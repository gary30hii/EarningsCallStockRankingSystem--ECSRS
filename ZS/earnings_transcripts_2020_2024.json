Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry : Thank you, Bill and thank you for joining us. I hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe. With ongoing pandemic, I would like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of our team and partners who are committed to our customer success. I'm pleased to report our strong results for the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year 2020 with exceptional growth in both, new customer and upsell business. In Q4, we delivered growth of 46% in revenue, and 55% in billings, reflecting the increased momentum in our business as our customers accelerate the digital transformation, despite the macroeconomic challenges. We offer customers a cloud native platform, which we call the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, securely connecting users to applications or applications to applications in a borderless and hyper connected digital world. In the new work from anywhere economy where applications are moving to the cloud and users are outside of corporate network, traditional network and network security have become irrelevant. We ensure that businesses can operate at any scale with users anywhere in the world on any device, independent of the network. We are helping our customers move from legacy network security to Zero Trust Security, which reduces business risk and makes businesses agile and competitive. As I reflect on the past 12 months, culminating in our strong Q4 performance, I view fiscal \u201820 as a pivotal year in which we made tremendous progress on a number of strategic fronts to position us well for long-term growth. Zscaler has never been stronger. And I believe we have an incredible opportunity in front of us. Let me highlight three pillars of our strategy: Our platform; our products; and our go-to-market. To start with our platform, Zscaler stands for Zenith of Scalability. True to our name, our platform continues to scale to new heights. Zscaler\u2019s Zero Trust Exchange is the largest in-line cloud security platform in the world. And we\u2019re processing more than 120 billion transactions and blocking more than a 100 million threats per day from users across 185 countries. This large data set feeds our machine learning and AI engines for superior threat protection, better detection of user and application traffic anomalies, and faster resolution of performance bottlenecks. All this happens on a platform that uses 70% renewable energy today with a goal to use over 90%. Deployed across more than 150 data centers, our Zero Trust Exchange platform was built from the ground up to fully deliver the promise of Gartner's Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE framework. Traditional network security vendors are trying to co-opt our vision of cloud security after rejecting it for years. They're trying to retrofit the legacy appliances into a cloud world. But just like you can\u2019t create Netflix by stacking thousands of DVD players in the cloud, you can't offer an in-line high-performance security cloud by spinning up a bunch of virtual firewalls in a public cloud. To put it simply, having the right cloud native architecture creates a significant barrier to entry for cloud imitators. Building a cloud native architecture with full security and minimal latency was a daunting challenge. And running a massive in-line distributed cloud with five-nines of availability is an order of magnitude more difficult. For large enterprises who want network and security and modernization, we believe, we are the only cloud native multi-tenant platform that meets their needs. We ended fiscal \u201820 with over 4,500 customers, including over 150 of the Fortune 500 and over 450 of the global 2,000 companies. We have over 100 customers that generate over $1 billion in ARR or annual recurring revenue. While the average NPS or net promoter score, of an average SaaS company is 30, Zscaler\u2019s NPS is 76, which is 2.5 times higher, a proof of the value that Zscaler delivers. Next on product innovation. This has been an exceptionally productive year for our engineering and product teams where through internal innovation and internal integration and highly targeted acquisitions we have significantly increased the number of products available on our platform, further expanding our already substantial technology lead. During the year, we expanded the number of solutions from 2 to 4. First, our flagship ZIA solution expanded with two new products, out-of-band CASB and Cloud Browser Isolation, which together with our in-line CASB, and advanced DLP, expanded our addressable market for data protection. Second, our ZPA solution, which doubles our market opportunity, has become the most mature zero trust solution with deep and wide functionality, including support for web and non-web applications. With deployment at a massive scale with over 150 global 2000 customers, ZPA has become the market leader for zero trust security. Third, with the Zscaler platform, uniquely sitting between the user and application, our Zscaler Digital Experience, or ZDX solution, computes a performance score, measuring the digital experience of every user and application, helping customers to pinpoint and resolve performance issues, further expanding our addressable market. Lastly, our next opportunity is to expand our Zero Trust Exchange to protect applications and data on public or private clouds. With our CSPM product, we can identify and remediate misconfigurations of cloud workloads, providing superior data protection. Our workload segmentation service implements zero trust architecture for app to app communication where apps maybe running on containers or virtual machines. This is a far superior approach for app segmentation without having to do network-based segmentation. What sets us apart from the many vendors who claim to have a platform is the following. Our platform is purpose built for the cloud. It is designed to be extensible to integrate with our targeted acquisitions, as well as with third-party products. Legacy network security vendors can create a cloud platform by cobbling together a bunch of acquired companies. History has shown that this approach does not work. Moving on to the third pillar, go-to-market. We further refined our metric driven, repeatable sales process, which is giving us deep visibility into our business, and a strong and growing pipeline. We invested heavily this year to build a sales machine that we believe can demonstrate our compelling value to enterprises, drive larger deals, and deliver consistent sales execution to take Zscaler beyond a $1 billion in annual revenue. Let me highlight a few of our go-to-market accomplishments. We significantly expanded our sales leadership by adding extra depth in our regional management. The build out of our sales leadership is largely complete. We had another record quarter filing and exceeded our year-end target of 60% year-over-year increase in quota carrying field reps. Even with a significant growth, our sales productivity was up for the year, exceeding our expectations. Since we launched our Summit Partner Program, we recruited additional cloud-focused channel partners to drive further sales leverage. We are pleased to see increasing wins and larger deal size with our Summit Partners. I'm extremely proud of our go-to-market team and how we executed our sales strategy this year. Now, let me provide some business highlights for the fourth quarter. Our ZIA business is accelerating due to our customers\u2019 focus on work from anywhere. When employees are allowed to directly access SaaS applications and the internet from their homes, security becomes a major risk and they need ZIA. We continue to see the increased adoption of our high-end transformation bundle, which includes cloud firewall and sandbox. At the end of fiscal '20, 49% of our ZIA annual recurring revenue is coming from the transformation bundle, compared to 43% last year. Let me share two ZIA deals in the quarter that show our accelerated momentum with the financial services customers. A new customer initially engaged us to secure SD-WAN for 120 offices. They shifted the focus from SD-WAN to securing 40,000 employees in their homes as a result of the pandemic. With sensitive financial data at risk, security was a major requirement, and only a proxy architecture was considered. This customer purchased the entire ZIA portfolio including CASB advanced DLP and CSPM for Microsoft Office 365. Our integrated CASB offering replaced a CASB Point Product that by itself required three on-site engineers and a seven-figure annual spent. Our superior security at a very attractive ROI resonated with both the CIO and the CFO. In a ZIA upsell, another financial services company that has been a customer since 2018, merged with a peer and more than doubled the purchase of business bundle plus DLP to protect all 70,000 employees. Like the prior example, this customer only considered a proxy architecture. They standardized on our platform and consolidated three vendors, streamlining their operations and reducing their costs. Our product integration with Microsoft and CrowdStrike was an important consideration. Next, I'd like to highlight ZPA. We continue to have strong adoption of ZPA, which is benefiting from work from anywhere and applications migrating to the cloud. ZPA is more than a VPN replacement. It is an architectural shift to zero trust access for private applications in a multi-cloud environment. ZPA contributed 29% of our new and upsell business in fiscal '20, compared to 14% in the prior year. In the quarter, we closed our largest deal for ZPA with a longtime customer. This global 100 conglomerate has already purchased the entire ZIA portfolio for all employees and with the COVID pandemic, accelerated the transformation journey by purchasing ZPA for 3,000 employees. With resounding success with ZIA and significant trust in Zscaler, they deployed ZPA globally in just a couple of weeks as the world battled the spread of COVID, while the immediate objective for this deal was to eliminate legacy VPN. ZPA was selected to implement zero trust security by establishing application level policy where you connect users to specific apps, not to a network. ZPA is providing secure access to over a 0.5 million unique applications another proof point lf its maturity and scalability. Next, one of the world's largest IT services company which headquarters in Asia, purchased ZPA for all 180,000 employees. This customer was using virtual firewalls and VPNs to protect the applications in the public cloud. They viewed each internet facing firewall or VPN as an attack surface that they wanted to eliminate. With the ZPA rollout, the customer reduced internet exposure for hundreds of applications down to a handful in less than four weeks, greatly reducing business risk. Legacy vendors tried to sell their cloud-based VPN, but failed to meet the requirement for zero attack surface. I'm delighted to share that more customers are buying ZIA and ZPA together, which enables true transformation, the direct access to any application over any network. For example, a global professional services company purchased our transformation bundle plus DLP for 50,000 users and ZPA for 20,000 users. The business involves handling sensitive customer information. Hence they needed inspection of all traffic, including SSL for comprehensive data protection. The incumbent firewall vendor tried to sell its cloud based offering, but was disqualified as they could not meet the SSL inspection and DLP requirements. Our zero trust approach will also help the customer to quickly integrate future M&A, a core growth strategy for this company. And lastly, in another new logo deal, a federal civilian agency purchased ZIA business bundle with cloud firewall plus DLP and ZPA for 21,000 users. When the pandemic started, the agency relied on legacy VPN technology, which could not scale and resulted in poor user experience. While the immediate use case was VPN replacement, this agency acquired ZIA and ZPA together to transform its network and security with our FedRAMP authorized cloud platform. This win was notably our largest federal deal to date, and they're building considerable momentum in the U.S. federal market. With the highest levels of FedRAMP certifications of both, the ZIA and ZPA which involves our a rigorous process, we are positioned very well in this large market and we are proud to help our government customers do their critical work in these trying times. Let me touch on a couple of new products that are starting to contribute to deal wins. Our out-of-band CASB has become very comprehensive, helping us displace CASB point parts and increase our deal size, as I indicated in the deal highlights. We're also starting to see early success with ZDX, including wins with a European consumer products company and a U.S.-based pharmaceutical company. While currently very small, we believe our new products create a significant growth opportunity. As we start the new fiscal year, we are in a fortunate position to be able to help our customers pursue digital transformation, their highest IT priority. With the mindset change and the openness to transformation, I've seen an increase in CIO level awareness and engagement with us. The inbound customer requests have greatly increased. And we're becoming a part of bigger transformation projects and a key partner to consolidate point products, remove complexity, and save costs. We are excited about our mission to make the cloud safe for business and enjoyable for users. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. As mentioned, we were pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. Revenue for the quarter was $125.9 million, up 14% sequentially and 46% year-over-year. ZPA revenue was 12% of total revenue in the quarter. From a geographic perspective, for the quarter, Americas represented 50% of revenue, EMEA was 40% and APJ was 10%. For the full year, revenue was $431.3 million, up 42% year-over-year. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 55% year-over-year to $194.9 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years. We primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, was $783 million on July 31st, up 41% from one year ago. The current RPO is 55% of the total RPO. ZPA was 29% of total new and upsell business in fiscal '20 compared to 14% in the prior year. We\u2019re seeing a higher tax rate of ZPA, both the number of deals and the number of seats per deal. We see a good mix of ZPA opportunities between new and existing customers. We have a large upsell opportunity as only 35% of our 450 global 2000 customers have purchased ZPA. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar based net retention rate, which is 120% for the quarter compared to 118% a year ago, and 119% last quarter. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger transformation bundles, selling both ZIA and the ZPA from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 120% is outstanding. Total gross margin was 78%, down 2 percentage points sequentially and 3 points year-over-year. The decline is primarily due to ZPA traffic growing over 10x since February. The augmented use of AWS and Azure to meet the surge in demand, which run at significantly higher costs compared to our data centers. The gross margin was better than our guidance of 76% to 77% as we made solid progress on migrating more of the ZPA traffic to our data centers during the quarter. As we mentioned previously, our combined gross margins of our core products,, ZIA and ZPA, are expected to return to 80% in the second half of fiscal 2021. However, most of our new emerging products, which include ZDX, workload segmentation, and CSPM will be running in the public cloud until we scale them into our own data centers in the future. While the public cloud, these products will have lower gross margins than our core products. As a result, we expect total corporate gross margins to be 78%, 79% in fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 14% sequentially and 46% year-over-year to $90.7 million, was flat year-over-year as a percentage of revenue at 72%. Operating expenses in Q4 includes approximately $2.9 million of expenses associated with the Cloudneeti and the Edgewise acquisitions. Sales and marketing increased 14% sequentially and 46% year-over-year to $59.7 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives, offset by lower T&E. We've been very successful in hiring and on-boarding remotely. We exceeded our goal of increasing our field rep headcount by 60% for the full year. R&D was up 19% sequentially, and up 54% year-over-year to $20.3 million. The increase was primarily due to continued investments in our team. G&A increased 8% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $10.7 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation related expenses and professional fees, including acquisition related expenses. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 6%, which compares to 9% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $7 million for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including net cash for approximately $1 billion raised for the June offering of convertible senior notes due in 2025. Free cash flow was positive $11 million in the quarter. Now, moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. As Bill indicated earlier, starting in fiscal 2021, we will also be excluding stock-based compensation related to payroll taxes from our non-GAAP results. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $131 to $133 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 40% to 42%; operating profit in the range of $8 million to $10 million; other income of $500,000 net interest payments on the senior convertible notes; income taxes of $1.25 million; and earnings per share of approximately $0.05 to $0.06, assuming 143 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal '21, we expect revenue in the range of $580 million to $590 million or year-over-year growth of 34% to 37%; calculated billings in the range of $710 million to $720 million a year-over-year growth of 29% to 31%. Over the last five years, first half billings have represented on average 43% to 44% of full year billings. We would expect a similar distribution in fiscal 2021. Operating profit in the range of $44 million to $46 million, other income of $2 million, income taxes of $5 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.28 to $0.30 assuming approximately 145 million common shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects the increased investments in our business, driven by two major developments, one, COVID-19 is accelerating digital transformation, which is the market Zscaler was created to serve. We feel we have momentum based on our performance, and we see the market coming to us. Our plans are to continue to invest aggressively in sales and marketing behind the growth in our business. Two, our pursuit of additional market opportunities with our new products that Jay reviewed earlier. As I've indicated, the acquisitions of Cloudneeti and Edgewise are expected to have a material impact on revenue in fiscal \u201921, while adding approximately $12 million to $14 million in operating expenses. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. Given our accelerated investments this year, we'd like to provide an update to our long-term financial model. We expect to achieve 20% to 22% operating margin for the full year in fiscal \u201824. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will take priority, considering our significant market opportunity. We are confident of reaching our target operating model within the next four years. Now, I'd like to hand the call back over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Remo. We believe we are in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to secure digital transformation, just like Salesforce and Workday, develop cloud native multi-tenant platforms to disrupt large legacy software vendors. Zscaler has a similar opportunity to disrupt network security. With multiples tailwinds, such as SaaS adoption, work from anywhere and app migration to public clouds, we believe the market is coming to us. The value proposition of our zero trust platform is resonating with customers. Our next big opportunity is to expand into securing app-to-app communication in the cloud, as well as monitoring end-to-end digital experience. As we demonstrated in recent quarters, we are delivering world class sales execution, and we believe we are positioned for long-term growth. We thank you for your interest in Zscaler and look forward to reporting our progress in the future. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi. Thanks. I'm wondering, if you could juxtapose suppose the guidance for billings next year, around 30% with the capacity growth you had in sales, which I think is about double that. Obviously, there's some puts and takes around productive reps and so forth. But, how should we think about those two things together? And you had productivity increase this year, I think you said in the script. Just wanted to make sure we're thinking about those together or any things that drives the disparity?\nRemo Canessa: Yes, fine. Walter, I think you've known me for a long time. Related to how we do guidance, we like to be prudent. Related to, as Jay mentioned on the call, we planned initially for fiscal '20 that our sales productivity will be down. And when you consider that we're able to increase our field quota sales reps by 60%, primarily in the second half, for us to be higher sales productivity in fiscal '20, I think speaks volumes related to the go-to-market and the team we have in the sales organization, as well as the market coming to us. As we go forward into fiscal '21, just some clarity, the key thing to remember is that we see the market coming to us. Everything points that basically the market is coming to us from pipeline growth, new customer meetings, new customer growth, and just the employees we\u2019re bringing on board, deal sizes, consolidation going on, all the things, everything we're looking at basically points to that growth. So, what we're doing basically is we're going to invest in the growth of the Company. From an operating profitability perspective, it is easy to get to a SaaS model\u2019s operating possibility quicker. All you got to do is slow things down, because of the contribution margin in years two and three. Jay and I said from the start, if we see this market coming to us, we're going to step on the gas. And we're seeing the market coming to us, we're stepping on the gas, and we're going to significantly increase our investments across the board and the Company, in particular, in sales and marketing -- continued sales and marketing, R&D, and also our cloud operations and delivery of our platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Jay, digital transformations are clearly accelerating post COVID. And I'm wondering, though, as you talk to executives, are a lot of them thinking that in fact security transformations have to happen first? In other words, is that a precursor to digital transformation? And is that -- what's also sort of leading to what I assume is record pipelines are exiting the year?\nJay Chaudhry: That's correct, Matt. Thank you. So, if you think of digital transformation, it has three pieces to it, everything starts with application transformation modernization, because people need to access applications, maybe business application collaborations alike. And since this new economy, you can be sitting on the network in your branch office or wherever, you end up working from anywhere and wherever, so you must be secure. So, security becomes an important enabler of this transformation journey. In fact, I would say that security comes first before any of the network transformation or SD-WAN comes in, because without proper cloud centric security, it can\u2019t be done. That's why we are seeing the acceleration in our business. That's why when people say, gee, after COVID, are things going to slow down? I say no, we are seeing actually acceleration in our business, not because of a onetime event, but because of accelerating trend. More and more CIOs, CEOs are talking to us. The other thing I would mention is, our business is not driven by just CSOs. Number one buyer of Zscaler -- or number one sponsor of Zscaler transformation is CIO and then CTO and CSO come along with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.\nAlex Henderson: Just one technical question and then one on technology side. Can you talk about whether you expect to continue to expand your sales capacity at a pace faster than sales in your '21 guidance? And then, second piece on the technology front. I\u2019m really fascinated by your commentary around the modern application protection, domain to domain, app to app environments. Can you talk a little bit about how you penetrate into the Kubernetes orchestration environments tie in to Jenkins and CI/CD processing? And does that put you in conflict with some of the CDN players, or are you more a partner with them? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: I'll take the first question, Alex. The answer is yes. We are increasing sales capacity significantly in fiscal '21. The sales capacity increase -- we took a bet last year about increasing sales capacity and it was the right bet. And basically, the increased sales capacity puts us in good position going into fiscal '21. Much of that sales capacity in fiscal '20 basically coming on the second half will have a positive impact in the second half of our fiscal '21. Related to going into fiscal '22, we're increasing -- we're trying to increase our sales capacity and trying to front end load that sales capacity increases. As we go forward, we will monitor how the business is going. But, as I mentioned before, all indicators are it's just very, very positive. The sales productivity, as I mentioned, that we exceeded our sales activity, go -- be above the prior year where we thought we'd be below. It just speaks to what we put in place. One of the key things, when our think about Zscaler, you think about a company that built a platform for today, in the future; you're talking about a market that basically we knew was there, but wasn't coming to us as fast as we thought it would. It's now coming to us, because of basically the external factors which are hitting the world. So, -- and there is a missing piece, basically just the go-to-market. We feel, we've got, if not the world's best sales machine, one of the world's best sales machines with the leadership that we have in our sales organizations and the investments that we\u2019ve made in that in fiscal '20 and will continue to make into fiscal '21. Having said that, basically the foundation is in place. That foundation in the go-to-market was filled in fiscal '20. Now, we're going to add to it, we'll monitor it. If we see things as we're open to, we\u2019ll continue to expand.\nJay Chaudhry: And Alex, this is Jay. Second part of your question is application protection and public cloud. We\u2019re seeing lots and lots of dynamic workloads being launched in public cloud; this security has to be done. Different vendors try to look at it different ways. Legacy vendors try to take a legacy approach to it. For example, firewall guys will say, let me try to create network segmentation. CDN guys are trying to say, gee, I\u2019m a CDN vendor, can I build WAN [ph] around it and the like. We come from the fact that in this new world, there's no such thing as traditional security. We are the exchange, we\u2019re switchboard. We connect the right user to right application. We\u2019re extending the same concept to say, we will securely connect right application to right application, right process to the right process. And that's using core of our ZPA technology combined with the acquisition we did of a company called Edgewise Networks. So, it's a nascent new market. It's a disruption opportunity. We think, we can do the same thing in a public cloud that we had done for ZIA and ZPA type of technologies.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Thank you very much, gentlemen, and congrats on the great quarter. I just want to ask more of a competition related question. Cisco acquired a company called ThousandEyes recently, and I -- which I believe is a technology aimed at providing more network visibility, similar to ZDX. So, I'm wondering if you're seeing any more competition from Cisco in the zero trust market. And then also, could you also provide any feedback on your win rates versus Palo Alto? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Let me start with this, your first question about network visibility vendors. It is true that the lots of vendors that are doing network monitoring. And the network they monitor was typically the wide area network, the private network. We don't do any of that. We believe that internet is that new network. So, we are not focused on network itself. We\u2019re focused on end-to-end monitoring and performance of a user from user to the application. The network is a piece of it, application is a piece of it, and end user device may be piece of it. It\u2019s -- even though network performance is in old the market, app performance is old market. A market we\u2019re going after is a relatively new market because of work from anywhere. That's number one. Number two, this one doesn't really have much to do with zero trust. This is about performance. Your question was, are we seeing zero trust competition from other larger vendors? Zero trust can be done by cobbling things on top of network security. If you're doing network security, don\u2019t do zero trust, because zero trust means not securing the network. Because assuming that you basically -- you can't be trusted to be on the network. So, that's the second part. The third part is, I think you mentioned competition form of firewall company, I think. Yes. So, we think -- look, if you think about zero trust, we say we securely connect an entity to another entity or use it to an application without putting them on the network. Network is merely transport for us. All network security companies, including firewalls, they\u2019re trying to secure the network. Our architecture is totally opposite to other architecture. So, whilst we see them on some of the lower accounts, when it comes to large enterprises, they are very savvy. They understand zero trust, they understand security, they understand proxy architecture. And as I highlighted in a few of my -- in my prepared remarks and some of the customer wins, firewalls are generally ruled out at the upfront, even if they\u2019re trying to go in there because proxy architecture becomes a requirement to do proper security, including SSL inspection.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Congratulations guys, a real, real strong finish to unbelievable year. And it's great to see. Remo, I wanted to drill in on the update that you provided on the long-term model. So, you told us, now you've put a timeline to when you'd be at 20% to 22% operating margins four years out. And if I'm not mistaken, I recall that around the time of the IPO, you had thought that the Company would be at $800 million to $1 billion in revenue at the time that you would hit that goal. And I just want to go back and think about, if I try to, back of the envelope, model out to \u201824, and we assume natural deceleration over time, is it fair that at that point, you would be growing the business maybe somewhere in the in the high teens or low 20s? Do you think about it that way? And as well, how should we think about the slope of that margin expansion over time on the way to the 20% to 22%?\nRemo Canessa: Brad, a lot of great questions. And in that you got several questions. The key thing is that the world changed, the world changed from the time we went public. And what's happened, basically, we're seeing an acceleration in our business, as I talked about before. The two things that we're seeing the acceleration, one is very apparent, which is basically COVID-19. I mean, it's basically accelerating transformation. It is the markets that we're built for. So, that's one thing that's going on. The second thing, basically, with our emerging products, we have a significant additional TAM in our user experience product and also workload segmentation. And what we've decided is that to refine the 20% to 22% profit target, and we're saying for the full year, fiscal '24 versus the dollar amount, which we provided before. What we've also said basically is that -- and you know the model, I mean, you know the SaaS model. We can slow this thing down and get there like next year if we want to. Is that the right thing to do for the shareholders with this market opportunity that we have? It is absolutely not. So therefore, -- and Jay and I have had long discussions about this. Jay and I, we met four years ago, there\u2019s not much that\u2019s changed. We basically are on the same page. I took this job to build a great company. I took this job because my respect for Jay, and because we're on the same page. We're trying to build a very meaningful and significant company and we feel we have that opportunity, more so now than before, because of the changes in the world. We will put growth ahead of profitability, but we're putting -- the end zones, basically the goalpost is where we're at right now for our projections for fiscal '21 and where we're going to be for the full year fiscal '24. What growth rates? I can't tell you. How are things going to play out? I can't tell you. What I can tell you is we can get there. We can get there no matter how this market goes. With the product platform that we have, that we started out with the ZIA, then we expanded to ZPA. And you take a look at the growth in ZPA that we've had, it's been pretty significant. Now, you're adding ZDX, the user experience, which we think has significant market, as I\u2019ve mentioned. You're putting on board the foreclosed [ph] segmentation. And then, you have the ability to bring other products like CASB, out-of-band, the browser isolation, B2B, CSPM. We have the ability to deliver these products because we\u2019ve built the platform in order to deliver these products. So, am I confident we're going to get to our operating profitability for years? I am. What is the growth going to be? I cannot tell you. But I can tell you that I'm very -- based on what we're seeing, based on the market potential, based on the team that we have in place, I feel very good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: I wanted to ask a little bit about growth drivers. And just to pick on what you -- pick up on what you just mentioned is you talk about the world's change. And it would seem to be that in a COVID economy, the solution ZPA is getting a much more welcome reception. So, speaking of it, it seems like it's been a catalyst to growth. And you mentioned that only 35% of your installed base is purchase. When you think about the guidance you gave for '21, how are you thinking about the growth of ZPA within that context? And really, what I'm asking is, any color you could give us on the distribution. But, isn't that ZPA now being a help in terms of opening up new accounts, as well as just selling into the installed base of ZIA, so to speak. But, if you just give us a little color on how we should be thinking about the growth rate in '21? And is it in fact opening new doors for you as a standalone? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: I'll take a crack, then, let Jay talk. Yes, the answer is yes. I mean, ZPA was at 43% of our business, total new and upsell business in Q3. ZPA for the year is 29%, it was around 28%, 29% for Q4. If I look at the dollar amount of ZPA in Q3, Q4, it's pretty comparable. The question that came up on the last call is what's going on with ZIA? I mean, ZIA is going to fall off the cliff? Well, it had -- it was a record quarter. It was a record quarter for ZIA in Q4. Question came up last call was, more of your existing customers were buying basically. And that's ZPA driven by COVID. And percentages were I think, 60% upsell, 40% new. We said that our pipeline indicated that we would be closer to our historical rates of 50% new or 60% new. We're pretty much 50-50. Pipeline that we have going forward related to ZIA and ZPA, I think, it depends on close rates, but it's healthy. It is showing that ZPA has a lot of traction to build. The key thing though, when you take a look at the contribution of ZIA and ZPA, what I want to draw your attention to is that Zscaler is a platform. That platform as we talked about, ZDX and workload segmentation, and the other products that I've talked about. As we go forward, customers have a need related to securing their networks for the 21st century. Zscaler was built for the 21st century. Zscaler is right in the center of what these companies need. We need to go out there and tell companies what we have, so they understand that their lives can be a lot better. So, when you think about us going forward, think about Zscaler as a platform play, the ability to add additional applications relatively quickly, to really service our customers, to properly secure them, both in the workload environment, as well as going -- in a user environment.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. That\u2019s great, Remo. I would say, many times people think of COVID means ZPA. No, work from anywhere means ZIA and ZPA, both combined, and there is big potential for both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Bartus of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Bartus: I wanted to ask about new products and specifically ZDX and ZB2B. So, first, Jay, can you just talk about customer interest at this time, maybe compared to the early years through ZPA? And then, Remo, just curious what you have baked into your fiscal \u201821 assumptions for these products or new products in general? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So, let me start with the two new products you talked about, ZDX, which is digital experience. When your CEO lands in Sydney, connects to Office 365, things slow, there's not a single product in the market that helps IT figure out where the issues are. That's a big hole we are filling. So, there's a pretty high demand for ZDX. And we just got the product out last quarter. We\u2019re seeing a good pipeline, lots of interest and we\u2019re evolving the product pretty rapidly. B2B is actually a little bit interesting angle, big, sizable opportunity but different kind of products, a little bit different buyers. It's the Chief Digital Officer who is building new B2B application. They are interested in it. So, we've seen a lot of interest, but we see a lot more evangelism needed on the B2B side than on the ZDX side. But good going pipeline in both areas, good interest, shorter sales cycle on ZDX; longer sales cycle on B2B. But both help us because of part of a proper platform. All these things aren\u2019t [bought piece] at a time. They become extension to the platform our customer has bought. Because customers are trying to buy best of breed platform and best of breed products.\nRemo Canessa: On the financial side, the revenue is basically immaterial because we're ratable. And for the new business, new ACD, I would say the mid-single-digit type range for all the products combined, similar type trajectory that we had for ZPA, where we went from like 4% and then upto 10%, more in that single digit type range is probably best by backed into plan. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBrian Essex: Jay, I had a question for you, maybe to pivot off of Keith\u2019s question. It seemed as though, last quarter, there was a lot of I don't want to call it panic buying, but a lot of enterprise purchases that maybe they didn't have enough time to assess a new enterprise architecture. And it sounds like you have more -- and I think that naturally led to higher ZPA attach rate. It sounds like growth is more balanced now. Could you maybe talk about strategically what you're seeing with customers? Are they -- do they now have time to reassess their network architecture and are those leading to larger deals and more new customers added onto the platform? Maybe you can just give us a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing that will be real helpful.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Two points you mentioned there. One is, re-assessment to do the right architecture. Two is, are their decisions driven by some of the cost complexity driven? The answer is yes to both of those things. It is very true that a lot of people who actually both familiar and exposed to Zscaler and in fact, some of them are already testing it, they've launched ZPA pretty quickly because they knew us already. We also saw a number of ZIA, ZPA combined deals in Q3. The acceleration of combined ZIA and ZPA deals together has a further increase. So, we realize that. But also what we're finding is a number of customers we're talking to now or I would say prospects we're talking now are saying yes, we bought a bunch of VPNs or whatever or VDIs for a short-term need to be met. But we know we want to go to zero trust, we need this digital transformation. So, evaluation of Zscaler ZIA and ZPAs are driven by some of those needs, not for the short term, but for architectural transformation. The second big trend we're seeing is that because of macroeconomic pressures, every CIO and more and more CFOs are trying to figure out how to do cost consolidation and simplification. So, now, they're beginning to buy more and more bigger platform bundles than smaller bundles. That has led to an increase of transformation bundle on the ZIA side, but also combination of ZIA and ZPA together on other side. So, we've benefiting from consolidation, simplification, reduction of complexity as well. We think it's a good trend that market needs to do for making the business more agile and more competitive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Colville with Deutsche Bank.\nPatrick Colville: Can I just talk about the sales hiring? In 2020, that was probably one of the biggest things we saw, you guys increase in sales headcount by net 60% in hindsight, very astute decision. Can we just think about, in 2021, if you can go through the metrics around, I guess, the headcount hiring would be great. And then, that\u2019s be awesome, just to how we should think about the momentum there, and I guess how you see that trending?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. We're not going to give as much color as we did last time. What I can say though, to give you some perspective, we do expect to increase the number of heads that we increased fiscal '20 in our field sales organization, substantially. So, we are -- as I mentioned, we see the market coming to us. We're going to do what we feel are the right things for the business. We're going to aggressively hire. That aggressive hiring is already started. And that aggressive hiring we're finding is that basically I think there's an increased awareness related to the value proposition that Zscaler has. And I think that we are attracting some very high-quality people. But, the total amount, the numeric amount will be substantially higher in fiscal '21 than fiscal '22 -- fiscal \u201820 that we hired.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ruykhaver with Baird.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Jay, I'm wondered if you could provide some more color on the initiatives that have been put into place with the new Summit Partner Program. Specifically, just what kind of reception are you seeing, and has there been any impact yet to channel sales velocity?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, very good question. I briefly mentioned in my prepared remarks, but Summit Partner was put in place to identify cloud focused or cloud borne partners, who could help customers with translation. So, it\u2019s actually very well aligned with how our sales are done. So, we are seeing increased number of deal registrations, we\u2019re also seeing the deal size growing, because of the way the transmission sale is happening. And we think -- we expect to get more and more leverage in fiscal '21 from these partners. So, I would say, very bullish on the progress we've made and expecting even better results in this fiscal year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: All right. Well, thank you all for joining us. We look forward to seeing you at one of the sales side conferences that we\u2019ll be attending. Thank you again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As mentioned, we were pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2020. Revenue for the quarter was $125.9 million, up 14% sequentially and 46% year-over-year. ZPA revenue was 12% of total revenue in the quarter. From a geographic perspective, for the quarter, Americas represented 50% of revenue, EMEA was 40% and APJ was 10%. For the full year, revenue was $431.3 million, up 42% year-over-year. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 55% year-over-year to $194.9 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years. We primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, was $783 million on July 31st, up 41% from one year ago. The current RPO is 55% of the total RPO. ZPA was 29% of total new and upsell business in fiscal '20 compared to 14% in the prior year. We're seeing a higher tax rate of ZPA, both the number of deals and the number of seats per deal. We see a good mix of ZPA opportunities between new and existing customers. We have a large upsell opportunity as only 35% of our 450 global 2000 customers have purchased ZPA. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar based net retention rate, which is 120% for the quarter compared to 118% a year ago, and 119% last quarter. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger transformation bundles, selling both ZIA and the ZPA from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 120% is outstanding. Total gross margin was 78%, down 2 percentage points sequentially and 3 points year-over-year. The decline is primarily due to ZPA traffic growing over 10x since February. The augmented use of AWS and Azure to meet the surge in demand, which run at significantly higher costs compared to our data centers. The gross margin was better than our guidance of 76% to 77% as we made solid progress on migrating more of the ZPA traffic to our data centers during the quarter. As we mentioned previously, our combined gross margins of our core products,, ZIA and ZPA, are expected to return to 80% in the second half of fiscal 2021. However, most of our new emerging products, which include ZDX, workload segmentation, and CSPM will be running in the public cloud until we scale them into our own data centers in the future. While the public cloud, these products will have lower gross margins than our core products. As a result, we expect total corporate gross margins to be 78%, 79% in fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 14% sequentially and 46% year-over-year to $90.7 million, was flat year-over-year as a percentage of revenue at 72%. Operating expenses in Q4 includes approximately $2.9 million of expenses associated with the Cloudneeti and the Edgewise acquisitions. Sales and marketing increased 14% sequentially and 46% year-over-year to $59.7 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives, offset by lower T&E. We've been very successful in hiring and on-boarding remotely. We exceeded our goal of increasing our field rep headcount by 60% for the full year. R&D was up 19% sequentially, and up 54% year-over-year to $20.3 million. The increase was primarily due to continued investments in our team. G&A increased 8% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $10.7 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation related expenses and professional fees, including acquisition related expenses. Our fourth quarter operating margin was 6%, which compares to 9% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $7 million for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including net cash for approximately $1 billion raised for the June offering of convertible senior notes due in 2025. Free cash flow was positive $11 million in the quarter. Now, moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. As Bill indicated earlier, starting in fiscal 2021, we will also be excluding stock-based compensation related to payroll taxes from our non-GAAP results. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $131 to $133 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 40% to 42%; operating profit in the range of $8 million to $10 million; other income of $500,000 net interest payments on the senior convertible notes; income taxes of $1.25 million; and earnings per share of approximately $0.05 to $0.06, assuming 143 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal '21, we expect revenue in the range of $580 million to $590 million or year-over-year growth of 34% to 37%; calculated billings in the range of $710 million to $720 million a year-over-year growth of 29% to 31%. Over the last five years, first half billings have represented on average 43% to 44% of full year billings. We would expect a similar distribution in fiscal 2021. Operating profit in the range of $44 million to $46 million, other income of $2 million, income taxes of $5 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.28 to $0.30 assuming approximately 145 million common shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects the increased investments in our business, driven by two major developments, one, COVID-19 is accelerating digital transformation, which is the market Zscaler was created to serve. We feel we have momentum based on our performance, and we see the market coming to us. Our plans are to continue to invest aggressively in sales and marketing behind the growth in our business. Two, our pursuit of additional market opportunities with our new products that Jay reviewed earlier. As I've indicated, the acquisitions of Cloudneeti and Edgewise are expected to have a material impact on revenue in fiscal '21, while adding approximately $12 million to $14 million in operating expenses. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. Given our accelerated investments this year, we'd like to provide an update to our long-term financial model. We expect to achieve 20% to 22% operating margin for the full year in fiscal \u201824. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will take priority, considering our significant market opportunity. We are confident of reaching our target operating model within the next four years. Now, I'd like to hand the call back over to Jay. Yes, fine. Walter, I think you've known me for a long time. Related to how we do guidance, we like to be prudent. Related to, as Jay mentioned on the call, we planned initially for fiscal '20 that our sales productivity will be down. And when you consider that we're able to increase our field quota sales reps by 60%, primarily in the second half, for us to be higher sales productivity in fiscal '20, I think speaks volumes related to the go-to-market and the team we have in the sales organization, as well as the market coming to us. As we go forward into fiscal '21, just some clarity, the key thing to remember is that we see the market coming to us. Everything points that basically the market is coming to us from pipeline growth, new customer meetings, new customer growth, and just the employees we're bringing on board, deal sizes, consolidation going on, all the things, everything we're looking at basically points to that growth. So, what we're doing basically is we're going to invest in the growth of the Company. From an operating profitability perspective, it is easy to get to a SaaS model's operating possibility quicker. All you got to do is slow things down, because of the contribution margin in years two and three. Jay and I said from the start, if we see this market coming to us, we're going to step on the gas. And we're seeing the market coming to us, we're stepping on the gas, and we're going to significantly increase our investments across the board and the Company, in particular, in sales and marketing -- continued sales and marketing, R&D, and also our cloud operations and delivery of our platform. I'll take the first question, Alex. The answer is yes. We are increasing sales capacity significantly in fiscal '21. The sales capacity increase -- we took a bet last year about increasing sales capacity and it was the right bet. And basically, the increased sales capacity puts us in good position going into fiscal '21. Much of that sales capacity in fiscal '20 basically coming on the second half will have a positive impact in the second half of our fiscal '21. Related to going into fiscal '22, we're increasing -- we're trying to increase our sales capacity and trying to front end load that sales capacity increases. As we go forward, we will monitor how the business is going. But, as I mentioned before, all indicators are it's just very, very positive. The sales productivity, as I mentioned, that we exceeded our sales activity, go -- be above the prior year where we thought we'd be below. It just speaks to what we put in place. One of the key things, when our think about Zscaler, you think about a company that built a platform for today, in the future; you're talking about a market that basically we knew was there, but wasn't coming to us as fast as we thought it would. It's now coming to us, because of basically the external factors which are hitting the world. So, -- and there is a missing piece, basically just the go-to-market. We feel, we've got, if not the world's best sales machine, one of the world's best sales machines with the leadership that we have in our sales organizations and the investments that we've made in that in fiscal '20 and will continue to make into fiscal '21. Having said that, basically the foundation is in place. That foundation in the go-to-market was filled in fiscal '20. Now, we're going to add to it, we'll monitor it. If we see things as we're open to, we'll continue to expand. Brad, a lot of great questions. And in that you got several questions. The key thing is that the world changed, the world changed from the time we went public. And what's happened, basically, we're seeing an acceleration in our business, as I talked about before. The two things that we're seeing the acceleration, one is very apparent, which is basically COVID-19. I mean, it's basically accelerating transformation. It is the markets that we're built for. So, that's one thing that's going on. The second thing, basically, with our emerging products, we have a significant additional TAM in our user experience product and also workload segmentation. And what we've decided is that to refine the 20% to 22% profit target, and we're saying for the full year, fiscal '24 versus the dollar amount, which we provided before. What we've also said basically is that -- and you know the model, I mean, you know the SaaS model. We can slow this thing down and get there like next year if we want to. Is that the right thing to do for the shareholders with this market opportunity that we have? It is absolutely not. So therefore, -- and Jay and I have had long discussions about this. Jay and I, we met four years ago, there's not much that's changed. We basically are on the same page. I took this job to build a great company. I took this job because my respect for Jay, and because we're on the same page. We're trying to build a very meaningful and significant company and we feel we have that opportunity, more so now than before, because of the changes in the world. We will put growth ahead of profitability, but we're putting -- the end zones, basically the goalpost is where we're at right now for our projections for fiscal '21 and where we're going to be for the full year fiscal '24.

Yes, the answer is yes. I mean, ZPA was at 43% of our business, total new and upsell business in Q3. ZPA for the year is 29%, it was around 28%, 29% for Q4. If I look at the dollar amount of ZPA in Q3, Q4, it's pretty comparable. The question that came up on the last call is what's going on with ZIA? I mean, ZIA is going to fall off the cliff?

So, we are -- as I mentioned, we see the market coming to us. We're going to do what we feel are the right things for the business. We're going to aggressively hire. That aggressive hiring is already started. And that aggressive hiring we're finding is that basically I think there's an increased awareness related to the value proposition that Zscaler has. And I think that we are attracting some very high-quality people. But, the total amount, the numeric amount will be substantially higher in fiscal '21 than fiscal '22 -- fiscal \u201820 that we hired."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill and thank you for joining us. I hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe. With ongoing pandemic, I would like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of our team and partners who are committed to our customer success. I'm pleased to report our strong results for the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year 2020 with exceptional growth in both, new customer and upsell business. In Q4, we delivered growth of 46% in revenue, and 55% in billings, reflecting the increased momentum in our business as our customers accelerate the digital transformation, despite the macroeconomic challenges. We offer customers a cloud native platform, which we call the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, securely connecting users to applications or applications to applications in a borderless and hyper connected digital world. In the new work from anywhere economy where applications are moving to the cloud and users are outside of corporate network, traditional network and network security have become irrelevant. We ensure that businesses can operate at any scale with users anywhere in the world on any device, independent of the network. We are helping our customers move from legacy network security to Zero Trust Security, which reduces business risk and makes businesses agile and competitive. As I reflect on the past 12 months, culminating in our strong Q4 performance, I view fiscal \u201820 as a pivotal year in which we made tremendous progress on a number of strategic fronts to position us well for long-term growth. Zscaler has never been stronger. And I believe we have an incredible opportunity in front of us. Let me highlight three pillars of our strategy: Our platform; our products; and our go-to-market. To start with our platform, Zscaler stands for Zenith of Scalability. True to our name, our platform continues to scale to new heights. Zscaler's Zero Trust Exchange is the largest in-line cloud security platform in the world. And we're processing more than 120 billion transactions and blocking more than a 100 million threats per day from users across 185 countries. This large data set feeds our machine learning and AI engines for superior threat protection, better detection of user and application traffic anomalies, and faster resolution of performance bottlenecks. All this happens on a platform that uses 70% renewable energy today with a goal to use over 90%. Deployed across more than 150 data centers, our Zero Trust Exchange platform was built from the ground up to fully deliver the promise of Gartner's Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE framework. Traditional network security vendors are trying to co-opt our vision of cloud security after rejecting it for years. They're trying to retrofit the legacy appliances into a cloud world. But just like you can't create Netflix by stacking thousands of DVD players in the cloud, you can't offer an in-line high-performance security cloud by spinning up a bunch of virtual firewalls in a public cloud. To put it simply, having the right cloud native architecture creates a significant barrier to entry for cloud imitators. Building a cloud native architecture with full security and minimal latency was a daunting challenge. And running a massive in-line distributed cloud with five-nines of availability is an order of magnitude more difficult. For large enterprises who want network and security and modernization, we believe, we are the only cloud native multi-tenant platform that meets their needs. We ended fiscal \u201820 with over 4,500 customers, including over 150 of the Fortune 500 and over 450 of the global 2,000 companies. We have over 100 customers that generate over $1 billion in ARR or annual recurring revenue. While the average NPS or net promoter score, of an average SaaS company is 30, Zscaler's NPS is 76, which is 2.5 times higher, a proof of the value that Zscaler delivers. Next on product innovation. This has been an exceptionally productive year for our engineering and product teams where through internal innovation and internal integration and highly targeted acquisitions we have significantly increased the number of products available on our platform, further expanding our already substantial technology lead. During the year, we expanded the number of solutions from 2 to 4. First, our flagship ZIA solution expanded with two new products, out-of-band CASB and Cloud Browser Isolation, which together with our in-line CASB, and advanced DLP, expanded our addressable market for data protection. Second, our ZPA solution, which doubles our market opportunity, has become the most mature zero trust solution with deep and wide functionality, including support for web and non-web applications. With deployment at a massive scale with over 150 global 2000 customers, ZPA has become the market leader for zero trust security. Third, with the Zscaler platform, uniquely sitting between the user and application, our Zscaler Digital Experience, or ZDX solution, computes a performance score, measuring the digital experience of every user and application, helping customers to pinpoint and resolve performance issues, further expanding our addressable market. Lastly, our next opportunity is to expand our Zero Trust Exchange to protect applications and data on public or private clouds. With our CSPM product, we can identify and remediate misconfigurations of cloud workloads, providing superior data protection. Our workload segmentation service implements zero trust architecture for app to app communication where apps maybe running on containers or virtual machines. This is a far superior approach for app segmentation without having to do network-based segmentation. What sets us apart from the many vendors who claim to have a platform is the following. Our platform is purpose built for the cloud. It is designed to be extensible to integrate with our targeted acquisitions, as well as with third-party products. Legacy network security vendors can create a cloud platform by cobbling together a bunch of acquired companies. History has shown that this approach does not work. Moving on to the third pillar, go-to-market. We further refined our metric driven, repeatable sales process, which is giving us deep visibility into our business, and a strong and growing pipeline. We invested heavily this year to build a sales machine that we believe can demonstrate our compelling value to enterprises, drive larger deals, and deliver consistent sales execution to take Zscaler beyond a $1 billion in annual revenue. Let me highlight a few of our go-to-market accomplishments. We significantly expanded our sales leadership by adding extra depth in our regional management. The build out of our sales leadership is largely complete. We had another record quarter filing and exceeded our year-end target of 60% year-over-year increase in quota carrying field reps. Even with a significant growth, our sales productivity was up for the year, exceeding our expectations. Since we launched our Summit Partner Program, we recruited additional cloud-focused channel partners to drive further sales leverage. We are pleased to see increasing wins and larger deal size with our Summit Partners. I'm extremely proud of our go-to-market team and how we executed our sales strategy this year. Now, let me provide some business highlights for the fourth quarter. Our ZIA business is accelerating due to our customers' focus on work from anywhere. When employees are allowed to directly access SaaS applications and the internet from their homes, security becomes a major risk and they need ZIA. We continue to see the increased adoption of our high-end transformation bundle, which includes cloud firewall and sandbox. At the end of fiscal '20, 49% of our ZIA annual recurring revenue is coming from the transformation bundle, compared to 43% last year. Let me share two ZIA deals in the quarter that show our accelerated momentum with the financial services customers. A new customer initially engaged us to secure SD-WAN for 120 offices. They shifted the focus from SD-WAN to securing 40,000 employees in their homes as a result of the pandemic. With sensitive financial data at risk, security was a major requirement, and only a proxy architecture was considered. This customer purchased the entire ZIA portfolio including CASB advanced DLP and CSPM for Microsoft Office 365. Our integrated CASB offering replaced a CASB Point Product that by itself required three on-site engineers and a seven-figure annual spent. Our superior security at a very attractive ROI resonated with both the CIO and the CFO. In a ZIA upsell, another financial services company that has been a customer since 2018, merged with a peer and more than doubled the purchase of business bundle plus DLP to protect all 70,000 employees. Like the prior example, this customer only considered a proxy architecture. They standardized on our platform and consolidated three vendors, streamlining their operations and reducing their costs. Our product integration with Microsoft and CrowdStrike was an important consideration. Next, I'd like to highlight ZPA. We continue to have strong adoption of ZPA, which is benefiting from work from anywhere and applications migrating to the cloud. ZPA is more than a VPN replacement. It is an architectural shift to zero trust access for private applications in a multi-cloud environment. ZPA contributed 29% of our new and upsell business in fiscal '20, compared to 14% in the prior year. In the quarter, we closed our largest deal for ZPA with a longtime customer. This global 100 conglomerate has already purchased the entire ZIA portfolio for all employees and with the COVID pandemic, accelerated the transformation journey by purchasing ZPA for 3,000 employees. With resounding success with ZIA and significant trust in Zscaler, they deployed ZPA globally in just a couple of weeks as the world battled the spread of COVID, while the immediate objective for this deal was to eliminate legacy VPN. ZPA was selected to implement zero trust security by establishing application level policy where you connect users to specific apps, not to a network. ZPA is providing secure access to over a 0.5 million unique applications another proof point lf its maturity and scalability. Next, one of the world's largest IT services company which headquarters in Asia, purchased ZPA for all 180,000 employees. This customer was using virtual firewalls and VPNs to protect the applications in the public cloud. They viewed each internet facing firewall or VPN as an attack surface that they wanted to eliminate. With the ZPA rollout, the customer reduced internet exposure for hundreds of applications down to a handful in less than four weeks, greatly reducing business risk. Legacy vendors tried to sell their cloud-based VPN, but failed to meet the requirement for zero attack surface. I'm delighted to share that more customers are buying ZIA and ZPA together, which enables true transformation, the direct access to any application over any network. For example, a global professional services company purchased our transformation bundle plus DLP for 50,000 users and ZPA for 20,000 users. The business involves handling sensitive customer information. Hence they needed inspection of all traffic, including SSL for comprehensive data protection. The incumbent firewall vendor tried to sell its cloud based offering, but was disqualified as they could not meet the SSL inspection and DLP requirements. Our zero trust approach will also help the customer to quickly integrate future M&A, a core growth strategy for this company. And lastly, in another new logo deal, a federal civilian agency purchased ZIA business bundle with cloud firewall plus DLP and ZPA for 21,000 users. When the pandemic started, the agency relied on legacy VPN technology, which could not scale and resulted in poor user experience. While the immediate use case was VPN replacement, this agency acquired ZIA and ZPA together to transform its network and security with our FedRAMP authorized cloud platform. This win was notably our largest federal deal to date, and they're building considerable momentum in the U.S. federal market. With the highest levels of FedRAMP certifications of both, the ZIA and ZPA which involves our a rigorous process, we are positioned very well in this large market and we are proud to help our government customers do their critical work in these trying times. Let me touch on a couple of new products that are starting to contribute to deal wins. Our out-of-band CASB has become very comprehensive, helping us displace CASB point parts and increase our deal size, as I indicated in the deal highlights. We're also starting to see early success with ZDX, including wins with a European consumer products company and a U.S.-based pharmaceutical company. While currently very small, we believe our new products create a significant growth opportunity. As we start the new fiscal year, we are in a fortunate position to be able to help our customers pursue digital transformation, their highest IT priority. With the mindset change and the openness to transformation, I've seen an increase in CIO level awareness and engagement with us. The inbound customer requests have greatly increased. And we're becoming a part of bigger transformation projects and a key partner to consolidate point products, remove complexity, and save costs. We are excited about our mission to make the cloud safe for business and enjoyable for users. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you, Remo. We believe we are in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to secure digital transformation, just like Salesforce and Workday, develop cloud native multi-tenant platforms to disrupt large legacy software vendors. Zscaler has a similar opportunity to disrupt network security. With multiples tailwinds, such as SaaS adoption, work from anywhere and app migration to public clouds, we believe the market is coming to us. The value proposition of our zero trust platform is resonating with customers. Our next big opportunity is to expand into securing app-to-app communication in the cloud, as well as monitoring end-to-end digital experience. As we demonstrated in recent quarters, we are delivering world class sales execution, and we believe we are positioned for long-term growth. We thank you for your interest in Zscaler and look forward to reporting our progress in the future. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. That's correct, Matt. Thank you. So, if you think of digital transformation, it has three pieces to it, everything starts with application transformation modernization, because people need to access applications, maybe business application collaborations alike. And since this new economy, you can be sitting on the network in your branch office or wherever, you end up working from anywhere and wherever, so you must be secure. So, security becomes an important enabler of this transformation journey. In fact, I would say that security comes first before any of the network transformation or SD-WAN comes in, because without proper cloud centric security, it can't be done. That's why we are seeing the acceleration in our business. That's why when people say, gee, after COVID, are things going to slow down? I say no, we are seeing actually acceleration in our business, not because of a onetime event, but because of accelerating trend. More and more CIOs, CEOs are talking to us. The other thing I would mention is, our business is not driven by just CSOs. Number one buyer of Zscaler -- or number one sponsor of Zscaler transformation is CIO and then CTO and CSO come along with that. And Alex, this is Jay. Second part of your question is application protection and public cloud. We're seeing lots and lots of dynamic workloads being launched in public cloud; this security has to be done. Different vendors try to look at it different ways. Legacy vendors try to take a legacy approach to it. For example, firewall guys will say, let me try to create network segmentation. CDN guys are trying to say, gee, I'm a CDN vendor, can I build WAN [ph] around it and the like. We come from the fact that in this new world, there's no such thing as traditional security. We are the exchange, we're switchboard. We connect the right user to right application. We're extending the same concept to say, we will securely connect right application to right application, right process to the right process. And that's using core of our ZPA technology combined with the acquisition we did of a company called Edgewise Networks. So, it's a nascent new market. It's a disruption opportunity. We think, we can do the same thing in a public cloud that we had done for ZIA and ZPA type of technologies. Yes. Let me start with this, your first question about network visibility vendors. It is true that the lots of vendors that are doing network monitoring. And the network they monitor was typically the wide area network, the private network. We don't do any of that. We believe that internet is that new network. So, we are not focused on network itself. We're focused on end-to-end monitoring and performance of a user from user to the application. The network is a piece of it, application is a piece of it, and end user device may be piece of it. It's -- even though network performance is in old the market, app performance is old market. A market we're going after is a relatively new market because of work from anywhere. That's number one. Number two, this one doesn't really have much to do with zero trust. This is about performance. Your question was, are we seeing zero trust competition from other larger vendors? Zero trust can be done by cobbling things on top of network security. If you're doing network security, don't do zero trust, because zero trust means not securing the network. Because assuming that you basically -- you can't be trusted to be on the network. So, that's the second part. The third part is, I think you mentioned competition form of firewall company, I think. Yes. So, we think -- look, if you think about zero trust, we say we securely connect an entity to another entity or use it to an application without putting them on the network. Network is merely transport for us. All network security companies, including firewalls, they're trying to secure the network. Our architecture is totally opposite to other architecture. So, whilst we see them on some of the lower accounts, when it comes to large enterprises, they are very savvy. They understand zero trust, they understand security, they understand proxy architecture. And as I highlighted in a few of my -- in my prepared remarks and some of the customer wins, firewalls are generally ruled out at the upfront, even if they're trying to go in there because proxy architecture becomes a requirement to do proper security, including SSL inspection. Yes. That's great, Remo. I would say, many times people think of COVID means ZPA. No, work from anywhere means ZIA and ZPA, both combined, and there is big potential for both. Yes. So, let me start with the two new products you talked about, ZDX, which is digital experience. When your CEO lands in Sydney, connects to Office 365, things slow, there's not a single product in the market that helps IT figure out where the issues are. That's a big hole we are filling. So, there's a pretty high demand for ZDX. And we just got the product out last quarter. We're seeing a good pipeline, lots of interest and we're evolving the product pretty rapidly. B2B is actually a little bit interesting angle, big, sizable opportunity but different kind of products, a little bit different buyers. It's the Chief Digital Officer who is building new B2B application. They are interested in it. So, we've seen a lot of interest, but we see a lot more evangelism needed on the B2B side than on the ZDX side. But good going pipeline in both areas, good interest, shorter sales cycle on ZDX; longer sales cycle on B2B. But both help us because of part of a proper platform. All these things aren't [bought piece] at a time. They become extension to the platform our customer has bought. Because customers are trying to buy best of breed platform and best of breed products. Yes. Two points you mentioned there. One is, re-assessment to do the right architecture. Two is, are their decisions driven by some of the cost complexity driven? The answer is yes to both of those things. It is very true that a lot of people who actually both familiar and exposed to Zscaler and in fact, some of them are already testing it, they've launched ZPA pretty quickly because they knew us already. We also saw a number of ZIA, ZPA combined deals in Q3. The acceleration of combined ZIA and ZPA deals together has a further increase. So, we realize that. But also what we're finding is a number of customers we're talking to now or I would say prospects we're talking now are saying yes, we bought a bunch of VPNs or whatever or VDIs for a short-term need to be met. But we know we want to go to zero trust, we need this digital transformation. So, evaluation of Zscaler ZIA and ZPAs are driven by some of those needs, not for the short term, but for architectural transformation. The second big trend we're seeing is that because of macroeconomic pressures, every CIO and more and more CFOs are trying to figure out how to do cost consolidation and simplification. So, now, they're beginning to buy more and more bigger platform bundles than smaller bundles. That has led to an increase of transformation bundle on the ZIA side, but also combination of ZIA and ZPA together on other side. So, we've benefiting from consolidation, simplification, reduction of complexity as well. We think it's a good trend that market needs to do for making the business more agile and more competitive. Yes, very good question. I briefly mentioned in my prepared remarks, but Summit Partner was put in place to identify cloud focused or cloud borne partners, who could help customers with translation. So, it's actually very well aligned with how our sales are done. So, we are seeing increased number of deal registrations, we're also seeing the deal size growing, because of the way the transmission sale is happening. And we think -- we expect to get more and more leverage in fiscal '21 from these partners. So, I would say, very bullish on the progress we've made and expecting even better results in this fiscal year. All right. Well, thank you all for joining us. We look forward to seeing you at one of the sales side conferences that we'll be attending. Thank you again."

And thank you for joining us. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these unprecedented times. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted. As you saw in the earnings release, we delivered very strong results for the third quarter. And we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2020. We built the right cloud native security platform for the cloud world. And the digital transformation market, driving our business is further accelerating. Combined with our improved sales execution, we are capitalizing on the market opportunity to take Zscaler beyond $1 billion in annual revenue. Zscaler was founded on the belief that in a cloud and mobile world, a user must be able to securely access any application from anywhere on any device. In the new work from anywhere economy, fulfilling this vision is even more critical because almost all users are now outside the corporate network where traditional perimeter-based security becomes irrelevant. To protect their employees working from home our customers are using Zscaler Internet Access or ZIA to provide secure access to the internet and SaaS applications and Zscaler Private Access or ZPA for Zero Trust access with internal applications. Combined, ZIA and ZPA enabled our customers to work securely from home, literally overnight as quarantine orders went into effect around the globe. We saw exceptional strength in our ZPA service with over 10x growth in usage during the quarter. Many new and existing customers deployed hundreds of thousands of new ZPA users. Our employees worked around the clock to support these deployments in a matter of weeks or even days. Even with the unprecedented traffic growth, our net promoter score or NPS reached a world class level, more than twice the average NPS of SaaS companies. I personally received many emails from customers about the positive impact Zscaler made on their business by enabling them to continue their operations. Let me quote a couple of them. CFO of large insurance company in U.S. said, \"Zscaler\u2019s deployment was executed to near perfection. We quickly secured 10,000 users. Kudos to Zscaler for such great tech and people.\" CIO of a high tech company in UK said, I quote \u201cWithout doubt, I now consider Zscaler acquisition to be one of the most-timely and beneficial services I have purchased in 25 years of working in IT.\u201d I spoke to over 100 CFOs this past quarter, and most of them believe COVID-19 is accelerating the digital transformation. And resistance to change is dissipating. Zscaler was born in the cloud, for the cloud, and as a result, we seamlessly transitioned to work from anywhere. We are focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees around the globe while we are successfully engaging and supporting our customers virtually. For example, we are leveraging modern tools like virtual whiteboarding to conduct interactive architectural workshops. Now, let me discuss our performance for the third quarter. Our revenue grew 40% and billings grew 55% year-over-year. We also delivered very strong growth in operating profit and free cash flow. We saw broad strength across verticals with notable strength in financial services. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in both ZIA and ZPA, but a standout performance in ZPA, which contributed 43% of new and add-on business, compared to approximately 20% in the first half of fiscal 2020. ZPA is a natural purchase for existing ZIA customers, which had a positive impact on our net retention rate of 119%. Gross margins were slightly lower, as we temporarily increased our use of public cloud to handle the significant growth in ZPA traffic. We are moving this increased traffic to our data centers in coming quarters and expect gross margins to improve. Remo will speak more about our gross margins in his section. As I mentioned earlier, many new and existing customers deployed hundreds of thousands of new ZPA users in the quarter. A Europe based global conglomerate added more than 200,000 users in three weeks across 185 countries. A U.S. based insurance company deployed 13,000 users in one week. An oil and gas company enabled over 47,000 users in 10 days. And an India-based financial services company enabled 11,000 users in only two days. We are seeing the attach rate of ZPA increase in our deals. But we still have a very large opportunity for upsell in the future, as only 32% of our global 2,000 customers have purchased ZPA. Ultimately, we believe all employees need ZPA, as internal applications migrate to the public cloud, and COVID-19 is accelerating this adoption. ZPA is much more than a VPN replacement. Customers are buying ZPA to implement a Zero Trust Network Approach or what Gartner calls ZTNA, which advocates that network security can no longer be done in a perimeter-less world. Hence, users should not be connected to the network but only to specific applications. While many enterprises purchased VPN appliances from the legacy VPN vendors in the past couple of months, I believe those were tactical purchases. In the world of Zero Trust, there's no place for firewalls and VPNs, since they are network security devices, and traditional networks are disappearing. Our new customers are increasingly purchasing ZIA and ZPA together as both are needed to enable employees to work from anywhere, securely, with great user experience. For example, a fin-tech customer purchased our Transformation Bundle, plus DLP, inline and out-of-band CASB and Browser Isolation for 40,000 users and ZPA for 25,000 users. This Fortune 500 Company was increasingly using cloud applications like Office 365, but the multi-vendor appliance-based security stack was a bottleneck that was hurting user performance and business agility. The deal started as legacy web gateway replacement but our sales team successfully demonstrated the value in transforming their network and security to deliver great user experience, superior security at a very attractive return on investment. With Zscaler, they're consolidating four different vendors, and eliminating more than 8-point products including secure web gateway, next gen firewall, sandbox, DNS, DLP, CASB and SSL inspection. Moreover, our cloud native architecture scales to meet any surges in their traffic that has overwhelmed their security appliances. In addition, their new Zero Trust approach will enable the company to quickly integrate mergers and acquisitions, which is a core growth strategy for them. Next, let me talk about ZIA, which we believe is also accelerating due to COVID-19. ZIA protects employees working from home as they access SaaS applications and the internet. Without ZIA, enterprises must use legacy VPN to route traffic to the corporate data center first, then out to the internet, back to the data center and finally back to the user. No wonder this results in poor user experience. And we all know that VPN, even a cloud-based VPN puts users on the corporate network and represents a major cyber risk. Last quarter, our ThreatLabZ security research team uncovered well over 0.5 million COVID-19 specific threats and protected our customers from them. Let me highlight a few of the ZIA deals. A major U.S. bank was experiencing performance issues with an incumbent web gateway that could not meet the traffic requirement of Office 365 and was due for a refresh. In this partner-led deal, customer purchased transmission bundle, CASB and Browser Isolation for 23,000 users and will retire the legacy proxy solution along with a few other security growing products. The customer expects this project to yield an ROI exceeding 100% and a payback period less than 12 months, while adding critical capabilities, like SSL inspection at scale, cloud firewall and [Technical Difficulty] DLP as DLP is becoming important in the world of cloud and work from anywhere. While SD-WAN was an important consideration for this deal, with COVID-19, the focus shifted to deploying Zscaler right away to protect users working from home and visit SD-WAN in the future. With similar goal, a Fortune 500 financial services company, an existing customer, upgraded their 50,000 user subscription from business to Transformation Bundle. This is another example of a sizable deal that was driven by two of our new products, out-of-band CASB and Browser Isolation. These examples illustrate that many of our customers are buying our high-end ZIA bundles and additional product modules. Lastly, our European public sector customer purchased our Transformation Bundle and DLP for 100,000 users. They needed to replace recently purchased, so called cloud security service, a legacy next-gen firewall vendor. After taking 10 months to onboard 14,000 users, they had to stop their deployment. Since security was important for this customer, they needed to inspect SSL traffic. While this virtual firewall could ostensibly inspect SSL, it could not do so at any meaningful scale. When their single-tenant cloud service failed, the vendor offered to replace it with on-prem firewall appliances. Since Zscaler was natively designed as a full SSL proxy, our customers can inspect encrypted traffic at scale without impacting user experience, leading to better security and reduced business risk. This customer also purchased ZPA for 30,000 users with plans to expand in the near future. As this last example shows, architecture matters for a cloud security platform that must sit in line to inspect traffic and enforce policy. Single-tenant architectures whether deployed as appliances or as virtual machines in a public cloud will only work if enterprises settle for poor security by not inspecting SSL traffic. As I have said before, you can't create a Netflix service by stacking thousands of DVD players in the cloud. We believe Gartner's only validated our platform and vision when they published a new approach for security, named Secure Access Service Edge or SASE. While many imitators claim to be SASE, they conveniently forget to mention that Gartner identifies SSL inspection as a key requirement of SASE architecture. We believe our 10-year track record of running a massive inline cloud that has to be highly reliable and available makes Zscaler the safe and the best choice when enterprises need to securely access mission-critical applications. We recently crossed a milestone of processing over 100 billion transactions per day, which we believe allows us to provide an unmatched network effect for better security for our customers. Let me now discuss the tremendous progress we made in our go-to-market initiatives to implement a repeatable and scalable process for world-class sales execution. I believe our consultative sales approach played a major role in our success this quarter. It enabled us to maintain a high level of engagement with our customers and prospects in the current virtual environment. Last quarter, I said that we were making good progress, based on key leading sales indicators. Let me give you a few examples of our progress in Q3. We hired a record number of field sales reps and we're continuing to attract high level talent. We built out strong sales leadership at the regional director, regional VP, and area VP levels. We increased sales productivity. We generated strong pipeline. And we recruited cloud-focused channel partners to drive further sales leverage. I could not be happier with our progress. And we believe this quarter's strong results are a proof of our ability to execute our sales strategy. Moving on to products, as we discussed previously, we have four new product offerings that are generally available this quarter: CASB; Browser Isolation, Zscaler B2B and Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX. As I mentioned in my deal highlights, our CASB and Browser Isolation products are beginning to generate revenue. As we have indicated before, we anticipate these new products will add to our growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Our cloud security platform protects users\u2019 access to any application from anywhere. Our next opportunity is to expand into protecting applications and data in the cloud. We are pursuing this opportunity in three areas. One, with out-of-band CASB, we are providing comprehensive data protection for SaaS applications. Two, with the acquisition of Cloudneeti and its cloud security posture management or CSPM functionality, we now provide data protection to public cloud workloads, which is an emerging security market segment. Three, with today's announcement of acquisition of Edgewise Networks, we are extending Zero Trust protection to east-west traffic within a public cloud or a data center. With Edgewise, we can provide a Zero Trust approach from machine to machine and process to process communications. Edgewise discovers individual micro services and the legitimate communication patterns, and using AI and machine learning algorithms, automatically creates and enforces authorized process to process communication to provide application segmentation. This is a far superior approach than legacy network segmentation for security. With our existing and new products, we believe Zscaler is the most comprehensive cloud security platform. And these additional products will expand our already large market opportunity. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. As mentioned, we had a very strong third quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $110.5 million, up 9% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective for the quarter, Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 40% and APJ was 9%. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 55% year-over-year to $131.3 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years, and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, was $654 million on April 30th, up 31% from a year ago. The current RPO is 56% of the total RPO and grew 36% year-over-year. I'd like to call out two dynamics that impacted our billing and contract duration. We are offering shorter commitments and invoicing period for customers needing help with their business continuity requirements for COVID-19 and in China and Japan free access to ZPA for two months. The overall impact of these initiatives to our billings and RPO was relatively modest. With billing duration, approximately flat year-over-year and with contract durations down slightly, we also had a higher mix of upsell business, which typically is shorter contracts and billing durations as it often co-terminates with the existing contracts. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which is 119% for the quarter and benefited from increased adoption of ZPA with existing customers. This compares to 118% a year ago, and 116% last quarter. As is highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger Transformation Bundles, selling both, the ZIA and ZPA from the start, and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel 119% is outstanding. Total gross margin was 80%, down 2 percentage points sequentially in year-over-year. This decline is primarily due to ZPA traffic growing over 10x during the quarter. To support this surge in demand by augmenting the use of AWS and Azure, which run at significantly higher costs compared to our data centers. We decided to prioritize helping our customers gain ramp quickly, rather than managing our cloud infrastructure to optimize our gross margins. We're working to reduce the use of public cloud and increase the capacity in our data centers over the next three quarters. But we expect some pressure on gross margin in the near-term. We expect overall gross margins to be 76% to 77% in Q4, 78%, in the first half of fiscal 2021, and we expect to return to our 80% target in the second half of fiscal 2021. We feel it's important to continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure to drive top-line revenue growth. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $79.6 million, and decreased as a percentage of revenue to 72% compared to 74% last year. Sales and marketing increased 6% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $52.6 million. We had two mid-year regional sales kickoffs in February for training and team building that represented $2.3 million in expenses. The year-over-year increase is due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our team and go-to-market initiatives offset by lower T&E. R&D was up 20% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year to $17.1 million. The increase is primarily due to continued investments in our team to enhance our product functionality and innovate new products. G&A increased 22% sequentially and 26% year-over-year to $9.9 million. The growth in G&A includes investments within our teams, compensation related expenses, and professional fees including acquisition-related expenses. Our third quarter operating margin was 8%, which compared to the 8% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $9 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.07. We ended the quarter with $391 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no debt. Free cash flow was positive $9 million in the quarter. Before moving on to guidance, I'd like to share a few additional thoughts related to COVID-19 that may be informative. Though we are not yet able to accurately predict the long-term impact of the pandemic, we did not experience a negative impact to our top-line results from COVID-19 this quarter. We attribute this to our focus on large enterprises, our recurring revenue model and our market position as customers move increasingly to the cloud. We had good linearity in the quarter with a strong March and April and May-to-date continues to be strong. We have not seen any meaningful pressure on renewals or receivable collections to date due to COVID-19, though the long-term impact on our customers and partners is not fully known. Renewals due in the next 12-18 months may place downward pressure depending on how the economy recovers. Our overall exposure to industries particularly impacted by COVID-19, like transportation, hospitality, retail and leisure where workforce reductions have been announced publicly is less than 10%. Now, moving on to guidance which incorporates these observations. A reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $117 million to $119 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 36% to 38%; operating profit in the range of $2 million to $4 million; other income of $1 million; income taxes of $1 million; and earnings per share of approximately $0.02 to $0.03, assuming 140 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range $422 million to $424 million or year-over-year growth of 39% or 40%; calculated billings in the range of $529 million to $531 million for year-over-year growth of 36%. Excluding $11 million of upfront billings in Q2 2019, our updated billings guidance for the fiscal year implies growth of 40%. Operating profit in the range of $24 million to $26 million; other income of $6.4 million; income taxes $3.5 million; and earnings per share in the range of $0.20 to $0.21, assuming approximately 138 million common shares outstanding. The acquisitions of Cloudneeti and Edgewise Networks are expected to have an immaterial impact on revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2021, as they are early stage companies. The cash purchase price of Cloudneeti, which closed in mid-April was $9 million, and the cash purchase price Edgewise which closed last week was $31 million. Our plan is to further develop these products, incorporate their technologies into our platform. We expect to incur approximately $2 million in additional operating expenses related to the acquisitions in Q4 and $12 million to $14 million in fiscal 2021. This is incorporated into our Q4 guidance. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. We've been very successful in hiring and onboarding remotely, and remain on track to increase our field sales rep headcount by 60% for the full year. We're very-pleased with the progress in our go-to-market initiatives and confident that these investments will build the foundation for long term growth. In addition, we will increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. Now, I'd like to hand the call back over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Remo. In closing, let me state five key points that make me excited. One, secure digital transmission, which is a market we have purpose built to address is accelerating. Two, as we have seen with SaaS leaders, like Salesforce and Workday, architecture matters. Only a cloud native multi-tenant architectures can enable through transformation. Three, our customers are consolidating and simplifying legacy network and security infrastructure, resulting in significant cost savings. Hence, our value proposition is highly attractive to CFOs and CIOs, especially in today's challenging economic environment. Four, in addition to our ongoing success for delivering comprehensive user protection, our next big opportunity is to expand into protecting applications and data, which we are pursuing through our own internal innovation and targeted acquisitions. Five, we are delivering world class sales execution, which we believe will drive sustainable long-term growth. We're mindful of the terrible toll that COVID-19 is infecting on the lives of so many people in so many ways. And we hope that we are helping and making difference to our customers and employees in these challenging times. We wish everyone good health and safety. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Please go ahead.\nAlex Henderson: Well, thank you very much. And thanks for the great quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the transaction that you won from a next-gen firewall player as cloud architecture. Are you seeing an increased flow of traffic coming to -- in your pipeline from people who are having the same type of issues? To what extent have you been able to demonstrate that the architecture really does matter to some of those customers? Is that becoming a funnel of opportunity for you?\nJay Chaudhry: If there were good amount of installed base, we will be seeing a lot of flow coming in. There aren\u2019t that many customers who are using firewall based cloud security services. The one that has deployed, we're seeing and who are trying to do security with proper SSL inspection at foundry. So, in a nutshell, are there lots of customers out there with firewall installed based in the cloud? Not really.\nAlex Henderson: Okay. Then, let me shift to the second follow-up question, if I could. Clearly, you're driving a cloud-direct model. As that happens, you're connecting the user direct to the cloud. And then, applications are increasingly being driven by Kubernetes in a variety of locations, whether that be AWS, Azure or private cloud. And those start to become points in the cloud, and connectivity to them becomes critical. Are you planning on doing the connectivity into those locations, those points in the cloud or are you also planning on going beyond that to the CICD processing and the like, where the image is secured before it goes into production or in runtime?\nJay Chaudhry: So, the way we look at accesses, applications, whether sitting in data center, or in a public cloud, or a private cloud, are simply destinations. So, with ZPA, any user can access any of those applications. We're independent of how those applications are deployed and where they're deployed. So, we aren't doing that today. But the most -- more important stuff we're doing in future, as we announced the acquisition of Edgewise Network is application to application communication security, process to process communication, which we think is the next big opportunity for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski from DA Davidson.\nAndrew Nowinski: I'd like to start with a question on ZPA. So, I was wondering if you could give us any color relative to the pricing of ZPA versus ZIA. And what I'm trying to get at is whether you're indifferent in terms of whether customers start with ZPA and then move to ZIA or vice versa.\nJay Chaudhry: So, I will start and Remo can add-on. ZIA and ZPA are two independent product lines, ZIA to provide secure access to external applications like SaaS and internet; and ZPA to provide access to internal applications. Customers can start from either side, it doesn't really matter. But, since ZIA started very early on with us, so we have a large installed base of customers, who started with ZIA, and those happy customers are adding ZPA, but we do see a number of customers starting with ZPA.\nRemo Canessa: Pricing is similar. We sell in three bundles for each pro business and transformation. So, the pricing is similar and the bundles are similar for both products.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it. That makes sense. And then, just a quick follow-up on your hiring target. I don't know if you mentioned it. But I know you are targeting a 60% growth in headcount by the end of the July quarter. Are you still on track to achieve that?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, we are -- we had a record quarter in Q3 hiring. We also feel the quality of people they're bringing on board is outstanding. The leadership that we're putting in place throughout the sales organization, for the most part, it's completely in place right now. So, now, we're filling up the ranks with the field sales reps. But we are planning and expecting to get to 60% field sales rep growth.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you very much. Guys, I just first want to say congratulations on the success, very impressive to see the acceleration in the business, and frankly the execution during these crazy times. And that really leads to my first question for Jay. Jay, can you just talk us through the balance of headwinds and tailwinds from COVID-19 that impacted the business? And if you look out on the horizon longer term, how does this experience change the shape of adoption for Zscaler going forward?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. If you look at what COVID has done, it has forced everyone to work from home. It is accelerating digital transformation. And that's the market we were designed to address. So, we are getting benefit from COVID-19 as every customer has to work from home. And you saw a number of examples where we enabled so many customers literally overnight or over a week or two weeks. So, it's helping us. Now, the next question ends up being what happens after two or three months? We think that changes that CIOs, CTOs are seeing with transformation that being able to work from home, they are actually accelerating their transformation. One of the new things that I learned during this transition was, I'm working from home, all of my employees are working from home without using my corporate network, why do I need the corporate network? Why do I need to do this local internet breakout and why do I need to do this SD-WAN transformation? So, a lot of customers are buying into going to the final step of transformation where a user can directly go to any application from anywhere. So, net-net, we are seeing some good tailwind. Now, the headwind could potentially be reduction in spend because every company is becoming cost conscious. And that's where actually our story is getting more compelling. Since we do such a great ROI, so CFOs and CIOs and are looking for consolidation of vendors. And this consolidation is around best of breed platforms, rather than best of breed point products. So, they like our position that we're not trying to play in four different market segments that are totally different, but in a very meaningful segment where we are the Zero Trust exchange to connect anything to anything. So, net-net, we think this trend of accelerated digital transformation is going to help our business.\nBrad Zelnick: That makes perfect sense. And it would seem to me Zscaler was built for a situation just like this. Maybe my follow-up just for Remo, the net expansion is a metric that you've been deemphasizing over the last several quarters and maybe somewhat unsurprisingly, at least to us. It's nice to see it's up significantly, in the April quarter. How should we think about it as we look forward? And what are you assuming? I know, you've only given us one quarter of guidance. But even as you're formulating your own plan into next year, how are you thinking about expansion of the base?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. We talked about it. And we deemphasized the net retention rate. However, it stayed pretty consistent for the last three years. From my perspective, I don't want to give forward guidance on net retention rate, but I don't see the composition of our business significantly changing in the near future.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you guys so much and congrats again.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bartus from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Bartus: Great. Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Jay, I just wanted to drill down on your SD-WAN-driven sales and what you're hearing from customers. And I'm thinking, does it make sense that this 3Q maybe the trough for your ZIA business tat\u2019s typically tied to SD-WAN? And then, as we look into the 4Q and beyond, do SD-WAN headwinds potentially persist, or do you hear that it's going to be a priority as to save money as people kind of trickle back into the offices?\nJay Chaudhry: Well, that\u2019s a question we have been asking a lot of CIOs as we talk to them. As work from home order happened, all network changes got put on hold. There's only one priority, I need my employees to work from home securely, which really needed a ZIA kind of product to go to external applications, ZPA to go to internal applications. So, we actually benefited from not even having to deal with SD-WAN because sometimes network transformation can take longer. We expect that as customers go back to the office, they will be revisiting some SD-WAN projects. But, if it has shown the CIOs that they don't have to depend on the network, and they can move forward faster with it. I was talking to CIO of this very large company, about 100,000 users, who was actually looking at doing the SD-WAN breakout. And now having seen this, he said, I\u2019ll think about it if I need to, but I am finding that I can run my business without worrying about the network. In IT, things don't change overnight. But the emphasis is changing. We think now the shift is happening. It is less focus on network, more focus on access from anywhere.\nDaniel Bartus: Great. And then, -- that's really helpful. And just quickly, Remo, I'm wondering if you can help us break out the strength through ZPA between existing ZPA customers, adding more seats and actually adding new ZPA customers?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So, the strength in the quarter was ZPA and it was with existing customers. So, the growth both in ZIA and ZPA were very good. So, the growth with the work from home initiatives, the existing customers quickly purchased ZPA. And ZPA represented close to 40% of our new customers. So, the new customer business historically 50% to 60% mix of the new ACV, but we expect it to return back to the historical mix.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. If I may add, ZPA came from three sources. One was on existing customers have bought some number of seats of ZPA, which is generally having in a 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% range. So, that's one. Second bucket was, Zscaler customers who have bought ZIA were still looking at ZPA hadn't bought it, that decision moved on. That became number two. And third was customers who bought ZIA and ZPA together, because they were new logos to us. All three contributed to the success of ZPA, while ZIA did very well as well.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So, the follow-on also, typically in the past we've seen a 50-50 mix of new and existing. Over the last several quarters that mix has been more in the 30% to 50% range. In Q3, it was closer to that lower end of the range.\nJay Chaudhry: And that's number of customers.\nRemo Canessa: And the number of customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Jay, maybe for you, just to change subject there just for a second. Can you talk about some of the acquisitions here with Cloudneeti and Edgewise? Those are a little different than ZIA and ZPA in terms of displacing sort of an existing vendor of per user kind of per year pricing model. How do you sort of envision those two new acquisitions sort of fitting into the go-to-market for the future?\nJay Chaudhry: So, first of all, if you look at overall position, Zscaler has been focused on protecting users, no matter what they need to access. That's on ZIA, ZPA, Zscaler B2B story. Our next natural step was to protect applications and data in the cloud. So, for that Cloudneeti helps us to protect workloads, because misconfigurations and all can cause leakage of data. So, that's an important piece for data protection. And then Edgewise, basically extends our story of saying, why should we just stop at connecting users to application? Why not application to application, why not process to process, using the same Zero Trust approach that disrupts typical network based security? So, that's all that fit. Now, from pricing point-of-view, yes, our pricing has been based on number of users. Now, price will be based on, what? Workloads, right? There are millions and millions of workloads going out on the cloud. It will be subscription service, just like everything else, but the unit of pricing becomes workloads.\nSaket Kalia: Maybe for my follow-up for you, Remo. So, helpful commentary in the prepared remarks just around duration. Can you just tell us how you're thinking about duration here in Q4? Understanding the majority of billings here are annually in advance. You talked a little bit about more co-term business, maybe some shorter commitments as well kind of in a COVID environment. How are you thinking about sort of the duration inside the implied Q4 billings guide?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I really don't see much change in the billing duration in Q4. Our billing duration typically is between 10 and 14 months. And for the last few quarters, several quarters, it\u2019s been a lower half of that range. I'd expect the same in Q4.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nRemo Canessa: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Please go ahead.\nCatharine Trebnick: Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on good quarter. So, in your prepared remarks, you had discussed that you were doing whiteboarding in some of your activities in the sales motion. Can you describe? Every time I talk to investors, I get pushed back on how complicated the sales process is for you all, takes longer -- it's a long sales cycle. Could you explain to us or give us sort of background on what that new sales process looks like in COVID-19? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Catherine. At the core of Zscaler is transformation of the network and applications, because you no longer need traditional hub and spoke network. So, when you try to replace one box of a firewall with a second box of firewall, it's simple. This box comes out, that box goes in. In Zscaler, we generally need to show them that you don't have to have this hub and spoke network and castle-and-moat security mode. So, you end up doing this architectural discussion. Now, once architects start getting it and understanding it, the life becomes a lot easier, because typically we don't go through this typical POCs, proof of concept that compares features and functions. And whiteboarding becomes important to show essentially how the network is sitting today, how can it change in phase one, phase two, phase three. So, we show them the transmission journey. That's where whiteboarding comes in. Is it complicated? I won't say it's complicated. I would say is different than doing the box-centric, POC-centric sale. Here, transformation starts from the C level. And those are generally the first parties we work with. And generally that C level really depends on architects to show them how the architecture changes. So, we haven't seen any slowdown in terms of engagement. Actually I\u2019ve been surprised to find that getting meetings with C level as well as architects in this confined at home world is actually much easier. Did I answer your question?\nCatharine Trebnick: Yes, you did. Thank you very much.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Catharine.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nGray Powell: Okay. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good results. I want to go back to one of the comments you made in the prepared remarks, particularly on linearity. So, did you guys see any material benefit from emergency spending initiatives to support work from home? And then, I know you said linearity was strong in March and April, and that may continue to be strong. So, I\u2019m just trying to think of the trendline there. Was there any like decel in May or how did May compare to April?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. I won't make a specific comment between May and April. What I can say is that linearity in Q3 was better than we had in prior quarters. We picked up strongly in March, get to work from home with COVID-19. We continued to have a strong April. And so, we ended the quarter well. And that momentum that we had in Q3 is carrying over into May. And May continues to be strong.\nGray Powell: Got it. That makes perfect sense. And then, just one quick one. So, I know you guys mentioned -- you did some free I think it was 90 day trial for promotions on ZPA back in March and April. Just what's your confidence level in converting those into paid customers? And how big should we think of that opportunity today?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, see, as COVID-19 became basically a global pandemic, most of the customers that started with original pre-offer for their China-based employees converted to paying customers. Some of the customers converted to business continuity program, the sort of commitment period, but many also converting to multi-year commitments with annual billings. So, that's proved that to be good for us.\nJay Chaudhry: But just to add on, Remo, we did not have a global trial free program.\nRemo Canessa: That's correct.\nJay Chaudhry: We simply did it in China early on when things started. And after that our customers started to call us and say, we need to help to get turned on. It's less of an issue of money. It's more of a matter of my employees need to be productive on Monday morning. And we were crazy busy getting our customers online and making sure they work well.\nGray Powell: Got it. Okay. Yes. Thank you very much for clarifying that. All right. I'm good. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Srini Nandury from Summit Insights. Please go ahead.\nSrini Nandury: All right. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. Jay, you talked about using AWS for some of the processing of data, since you didn't have enough capacity. How does that affect the latency? And more importantly, how long does it take for you to add more capacity to infrastructure? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Add capacity to our infrastructure?\nSrini Nandury: Yes. That's the reason I presume you're using AWS, right?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So, the difference is the following. You need to have some hardware sitting in the data centers where we want to add capacity. The turning on and turning them up and running is not a hard thing at all, literally that\u2019s a matter of maybe a day or two. So, whatever time it takes, it takes time to acquire hardware and ship it to the data center, then it gets turned on pretty quickly. Now, as COVID happened literally overnight, I still recall on Thursday, I got a call from very large conglomerate in Europe, they said, my over 3,000 people need to start working from home on Monday at 14th of Match. And I'm already using ZIA, I'm still playing with ZPA, but I need ZPA to turned on by Monday morning. This is in two days notice, right? So, for us to get our capacity ready doesn't take a whole lot shipments and all, does take some time. And so, it's this good option to be able to use Azure or AWS, as we need to increase capacity for a short amount of time. And as we said in our prepared remarks, the gross margin difference can be significant. So, we use them as we need them and then we can dial that down.\nSrini Nandury: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from UBS. Please go ahead.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I hope you're all safe and sound. Jay, maybe a question for you to start. As I zoom out -- or as you zoom out rather, and consider your pipeline, at a time when organizations are perhaps becoming more measured in what they're spending and whom they're spending with, perhaps slow playing some of the big architectural decisions, particularly around SD-WAN as was alluded to earlier. I was curious how a lot of these dynamics are or will be impacting your pipeline composition, if I consider some of your traditional demand drivers across competitive displacement, SD-WAN adoption and Office 365 migrations?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. If I may say our number one driver has been digital transformation, whether Office 365 or SD-WAN, any of those things have been coming from one core thing, it is very true that every CIO and CFO is becoming more cost conscious. And that's where -- so the decision is not driven by I need to change the architecture. The decision is driven by, I need to consolidate and my multiple vendors, reduce my costs and be ready for digital transformation. If you look at from two buckets point-of-view, consolidation, we do because of a great platform and architecture readiness gets in there. So, we actually see this thing accelerating in many ways. Especially, the network with generally the slowest moving part is becoming less important factor, because CIOs have seen business work without using the corporate network. Did I answer your question?\nFatima Boolani: Yes. That\u2019s super helpful. And Remo, maybe a question for you. Just as it relates to volumes of large deals in the quarter, you provided some very marquee examples in the prepared remarks of the 200,000-seat win. So I'm curious if there is any outsized or unusually large impact from very large deals in the quarter. And that's it for me. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: No. I mean, there's no real large deal in the quarter. I mean, a lot of deals are greater than $500,000, ACV, which is a great quarter for us. But, nothing stands out as a very, very large deal.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Shebly Seyrafi from FBN Securities.\nShebly Seyrafi: So, my question is, you're going to have four new products ramping in '21. Do you have an estimate roughly, what kind of revenue contributions there\u2019ll be?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s not going to be material. If you take a look at our ZPA product that we introduced, I'd say, it\u2019s going to be along those same type of trajectory. A couple of percentage points of our total perhaps in fiscal '21 and then accelerate as we go forward. So, clearly, it\u2019s immaterial basically impact for the products in fiscal '21.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. And then, I know from the number you provided, Americas\u2019 growth accelerated with my spreadsheet to 39% from 30% growth the prior quarter. And you even had a tougher year-to-year comparison in the Americas. So, is this just COVID or are there other factors in the Americas driving it?\nRemo Canessa: So, it relates to products, it also relates to new and upsell, not revenue. So, just so you're aware that. Related to the growth in the region, I can say that all regions did very, very well. For new and upsell, there is no region that did not do well.

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As mentioned, we had a very strong third quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $110.5 million, up 9% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective for the quarter, Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 40% and APJ was 9%. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 55% year-over-year to $131.3 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years, and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, was $654 million on April 30th, up 31% from a year ago. The current RPO is 56% of the total RPO and grew 36% year-over-year. I'd like to call out two dynamics that impacted our billing and contract duration. We are offering shorter commitments and invoicing period for customers needing help with their business continuity requirements for COVID-19 and in China and Japan free access to ZPA for two months. The overall impact of these initiatives to our billings and RPO was relatively modest. With billing duration, approximately flat year-over-year and with contract durations down slightly, we also had a higher mix of upsell business, which typically is shorter contracts and billing durations as it often co-terminates with the existing contracts. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which is 119% for the quarter and benefited from increased adoption of ZPA with existing customers. This compares to 118% a year ago, and 116% last quarter. As is highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger Transformation Bundles, selling both, the ZIA and ZPA from the start, and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel 119% is outstanding. Total gross margin was 80%, down 2 percentage points sequentially in year-over-year. This decline is primarily due to ZPA traffic growing over 10x during the quarter. To support this surge in demand by augmenting the use of AWS and Azure, which run at significantly higher costs compared to our data centers. We decided to prioritize helping our customers gain ramp quickly, rather than managing our cloud infrastructure to optimize our gross margins. We're working to reduce the use of public cloud and increase the capacity in our data centers over the next three quarters. But we expect some pressure on gross margin in the near-term. We expect overall gross margins to be 76% to 77% in Q4, 78%, in the first half of fiscal 2021, and we expect to return to our 80% target in the second half of fiscal 2021. We feel it's important to continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure to drive top-line revenue growth. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $79.6 million, and decreased as a percentage of revenue to 72% compared to 74% last year. Sales and marketing increased 6% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $52.6 million. We had two mid-year regional sales kickoffs in February for training and team building that represented $2.3 million in expenses. The year-over-year increase is due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our team and go-to-market initiatives offset by lower T&E. R&D was up 20% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year to $17.1 million. The increase is primarily due to continued investments in our team to enhance our product functionality and innovate new products. G&A increased 22% sequentially and 26% year-over-year to $9.9 million. The growth in G&A includes investments within our teams, compensation related expenses, and professional fees including acquisition-related expenses. Our third quarter operating margin was 8%, which compared to the 8% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $9 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.07. We ended the quarter with $391 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and no debt. Free cash flow was positive $9 million in the quarter. Before moving on to guidance, I'd like to share a few additional thoughts related to COVID-19 that may be informative. Though we are not yet able to accurately predict the long-term impact of the pandemic, we did not experience a negative impact to our top-line results from COVID-19 this quarter. We attribute this to our focus on large enterprises, our recurring revenue model and our market position as customers move increasingly to the cloud. We had good linearity in the quarter with a strong March and April and May-to-date continues to be strong. We have not seen any meaningful pressure on renewals or receivable collections to date due to COVID-19, though the long-term impact on our customers and partners is not fully known. Renewals due in the next 12-18 months may place downward pressure depending on how the economy recovers. Our overall exposure to industries particularly impacted by COVID-19, like transportation, hospitality, retail and leisure where workforce reductions have been announced publicly is less than 10%. Now, moving on to guidance which incorporates these observations. A reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $117 million to $119 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 36% to 38%; operating profit in the range of $2 million to $4 million; other income of $1 million; income taxes of $1 million; and earnings per share of approximately $0.02 to $0.03, assuming 140 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range $422 million to $424 million or year-over-year growth of 39% or 40%; calculated billings in the range of $529 million to $531 million for year-over-year growth of 36%. Excluding $11 million of upfront billings in Q2 2019, our updated billings guidance for the fiscal year implies growth of 40%. Operating profit in the range of $24 million to $26 million; other income of $6.4 million; income taxes $3.5 million; and earnings per share in the range of $0.20 to $0.21, assuming approximately 138 million common shares outstanding. The acquisitions of Cloudneeti and Edgewise Networks are expected to have an immaterial impact on revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2021, as they are early stage companies. The cash purchase price of Cloudneeti, which closed in mid-April was $9 million, and the cash purchase price Edgewise which closed last week was $31 million. Our plan is to further develop these products, incorporate their technologies into our platform. We expect to incur approximately $2 million in additional operating expenses related to the acquisitions in Q4 and $12 million to $14 million in fiscal 2021. This is incorporated into our Q4 guidance. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. We've been very successful in hiring and onboarding remotely, and remain on track to increase our field sales rep headcount by 60% for the full year. We're very-pleased with the progress in our go-to-market initiatives and confident that these investments will build the foundation for long term growth. In addition, we will increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. Now, I'd like to hand the call back over to Jay. Pricing is similar. We sell in three bundles for each pro business and transformation. So, the pricing is similar and the bundles are similar for both products. Yes. We talked about it. And we deemphasized the net retention rate. However, it stayed pretty consistent for the last three years. From my perspective, I don't want to give forward guidance on net retention rate, but I don't see the composition of our business significantly changing in the near future. Thank you. Yes. So, the strength in the quarter was ZPA and it was with existing customers. So, the growth both in ZIA and ZPA were very good. So, the growth with the work from home initiatives, the existing customers quickly purchased ZPA. And ZPA represented close to 40% of our new customers. So, the new customer business historically 50% to 60% mix of the new ACV, but we expect it to return back to the historical mix. Yes. So, the follow-on also, typically in the past we've seen a 50-50 mix of new and existing. Over the last several quarters that mix has been more in the 30% to 50% range. In Q3, it was closer to that lower end of the range. And the number of customers. Yes. I really don't see much change in the billing duration in Q4. Our billing duration typically is between 10 and 14 months. And for the last few quarters, several quarters, it's been a lower half of that range. I'd expect the same in Q4. Great, thank you. Yes. I mean, see, as COVID-19 became basically a global pandemic, most of the customers that started with original pre-offer for their China-based employees converted to paying customers. Some of the customers converted to business continuity program, the sort of commitment period, but many also converting to multi-year commitments with annual billings. So, that's proved that to be good for us. That's correct. No. I mean, there's no real large deal in the quarter. I mean, a lot of deals are greater than $500,000, ACV, which is a great quarter for us. But, nothing stands out as a very, very large deal. So, it relates to products, it also relates to new and upsell, not revenue. So, just so you're aware that. Related to the growth in the region, I can say that all regions did very, very well. For new and upsell, there is no region that did not do well. EMEA, APJ and Americas, all did about the same. Great. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. And thank you for joining us. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe during these unprecedented times. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted. As you saw in the earnings release, we delivered very strong results for the third quarter. And we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2020. We built the right cloud native security platform for the cloud world. And the digital transformation market, driving our business is further accelerating. Combined with our improved sales execution, we are capitalizing on the market opportunity to take Zscaler beyond $1 billion in annual revenue. Zscaler was founded on the belief that in a cloud and mobile world, a user must be able to securely access any application from anywhere on any device. In the new work from anywhere economy, fulfilling this vision is even more critical because almost all users are now outside the corporate network where traditional perimeter-based security becomes irrelevant. To protect their employees working from home our customers are using Zscaler Internet Access or ZIA to provide secure access to the internet and SaaS applications and Zscaler Private Access or ZPA for Zero Trust access with internal applications. Combined, ZIA and ZPA enabled our customers to work securely from home, literally overnight as quarantine orders went into effect around the globe. We saw exceptional strength in our ZPA service with over 10x growth in usage during the quarter. Many new and existing customers deployed hundreds of thousands of new ZPA users. Our employees worked around the clock to support these deployments in a matter of weeks or even days. Even with the unprecedented traffic growth, our net promoter score or NPS reached a world class level, more than twice the average NPS of SaaS companies. I personally received many emails from customers about the positive impact Zscaler made on their business by enabling them to continue their operations. Let me quote a couple of them. CFO of large insurance company in U.S. said, \"Zscaler's deployment was executed to near perfection. We quickly secured 10,000 users. Kudos to Zscaler for such great tech and people.\" CIO of a high tech company in UK said, I quote \u201cWithout doubt, I now consider Zscaler acquisition to be one of the most-timely and beneficial services I have purchased in 25 years of working in IT.\u201d I spoke to over 100 CFOs this past quarter, and most of them believe COVID-19 is accelerating the digital transformation. And resistance to change is dissipating. Zscaler was born in the cloud, for the cloud, and as a result, we seamlessly transitioned to work from anywhere. We are focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees around the globe while we are successfully engaging and supporting our customers virtually. For example, we are leveraging modern tools like virtual whiteboarding to conduct interactive architectural workshops. Now, let me discuss our performance for the third quarter. Our revenue grew 40% and billings grew 55% year-over-year. We also delivered very strong growth in operating profit and free cash flow. We saw broad strength across verticals with notable strength in financial services. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in both ZIA and ZPA, but a standout performance in ZPA, which contributed 43% of new and add-on business, compared to approximately 20% in the first half of fiscal 2020. ZPA is a natural purchase for existing ZIA customers, which had a positive impact on our net retention rate of 119%. Gross margins were slightly lower, as we temporarily increased our use of public cloud to handle the significant growth in ZPA traffic. We are moving this increased traffic to our data centers in coming quarters and expect gross margins to improve. Remo will speak more about our gross margins in his section. As I mentioned earlier, many new and existing customers deployed hundreds of thousands of new ZPA users in the quarter. A Europe based global conglomerate added more than 200,000 users in three weeks across 185 countries. A U.S. based insurance company deployed 13,000 users in one week. An oil and gas company enabled over 47,000 users in 10 days. And an India-based financial services company enabled 11,000 users in only two days. We are seeing the attach rate of ZPA increase in our deals. But we still have a very large opportunity for upsell in the future, as only 32% of our global 2,000 customers have purchased ZPA. Ultimately, we believe all employees need ZPA, as internal applications migrate to the public cloud, and COVID-19 is accelerating this adoption. ZPA is much more than a VPN replacement. Customers are buying ZPA to implement a Zero Trust Network Approach or what Gartner calls ZTNA, which advocates that network security can no longer be done in a perimeter-less world. Hence, users should not be connected to the network but only to specific applications. While many enterprises purchased VPN appliances from the legacy VPN vendors in the past couple of months, I believe those were tactical purchases. In the world of Zero Trust, there's no place for firewalls and VPNs, since they are network security devices, and traditional networks are disappearing. Our new customers are increasingly purchasing ZIA and ZPA together as both are needed to enable employees to work from anywhere, securely, with great user experience. For example, a fin-tech customer purchased our Transformation Bundle, plus DLP, inline and out-of-band CASB and Browser Isolation for 40,000 users and ZPA for 25,000 users. This Fortune 500 Company was increasingly using cloud applications like Office 365, but the multi-vendor appliance-based security stack was a bottleneck that was hurting user performance and business agility. The deal started as legacy web gateway replacement but our sales team successfully demonstrated the value in transforming their network and security to deliver great user experience, superior security at a very attractive return on investment. With Zscaler, they're consolidating four different vendors, and eliminating more than 8-point products including secure web gateway, next gen firewall, sandbox, DNS, DLP, CASB and SSL inspection. Moreover, our cloud native architecture scales to meet any surges in their traffic that has overwhelmed their security appliances. In addition, their new Zero Trust approach will enable the company to quickly integrate mergers and acquisitions, which is a core growth strategy for them. Next, let me talk about ZIA, which we believe is also accelerating due to COVID-19. ZIA protects employees working from home as they access SaaS applications and the internet. Without ZIA, enterprises must use legacy VPN to route traffic to the corporate data center first, then out to the internet, back to the data center and finally back to the user. No wonder this results in poor user experience. And we all know that VPN, even a cloud-based VPN puts users on the corporate network and represents a major cyber risk. Last quarter, our ThreatLabZ security research team uncovered well over 0.5 million COVID-19 specific threats and protected our customers from them. Let me highlight a few of the ZIA deals. A major U.S. bank was experiencing performance issues with an incumbent web gateway that could not meet the traffic requirement of Office 365 and was due for a refresh. In this partner-led deal, customer purchased transmission bundle, CASB and Browser Isolation for 23,000 users and will retire the legacy proxy solution along with a few other security growing products. The customer expects this project to yield an ROI exceeding 100% and a payback period less than 12 months, while adding critical capabilities, like SSL inspection at scale, cloud firewall and [Technical Difficulty] DLP as DLP is becoming important in the world of cloud and work from anywhere. While SD-WAN was an important consideration for this deal, with COVID-19, the focus shifted to deploying Zscaler right away to protect users working from home and visit SD-WAN in the future. With similar goal, a Fortune 500 financial services company, an existing customer, upgraded their 50,000 user subscription from business to Transformation Bundle. This is another example of a sizable deal that was driven by two of our new products, out-of-band CASB and Browser Isolation. These examples illustrate that many of our customers are buying our high-end ZIA bundles and additional product modules. Lastly, our European public sector customer purchased our Transformation Bundle and DLP for 100,000 users. They needed to replace recently purchased, so called cloud security service, a legacy next-gen firewall vendor. After taking 10 months to onboard 14,000 users, they had to stop their deployment. Since security was important for this customer, they needed to inspect SSL traffic. While this virtual firewall could ostensibly inspect SSL, it could not do so at any meaningful scale. When their single-tenant cloud service failed, the vendor offered to replace it with on-prem firewall appliances. Since Zscaler was natively designed as a full SSL proxy, our customers can inspect encrypted traffic at scale without impacting user experience, leading to better security and reduced business risk. This customer also purchased ZPA for 30,000 users with plans to expand in the near future. As this last example shows, architecture matters for a cloud security platform that must sit in line to inspect traffic and enforce policy. Single-tenant architectures whether deployed as appliances or as virtual machines in a public cloud will only work if enterprises settle for poor security by not inspecting SSL traffic. As I have said before, you can't create a Netflix service by stacking thousands of DVD players in the cloud. We believe Gartner's only validated our platform and vision when they published a new approach for security, named Secure Access Service Edge or SASE. While many imitators claim to be SASE, they conveniently forget to mention that Gartner identifies SSL inspection as a key requirement of SASE architecture. We believe our 10-year track record of running a massive inline cloud that has to be highly reliable and available makes Zscaler the safe and the best choice when enterprises need to securely access mission-critical applications. We recently crossed a milestone of processing over 100 billion transactions per day, which we believe allows us to provide an unmatched network effect for better security for our customers. Let me now discuss the tremendous progress we made in our go-to-market initiatives to implement a repeatable and scalable process for world-class sales execution. I believe our consultative sales approach played a major role in our success this quarter. It enabled us to maintain a high level of engagement with our customers and prospects in the current virtual environment. Last quarter, I said that we were making good progress, based on key leading sales indicators. Let me give you a few examples of our progress in Q3. We hired a record number of field sales reps and we're continuing to attract high level talent. We built out strong sales leadership at the regional director, regional VP, and area VP levels. We increased sales productivity. We generated strong pipeline. And we recruited cloud-focused channel partners to drive further sales leverage. I could not be happier with our progress. And we believe this quarter's strong results are a proof of our ability to execute our sales strategy. Moving on to products, as we discussed previously, we have four new product offerings that are generally available this quarter: CASB; Browser Isolation, Zscaler B2B and Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX. As I mentioned in my deal highlights, our CASB and Browser Isolation products are beginning to generate revenue. As we have indicated before, we anticipate these new products will add to our growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Our cloud security platform protects users' access to any application from anywhere. Our next opportunity is to expand into protecting applications and data in the cloud. We are pursuing this opportunity in three areas. One, with out-of-band CASB, we are providing comprehensive data protection for SaaS applications. Two, with the acquisition of Cloudneeti and its cloud security posture management or CSPM functionality, we now provide data protection to public cloud workloads, which is an emerging security market segment. Three, with today's announcement of acquisition of Edgewise Networks, we are extending Zero Trust protection to east-west traffic within a public cloud or a data center. With Edgewise, we can provide a Zero Trust approach from machine to machine and process to process communications. Edgewise discovers individual micro services and the legitimate communication patterns, and using AI and machine learning algorithms, automatically creates and enforces authorized process to process communication to provide application segmentation. This is a far superior approach than legacy network segmentation for security. With our existing and new products, we believe Zscaler is the most comprehensive cloud security platform. And these additional products will expand our already large market opportunity. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you, Remo. In closing, let me state five key points that make me excited. One, secure digital transmission, which is a market we have purpose built to address is accelerating. Two, as we have seen with SaaS leaders, like Salesforce and Workday, architecture matters. Only a cloud native multi-tenant architectures can enable through transformation. Three, our customers are consolidating and simplifying legacy network and security infrastructure, resulting in significant cost savings. Hence, our value proposition is highly attractive to CFOs and CIOs, especially in today's challenging economic environment. Four, in addition to our ongoing success for delivering comprehensive user protection, our next big opportunity is to expand into protecting applications and data, which we are pursuing through our own internal innovation and targeted acquisitions. Five, we are delivering world class sales execution, which we believe will drive sustainable long-term growth. We're mindful of the terrible toll that COVID-19 is infecting on the lives of so many people in so many ways. And we hope that we are helping and making difference to our customers and employees in these challenging times. We wish everyone good health and safety. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. If there were good amount of installed base, we will be seeing a lot of flow coming in. There aren't that many customers who are using firewall based cloud security services. The one that has deployed, we're seeing and who are trying to do security with proper SSL inspection at foundry. So, in a nutshell, are there lots of customers out there with firewall installed based in the cloud? Not really. So, the way we look at accesses, applications, whether sitting in data center, or in a public cloud, or a private cloud, are simply destinations. So, with ZPA, any user can access any of those applications. We're independent of how those applications are deployed and where they're deployed. So, we aren't doing that today. But the most -- more important stuff we're doing in future, as we announced the acquisition of Edgewise Network is application to application communication security, process to process communication, which we think is the next big opportunity for us. So, I will start and Remo can add-on. ZIA and ZPA are two independent product lines, ZIA to provide secure access to external applications like SaaS and internet; and ZPA to provide access to internal applications. Customers can start from either side, it doesn't really matter. But, since ZIA started very early on with us, so we have a large installed base of customers, who started with ZIA, and those happy customers are adding ZPA, but we do see a number of customers starting with ZPA. Yes, we are -- we had a record quarter in Q3 hiring. We also feel the quality of people they're bringing on board is outstanding. The leadership that we're putting in place throughout the sales organization, for the most part, it's completely in place right now. So, now, we're filling up the ranks with the field sales reps. But we are planning and expecting to get to 60% field sales rep growth. Yes. If you look at what COVID has done, it has forced everyone to work from home. It is accelerating digital transformation. And that's the market we were designed to address. So, we are getting benefit from COVID-19 as every customer has to work from home. And you saw a number of examples where we enabled so many customers literally overnight or over a week or two weeks. So, it's helping us. Now, the next question ends up being what happens after two or three months? We think that changes that CIOs, CTOs are seeing with transformation that being able to work from home, they are actually accelerating their transformation. One of the new things that I learned during this transition was, I'm working from home, all of my employees are working from home without using my corporate network, why do I need the corporate network? Why do I need to do this local internet breakout and why do I need to do this SD-WAN transformation? So, a lot of customers are buying into going to the final step of transformation where a user can directly go to any application from anywhere. So, net-net, we are seeing some good tailwind. Now, the headwind could potentially be reduction in spend because every company is becoming cost conscious. And that's where actually our story is getting more compelling. Since we do such a great ROI, so CFOs and CIOs and are looking for consolidation of vendors. And this consolidation is around best of breed platforms, rather than best of breed point products. So, they like our position that we're not trying to play in four different market segments that are totally different, but in a very meaningful segment where we are the Zero Trust exchange to connect anything to anything. So, net-net, we think this trend of accelerated digital transformation is going to help our business. Well, that's a question we have been asking a lot of CIOs as we talk to them. As work from home order happened, all network changes got put on hold. There's only one priority, I need my employees to work from home securely, which really needed a ZIA kind of product to go to external applications, ZPA to go to internal applications. So, we actually benefited from not even having to deal with SD-WAN because sometimes network transformation can take longer. We expect that as customers go back to the office, they will be revisiting some SD-WAN projects. But, if it has shown the CIOs that they don't have to depend on the network, and they can move forward faster with it. I was talking to CIO of this very large company, about 100,000 users, who was actually looking at doing the SD-WAN breakout. And now having seen this, he said, I'll think about it if I need to, but I am finding that I can run my business without worrying about the network. In IT, things don't change overnight. But the emphasis is changing. We think now the shift is happening. It is less focus on network, more focus on access from anywhere. Yes. If I may add, ZPA came from three sources. One was on existing customers have bought some number of seats of ZPA, which is generally having in a 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% range. So, that's one. Second bucket was, Zscaler customers who have bought ZIA were still looking at ZPA hadn't bought it, that decision moved on. That became number two. And third was customers who bought ZIA and ZPA together, because they were new logos to us. All three contributed to the success of ZPA, while ZIA did very well as well. And that's number of customers. So, first of all, if you look at overall position, Zscaler has been focused on protecting users, no matter what they need to access. That's on ZIA, ZPA, Zscaler B2B story. Our next natural step was to protect applications and data in the cloud. So, for that Cloudneeti helps us to protect workloads, because misconfigurations and all can cause leakage of data. So, that's an important piece for data protection. And then Edgewise, basically extends our story of saying, why should we just stop at connecting users to application? Why not application to application, why not process to process, using the same Zero Trust approach that disrupts typical network based security? So, that's all that fit. Now, from pricing point-of-view, yes, our pricing has been based on number of users. Now, price will be based on, what? Workloads, right? There are millions and millions of workloads going out on the cloud. It will be subscription service, just like everything else, but the unit of pricing becomes workloads. Thank you, Catherine. At the core of Zscaler is transformation of the network and applications, because you no longer need traditional hub and spoke network. So, when you try to replace one box of a firewall with a second box of firewall, it's simple. This box comes out, that box goes in. In Zscaler, we generally need to show them that you don't have to have this hub and spoke network and castle-and-moat security mode. So, you end up doing this architectural discussion. Now, once architects start getting it and understanding it, the life becomes a lot easier, because typically we don't go through this typical POCs, proof of concept that compares features and functions. And whiteboarding becomes important to show essentially how the network is sitting today, how can it change in phase one, phase two, phase three. So, we show them the transmission journey. That's where whiteboarding comes in. Is it complicated? I won't say it's complicated. I would say is different than doing the box-centric, POC-centric sale. Here, transformation starts from the C level. And those are generally the first parties we work with. And generally that C level really depends on architects to show them how the architecture changes. So, we haven't seen any slowdown in terms of engagement. Actually I've been surprised to find that getting meetings with C level as well as architects in this confined at home world is actually much easier. Did I answer your question? Thank you, Catharine. Yes. I won't make a specific comment between May and April. What I can say is that linearity in Q3 was better than we had in prior quarters. We picked up strongly in March, get to work from home with COVID-19. We continued to have a strong April. And so, we ended the quarter well. And that momentum that we had in Q3 is carrying over into May. And May continues to be strong. But just to add on, Remo, we did not have a global trial free program. We simply did it in China early on when things started. And after that our customers started to call us and say, we need to help to get turned on. It's less of an issue of money. It's more of a matter of my employees need to be productive on Monday morning. And we were crazy busy getting our customers online and making sure they work well. Add capacity to our infrastructure? Yes. So, the difference is the following. You need to have some hardware sitting in the data centers where we want to add capacity. The turning on and turning them up and running is not a hard thing at all, literally that's a matter of maybe a day or two. So, whatever time it takes, it takes time to acquire hardware and ship it to the data center, then it gets turned on pretty quickly. Now, as COVID happened literally overnight, I still recall on Thursday, I got a call from very large conglomerate in Europe, they said, my over 3,000 people need to start working from home on Monday at 14th of Match. And I'm already using ZIA, I'm still playing with ZPA, but I need ZPA to turned on by Monday morning. This is in two days notice, right? So, for us to get our capacity ready doesn't take a whole lot shipments and all, does take some time. And so, it's this good option to be able to use Azure or AWS, as we need to increase capacity for a short amount of time. And as we said in our prepared remarks, the gross margin difference can be significant. So, we use them as we need them and then we can dial that down. Yes. If I may say our number one driver has been digital transformation, whether Office 365 or SD-WAN, any of those things have been coming from one core thing, it is very true that every CIO and CFO is becoming more cost conscious. And that's where -- so the decision is not driven by I need to change the architecture. The decision is driven by, I need to consolidate and my multiple vendors, reduce my costs and be ready for digital transformation. If you look at from two buckets point-of-view, consolidation, we do because of a great platform and architecture readiness gets in there. So, we actually see this thing accelerating in many ways. Especially, the network with generally the slowest moving part is becoming less important factor, because CIOs have seen business work without using the corporate network. Did I answer your question? Yes. It's small. It's not going to be material. If you take a look at our ZPA product that we introduced, I'd say, it's going to be along those same type of trajectory. A couple of percentage points of our total perhaps in fiscal '21 and then accelerate as we go forward. So, clearly, it's immaterial basically impact for the products in fiscal '21. Good. All right. Well, thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We wish everyone good health and safety. Look forward to seeing you at our next quarterly earnings call. Thank you."

Now I will turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill, and thank you everyone for joining us. We delivered solid Q2 results while making tremendous progress in important areas of our business, particularly with our go-to-market initiatives. In Q2, our revenue grew 36% and billings grew 18% year-over-year, which had a difficult comparison due to a non-recurring private cloud sale to a large public sector customer last year. Adjusting for this, revenue grew 41% and billings grew 30%. During the quarter, we significantly expanded our sales leadership team, refined our territory coverage, revamped our channel program and tooled our sales management systems. It is remarkable how much progress we made on our go-to-market initiatives in a short period of time. Considering these significant undertakings, I am very pleased with our results. We are seeing good momentum in our business and we are increasing our outlook for revenue and billings for the full fiscal year 2020. On profitability, we delivered 11% non-GAAP operating margins and our free cash flow was negative $2 million. Excluding the $15 million one-time cash payment to settle all cemented lawsuits, free cash flow would have been positive $13 million while we delivered strong profitability in the quarter. We are focused on making strategic investments to position Zscaler well for the long term. What excites me the most is seeing our customers leverage a cloud native integrated security platform to accelerate the digital transformation journey. We are empowering them to transform their network and security to fully realize the benefits of cloud and mobility. Let me highlight a few wins in Q2 that showed the many use cases of our platform and what we believe are our sustainable competitive advantages. I will start with a new logo win of a national public transportation provider in Europe that needed to modernize its infrastructure and better engage with its passengers. The scalability and elasticity of a cloud became a critical enabler of their transformation strategy, supporting large-scale data center consolidation, application migration and network changes. Zscaler is the only solution that could meet the requirements to scale from 2 gigabit per second Internet connectivity today to 100 gigabits per second in the future while delivering full SSL inspection and sandboxing for zero trust. We closely partnered with a global system integrator to implement our Transformation Bundle for 45,000 users. This is a great example of the leverage we gained from working with the system integrator partner. That was awarded the overall transformation project. In our large ZIA deals, we continue to see increasing adoption of SaaS and Office 365 as primary drivers. In another new customer win, a Fortune 500 material sciences company purchased our business bundle that includes advanced threat protection, SSL inspection and bandwidth control for 57,000 users. With a Strategy the legacy on-premise security gateway became irrelevant. We provided protection across over 100 locations and for mobile users, improving the security posture and delivering elasticity that's expected of a cloud service. Now, let me give an example of an upsell deal. A Fortune 100 healthcare company that started a large paid pilot of our Transformation Bundle Plus DLP for 10,000 users just nine months ago purchased additional seats along with our newly released CASB to cover all 65,000 employees. With 120 SaaS and cloud apps already in use, their existing appliance-centric security approach was failing, even with 40 large security appliances in their two primary data centers. With the upcoming Office 365 deployment, which often doubles Internet bound traffic, this customer is implementing local breakout with SD WAN secured by Zscaler across 450 locations. Notably, this was our first CASB win as the customer wanted an integrated solution CASB that is integrated with ZIA and that brings together both outdoor band and in-line CASB capabilities. For the first phase of adopting a zero trust network access strategy across the Company, they bought ZPA for 2,500 users to help integrate a recently acquired company and provide secure access to AWS for their developers. I'm delighted to share our continued momentum with ZPA which remains our fastest growing product line. There is a growing customer interest in zero trust network approach to offer access to applications without granting access to the corporate network. As an early pioneer, ZPA is a mature rich offering that is deployed in hundreds of enterprises. Let me highlight a few additional ZPA events in the quarter. Two years ago, a global 10 multinational oil and gas customer bought our ZIA Transformation Bundle for 145,000 employees. After ZIA delivered excellent user experience while handling a 200% growth in their Internet traffic over 2 years, the customer purchased ZPA for over 100,000 users to replace its legacy VPN and to secure access to applications in the public cloud. ZPA represents the next step in this customers' IT transformation journey towards the cloud first strategy. To improve security, ZPA will connect users to applications not the network. This would not be possible with legacy VPN or firewall solutions. Since starting with Zscaler 4 years ago with professional Bundle, this customer has increased their total annual spend with Zscaler by over 700% I'm thrilled that more customers are purchasing ZIA and ZPA together to leverage a single platform for secured cloud transformation. A multinational industrial company purchased ZIA business bundle and Cloud Firewall for 60,000 users and ZPA for 40,000 users. The move to Zscaler was driven by one, to pursue local breakout from three data centers to 750 locations globally as their Office 365 rollout overwhelmed their existing security infrastructure. Two, to execute faster M&A and divestitures. Zscaler is the only solution that could meet all the requirements and deliver an excellent user experience. Due to ZPA's zero trust network access architecture, our ability to support M&A and divestitures is unique and was instrumental to winning this deal. The customer is leveraging Zscaler to provide secure, fast and reliable access for any user from any location on any device at a lower cost of ownership and with greater operational simplicity. Lastly, I will share another combined ZIA and ZPA win. A Fortune 500 medical testing company with the strategic objective of expanding the business in cloud-based data analytics needed to transform the network and security for greater agility and IT simplification. This customer purchased the ZIA business bundle and Cloud Firewall for 25,000 users to secure local Internet breakouts with SD WAN for 3,600 locations. While the incumbent firewall vendor offers an integrated SD-WAN solution, the customer chose a light branch architecture with Zscaler providing all security in the cloud as advocated by Gartner's SASE model. In the first phase of adopting a zero trust network access strategy across the company, the customer also purchased ZPA for 8,000 users to replace the legacy VPN, remote access. As these do show, a cloud first world requires a cloud native architecture. Unlike the traditional security appliances are born in the cloud security platform can scale, remember Zscaler stands for Zenith off scalability. You've seen the legacy network security vendors trying to recast themselves as cloud security providers. The single-tenant architecture is not designed for the cloud. As I have said before, you can't create a Netflix service by stacking thousands of DVD players in the cloud. You can't offer an in-line, high-performance security cloud by spinning up a bunch of virtual machines in a public cloud. As you may know, Gartner published two groundbreaking research reports to respond to customers' needs for better advice for security and network transformation. First, the future of network security is in the cloud, which defines the new approach named Secure Access Service Edge or SASE that strongly validates Zscaler's platform and vision. Gartner predicts that most organizations will move their network security to a SASE model. Many vendors are claiming that they are SASE, but we believe Zscaler most comprehensively meets the core architectural principles of SASE including cloud EDGE architectural light branch design proxy technology and cloud native multi-tenant architecture. We are SASE since 2008. The second Gartner report defines zero trust network access or ZTNA architecture which advocates that network security can no longer be done in a perimeter-less world. Hence, users should not be connected to the network but only to specific applications. This architecture renders traditional network security products like firewalls irrelevant. We believe ZPA is the best implementation of ZTNA and we are well positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market opportunity. We have over a 10-year lead on operating a cloud platform at scale processing over 85 billion transactions per day and providing an unprecedented network effect for better security for our customers. Let me update you on the status of the new products that we believe will keep us well ahead of the competition. As we discussed previously, we have 4 new product offerings that will be generally available in early fiscal Q4. Zscaler B2B and Zscaler digital experience or ZDX are two new product lines that are getting great initial feedback from our beta customers. We believe that these product lines will significantly expand our already large market opportunity. We are engaged with several dozen customers for our CASB offering and we have closed a few deals already. With the outdoor band CASB combined with our existing in line CASB capabilities, we now offer a complete CASB solution. But browser isolation offering is already being tested by a dozen customers. It is important to point out that these new products are fully integrated with the Zscaler platform, which provides a common set of services such as user authentication, central logging, single policy engine making Zscaler a compelling and powerful platform for security transformation and vendor consolidation. We believe these new products will add to our growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Let's now turn to our go-to-market. As I stated during the last earnings call, we are focused on improving our sales execution to take Zscaler beyond a $1 billion in annual revenue. I couldn't be happier having Dali on board, leading our go-to-market organization. I'm excited about the key initiatives that Dali and our sales leadership are putting in place to position us well for our long-term growth. The progress we are making in a short period of time is quite remarkable, and in many ways ahead of my expectations. We accelerated the majority of our initiatives within the last quarter as we rolled out a refined, repeatable and scalable sales process. Let me highlight the key initiatives. We implemented our new sales enablement program. This program is having a great impact on the consistency and quality of execution across the entire sales organization. We expect this to enable our new hires to ramp faster with quality activity out of the gate. We implemented new AI based tools and systems to provide visibility into leading indicators such as sales activities and key go-to-market metrics. We expanded and deepened our sales leadership structure, positioning us to scale our sales organization going forward. This included internal promotions to front line leadership roles. We rolled out the new sales leadership training program and trained all of our sales leaders in the past 90 days. Among other things, this training includes how to attract and hire the right talent. We continue to aggressively hire in sales and plan to increase our sales rep headcount by 60% by the end of this fiscal year, compared to prior year. I'm impressed with the quality of candidates we are attracting and hiring to drive top-down transformational sales. We evaluated and defined territory coverage that we believe will lead to higher volume and quality of customer engagements. To drive home these initiatives, we held two midyear sales kick offs earlier this month, one in Europe and one in the US to bring the global sales organization together for training and team building. While it will take time to realize the full benefits of these changes, I'm excited to share that we are starting to see promising leading indicators. Customer engagements are up significantly, both in new business meetings and existing customer interactions with more high impact CXO meetings. And with the introduction of a weekly pipeline generation day, the quality and volume of our pipeline is growing. To complement our comprehensive platform, we have been integrating our solution with technology leaders and creating go-to-market leverage with deeper field engagements with their sales organizations. For example, after recently completing the integration of the Zscaler platform with CrowdStrike, we are starting to see new opportunities with Global 2000 customers. Our field teams are partnering to sell to new customers and to our respective customer basis. Our Microsoft partnership is growing stronger and creating more tailwinds with the adoption of Office 365, Azure public cloud, Azure AD and Azure Sentinel. We are training Microsoft security professionals and architects on our integrated solution. Zscaler was also recently recognized as Microsoft Security 2020 Partner Award finalist nominated in two categories, ISV Partner of the Year and customer impact and we are working closely with both VMware and Silver Peak to secure the SD band deployments. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Revenue for the quarter was $101.3 million, up 8% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Recall that last year Q2 '19 revenue was aided by $2.3 million in nonrecurring revenue from a large public sector customer deploying our platform as a private cloud. Excluding this revenue from last year, revenue grew 41% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, for the quarter, Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 40% and the APJ was 9%. Turning to calculated billings which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 18% year-over-year to $135.4 million against a difficult comparison. Recall, we had a large upfront billing of $11 million in Q2 of 2019. From the large public sector customer excluding this deal, our billings grew 30% year-over-year. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue was $609 million on January 31, up 32% from one year ago. The current RPO is 56% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar based net retention rate, which is 116% for the quarter. This compares to 118% a year ago and 120% last quarter. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter to quarter. Our increased success selling bigger deals starting immediately with our Transformation Bundle and faster upsells within a year while good for our business can reduce our dollar based net retention rate which is calculated on a year-over-year ARR basis. Considering these factors, we feel that 116% is very strong. Total gross margin was 82%, up 1 percentage point sequentially and up 2 percentage points year-over-year. We feel that 80% continues to be a good target range in the near term as it is important to continue to invest in our platform to drive top line revenue growth. Turning to operating expenses, total operating expenses decreased 1% sequentially and increased 41% year-over-year to $71.9 million and increased as a percentage of revenue to 71% compared to 67% last year. Sales and marketing increased 1% sequentially and 49% year-over-year to $49.7 million. Please keep in mind that in Q1 2020, we had two Zenith Live user conferences and a global sales kick off that represented $6.5 million in expenses. The year-over-year increase is due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives. R&D was down 4% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year to $14.2 million. The sequential decrease was primarily due to higher capitalization of software development costs as a number of our new products continue to progress towards general availability. On a year-over-year basis, We continue to invest to enhance our product functionality and to innovate new products. G&A decreased 5% sequentially and increased 36% year-over-year to $8.1 million. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower professional fees and the year-over-year increase is to support our company growth. G&A expenses exclude $16.3 million in litigation related expenses, including the $15 million cash settlement for all Symantec lawsuits. Our second quarter operating margin was 11% which compares to 13% the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $12 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.09. We ended the quarter with $385 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Free cash flow was negative $2 million in the quarter. Excluding the $15 million one-time cash payment to settle all Symantec lawsuits, free cash flow would have been positive $13 million. Now moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, certain litigation related expenses, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $105 million to $107 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 33% to 35%. Operating profit in the range of $1 million to $3 million. We plan to increase our sales investments in Q3. Also, please keep in mind that we spent approximately $2 million on the two midyear sales kick offs in February. Income taxes of $950,000 and earnings per share of approximately $0.01 to $0.03 assuming 139 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $414 million to $417 million or year-over-year growth of 37% to 38%. Calculated billings in the range of $512 million to $217 million or year-over-year growth of 31% to 33%. Operating profit in the range of $16 million to $18 million. In Q4, we expect to host our annual Zenith Live conferences in both EMEA and Americas. We expect the cost of these two events to be in the range of $5 million to $6 million, income taxes of $3.5 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.14 to $0.16, assuming approximately 139 million common shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. We are very pleased with the progress Dali is making, and we are confident he is the right person to drive our sales and go-to-market execution. We are stepping up our sales and marketing investments in order to build the foundation for long-term growth. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. As you model billings, I want to remind you that historically, Q2 and Q4 have been our strongest billing quarters with the sequential declines in Q1 and Q3 quarters respectively. For the year, excluding the $11 million of upfront billings in Q2 of 2019, our updated billings guidance for the fiscal year implies 35% to 37% growth. In terms of free cash flow, please note that we have additional spend for tenant improvements related to our headquarters move. Including the settlement of Symantec lawsuits, these extraordinary items are expected to total approximately $22 million to $25 million in cash payments for the full year. As a result of these payments, we expect our free cash flow margins in fiscal 2020 to be approximately one point lower compared to our operating profit margins. Longer term, we would expect free cash flow margins to be higher than our non-GAAP operating margins. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Remo. In closing, let me state four key points that make me excited. One, architecture matters for a cloud security platform that must sit in line to inspect all traffic for policy enforcement. We believe we're the best architecture with over 10 years of operational experience to run a massive cloud, which is an enormous barrier to entry. Two, with multiple tailwinds such as Office 365, SaaS adoption, SD WAN and app migration to public clouds, we believe the market is coming to us. Three, we are in early innings of the cloud journey. We're disrupting a $20 billion TAM with ZI and ZPA. With recently announced Zscaler B2B and ZDX we believe we will expand our addressable market significantly. Four, with expanded go-to-market leadership in place, we are building a sales machine that can deliver world-class execution and sustainable long-term growth. We thank you for your interest in Zscaler and look forward to reporting our progress in the future. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: So, Jay, you spoke to this throughout your prepared remarks a bit, but I'd love if you can expand on it perhaps a bit more. In context of the business decelerating and the re-acceleration required to achieve your full-year guidance. What's driving your confidence at this point? And specifically, how should we think about the visibility you have into the back half of the year.\nJay Chaudhry: As we have said before, we brought Dali on board, we knew we needed to do a number of things to further scale our business to a larger level. And some of the main things we have already addressed are enablement our sales teams. We had a small enablement team, we've grown it. We have proper training programs, refined the sales process to make it scalable. We've put a number of systems in place that give visibility to not only headquarters, but also front line leaders and we have significantly expanded the sales leadership in the field and created an extra layer that's needed for scaling. So a lot of those things are behind us and done and we brought the entire sales organization together in 2 places for a mid-year SKO, sales kickoff Americas and EMEA to really bring it all together. So those are the things that are accomplished. Now, the second question is about confidence. Obviously, we look for what some of the impacts are, what's giving us confidence to give you the projection that we've done for the second half. There are couple of main things that fall in that area. Number one is we are able to measure our sales engagement, engagement with our customers, engagement of new business. And the tools we've put in place and the leadership we're driving, we are seeing a far better engagement than we used to have. And the second, even more important is pipeline generation because that's a good indicator. The volume of pipeline and the quality of pipeline is all going up. So looking at the pipelines, looking at the engagements, that's what's reflected in our visibility and confidence for the second half of the business.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks very much, Jay, and, Remo, if I can just follow up with a quick one for you. From a billings duration perspective, and I appreciate the adjustment on the year-ago comp for the large deal that you've called out both then and now. So thank you for that. But is there anything as we think about the average contract length. The mix of duration in this quarter, perhaps sequentially or even year-on-year if we exclude that large deal that we should take into account as we appraise your results that we're looking at tonight? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, thank you, Brad. When even with the deal that we had, the duration came down substantially year-over-year. When you take that large deal out, the duration did decrease slightly. I would say that the average duration is right around 12 months and it hasn't really changed that much on a year-over-year or a quarter-over-quarter basis.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Daniel Bartus with Bank of America.\nDaniel Bartus: First, for Jay, I wanted to ask about the SD WAN partners as I'm sure some see you guys as a bit of a competitive threat, as well as a partner. So, have there been any changes in the market where SD WAN vendors have gotten more aggressive in pushing their own security offerings? And then for Remo as a quick follow-up, pretty notable beat on operating margins. So, can you discuss if you guys are behind on hiring and to hit the lower second half operating margins should we attribute this all to higher go-to-market spending pretty much? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: First of all, regarding the SD WAN landscape, I'll share with you based on my field engagements. I'm out there meeting lots and lots of customers. They're largely free vendor as we see it. Most of the enterprise deals it's VMware Velocloud, it's Cisco Viptela and Silver Peak. In all those deals, we are the preferred security choice. They don't try to build security in the branch box, so to speak. Yes, there are a couple vendors who are trying to build security in the box. If you look at Gartner's SASE paper and if you talk to security experts in general, they don't believe security can be built in a branch box, security needs to be done at the cloud. So perhaps there is some opportunity for some of these vendors in the mid-market where security is not viewed as very critical, but when you come to securities heavy companies, which is generally larger enterprises, we don't really see a change in it. In fact we have seen better engagement with some of the larger partners like VMware and Silver Peak.\nRemo Canessa: And related to the questions you had for me. The beat on margin in the quarter was related to the beat on revenue, a higher gross margin and also lower operating expenses and primarily related to head count. On a go-forward basis for the second half, we do expect to step up our go-to-market investments. One of the things we called out or a couple of things to call out was the two SKOs we had in February, and also the two user conferences we're going to have in June. In addition, our expectation and one of the comments we made was that we'd be at a 60% RSM head count growth year-over-year. We expect to be there. So our plan and expectation is to be at 60% RSM head count growth year-over-year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Henderson with Needham & Company.\nAlex Henderson: So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the slope of the new sales hire and the timing of which those people will get up and running as they go through the training process and the like. Obviously you are accelerating your hires targeting 60% increase in staffing, don't think that you're at that rate at this point. So, is it going to accelerate into the back half, and if that's the case should we not see the acceleration of the contribution with the lag of what, three months, six months? Help us think it through.\nJay Chaudhry: I'll start and Remo you can add more color to it. As a part of our plan, one of the things we needed to do in this company was to expand our sales leadership at the front line. So that's the first priority we did to expand because we knew that if we hired the right leaders in the field, they can actually hire a number of - a good number of sales reps. So we accelerated sales leadership hiring and actually are ahead of what I thought it would be. Knowing that the priority, so yes, today we are behind on the sales plan where we wanted to be, but knowing that the leaders are in place, knowing that they have been trained on actually hiring and training, we are pretty confident that we will get to our 60% hiring numbers. So that was one part of the question. And a lot of enablement we are doing in the systems we are putting in place is to make sure there's better visibility and more effective engagement with the customers for a better ramp up. So things are being done to provide faster ramp and have better productivity over time. Remo, you want to add to it?\nRemo Canessa: Yes, Alex, it's a great question. When what Dali did in the first half, and as Jay mentioned, he significantly increased the leadership in the sales organization and we put an additional level layered related with RVPs, Regional Vice Presidents. When you look at the number of RVPs, area VPs and GOVPs in place, it's in the 80% range and that's in my opinion, quite remarkable to be at that point.\nJay Chaudhry: So 80% of our expanded target.\nRemo Canessa: 80% of our expanded target exactly. So the highest probability that you have to hire the right RSMs is to have that leadership in place. So, the concentration in the first half, in particular in Q2, was to get that leadership level in place in the Company. That's what gives me confidence also related to when I look at the quality of people that we're bringing on board, it is a very high quality group of leaders, as well as RSMs. When I look at also the Q2, we had the highest gross hires for RSMs in Q2 over the last two years. Now, our attrition was high also. We called that out on a prior call saying that we expect attrition to be higher in Q2, which it was. We feel that's behind us, and on a go-forward basis we feel attrition is going to decrease and we expect to step up the RSM hires as we go forward. And as I mentioned before, we're very confident and it's our plan to increase at 6% year-over-year.\nJay Chaudhry: I'll add one more point. As we are hiring these new reps, we're seeing that in the first quarter they're having better sales engagements, because we are measuring those engagements and some of the enablement and some of the tools we have put in place is helping us. So I feel very, very happy about it.\nAlex Henderson: If I could do a follow-up question. So obviously you're confident enough to accelerate your spending and hiring. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape that would impede the progress of this investment or offset or dilute the benefit as we look out? Any change in pricing condition, any change in competitor capabilities?\nJay Chaudhry: Haven't really seen much impact on the competition side. In fact, our churn is down year-over-year. Our discount is pretty sable. Our average ARR of customers with greater than 3,000 users, which we track is approaching 400-K. And as you know, we help customers drive transformation. We drive agility, zero trust access, and once they understand what we do we rarely lose. So I don't worry about competition, I do want to stay focused on our sales execution. I think as we improve it, we're going to see better and better results.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gray Powell with BTIG.\nGray Powell: Maybe a question on your net retention rates. So how should we think about net retention going forward. And I mean on the one side, you have a lot more customers landing with the Transformational Bundle but on the other side, you're launching a lot of new products. So just how should we think about that?\nRemo Canessa: It's a good question. We've talked about with more transformation, part of our ZIA - part of our business customers buy for the entire user base. And so as more transformation that puts pressure on the net retention rate, even though it's good for the Company, this does put pressure. In addition, if customers buy within the year, because the way we calculate net retention rate is the ARR for that sort of customers a year ago versus what that customers have in ARR currently. So as customers buy within the year, that also puts pressure. Also basically the mix between new and upsell. In the quarter, we saw in the mid-range of what we've seen in prior quarters. It's 60% or 50% new in the quarter is basically in the mid-range of that. Prior quarter our net retention rate was 120% and we called out that that was basically 50% new. So it's going to vary and we've talked about, it's a metric you should look at, but it's not one that we put a whole lot of importance to.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Colville with Arete Research.\nPatrick Colville: Can I just a clarification on your point just then on the net retention rate. So, were you saying that this quarter there was 50% revenue contribution of new customers and last quarter it was 40%? Is that - was that right?\nRemo Canessa: It was in the mid-range. So it was - in the mid - around 55% was new customers in the quarter and last quarter was 50%.\nPatrick Colville: So, slightly higher contribution this quarter from new customers.\nRemo Canessa: That's correct.\nPatrick Colville: And then can I talk just the competitively about the dynamics with NetScope. Is that someone that do you see as competitive, and if not, where is Zscaler stronger?\nJay Chaudhry: We have seen some of the press releases they've done but we hardly see them in the gateway area where they seem to be trying to go. They are in the CASB side of it. We've seen them on the CASB side of it. But with our strong integrated platform where we are offering a full CASB that consolidates, that integrates in line and out of band, we are in a very strong position. So we don't really see them out there in the market, especially in the market area, where we compete in.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Nowinski with DA Davidson.\nAndrew Nowinski: Maybe just to start with a quick clarification. I know you said you had some attrition in the quarter which was in line with your expectations. So I'm just wondering why you decided to step on the gas on hiring now versus maybe the start of the fiscal year?\nRemo Canessa: From - it's really we've stepped on the gas hiring. So as I mentioned, we have the hires - highest RSM hiring over the last two years last quarter. However, having said that, related to getting this management layer in place, the highest probably success that you have in hiring the right RSMs if you have the right leaders in place. So as we go forward with this leadership on board over a relatively short period, we expect to increase RSM hires as we go forward.\nJay Chaudhry: Or if I may add, yes, we have the largest hire for sales rep In Q2. We expect higher number of hiring in Q3 and Q4 because we have a strong field sales leadership in place.\nAndrew Nowinski: And then maybe shifting gears, Broadcom Symantec has made some announcements. They seem to be only focusing on their largest customers. I'm just wondering if you have seen any increase in displacements of Symantec Blue Coat. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: So we have seen a lot of additional interest from large enterprises. As you know, Blue Coat has been in enterprise market. They used to have a big presence, the presence was largely in the appliance space. So yes, a lot of interest and it is helping us. It's a good opportunity for us and we plan to take full advantage of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: Jay, I was wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about ZDX and Z B2B. How the progress is, is I guess going on the development front there. And it sounds like maybe the GA date pushed out a quarter. Anything to be concerned about there or maybe an update on the progress with the development of those two products?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, so first of all the GA date of those two products, hasn't really pushed out. We have just told before that we will be doing beta testing and will be ready in the Q4 timeframe. So we are actually pretty much on plan. What we have done, what we can report to you is the field engagement or the customer engagement of those two products. As you know, they not just product features their product lines per se. So, early beta engagement for B2B are very good, that's the new market actually. If you think about who leads Z's B2B market, nobody really does it, with the ZPA based architecture and zero trust it's an ideal opportunity for us. So we've seen tremendous interest from our customer base that's going to be starting. But there'll be some demand creation because people don't even know that this kind of thing exists out there. When it comes to ZDX zero - I'm sorry Zscaler digital experience, there is tons of interest and demand from the customers because none of the tools that are designed for user experience in the old world work in the new world. We got some very good beta customers going on and in Q4 we plan to start selling both of those products. So we - with a fairly good sell cycle in large enterprises, we don't expect a whole lot of contribution in Q4, but we expect it to help us in fiscal '21 and beyond.\nBrian Essex: Maybe just a follow-up on the launches of those products. Is there any analogy that you can point to maybe learning what - maybe what you learn with the launch of ZPA and now that Dali is on board, how you're prepared to manage contribution from those product cycles as we head into 2021?\nJay Chaudhry: I think if you look at ZPA, it was the first major product line introduction, right. In ZIA we had many modules we launched. Module to me is a firewall, it's not a product line. Module to me is a cloud sandbox. So, we have done quite well. We are pleased with how ZPA has come from nothing to a pretty significant contributing factor. For these products, we do have an incubation program. So rather than putting an overlay full sales team in place, we got an incubation team that's actually working with the early stage customers to learn the sales process and buyers and all those things so we could do proper training and the like for customers. So we have some good plans in place. We are comfortable and also we alluded to the fact that our sales process is meant for portfolio selling complex sales. So I think we'll be able to handle these product lines in our proper sales process.\nOperator: We'll take our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: The first question just around the 60% growth in RSMs as you exit the year, how should we think about productivity assumptions and so forth? Given that volume or rep growth would seem like you're setting up for billions of revenue to accelerate as you get that capacity on board, we just want to make sure we're not missing anything in terms of other assumptions that may go into that.\nRemo Canessa: No, I think you're right on. Basically with the added RSMs coming on board, again, that adds to our capacity. So it takes about - they're on full quota after 12 months. Not - doesn't mean all of our RSMs are at 100% capacity, but that's when they're full quota. So we do expect basically to be positive impact that in fiscal '21, you're not going to see it that much in fiscal '20 or even very early fiscal '21. But as these RSMs get on board we expect to see increased productivity because of the quality of the people we're bringing on board, because of the enablement that we're doing, because of the leadership, the increased products that we have, the market coming to us, we do expect to increase the sales productivity as they get ramped.\nWalter Pritchard: And then just as it relates to the expense of those people and what happens before they get productive. What can you tell us about the margin impact? Is it fully - do we fully see that as we exit this year or do you see that take on more of a burden as you go into next year? Just curious directionally given that large increase in head count.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, I think you're going to see the bulk of the margin impact this year, then you're going to see better margins we go forward in fiscal '21.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities.\nDaniel Ives: Can you just maybe talk on some of the larger deals in terms of what Dali bring - in terms of the process, maybe today cultivating some of those deals versus where we were maybe six to nine months ago? And then maybe you could give an example, Jay, obviously you're involved in a lot of those.\nJay Chaudhry: So just to clarify, the deals that we have been closing versus how we are closing? I just want to clarify.\nDaniel Ives: Yes, just the larger deals and just the process that Dali brings to the organization versus where you were before he came.\nJay Chaudhry: Right. I think the biggest thing we've done if you look at the sales process, we figured out the sales process several years ago that it can be pushed through VARs. It has to be transformational C level involvement and the like. So the reason we have seen this growth in the past several years is because we have been doing the right process. What we did not have is a proper discipline and structure and enablement to take it a large scale level. I had two people in my sales enablement team and I was waiting for new CRO to come and to put that in place, now we've got over 15 people in place in the sales development. So while we knew the process and the right thing and we have further refined it, we have further enhanced it to make it repeatable, but the biggest thing we have done spent time to really make sure our people are enabled properly. That's one biggest thing, which also includes a proper inspection, proper qualifiers, we use something called [indiscernible]. So there is some better selling methodology behind it, proper questions, proper qualifications, and the like, and along with that the tools we have put in place, which gives us visibility. We are measuring many things from engagement level, architectural workshop levels. So they are giving us far better visibility in the quality of the pipeline, which helps us do better forecasting. So those aren't the things that are needed to scale our business and that's what we have been doing and very pleased with the progress and that's what Dali has brought to the table.\nOperator: We'll take next question from Fatima Boolani with UBS.\nFatima Boolani: Jay, question for you. A number of times you've mentioned that pipeline quality has seen significant improvement in terms of both volume and quality, and I'm wondering if you can elaborate on what you mean by quality? Is it the size of the customer? Is at the size of the engagement? Is it the size of the displacement? Would really appreciate some more color on that. And I have a follow-up for Remo.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, the biggest part of quality we look at is - has been inspect. We are looking for certain attributes. For example, being able to understand all the stakeholders that are involved, being able to make sure engagements are happening. So there are several steps involved that help us give more confidence in the pipeline. For example, having a proper architectural workshops on the networking side and security side is an important piece of it. So being able to do all those things and inspect all those things and get visibility, it gives you better understanding of the quality. So you need both. We need the growth, we need the quality and we are getting better visibility now. That's what I alluded to. Did I make sense?\nFatima Boolani: And, Remo, for you, as I looked at the geographical performance, Americas certainly outperformed. And I recall that EMEA had some leadership transitions within the region and also looking at APJ as the sequential downtick in that theater but hoping to have you walk us through some of the dynamics, the ex-US this quarter. And that's it for me. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Great, thank you, Fatima. EMEA grew 39% year-over-year and the leadership changes that we made in EMEA from my perspective have been outstanding. The growth that we're seeing in EMEA, the traction, it's really from my perspective a great thing to see. APJ grew 56% year-over-year. So APJ has done well. I'll comment on Americas. Americas grew 32% year-over-year, but when you adjusted for the non-recurring one-time revenue last year, Americas grew 40% year-over-year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley.\nMelissa Franchi: I wanted to follow up on the discussion on SD-WAN for you, Jay. So we've seen success with Fortinet selling integrated SD-WAN security appliance in the branch locations. Can you guys both co-exist in the branch and be successful or are you becoming increasingly competitive?\nJay Chaudhry: You know we have done a few deals. We are fortunate SD-WAN device is at least sending traffic to us. So typically when there is a large enterprise that's security savvy, that's what we engage with. We don't see a whole lot of SD Van guys doing security, that's why the example I gave you. But there may be some low end systems where the customer is okay with the good enough security that's built in the SD WAN. But in our enterprise space, we are rarely seeing somebody that says I'm okay with the SD-WAN security. So we end up existing with SD-WAN. So I look at SD WANs as our partners and friends and I - as I commented earlier, in the enterprise space. Three vendors are taking a big lion's share Cisco, VMware and Silver Peak. And if you look at the magic quadrant leadership from Gartner, VMware and Silver Peak are in Gartner's magic quadrant. So I look at them as a complementary friendship. There's always some overlap from time to time, but we work closely with them.\nMelissa Franchi: And then I have a follow-up for Remo. I'm wondering if you could comment on whether you saw any changes in the sales cycles? On one hand, it sounds like you continue to sell more transformational deals, which I think would probably take a little bit longer to close, but on the other hand you've made some changes to sales enablement and refining the sales process. And so how did that shake out in terms of sales cycles this quarter?\nRemo Canessa: Yes, good question. Over time, we expect to see shortening of sales cycles, but currently I'd say they are about the same. It's three to six months for smaller accounts, larger accounts six to 12 months. So really not much change.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Yun Kim with Rosenblatt Securities.\nYun Kim: So going back to Dan's earlier question on large deals. Any specific trends that you're seeing that point to improvement in large deals execution? For instance, for large deals see sales cycle improving or closure rate improving. Just trying to better understand what metrics that you were seeing that cut points to improvement in large deal execution. And real quick, also in terms of sales hiring, are you comfortable with the number of sales folks that you have and the talent that you have today around those large deal opportunities or is this an area that you also need to ramp? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Right. So I'll take that question. So large deals, we dominate the large deals we do very well. Actually one of those things I noticed, in fact you may have noticed, as you saw, as you heard the script, there are a number of deals where ZPA and ZIA is being bought at - in large deals like that. The story - the part of evangelism we had to do early on is becoming less, our leadership is becoming clearly stronger and stronger and the more customers with CIOs and CSOs are moving from one company to the other company and they're calling us. So I believe our execution in large deals is getting good. The other thing that's going to help on our execution in large deals is large deals have complex sales cycle. There are lots of stakeholders and our enablement process is actually helping us do a better job. So I feel more confident in our ability to handle larger deals now. Your related question on reps for large versus small. I think we are hiring across the board, we have quite a few very good sales reps who are handling these large deals. We call them major account managers. But we are trying to add more because there is a big market opportunity and we need to properly cover it.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jay Chaudhry for closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. Thank you for your continued interest in Zscaler. Hope to see you at the upcoming conferences. Goodbye.\nRemo Canessa: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Revenue for the quarter was $101.3 million, up 8% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Recall that last year Q2 '19 revenue was aided by $2.3 million in nonrecurring revenue from a large public sector customer deploying our platform as a private cloud. Excluding this revenue from last year, revenue grew 41% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, for the quarter, Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 40% and the APJ was 9%. Turning to calculated billings which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 18% year-over-year to $135.4 million against a difficult comparison. Recall, we had a large upfront billing of $11 million in Q2 of 2019. From the large public sector customer excluding this deal, our billings grew 30% year-over-year. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue was $609 million on January 31, up 32% from one year ago. The current RPO is 56% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar based net retention rate, which is 116% for the quarter. This compares to 118% a year ago and 120% last quarter. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter to quarter. Our increased success selling bigger deals starting immediately with our Transformation Bundle and faster upsells within a year while good for our business can reduce our dollar based net retention rate which is calculated on a year-over-year ARR basis. Considering these factors, we feel that 116% is very strong. Total gross margin was 82%, up 1 percentage point sequentially and up 2 percentage points year-over-year. We feel that 80% continues to be a good target range in the near term as it is important to continue to invest in our platform to drive top line revenue growth. Turning to operating expenses, total operating expenses decreased 1% sequentially and increased 41% year-over-year to $71.9 million and increased as a percentage of revenue to 71% compared to 67% last year. Sales and marketing increased 1% sequentially and 49% year-over-year to $49.7 million. Please keep in mind that in Q1 2020, we had two Zenith Live user conferences and a global sales kick off that represented $6.5 million in expenses. The year-over-year increase is due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives. R&D was down 4% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year to $14.2 million. The sequential decrease was primarily due to higher capitalization of software development costs as a number of our new products continue to progress towards general availability. On a year-over-year basis, We continue to invest to enhance our product functionality and to innovate new products. G&A decreased 5% sequentially and increased 36% year-over-year to $8.1 million. The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower professional fees and the year-over-year increase is to support our company growth. G&A expenses exclude $16.3 million in litigation related expenses, including the $15 million cash settlement for all Symantec lawsuits. Our second quarter operating margin was 11% which compares to 13% the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $12 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.09. We ended the quarter with $385 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Free cash flow was negative $2 million in the quarter. Excluding the $15 million one-time cash payment to settle all Symantec lawsuits, free cash flow would have been positive $13 million. Now moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, certain litigation related expenses, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $105 million to $107 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 33% to 35%. Operating profit in the range of $1 million to $3 million. We plan to increase our sales investments in Q3. Also, please keep in mind that we spent approximately $2 million on the two midyear sales kick offs in February. Income taxes of $950,000 and earnings per share of approximately $0.01 to $0.03 assuming 139 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $414 million to $417 million or year-over-year growth of 37% to 38%. Calculated billings in the range of $512 million to $217 million or year-over-year growth of 31% to 33%. Operating profit in the range of $16 million to $18 million. In Q4, we expect to host our annual Zenith Live conferences in both EMEA and Americas. We expect the cost of these two events to be in the range of $5 million to $6 million, income taxes of $3.5 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.14 to $0.16, assuming approximately 139 million common shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. We are very pleased with the progress Dali is making, and we are confident he is the right person to drive our sales and go-to-market execution. We are stepping up our sales and marketing investments in order to build the foundation for long-term growth. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. As you model billings, I want to remind you that historically, Q2 and Q4 have been our strongest billing quarters with the sequential declines in Q1 and Q3 quarters respectively. For the year, excluding the $11 million of upfront billings in Q2 of 2019, our updated billings guidance for the fiscal year implies 35% to 37% growth. In terms of free cash flow, please note that we have additional spend for tenant improvements related to our headquarters move. Including the settlement of Symantec lawsuits, these extraordinary items are expected to total approximately $22 million to $25 million in cash payments for the full year. As a result of these payments, we expect our free cash flow margins in fiscal 2020 to be approximately one point lower compared to our operating profit margins. Longer term, we would expect free cash flow margins to be higher than our non-GAAP operating margins. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay. Yes, thank you, Brad. When even with the deal that we had, the duration came down substantially year-over-year. When you take that large deal out, the duration did decrease slightly. I would say that the average duration is right around 12 months and it hasn't really changed that much on a year-over-year or a quarter-over-quarter basis. And related to the questions you had for me. The beat on margin in the quarter was related to the beat on revenue, a higher gross margin and also lower operating expenses and primarily related to head count. On a go-forward basis for the second half, we do expect to step up our go-to-market investments. One of the things we called out or a couple of things to call out was the two SKOs we had in February, and also the two user conferences we're going to have in June. In addition, our expectation and one of the comments we made was that we'd be at a 60% RSM head count growth year-over-year. We expect to be there. So our plan and expectation is to be at 60% RSM head count growth year-over-year. Yes, Alex, it's a great question. When what Dali did in the first half, and as Jay mentioned, he significantly increased the leadership in the sales organization and we put an additional level layered related with RVPs, Regional Vice Presidents. When you look at the number of RVPs, area VPs and GOVPs in place, it's in the 80% range and that's in my opinion, quite remarkable to be at that point. 80% of our expanded target exactly. So the highest probability that you have to hire the right RSMs is to have that leadership in place. So, the concentration in the first half, in particular in Q2, was to get that leadership level in place in the Company. That's what gives me confidence also related to when I look at the quality of people that we're bringing on board, it is a very high quality group of leaders, as well as RSMs. When I look at also the Q2, we had the highest gross hires for RSMs in Q2 over the last two years. Now, our attrition was high also. We called that out on a prior call saying that we expect attrition to be higher in Q2, which it was. We feel that's behind us, and on a go-forward basis we feel attrition is going to decrease and we expect to step up the RSM hires as we go forward. And as I mentioned before, we're very confident and it's our plan to increase at 6% year-over-year. It's a good question. We've talked about with more transformation, part of our ZIA - part of our business customers buy for the entire user base. And so as more transformation that puts pressure on the net retention rate, even though it's good for the Company, this does put pressure. In addition, if customers buy within the year, because the way we calculate net retention rate is the ARR for that sort of customers a year ago versus what that customers have in ARR currently. So as customers buy within the year, that also puts pressure. Also basically the mix between new and upsell. In the quarter, we saw in the mid-range of what we've seen in prior quarters. It's 60% or 50% new in the quarter is basically in the mid-range of that. Prior quarter our net retention rate was 120% and we called out that that was basically 50% new. So it's going to vary and we've talked about, it's a metric you should look at, but it's not one that we put a whole lot of importance to. It was in the mid-range. So it was - in the mid - around 55% was new customers in the quarter and last quarter was 50%. That's correct. From - it's really we've stepped on the gas hiring. So as I mentioned, we have the hires - highest RSM hiring over the last two years last quarter. However, having said that, related to getting this management layer in place, the highest probably success that you have in hiring the right RSMs if you have the right leaders in place. So as we go forward with this leadership on board over a relatively short period, we expect to increase RSM hires as we go forward. No, I think you're right on. Basically with the added RSMs coming on board, again, that adds to our capacity. So it takes about - they're on full quota after 12 months. Not - doesn't mean all of our RSMs are at 100% capacity, but that's when they're full quota. So we do expect basically to be positive impact that in fiscal '21, you're not going to see it that much in fiscal '20 or even very early fiscal '21. But as these RSMs get on board we expect to see increased productivity because of the quality of the people we're bringing on board, because of the enablement that we're doing, because of the leadership, the increased products that we have, the market coming to us, we do expect to increase the sales productivity as they get ramped. Yes, I think you're going to see the bulk of the margin impact this year, then you're going to see better margins we go forward in fiscal '21. Great, thank you, Fatima. EMEA grew 39% year-over-year and the leadership changes that we made in EMEA from my perspective have been outstanding. The growth that we're seeing in EMEA, the traction, it's really from my perspective a great thing to see. APJ grew 56% year-over-year. So APJ has done well. I'll comment on Americas. Americas grew 32% year-over-year, but when you adjusted for the non-recurring one-time revenue last year, Americas grew 40% year-over-year. Yes, good question. Over time, we expect to see shortening of sales cycles, but currently I'd say they are about the same. It's three to six months for smaller accounts, larger accounts six to 12 months. So really not much change. Great, thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and thank you everyone for joining us. We delivered solid Q2 results while making tremendous progress in important areas of our business, particularly with our go-to-market initiatives. In Q2, our revenue grew 36% and billings grew 18% year-over-year, which had a difficult comparison due to a non-recurring private cloud sale to a large public sector customer last year. Adjusting for this, revenue grew 41% and billings grew 30%. During the quarter, we significantly expanded our sales leadership team, refined our territory coverage, revamped our channel program and tooled our sales management systems. It is remarkable how much progress we made on our go-to-market initiatives in a short period of time. Considering these significant undertakings, I am very pleased with our results. We are seeing good momentum in our business and we are increasing our outlook for revenue and billings for the full fiscal year 2020. On profitability, we delivered 11% non-GAAP operating margins and our free cash flow was negative $2 million. Excluding the $15 million one-time cash payment to settle all cemented lawsuits, free cash flow would have been positive $13 million while we delivered strong profitability in the quarter. We are focused on making strategic investments to position Zscaler well for the long term. What excites me the most is seeing our customers leverage a cloud native integrated security platform to accelerate the digital transformation journey. We are empowering them to transform their network and security to fully realize the benefits of cloud and mobility. Let me highlight a few wins in Q2 that showed the many use cases of our platform and what we believe are our sustainable competitive advantages. I will start with a new logo win of a national public transportation provider in Europe that needed to modernize its infrastructure and better engage with its passengers. The scalability and elasticity of a cloud became a critical enabler of their transformation strategy, supporting large-scale data center consolidation, application migration and network changes. Zscaler is the only solution that could meet the requirements to scale from 2 gigabit per second Internet connectivity today to 100 gigabits per second in the future while delivering full SSL inspection and sandboxing for zero trust. We closely partnered with a global system integrator to implement our Transformation Bundle for 45,000 users. This is a great example of the leverage we gained from working with the system integrator partner. That was awarded the overall transformation project. In our large ZIA deals, we continue to see increasing adoption of SaaS and Office 365 as primary drivers. In another new customer win, a Fortune 500 material sciences company purchased our business bundle that includes advanced threat protection, SSL inspection and bandwidth control for 57,000 users. With a Strategy the legacy on-premise security gateway became irrelevant. We provided protection across over 100 locations and for mobile users, improving the security posture and delivering elasticity that's expected of a cloud service. Now, let me give an example of an upsell deal. A Fortune 100 healthcare company that started a large paid pilot of our Transformation Bundle Plus DLP for 10,000 users just nine months ago purchased additional seats along with our newly released CASB to cover all 65,000 employees. With 120 SaaS and cloud apps already in use, their existing appliance-centric security approach was failing, even with 40 large security appliances in their two primary data centers. With the upcoming Office 365 deployment, which often doubles Internet bound traffic, this customer is implementing local breakout with SD WAN secured by Zscaler across 450 locations. Notably, this was our first CASB win as the customer wanted an integrated solution CASB that is integrated with ZIA and that brings together both outdoor band and in-line CASB capabilities. For the first phase of adopting a zero trust network access strategy across the Company, they bought ZPA for 2,500 users to help integrate a recently acquired company and provide secure access to AWS for their developers. I'm delighted to share our continued momentum with ZPA which remains our fastest growing product line. There is a growing customer interest in zero trust network approach to offer access to applications without granting access to the corporate network. As an early pioneer, ZPA is a mature rich offering that is deployed in hundreds of enterprises. Let me highlight a few additional ZPA events in the quarter. Two years ago, a global 10 multinational oil and gas customer bought our ZIA Transformation Bundle for 145,000 employees. After ZIA delivered excellent user experience while handling a 200% growth in their Internet traffic over 2 years, the customer purchased ZPA for over 100,000 users to replace its legacy VPN and to secure access to applications in the public cloud. ZPA represents the next step in this customers' IT transformation journey towards the cloud first strategy. To improve security, ZPA will connect users to applications not the network. This would not be possible with legacy VPN or firewall solutions. Since starting with Zscaler 4 years ago with professional Bundle, this customer has increased their total annual spend with Zscaler by over 700% I'm thrilled that more customers are purchasing ZIA and ZPA together to leverage a single platform for secured cloud transformation. A multinational industrial company purchased ZIA business bundle and Cloud Firewall for 60,000 users and ZPA for 40,000 users. The move to Zscaler was driven by one, to pursue local breakout from three data centers to 750 locations globally as their Office 365 rollout overwhelmed their existing security infrastructure. Two, to execute faster M&A and divestitures. Zscaler is the only solution that could meet all the requirements and deliver an excellent user experience. Due to ZPA's zero trust network access architecture, our ability to support M&A and divestitures is unique and was instrumental to winning this deal. The customer is leveraging Zscaler to provide secure, fast and reliable access for any user from any location on any device at a lower cost of ownership and with greater operational simplicity. Lastly, I will share another combined ZIA and ZPA win. A Fortune 500 medical testing company with the strategic objective of expanding the business in cloud-based data analytics needed to transform the network and security for greater agility and IT simplification. This customer purchased the ZIA business bundle and Cloud Firewall for 25,000 users to secure local Internet breakouts with SD WAN for 3,600 locations. While the incumbent firewall vendor offers an integrated SD-WAN solution, the customer chose a light branch architecture with Zscaler providing all security in the cloud as advocated by Gartner's SASE model. In the first phase of adopting a zero trust network access strategy across the company, the customer also purchased ZPA for 8,000 users to replace the legacy VPN, remote access. As these do show, a cloud first world requires a cloud native architecture. Unlike the traditional security appliances are born in the cloud security platform can scale, remember Zscaler stands for Zenith off scalability. You've seen the legacy network security vendors trying to recast themselves as cloud security providers. The single-tenant architecture is not designed for the cloud. As I have said before, you can't create a Netflix service by stacking thousands of DVD players in the cloud. You can't offer an in-line, high-performance security cloud by spinning up a bunch of virtual machines in a public cloud. As you may know, Gartner published two groundbreaking research reports to respond to customers' needs for better advice for security and network transformation. First, the future of network security is in the cloud, which defines the new approach named Secure Access Service Edge or SASE that strongly validates Zscaler's platform and vision. Gartner predicts that most organizations will move their network security to a SASE model. Many vendors are claiming that they are SASE, but we believe Zscaler most comprehensively meets the core architectural principles of SASE including cloud EDGE architectural light branch design proxy technology and cloud native multi-tenant architecture. We are SASE since 2008. The second Gartner report defines zero trust network access or ZTNA architecture which advocates that network security can no longer be done in a perimeter-less world. Hence, users should not be connected to the network but only to specific applications. This architecture renders traditional network security products like firewalls irrelevant. We believe ZPA is the best implementation of ZTNA and we are well positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market opportunity. We have over a 10-year lead on operating a cloud platform at scale processing over 85 billion transactions per day and providing an unprecedented network effect for better security for our customers. Let me update you on the status of the new products that we believe will keep us well ahead of the competition. As we discussed previously, we have 4 new product offerings that will be generally available in early fiscal Q4. Zscaler B2B and Zscaler digital experience or ZDX are two new product lines that are getting great initial feedback from our beta customers. We believe that these product lines will significantly expand our already large market opportunity. We are engaged with several dozen customers for our CASB offering and we have closed a few deals already. With the outdoor band CASB combined with our existing in line CASB capabilities, we now offer a complete CASB solution. But browser isolation offering is already being tested by a dozen customers. It is important to point out that these new products are fully integrated with the Zscaler platform, which provides a common set of services such as user authentication, central logging, single policy engine making Zscaler a compelling and powerful platform for security transformation and vendor consolidation. We believe these new products will add to our growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Let's now turn to our go-to-market. As I stated during the last earnings call, we are focused on improving our sales execution to take Zscaler beyond a $1 billion in annual revenue. I couldn't be happier having Dali on board, leading our go-to-market organization. I'm excited about the key initiatives that Dali and our sales leadership are putting in place to position us well for our long-term growth. The progress we are making in a short period of time is quite remarkable, and in many ways ahead of my expectations. We accelerated the majority of our initiatives within the last quarter as we rolled out a refined, repeatable and scalable sales process. Let me highlight the key initiatives. We implemented our new sales enablement program. This program is having a great impact on the consistency and quality of execution across the entire sales organization. We expect this to enable our new hires to ramp faster with quality activity out of the gate. We implemented new AI based tools and systems to provide visibility into leading indicators such as sales activities and key go-to-market metrics. We expanded and deepened our sales leadership structure, positioning us to scale our sales organization going forward. This included internal promotions to front line leadership roles. We rolled out the new sales leadership training program and trained all of our sales leaders in the past 90 days. Among other things, this training includes how to attract and hire the right talent. We continue to aggressively hire in sales and plan to increase our sales rep headcount by 60% by the end of this fiscal year, compared to prior year. I'm impressed with the quality of candidates we are attracting and hiring to drive top-down transformational sales. We evaluated and defined territory coverage that we believe will lead to higher volume and quality of customer engagements. To drive home these initiatives, we held two midyear sales kick offs earlier this month, one in Europe and one in the US to bring the global sales organization together for training and team building. While it will take time to realize the full benefits of these changes, I'm excited to share that we are starting to see promising leading indicators. Customer engagements are up significantly, both in new business meetings and existing customer interactions with more high impact CXO meetings. And with the introduction of a weekly pipeline generation day, the quality and volume of our pipeline is growing. To complement our comprehensive platform, we have been integrating our solution with technology leaders and creating go-to-market leverage with deeper field engagements with their sales organizations. For example, after recently completing the integration of the Zscaler platform with CrowdStrike, we are starting to see new opportunities with Global 2000 customers. Our field teams are partnering to sell to new customers and to our respective customer basis. Our Microsoft partnership is growing stronger and creating more tailwinds with the adoption of Office 365, Azure public cloud, Azure AD and Azure Sentinel. We are training Microsoft security professionals and architects on our integrated solution. Zscaler was also recently recognized as Microsoft Security 2020 Partner Award finalist nominated in two categories, ISV Partner of the Year and customer impact and we are working closely with both VMware and Silver Peak to secure the SD band deployments. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you, Remo. In closing, let me state four key points that make me excited. One, architecture matters for a cloud security platform that must sit in line to inspect all traffic for policy enforcement. We believe we're the best architecture with over 10 years of operational experience to run a massive cloud, which is an enormous barrier to entry. Two, with multiple tailwinds such as Office 365, SaaS adoption, SD WAN and app migration to public clouds, we believe the market is coming to us. Three, we are in early innings of the cloud journey. We're disrupting a $20 billion TAM with ZI and ZPA. With recently announced Zscaler B2B and ZDX we believe we will expand our addressable market significantly. Four, with expanded go-to-market leadership in place, we are building a sales machine that can deliver world-class execution and sustainable long-term growth. We thank you for your interest in Zscaler and look forward to reporting our progress in the future. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. As we have said before, we brought Dali on board, we knew we needed to do a number of things to further scale our business to a larger level. And some of the main things we have already addressed are enablement our sales teams. We had a small enablement team, we've grown it. We have proper training programs, refined the sales process to make it scalable. We've put a number of systems in place that give visibility to not only headquarters, but also front line leaders and we have significantly expanded the sales leadership in the field and created an extra layer that's needed for scaling. So a lot of those things are behind us and done and we brought the entire sales organization together in 2 places for a mid-year SKO, sales kickoff Americas and EMEA to really bring it all together. So those are the things that are accomplished. Now, the second question is about confidence. Obviously, we look for what some of the impacts are, what's giving us confidence to give you the projection that we've done for the second half. There are couple of main things that fall in that area. Number one is we are able to measure our sales engagement, engagement with our customers, engagement of new business. And the tools we've put in place and the leadership we're driving, we are seeing a far better engagement than we used to have. And the second, even more important is pipeline generation because that's a good indicator. The volume of pipeline and the quality of pipeline is all going up. So looking at the pipelines, looking at the engagements, that's what's reflected in our visibility and confidence for the second half of the business. First of all, regarding the SD WAN landscape, I'll share with you based on my field engagements. I'm out there meeting lots and lots of customers. They're largely free vendor as we see it. Most of the enterprise deals it's VMware Velocloud, it's Cisco Viptela and Silver Peak. In all those deals, we are the preferred security choice. They don't try to build security in the branch box, so to speak. Yes, there are a couple vendors who are trying to build security in the box. If you look at Gartner's SASE paper and if you talk to security experts in general, they don't believe security can be built in a branch box, security needs to be done at the cloud. So perhaps there is some opportunity for some of these vendors in the mid-market where security is not viewed as very critical, but when you come to securities heavy companies, which is generally larger enterprises, we don't really see a change in it. In fact we have seen better engagement with some of the larger partners like VMware and Silver Peak. I'll start and Remo you can add more color to it. As a part of our plan, one of the things we needed to do in this company was to expand our sales leadership at the front line. So that's the first priority we did to expand because we knew that if we hired the right leaders in the field, they can actually hire a number of - a good number of sales reps. So we accelerated sales leadership hiring and actually are ahead of what I thought it would be. Knowing that the priority, so yes, today we are behind on the sales plan where we wanted to be, but knowing that the leaders are in place, knowing that they have been trained on actually hiring and training, we are pretty confident that we will get to our 60% hiring numbers. So that was one part of the question. And a lot of enablement we are doing in the systems we are putting in place is to make sure there's better visibility and more effective engagement with the customers for a better ramp up. So things are being done to provide faster ramp and have better productivity over time. Remo, you want to add to it? So 80% of our expanded target. I'll add one more point. As we are hiring these new reps, we're seeing that in the first quarter they're having better sales engagements, because we are measuring those engagements and some of the enablement and some of the tools we have put in place is helping us. So I feel very, very happy about it. Haven't really seen much impact on the competition side. In fact, our churn is down year-over-year. Our discount is pretty sable. Our average ARR of customers with greater than 3,000 users, which we track is approaching 400-K. And as you know, we help customers drive transformation. We drive agility, zero trust access, and once they understand what we do we rarely lose. So I don't worry about competition, I do want to stay focused on our sales execution. I think as we improve it, we're going to see better and better results. We have seen some of the press releases they've done but we hardly see them in the gateway area where they seem to be trying to go. They are in the CASB side of it. We've seen them on the CASB side of it. But with our strong integrated platform where we are offering a full CASB that consolidates, that integrates in line and out of band, we are in a very strong position. So we don't really see them out there in the market, especially in the market area, where we compete in. Or if I may add, yes, we have the largest hire for sales rep In Q2. We expect higher number of hiring in Q3 and Q4 because we have a strong field sales leadership in place. So we have seen a lot of additional interest from large enterprises. As you know, Blue Coat has been in enterprise market. They used to have a big presence, the presence was largely in the appliance space. So yes, a lot of interest and it is helping us. It's a good opportunity for us and we plan to take full advantage of it. Yes, so first of all the GA date of those two products, hasn't really pushed out. We have just told before that we will be doing beta testing and will be ready in the Q4 timeframe. So we are actually pretty much on plan. What we have done, what we can report to you is the field engagement or the customer engagement of those two products. As you know, they not just product features their product lines per se. So, early beta engagement for B2B are very good, that's the new market actually. If you think about who leads Z's B2B market, nobody really does it, with the ZPA based architecture and zero trust it's an ideal opportunity for us. So we've seen tremendous interest from our customer base that's going to be starting. But there'll be some demand creation because people don't even know that this kind of thing exists out there. When it comes to ZDX zero - I'm sorry Zscaler digital experience, there is tons of interest and demand from the customers because none of the tools that are designed for user experience in the old world work in the new world. We got some very good beta customers going on and in Q4 we plan to start selling both of those products. So we - with a fairly good sell cycle in large enterprises, we don't expect a whole lot of contribution in Q4, but we expect it to help us in fiscal '21 and beyond. I think if you look at ZPA, it was the first major product line introduction, right. In ZIA we had many modules we launched. Module to me is a firewall, it's not a product line. Module to me is a cloud sandbox. So, we have done quite well. We are pleased with how ZPA has come from nothing to a pretty significant contributing factor. For these products, we do have an incubation program. So rather than putting an overlay full sales team in place, we got an incubation team that's actually working with the early stage customers to learn the sales process and buyers and all those things so we could do proper training and the like for customers. So we have some good plans in place. We are comfortable and also we alluded to the fact that our sales process is meant for portfolio selling complex sales. So I think we'll be able to handle these product lines in our proper sales process. So just to clarify, the deals that we have been closing versus how we are closing? I just want to clarify. Right. I think the biggest thing we've done if you look at the sales process, we figured out the sales process several years ago that it can be pushed through VARs. It has to be transformational C level involvement and the like. So the reason we have seen this growth in the past several years is because we have been doing the right process. What we did not have is a proper discipline and structure and enablement to take it a large scale level. I had two people in my sales enablement team and I was waiting for new CRO to come and to put that in place, now we've got over 15 people in place in the sales development. So while we knew the process and the right thing and we have further refined it, we have further enhanced it to make it repeatable, but the biggest thing we have done spent time to really make sure our people are enabled properly. That's one biggest thing, which also includes a proper inspection, proper qualifiers, we use something called [indiscernible]. So there is some better selling methodology behind it, proper questions, proper qualifications, and the like, and along with that the tools we have put in place, which gives us visibility. We are measuring many things from engagement level, architectural workshop levels. So they are giving us far better visibility in the quality of the pipeline, which helps us do better forecasting. So those aren't the things that are needed to scale our business and that's what we have been doing and very pleased with the progress and that's what Dali has brought to the table. Yes, the biggest part of quality we look at is - has been inspect. We are looking for certain attributes. For example, being able to understand all the stakeholders that are involved, being able to make sure engagements are happening. So there are several steps involved that help us give more confidence in the pipeline. For example, having a proper architectural workshops on the networking side and security side is an important piece of it. So being able to do all those things and inspect all those things and get visibility, it gives you better understanding of the quality. So you need both. We need the growth, we need the quality and we are getting better visibility now. That's what I alluded to. Did I make sense? You know we have done a few deals. We are fortunate SD-WAN device is at least sending traffic to us. So typically when there is a large enterprise that's security savvy, that's what we engage with. We don't see a whole lot of SD Van guys doing security, that's why the example I gave you. But there may be some low end systems where the customer is okay with the good enough security that's built in the SD WAN. But in our enterprise space, we are rarely seeing somebody that says I'm okay with the SD-WAN security. So we end up existing with SD-WAN. So I look at SD WANs as our partners and friends and I - as I commented earlier, in the enterprise space. Three vendors are taking a big lion's share Cisco, VMware and Silver Peak. And if you look at the magic quadrant leadership from Gartner, VMware and Silver Peak are in Gartner's magic quadrant. So I look at them as a complementary friendship. There's always some overlap from time to time, but we work closely with them. Right. So I'll take that question. So large deals, we dominate the large deals we do very well. Actually one of those things I noticed, in fact you may have noticed, as you saw, as you heard the script, there are a number of deals where ZPA and ZIA is being bought at - in large deals like that. The story - the part of evangelism we had to do early on is becoming less, our leadership is becoming clearly stronger and stronger and the more customers with CIOs and CSOs are moving from one company to the other company and they're calling us. So I believe our execution in large deals is getting good. The other thing that's going to help on our execution in large deals is large deals have complex sales cycle. There are lots of stakeholders and our enablement process is actually helping us do a better job. So I feel more confident in our ability to handle larger deals now. Your related question on reps for large versus small. I think we are hiring across the board, we have quite a few very good sales reps who are handling these large deals. We call them major account managers. But we are trying to add more because there is a big market opportunity and we need to properly cover it. Thank you. Thank you for your continued interest in Zscaler. Hope to see you at the upcoming conferences. Goodbye."

We reported solid Q1 results delivering strong revenue and operating profit growth in the first quarter with positive free cash flow, while making strategic investments to scale our go-to-market machine to the next level. Our revenue grew 48% and billings grew 37% year-over-year in Q1, and we are increasing our outlook for revenue and billings for the full fiscal year 2020. Adoption of the ZIA Transformation Bundle continues to grow and ZPA remains our fastest growing product. I'm thrilled that more customers are using ZIA and ZPA together, which provides a single platform for secured cloud transformation that we believe no other vendor can match. As you know, Dali Rajic joined this September as our President Go-To-Market and Chief Revenue Officer. I'm excited about the key initiatives our sales leadership is putting in place to position us well for the long term. At our recent Zenith Live Cloud Summit, I was pleased to hear CIOs, CTOs, and CSOs of Global 2000 Enterprises sharing with pride their cloud transformation journeys enabled by Zscaler that delivered lower costs, improved security, and provided fast and reliable user experience. I'm very proud that Gartner recently recognized Zscaler as a leader in the Secure Web Gateway Magic Quadrant for the ninth year in a row. More importantly, Zscaler is positioned the highest for both execution and vision, significantly separating us from the competition. We pioneered the cloud native, integrated security platform and our cloud service is trusted by over 3,900 customers, including over 400 of the Forbes Global 2000 to access applications no matter where they live. The Zscaler cloud processes over 80 billion transactions per day, which is over ten times the number of Google searches per day. This provides an unprecedented network effect, which allows us to deliver superior security to our customers. We are aggressively investing in our business to pursue a massive opportunity to disrupt traditional network security which mostly relies on legacy security appliances. Let me now highlight a few wins in Q1 that showcase what we believe are our sustainable competitive advantages. I will start with an upsell that highlights the scalability and elasticity of our cloud. This Fortune 100 customer purchased our professional Bundle for all 40,000 employees three years ago. In Q1, they tripled that annual business with us by upgrading to Business Bundle, adding additional users, and purchasing protection for server traffic going from the datacenter to the public cloud. They deployed local Internet breakouts at over 1,000 locations during their cloud journey, including rolling out Office 365. Their Internet traffic increased exponentially reaching 1.2 petabytes per month, which is equal to 10 billion photos in Facebook, and their IT leaders praised the elasticity of the Zscaler cloud when a companywide video conference call by the CEO went flawlessly even though the network traffic doubled during the event. How would a single tenant security cloud possibly handles this. Now, I will share a new logo win of a Fortune 100 customer that needed to up level their security. Unlike most large enterprises, they had no proxy gateways and instead relied upon next-gen firewalls for the user traffic to the Internet. No wonder they had a high-risk posture. They purchased ZIA transformation bundle for all 14,000 employees. With Zscaler, they can detect and prevent advanced threats and zero-day attacks which are increasingly found in encrypted traffic. This results in better security. Next, I will highlight the win that illustrates benefits of our Edge cloud capabilities and enabled faster M&A integration. A top global healthcare company that bought our Business Bundle and cloud firewall for 30,000 employees 18 months ago purchased an additional 30,000 seats to integrate a recent acquisition. The two companies have a combined global presence with hundreds of locations across 70 countries. Each company had embarked on a network transformation journey for local Internet breakouts but with two very different approaches to security. The acquired company was a next-gen firewall shop which scores offline walls deployed in branch offices giving a false sense of security, as 95% of the web traffic is encrypted and was not being inspected. To integrate the two companies, they standardized on Zscaler, implemented SSL inspection, and are ripping out all the branch firewalls. The result, significant savings and a big improvement in their security posture. Next, I'd like to share considerable momentum we are building in the U.S. Federal market. Last year, ZIA and ZPA received FedRAMP certification at the moderate level, and last month ZPA reached FedRAMP readiness at the high impact level which puts Zscaler in an elite group of technology companies. ZIA is the only FedRAMP certified secure cloud Internet gateway today. ZPA is the first and only cloud security service that has received FedRAMP certification for zero trust remote access. This positions us very well in this large market. In Q1, we won two deals with civilian agencies, each with an annual contract value greater than $0.5 million. The first win is with a large strategic agency with an initial order for ZIA and ZPA for 15,000 mobile users to deliver secure access to applications with zero trust network access. The second agency purchased the complete ZIA and ZPA platform for all 6,800 employees to enable cloud transformation to secure SD-WAN deployment for local breakouts and to provide direct access to any application from anywhere. Turning to Japan, we entered this large market only two years ago, but have been gaining great traction. In Q1, one-off Japan's largest transportation companies purchased our ZIA Business Bundle and cloud sandbox for all 30,000 employees to secure local breakouts and increased security for all users. Non proxy technologies such as next-gen firewalls were not considered since comprehensive security was important. A common theme, all these wins, is that a cloud-first world requires a cloud-native architecture. In a recent groundbreaking research note, Gartner defined a new product category named Secure Access Service Edge or as SASE pronounced SASE. Gartner predicts that the future of network security is in the cloud, and most organizations will move their network security to a SASE model.  Importantly Gartner recommends reducing the complexity of network security by moving to one vendor for Secure Web Gateway, CASB, DNS, zero trust network access and remote browser isolation capabilities. This is Zscaler. We strongly believe this validates our vision when we founded Zscaler over 10 years ago. Here are the core architectural principles Gartner has outlined for SASE. Number one SASE demands that the security providers offer security at the cloud EDGE close to the user for good user experience. Zscaler provides in line security at the cloud EDGE in more than 150 data centers around the world. In contrast, legacy security vendors claiming to offer a SASE service are spinning up virtual machines on public clouds the traffic backhauled to centralized compute that is not security at the edge. That is not SASE.  Number two, SASE recommends that a branch office should have a light footprint which simply an SD-WAN router and all security services in the cloud. While the Zscaler cloud is light branch architecture the legacy firewall vendors are peddling heavy branch Appliances again that is not SASE. Number three, Gartner specifically said, many of these SASE capabilities will use a proxy model, because our proxy is required to inspect encrypted traffic. Zscaler meet this requirement while next-gen firewalls don't hence next-gen firewalls or not SASE. Number four lastly; SASE advocates a cloud native multi-tenant architecture which is the foundation of Zscaler cloud platform. You can take legacy single tenant security appliances and stick them in the cloud as virtual machines and call it cloud security that would be like placing thousands of DVD players in a public cloud and calling it a Netflix streaming service. In summary Zscaler was designed for the SASE world that Gartner has spelled out. Some of you have asked questions about competition from next-gen firewall vendors. Over the last 10 years we have faced various competitors starting with large legacy secured web gateway vendors who claim to offer a cloud security service. Where they are today as security must move the cloud, legacy firewall vendors are now making similar noise. Next-gen firewalls are designed to build a moat around the castle, to secure the network and the data center. They are the wrong architecture for security users. The next question is why they can't build a platform like Zscaler, well the answer lies in the architecture. Architecture is like the foundation of a building you can't change the foundation unless you start all over which is hard and takes a long time. We know that start-ups like Salesforce and Workday competed and won against much larger on premise incumbent vendors, because of their cloud native architecture. We believe we are doing the same in the network security space. Let me talk about our product. I will highlight a few innovations data expanding our platform. Zscaler B2B and Zscaler digital experience or DDX. The two major product lines we announced at Zenith Live are getting great initial feedback from our customers. The outdoor band CASB that we announced at Zenith Live is receiving very good early reception combined with our existing in line CASB capabilities. We will now offer a complete CASB solution. The integration of browser isolation technology, we acquired through Appsulate is ahead of plan and is already being tested by customers. Building upon the TrustPath acquisition we did last year. We have significantly enhanced our threat detection capabilities with machine learning and AI. Moving on to tech partnerships to complement our comprehensive platform we believe in partnering with tech leaders. This provides an integrated solution for customers and creates go to market leverage for Zscaler. For example, we have a deep and wide partnership with Microsoft Office 365 and Azure public cloud. Microsoft names Zscaler the first and only cloud security provider to be a certified partner in the Microsoft Networking Partner Program or NPP for Office 365, which has stringent requirements for user performance. Microsoft only recommends NPP partners for Office 365 connectivity. We are working closely with both VMware and Silver Peak the only two leaders in Gartner's recently published SD-WAN Magic Quadrant. Let's now turn to our go-to-market. Zscaler is the enabler of cloud transformation. As a result we have a different top-down sales process and go-to-market strategy than legacy vendors. As I stated during the last earnings call, we are focused on improving our sales execution to take Zscaler beyond $1 billion in revenue. That is why I'm excited to have Dali on board as he is to building a highly scalable go-to-market machine. He has already driven rapid and tangible progress building a multi-dimensional go-to market model, putting us into a great position to scale. Let me give you a few examples; we implemented a more refined metrics based model of accountability and transparency giving us better visibility into how our business is run. We are ahead of our plan to build a new sales process and enablement program that will deliver consistent and high level execution in the field, it is already having a meaningful impact in our day-to-day execution, and we continue to mature our sales leadership structure. With all that we have implemented in a very short time. I'm very pleased with our progress and confident that we are building a solid foundation for a highly scalable sales machine for our long-term growth. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Revenue for the quarter was $93.6 million, up 9% sequentially and 48% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, for the quarter Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 41% and APJ was 8%. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus, total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 37% year-over-year to $88.3 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue was $555 million on October 31st, up 35% from $411 million one year ago. Our strong customer retention and ability upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar based net retention rate, which is 120% for the quarter ended October 31st. This compares to 118% a year ago and last quarter. Our increased success selling bigger deals starting immediately with our Transformation bundle and faster upsell within a year while good for our business can reduce our dollar based net retention rate which is calculated on a year-over-year ARR basis. Considering these factors we feel 120% is outstanding and it will vary quarter-to-quarter. We are pleased with the continued adoption of our comprehensive cloud platform by our customers as they increasingly rely on us for their transformation journey, in fact, two-thirds of our top 25 customers were also customers two years ago in the cumulative ARR has more than doubled over this period. Total gross margin was 81% flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. We feel that 80% continues to be a good target range in the near term as it is important to continue to invest in our platform to drive top line revenue growth. Turning to operating expenses, our total operating expenses increased 17% sequentially and increased 44% year-over-year at $72.7 million the decreased as a percentage of revenue, 78% compared to 80% last year. Sales and marketing increased 20% sequentially and 46% year-over-year to $49.4 million. The year-over-year increase is due to higher compensation expenses and the cost of three major marketing events, Zenith Live Americas, Zenith Live Europe and our sales kickoff. R&D was up 12% sequentially and 44% year-over-year to $14.8 million as we continue to invest to enhance our product functionality and innovate new products. G&A increased 6% sequentially and increased 32% year-over-year to $8.5 million. The year-over-year growth in G&A includes investments in building our team these expenses exclude $2 million in litigation related expenses. Our first quarter operating margin was 3%, which compares to 2% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $4.1 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.03. We ended the quarter with $378 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $9.4 million in the quarter compared to positive $5.2 million for the same quarter a year ago. Our ESPP program increased our free cash flow by approximately $3 million in the quarter same as a year ago. The ESPP program does not impact overall the cash balance. Now moving on to guidance as a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain litigation related expenses and any associated tax effects. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $97 million to $100 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 31% to 35% for the year-ago comparison recall the Q2, 2019 revenue was aided by $2.3 million in nonrecurring revenue from a large public sector customer deploying our platform as a private cloud. Excluding this revenue from last year guidance reflects 35% to 39% growth. Operating profit in the range of $3 million to $4 million; income taxes of $900,000 and earnings per share of approximately $0.03 assuming 138 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $405 million to $413 million or year-over-year growth of 34% to 36%. Calculated billings in the range of $500 million to $510 million or year-over-year growth of 28% to 31%. Operating profit in the range of $15 million to $18 million. In Q4, we expect to host our annual Zenith Live Events in both EMEA and Americas. We expect the cost of these two events to be in the range of $5 million to $6 million, income taxes of $3.6 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.15 assuming approximately 139 million common shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. We are pleased with the progress our CRO is making and we are confident, he is the right person to drive our sales and go-to-market execution. We are stepping up sales and marketing investments in order to build the foundation for long-term growth. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. As you model billings, I want to remind you that historically, Q2 and Q4 have been our strongest billing quarters with sequential declines in Q1 and Q3 quarters respectively. With our outperformance in Q1 billings we now expect first half billings to be approximately 43% of full year billings compared to our prior expectations of 42% to 43%. Also, please keep in mind that we had a large upfront billing of $1 million in Q2 of 2019 from a large public sector customer deploying our platform as a private cloud which will pose a tough year-over-year comparison in Q2. Excluding this deal our billings guidance for the full year implies 32% to 35% growth. In terms of free cash flow, please note that we'll have additional spend for tenant improvements related to our headquarters' move in January as well as ongoing cash outlays for lease payments on our existing San Jose buildings and litigation expenses related to our ongoing Symantec lawsuit. These extraordinary items are expected to be approximately $15 million to $20 million in cash payments for the full year. As a result of these payments, we expect our free cash flow margins in fiscal 2020 to be zero to two points lower compared to our operating profit margins. Longer term, we expect our free cash flow margins to be higher than our non-GAAP operating margins. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Remo. In closing, let me state four key points that make me excited. Number one architecture matters, especially for a cloud security platform that must set in line to inspect all traffic for policy enforcement. We believe we have the best architecture with 10 years of operational experience to run a massive cloud and enormous barrier to entry. Number two, with multiple tailwinds such as Office 365 SaaS adoption, SD-WAN and app migration to public clouds, we believe the market is coming to us. Number three, we are in early innings of the cloud journey we're disrupting a $20 billion TAM with ZIA and ZPA. In addition, we recently announced these got our B2B and ZDX, which we believe will expand our TAM significantly. Number four with new go-to-market leadership on board, we are building a sales machine that can deliver world-class execution and sustainable long-term growth. We thank you for your interest in Zscaler and look forward to reporting on our progress in the future. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first will come from Alex Henderson with Needham.\nAlexHenderson: All right. Thank you very much. I was hoping to ask a question around the new sales head, the Chief Revenue Officer, to what extent he's become -- come in and been effective, how long do you think it takes for his programs to be fully ramped and to get to the maximum benefit? Is that a three to four quarter process of reacceleration? And then the second piece of it, if I could, lot of questions coming at me from clients about the competition from the next-gen firewall players. It seems to me that has not been a factor, but can you talk about whether that's shown up in terms of pricing pressure or any other notable metric other than lost deals, but maybe some other element to the mix that may have pressured things? Thanks. \nJayChaudhry: Yes, Alex. Thank you. This is Jay. Regarding your question about our go-to-market, our CRO. As you know, we have done very well so far bill-to-business to hundreds of millions of dollars. Now, our goal is to take it to $1 billion and plus which means scaling our sales execution. Tony actually is the right guy who is driving a number of these things. Let me give you a perspective of what all he's driving. So, for execution at scale, I will give you three examples. One, when you have scores of salespeople, it's one thing; when you have hundreds of salespeople, you need far better sales enablement, far better training. For us, we used to have a small sales enablement team. Dali has come in and built a pretty sizable team, and the team has already rolling out some of the training programs. Number two; to really scale your business, you need a very consistent and repeatable sales process that may be more refined. And Dali has come in and taken our process and further refined and it's being rolled out to the whole field. Number three, while we had tools and systems in place to scale to the next level and to have better accountability, better visibility to give us better leading indicator in sales activities, he and the leadership team have started work on many areas. So, a lot of these things are already making a difference, and we're seeing it. And I think as each quarter goes by, we will see more and more impact of the work being done by Dali and his team. Remo, you want to add anything?\nRemoCanessa: Yes, couple add-ons to that also. I mean our plan is still to be at a 20% plus operating margin once we hit $800 million to $1 billion in revenue. Related to pricing pressure, our discounts are lower this quarter. Our average prices per user are higher. When I take a look at our ARR for customers with greater than 3,000 users, it is higher this quarter. It's in the high 300,000 range and our churn is down. \nJayChaudhry: Alex, regarding your second question about competition from firewall vendors, you know somehow discussion keeps on coming, I tried to address it during my statements, but fundamentally if you look at the large enterprises; to protect users, they almost always look for a proxy architecture. You guys deal with large banks. If you talk to top 20 banks and ask anyone, would you just depend upon on next-gen firewall for user protection, I haven't found a yes answer from a single bank so far. Now, it's probably true. There used to be some of that is happening on the lower end where the customer is less security savvy, and they are able to go with some of that solution happening. So, probably on the SD-WAN side, some of that is happening in the lower end. But where our primary focus is, we don't really think any of the impact from the firewall vendors making noise has happened and impacted us. So far, I think it's the architecture that we got much better that's giving us an edge, and I think it's a long-term edge. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Bartus with Bank of America. \nDanielBartus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions guys. First for Jay maybe, no mention of the longer sales cycle order. So, can you just walk us through the changes you're seeing versus last quarter when you called that out, and then I've got a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nJayChaudhry: Yes. Changes in terms of the sales cycle and all haven't really changed a whole lot for us. I think what we are doing is tightening our sales process and tightening our execution. We aren't really seeing much market impact in terms of slowdown of any of the stuff with better leadership and some of the things I outlined, I think it's focused execution is what we are doing, and we are beginning to see it's making a difference for us. And I think it'll help us in the long run because we're building a stronger infrastructure to scale our sales. \nDanielBartus: Great, makes sense. And then, Remo, quick, good to hear the new products are getting good reception. I'm curious if you have any ZDX or Z B2B in your fiscal 2020 expectations, and what's the potential for these new products to ramp and maybe drive some upside this year? Thanks.\nRemoCanessa: Yes. So, no, there's nothing we're planning for, and you shouldn't plan for anything either. We're planning to get these products out in the second calendar quarter of 2020. There's potential for the products as Jay mentioned with the CASB out of band browser isolation user experience in the B2B. We feel that there's a pretty significant upside for us with these types of products but nothing for this fiscal 2020 should be accounted for.\nJayChaudhry: Yes. If I may add, we are engaged with customers as you would expect in beta stages during evaluation and testing. Our interest is real. I mean just to clarify what we announced was two big product lines, Zscaler B2B and Zscaler Digital Experience. And then we also announced two, what I would call features, out-of-band CASB, CASB as a feature and browser isolation is another feature that's relevant for both ZI and ZPA. Early indications are very positive. These products become generally available in calendar Q2.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Patrick Colville with Arete Research. \nPatrickColville: Thanks taking my question. Can we just talk about the CASB product because -- I mean, that's something that from speaking to your customers, there's a lot of interest in CASB right now and some have said that these scale will be a natural insertion point into that CASB debate above and beyond your current partnerships right now with I think with Microsoft and McAfee. So just it's good to better understand that product, if possible, please?\nJayChaudhry: Yes. So for a long time we have had what we call in-line CASB, if all traffic goes through us, we have to do CASB which includes threat detection and protection DLP and alike. And for Autoban, we dependent upon two partnerships. You mentioned McAfee and Microsoft. Our customers kept on telling us that it's small add-on we should be doing it. So we took them seriously, we built it. So we become a single provider. So it's a natural feature for us to add-on and we're seeing lots of traction. We will continue our partnership with Microsoft and Sky High McAfee in this area. If customers want something like that they have it, but we believe a large number of our customers will take Zscaler and if there is another CASB solution I think we will end up displacing it. \nPatrickColville: Great. And can I just ask a quick follow-up on the dollar-based net retention rate. So the 120% is extremely impressive, no doubt, and especially given it's a sequential and annual increase, but it does imply that revenue from new customers would have tailed off, both sequentially and annually. So do you mind just help me understand if that's correct. The revenue contribution became increasingly skewed to existing customers? Or if there are any metrics you can share to help me better understand new customer revenue and customer count Great.\nRemoCanessa: Yes. That's a good question. So typically we range with 2 versus up sell 60% to 40% new versus upsell and also 50 to 50. In Q1, the mix was closer to 50% to 60%. What's important to recognize we don't really distinguish internally the difference between new and upsell when we track it? But we incentivize our sales organization both for new and up sell. When you take a look at the installed base that we have and the penetration with our installed base. There's a significant opportunity for us to upsell into that installed base. We don't want to disincentivize our sales organization selling into that installed base. With Dali onboard, I'm sure he'll be driving all aspects of the business including new customer acquisition. \nJayChaudhry: Remo, if I may add. If a company is a single product company with a narrow offering, they have to keep on worrying about new customers in order to drive the growth. We have such a wide platform and more products being added to it. So we're less worried about making sure we just do new customers. So our number one goal is to maximize new ACV. Hence, we don't have a difference between new versus upsell. And Remo said the range of new has varied from 50% to 60%. And I think that's a good range. But as you see more new products coming, some of them can be sold on its own without the install base. We expect over time to go up. But we don't look at in or our net retention revenue as the most reliable indicator. It varies quite a bit. Remo, you have commented on in the past why it varies. \nRemoCanessa: Yes. So I mean a 120% that's clearly outstanding. We've ranged on 118% for several quarters. We called out several quarters ago that there could be pressured on that in and our net retention rate. As more companies are buying transformation upfront, which is what we're seeing? In addition, if customers are buying things quicker within the year because our net retention rate is based on ARR at beginning of the year versus what it is currently. If customers buy product within that period that's going to put pressure also on the net retention rate. Now those are the negative effects to it. The positive effects to it are that 43% of our ARR and ZIA was transformation. 14% of our new and upsell business last year was the ZPA. So there are upsell capabilities with those products. In addition, as Jay mentioned, with our new products, there's a potential for it also going up. The point to make is it's going to fluctuate. It's a hard metric to really put your finger on. 120% is outstanding but it could fluctuate. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Nowinski with DA Davidson.\nAndrewNowinski: Great, thank you and congrats on the nice quarter. I want to start with a question on the Fed side. So I think you mentioned a few modest sized deals with civilian agencies, but I'm wondering if you can give us your thoughts on how Microsoft being awarded the Jedi contract might impact Zscalar given your strong partnership with Microsoft and having --and now having both ZIA and ZPA FedRAMP certified?\nJayChaudhry: Actually very excited with the opportunity. We started investing in FedRAMP certifications over two years ago. It's a very hard certification, but we made the investment and as you've seen in recent press releases and the like, we got certification for both ZPA and ZIA. And as I said, we're the only vendor that's FedRAMP-certified with cloud security gateway. And on the ZPA side only vendor certified for 0 trash remote access that puts us in a very, very good position. Now the way Zscaler works is it's independent of cloud. We can access Microsoft, AWS, Azure all these clouds worked with us, but having a good partnership already in place with Microsoft will help us work closely with them in the field from go-to-market point-of-view. So while we have begun to get some early deals, we are pretty optimistic about the opportunity.  Though we do realize that federal deals can take a little bit of a longer time. But very pleased with the team we have put in place. The team has grown quite a bit and it's delivering.\nAndrewNowinski: Okay, thanks Jay. And then the Telcos have also been a fairly large driver of demand over the course of the last few years. So can you just give us any color on what if anything has changed with regard to the revenue contributed by the Telco providers? Thanks.\nJayChaudhry: Yes. Telco, they have been an important partner for us. I won't see any partner has been driving a lot of demand for us. As you know, as we drove transformation we have done a lot of evangelism. So we have been driving a lot of demand. It has been high-touch sales. But as customers are asking for more and more transformations, we do see no more leads coming from telco partners to say my customers asking for it. We're beginning to see RFPs coming out and say I need to do transformation. Deal I referred to in my earnings calls from Japan actually was an RFP that is issued three telcos in all three telcos were Zscaler because we met the requirements. So good business happening. We are trying to go further down market with telcos. That's a new project. Actually Dali is trying to drive. So far a lot of business we've done with telcos on the very high end with the large enterprises. So excited about the opportunity. They are natural partners for us even though there is, yes, some contention about network costs and what not. But we really don't impact that, it is the market that's looking for it and we're taking advantage of the market. \nRemoCanessa: Yes. Telcos typically represent around 50% of our revenue and that's about where it was in Q1.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. \nSaketKalia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Jay maybe to start with you. A lot of talk on competition particularly from the firewall side. I'd actually like to shift a little bit and maybe talk about competition from the traditional Secure Web Gateway players here that are transitioning. Most notably with Blue Coat. I guess the question is what are you seeing in terms of sales engagement with those types of opportunities since the deal is closed and really their willingness to explore a solution legacy Zscalar?\nJayChaudhry: Yes. When it comes to competition, our real competition from incumbency point-of-view is Secure Web Gateway because they have the right architecture as proxy architecture. Where we have been winning against them is because they have been good on-premise single-tenant proxy architecture, but they couldn't pivot to the cloud -- they couldn't build a viable multi-tenant architecture right. Remember my DVD versus Netflix example. Now among these traditional vendors for Secure Web Gateway, Blue Coat had big presence, a large enterprises as an appliance and with sales to a new owner. There's somewhat uncertainty out there. So we are seeing a lot of additional interest from large enterprises who are looking for alternatives and also some of these customers are moving to the cloud so it is actually helping us. So we're getting inbound inquiries that we're not getting before. So we think it's a big opportunity for us. We got some focus to take advantage of it.\nSaketKalia: Makes sense. Remo, maybe for my follow-up for you somewhat related but now that Symantec is part of a larger entity. You talked about $15 million to $20 million in one time cash costs including litigation. Can you talk about the litigation portion of it? And how does that sort of progress now that ownership on Symantec has sort of changed hands?\nRemoCanessa: Yes. The litigation portion is $8 million to $10 million. And the transaction with Broadcom and Symantec just was completed. So there's not much update. I mean the only thing I can say is that we do not feel, we infringe we're going to defend ourselves vigorously and the lawsuit that is currently out there is not having any impact on our business at all.\nJayChaudhry: Yes. We are carrying on, as you pointed out, change of hands can present an opportunity. And if it did we will be open to it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. \nBrianEssex: Hi, good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Jay, maybe if I could point to a couple of the sustainable competitive advantage examples that you gave. One, the first one pointed to scalability and elasticity of your platform and the third one pointed to your Edge cloud capabilities. But both were really interesting instances of pursuing Internet breakouts. Maybe if you could help us understand a little bit how these deals transpired? And who the partners on the SD-WAN side were and was this driven by maybe an SI that was putting the deal together and working with the company on a consultative basis? Or was this something that you lead and held their hands through this process and pulled maybe the SD-WAN vendors in and put the deal together on your side?\nJayChaudhry: Yes. The way these things are happening, it's still not process where market is mature and RFPs get sent out all the time. As we have mentioned, we are still in a high-tech sales model. There is good amount of evangelism needed though it's getting easier and easier what it used to be. A typical process, our sales team goes or they engages with customers shows them the value of transformation that can deliver user experience at lower-cost. And that basically leads to natural discussion in sale. Let's get an SP or SA together because it's generally involved in transformation SD vendor awareness is out there. We start collaborating with SD vendors out there. As I mentioned to you, VMware and Silver Peak are good partners for us, they're the leaders out there. And we come together and offer our proposal and solution. So what I see I would say a majority of the large deals that are driven and closed, there's still led us and we bring the partners along. But in a good number of them they do come from partners and many times our SD-WAN vendors introduced us to deal and sometimes we introduced us them to deals. So that's why we liked these technology partnerships. Microsoft, VMware are too big technology partners that are helping us on the SP front. The large SP the top four or five SP are globally are very good partners. \nBrianEssex: Got it. Maybe just a follow-up to, thank you for that. That's very helpful. Remo, when we spoke with Dali in September, he had a goal of maybe taking 30 to 60 days to evaluate data on a platform, build models, evaluate tie-up, talent and hire and so forth. Is he through with that? And do you know like definitively kind of the framework of what the incremental spend on the sales and marketing side will be for this year or might that kind of bleed into next year? I'm just trying to get a sense of when we might anticipate some meaningful leverage on our sales and marketing side of the model.\nRemoCanessa: Yes. Good question. I would start seeing basically improvement next year related to, and again the guidance that we gave contemplates the investments we're making in sales and marketing. Dolly's 30 to 60-day plan. I mean I've worked with the few CROs and watching what Dali is doing here in the first couple of months as he's moving very quickly and doing an outstanding. I mean he is building the sales leadership in the organization. He's building, as Jay mentioned, our sales enablement and training. He is better defining sales responsibility and putting in place the framework for us to be a much bigger company and placing in, putting in place that accountability. In summary, what I see with Dali is doing, he's putting structured, disciplined leadership and has a passion that he has. Quite frankly, I don't know when he sleeps. It's going very quickly, but it is going to take time. So that was the reason for our guidance initially at 42% to 43% billings in the first half and we increased that to 43% increased our billings guidance to 500 and 510. I'm excited working with Dolly. And what he's doing and looks forward to it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Wells with Citi.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you provide an update on customer feedback and learnings around the ZB2B and ZDX? I understand both are still in beta and plan to go live I believe next quarter actually. \nJayChaudhry: Yes. I think we will be able to give you more tangible and meaningful customer feedback probably next quarter. Right now, I would say the degree of interest and opportunity higher anticipated three or six months ago. It seems bigger than that. So high customer interest but again it's limited engagement so far. So the limited engagement we have is very high degree of interest. But we'll give you more as we have more tangible feedback.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Got it. And just a follow-up on that. Is the salesforce incentivized around the products while they're still in beta or is this just when they go live next quarter?\nJayChaudhry: We have no incentive. In fact, product management is actually working closely with selected number of customers. So we're not really pushing. We would rather not push till the products are properly cooked and all the kinks out auto fit. Once they become GA only then salesforce start selling.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: I just wanted to clarify that these new products are going to be generally available in calendar Q2, so it is not next quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: Next we have Melissa Franchi with Morgan Stanley.\nMelissaDan: Hi, this is Melissa Dan on for Melissa Franchi. I was hoping you could provide some color around activity in EMEA. Revenue growth in that area was slightly slower than the rest of the region. So wondering if there was any macro softness in your view or maybe execution considerations. Thank you.\nRemoCanessa: Yes, thank you. From a macro perspective really don't see it. EMEA grew 40% which is slower than the Americas and APJ. We did have a leadership change in EMEA which we're very excited about. But at 41% of total revenue in the EMEA, APJ at 8% Americas at 51% is pretty consistent what it's been in the past. But from a macro perspective not really seeing any changes. \nJayChaudhry: Yes. We're bullish on EMEA. I think we got good incumbent installed base and we will keep on growing it. We're making the right amount of investments for EMEA. \nMelissaDan: And just a quick follow-up to what extent is ZPA driving initial conversations with new customers versus ZIA? And there have been a lot of other vendors that are seemingly trying to address this opportunity. So has there been any change in what you've seen in competitive deals?\nJayChaudhry: So in the past few quarters, we have been seeing about half the new customers coming for ZPA, sorry half the ZPA deal is coming from new customers and half coming from upsell. So that's kind of number of customers. But having said that, the ZPA deals are smaller than ZIA deal. As we said before, when ZIA is bought it's bought for everyone in the company for all employees and ZPA are based on number of applications. So it's one. GPA is opening more doors for new logos than we had initially thought off. So pleased with that.  Your second question is competition for ZPA, ZPA market in what gotten calls 0 trust network access or others call, SDP, it is still a young market. We kind of really run into each other because it's relatively small. So it's not a very competitive space. It's more of a matter of evangelizing and showing people that doing traditional network security with things like VPN is a dangerous thing they don't need to do it. Once they get it you win the deal.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Fatima Boolani with UBS. \nFatimaBoolani: Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Jay, I have a question for you and a follow-up for Remo. Jay, you talked a lot about the internal improvements and pipeline rigor and sales enablement initiatives that Dali have sort of put in place and put into motion. So internally you're really elevating the rigor in the sales organization and go-to-market. I'm wondering if you can speak to the external and external distribution avenues and sort of what you're doing there from maybe a channel perspective or service provider or SI distribution perspective. Because as we understand your model doesn't traditionally lend itself well to the box pressures. So I wanted to get your sense of what sort of investments are in play from an external distribution perspective?\nJayChaudhry: Absolutely, there are number of points I could make there. In fact, I heard from someone other day, they said, it seemed like you're defocusing on channel. I said I'm not sure where that's coming from. Because actually we are putting more focus on channel. Now the point is it's not the same traditional channels. So what are we doing about channel? We know SPS have worked for us. We will keep on making more investments rather looking at going downstream with some of the SPS and not just do the very large enterprise deals. On the channel or maybe called the VAR channel traditionally guide. The people who largely on the box selling business that has limited synergy with us but Dali is focused on two types or channel partners. One, we have done cloud native boutique VARs well but only limited. We are expanding the reach. Dali has successfully done those cloud-native types of vendors in his previous life. So we're focused on getting those things done. Two, finding more vendors who are ready to pivot. Every channel person doesn't want to pivot or they wish they don't have to pivot because boxes will keep on selling forever. So those are the two things we're doing. I talked about sales enablement and training. That's really not just needed for channel, sorry for internal things, that's needed for channel as well. So we are actually putting a lot of focus in that area as well because that's needed for them to become more effective. Does it make sense?\nFatimaBoolani: I appreciate that. That makes a ton of sense. Remo, a question for you. You've been very explicit on the level of investments especially on the sales and marketing front as reflected in your guide. But as I think about Analyst Day you were a little bit more explicit on your sales capacity investments. So maybe accelerating that sales capacity footprint is 60% this year. I just wanted to get a sense of an update of how the sales hiring has been tracking as you started the New Year and that's it for me. Thank you.\nRemoCanessa: Yes. Our sales tracking for Q1, it's a little bit behind but our expectation is still to get to that 60%. We are looking 4Q to be a good quarter for us, but it's all taken into account in our guidance.\nJayChaudhry: Yes. I would add that in the past quarter, we have raised the bar in hiring better quality people. And also acceleration hiring. In fact, under Dali we have put together new recruiting playbook where we're educating, we're training all of our frontline sales leaders to make sure we hired the right kind of people. Again part of scaling, when you only have 10 leaders who are hiring. It's a small problem. When you have 50 sales leaders who are hiring it needs better scaling and better methodology and process. And that's what we're really scaling out. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities.\nDanIves: Yes, thanks. So maybe can you talk about the government market, obviously, a lot of deals move into cloud, Jedi, just I think one of them and just given where you are in terms of Azure in terms of that channel maybe just talk about that as an opportunity over the next 6-12 months in terms of how you're viewing that going into 2020?\nJayChaudhry: Yes. I think I'll add upon what I said earlier. Getting FedRAMP certifications is the first thing unless you have been nothing, not much matter so we have done that. And also in FedRAMP there's a moderate level certification is a high impact, having done both of them for ZIA, sorry ZPA is post done, ZIA, we are at more rates we will get to high impact shortly. The door is wide open for us to leverage. And Azure with Microsoft partnership is a good opportunity but we also worked with a fair amount of AWS out there. Very bullish on it. Remo, can I say that? Good team. I would say, if you asked me a year ago versus today, I feel we are significantly ahead of where I thought it would be. \nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Yun Kim with Rosenblatt Securities. \nYunKim: Thank you and congrats on the solid quarter. On the ZPA front, just wanted to ask about the competitive nature of that market. Are you seeing some of the same competitors are ZIA for your ZPA product and also are you selling to the same department or are they typically two different buyers for VPN and ZIA? Thanks. \nJayChaudhry: So it's a good question. ZIA is generally driven by transformation in our ideal world we start from the CIO, go down to head of infrastructure who wants to transform the network and security gets brought along. And it's a full blown play. ZPA actually has a few different paths. I will talk about three of them because it's very different opportunities. One case that we go to the customer, say if your applications are going to the cloud, public cloud like Azure and AWS. You don't need to go back through your datacenter. Go direct through Zscalar. It's good opportunity in that case. So who is the buyer? It's actually generally Head of Infrastructure because he was providing that connectivity before. Number two, many customers say, yes, I look at cloud but I have one problem to solve today. My remote access VPN. I hate it, it's slow and it's not secured. So replacing that, the VPN a buyer could be security. The buyer could be network. A third area, very different buyer, M&A, when companies are bought generally they want to bring the networks together in the old world of network security. In the Zscaler world, you don't bring the networks together. You simply with ZPA provide access to each of those applications transparently. In that case traditional IT is less open buyer. You basically deal with, it is --it's a CIO level but it's also sometimes M&A team that's put in place to bring the two companies together. Some common buyers, some different buyers.  End of Q&A\nOperator: Thank you, gentlemen. That concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Well, thank you all for your time. And we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences this quarter. Thank you again. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference and you may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Revenue for the quarter was $93.6 million, up 9% sequentially and 48% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, for the quarter Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 41% and APJ was 8%. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus, total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 37% year-over-year to $88.3 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue was $555 million on October 31st, up 35% from $411 million one year ago. Our strong customer retention and ability upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar based net retention rate, which is 120% for the quarter ended October 31st. This compares to 118% a year ago and last quarter. Our increased success selling bigger deals starting immediately with our Transformation bundle and faster upsell within a year while good for our business can reduce our dollar based net retention rate which is calculated on a year-over-year ARR basis. Considering these factors we feel 120% is outstanding and it will vary quarter-to-quarter. We are pleased with the continued adoption of our comprehensive cloud platform by our customers as they increasingly rely on us for their transformation journey, in fact, two-thirds of our top 25 customers were also customers two years ago in the cumulative ARR has more than doubled over this period. Total gross margin was 81% flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. We feel that 80% continues to be a good target range in the near term as it is important to continue to invest in our platform to drive top line revenue growth. Turning to operating expenses, our total operating expenses increased 17% sequentially and increased 44% year-over-year at $72.7 million the decreased as a percentage of revenue, 78% compared to 80% last year. Sales and marketing increased 20% sequentially and 46% year-over-year to $49.4 million. The year-over-year increase is due to higher compensation expenses and the cost of three major marketing events, Zenith Live Americas, Zenith Live Europe and our sales kickoff. R&D was up 12% sequentially and 44% year-over-year to $14.8 million as we continue to invest to enhance our product functionality and innovate new products. G&A increased 6% sequentially and increased 32% year-over-year to $8.5 million. The year-over-year growth in G&A includes investments in building our team these expenses exclude $2 million in litigation related expenses. Our first quarter operating margin was 3%, which compares to 2% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $4.1 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.03. We ended the quarter with $378 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $9.4 million in the quarter compared to positive $5.2 million for the same quarter a year ago. Our ESPP program increased our free cash flow by approximately $3 million in the quarter same as a year ago. The ESPP program does not impact overall the cash balance. Now moving on to guidance as a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain litigation related expenses and any associated tax effects. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $97 million to $100 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 31% to 35% for the year-ago comparison recall the Q2, 2019 revenue was aided by $2.3 million in nonrecurring revenue from a large public sector customer deploying our platform as a private cloud. Excluding this revenue from last year guidance reflects 35% to 39% growth. Operating profit in the range of $3 million to $4 million; income taxes of $900,000 and earnings per share of approximately $0.03 assuming 138 million common shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $405 million to $413 million or year-over-year growth of 34% to 36%. Calculated billings in the range of $500 million to $510 million or year-over-year growth of 28% to 31%. Operating profit in the range of $15 million to $18 million. In Q4, we expect to host our annual Zenith Live Events in both EMEA and Americas. We expect the cost of these two events to be in the range of $5 million to $6 million, income taxes of $3.6 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.15 assuming approximately 139 million common shares outstanding. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. We are pleased with the progress our CRO is making and we are confident, he is the right person to drive our sales and go-to-market execution. We are stepping up sales and marketing investments in order to build the foundation for long-term growth. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. As you model billings, I want to remind you that historically, Q2 and Q4 have been our strongest billing quarters with sequential declines in Q1 and Q3 quarters respectively. With our outperformance in Q1 billings we now expect first half billings to be approximately 43% of full year billings compared to our prior expectations of 42% to 43%. Also, please keep in mind that we had a large upfront billing of $1 million in Q2 of 2019 from a large public sector customer deploying our platform as a private cloud which will pose a tough year-over-year comparison in Q2. Excluding this deal our billings guidance for the full year implies 32% to 35% growth. In terms of free cash flow, please note that we'll have additional spend for tenant improvements related to our headquarters' move in January as well as ongoing cash outlays for lease payments on our existing San Jose buildings and litigation expenses related to our ongoing Symantec lawsuit. These extraordinary items are expected to be approximately $15 million to $20 million in cash payments for the full year. As a result of these payments, we expect our free cash flow margins in fiscal 2020 to be zero to two points lower compared to our operating profit margins. Longer term, we expect our free cash flow margins to be higher than our non-GAAP operating margins. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jay. Yes, couple add-ons to that also. I mean our plan is still to be at a 20% plus operating margin once we hit $800 million to $1 billion in revenue. Related to pricing pressure, our discounts are lower this quarter. Our average prices per user are higher. When I take a look at our ARR for customers with greater than 3,000 users, it is higher this quarter. It's in the high 300,000 range and our churn is down. Yes. So, no, there's nothing we're planning for, and you shouldn't plan for anything either. We're planning to get these products out in the second calendar quarter of 2020. There's potential for the products as Jay mentioned with the CASB out of band browser isolation user experience in the B2B. We feel that there's a pretty significant upside for us with these types of products but nothing for this fiscal 2020 should be accounted for. Yes. That's a good question. So typically we range with 2 versus up sell 60% to 40% new versus upsell and also 50 to 50. In Q1, the mix was closer to 50% to 60%. What's important to recognize we don't really distinguish internally the difference between new and upsell when we track it? But we incentivize our sales organization both for new and up sell. When you take a look at the installed base that we have and the penetration with our installed base. There's a significant opportunity for us to upsell into that installed base. We don't want to disincentivize our sales organization selling into that installed base. With Dali onboard, I'm sure he'll be driving all aspects of the business including new customer acquisition. Yes. So I mean a 120% that's clearly outstanding. We've ranged on 118% for several quarters. We called out several quarters ago that there could be pressured on that in and our net retention rate. As more companies are buying transformation upfront, which is what we're seeing? In addition, if customers are buying things quicker within the year because our net retention rate is based on ARR at beginning of the year versus what it is currently. If customers buy product within that period that's going to put pressure also on the net retention rate. Now those are the negative effects to it. The positive effects to it are that 43% of our ARR and ZIA was transformation. 14% of our new and upsell business last year was the ZPA. So there are upsell capabilities with those products. In addition, as Jay mentioned, with our new products, there's a potential for it also going up. The point to make is it's going to fluctuate. It's a hard metric to really put your finger on. 120% is outstanding but it could fluctuate. Yes. Telcos typically represent around 50% of our revenue and that's about where it was in Q1. Yes. The litigation portion is $8 million to $10 million. And the transaction with Broadcom and Symantec just was completed. So there's not much update. I mean the only thing I can say is that we do not feel, we infringe we're going to defend ourselves vigorously and the lawsuit that is currently out there is not having any impact on our business at all. Yes. Good question. I would start seeing basically improvement next year related to, and again the guidance that we gave contemplates the investments we're making in sales and marketing. Dolly's 30 to 60-day plan. I mean I've worked with the few CROs and watching what Dali is doing here in the first couple of months as he's moving very quickly and doing an outstanding. I mean he is building the sales leadership in the organization. He's building, as Jay mentioned, our sales enablement and training. He is better defining sales responsibility and putting in place the framework for us to be a much bigger company and placing in, putting in place that accountability. In summary, what I see with Dali is doing, he's putting structured, disciplined leadership and has a passion that he has. Quite frankly, I don't know when he sleeps. It's going very quickly, but it is going to take time. So that was the reason for our guidance initially at 42% to 43% billings in the first half and we increased that to 43% increased our billings guidance to 500 and 510. I'm excited working with Dolly. And what he's doing and looks forward to it. Yes, thank you. From a macro perspective really don't see it. EMEA grew 40% which is slower than the Americas and APJ. We did have a leadership change in EMEA which we're very excited about. But at 41% of total revenue in the EMEA, APJ at 8% Americas at 51% is pretty consistent what it's been in the past. But from a macro perspective not really seeing any changes. Yes. Our sales tracking for Q1, it's a little bit behind but our expectation is still to get to that 60%. We are looking 4Q to be a good quarter for us, but it's all taken into account in our guidance."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and thank you everyone for joining us. We reported solid Q1 results delivering strong revenue and operating profit growth in the first quarter with positive free cash flow, while making strategic investments to scale our go-to-market machine to the next level. Our revenue grew 48% and billings grew 37% year-over-year in Q1, and we are increasing our outlook for revenue and billings for the full fiscal year 2020. Adoption of the ZIA Transformation Bundle continues to grow and ZPA remains our fastest growing product. I'm thrilled that more customers are using ZIA and ZPA together, which provides a single platform for secured cloud transformation that we believe no other vendor can match. As you know, Dali Rajic joined this September as our President Go-To-Market and Chief Revenue Officer. I'm excited about the key initiatives our sales leadership is putting in place to position us well for the long term. At our recent Zenith Live Cloud Summit, I was pleased to hear CIOs, CTOs, and CSOs of Global 2000 Enterprises sharing with pride their cloud transformation journeys enabled by Zscaler that delivered lower costs, improved security, and provided fast and reliable user experience. I'm very proud that Gartner recently recognized Zscaler as a leader in the Secure Web Gateway Magic Quadrant for the ninth year in a row. More importantly, Zscaler is positioned the highest for both execution and vision, significantly separating us from the competition. We pioneered the cloud native, integrated security platform and our cloud service is trusted by over 3,900 customers, including over 400 of the Forbes Global 2000 to access applications no matter where they live. The Zscaler cloud processes over 80 billion transactions per day, which is over ten times the number of Google searches per day. This provides an unprecedented network effect, which allows us to deliver superior security to our customers. We are aggressively investing in our business to pursue a massive opportunity to disrupt traditional network security which mostly relies on legacy security appliances. Let me now highlight a few wins in Q1 that showcase what we believe are our sustainable competitive advantages. I will start with an upsell that highlights the scalability and elasticity of our cloud. This Fortune 100 customer purchased our professional Bundle for all 40,000 employees three years ago. In Q1, they tripled that annual business with us by upgrading to Business Bundle, adding additional users, and purchasing protection for server traffic going from the datacenter to the public cloud. They deployed local Internet breakouts at over 1,000 locations during their cloud journey, including rolling out Office 365. Their Internet traffic increased exponentially reaching 1.2 petabytes per month, which is equal to 10 billion photos in Facebook, and their IT leaders praised the elasticity of the Zscaler cloud when a companywide video conference call by the CEO went flawlessly even though the network traffic doubled during the event. How would a single tenant security cloud possibly handles this. Now, I will share a new logo win of a Fortune 100 customer that needed to up level their security. Unlike most large enterprises, they had no proxy gateways and instead relied upon next-gen firewalls for the user traffic to the Internet. No wonder they had a high-risk posture. They purchased ZIA transformation bundle for all 14,000 employees. With Zscaler, they can detect and prevent advanced threats and zero-day attacks which are increasingly found in encrypted traffic. This results in better security. Next, I will highlight the win that illustrates benefits of our Edge cloud capabilities and enabled faster M&A integration. A top global healthcare company that bought our Business Bundle and cloud firewall for 30,000 employees 18 months ago purchased an additional 30,000 seats to integrate a recent acquisition. The two companies have a combined global presence with hundreds of locations across 70 countries. Each company had embarked on a network transformation journey for local Internet breakouts but with two very different approaches to security. The acquired company was a next-gen firewall shop which scores offline walls deployed in branch offices giving a false sense of security, as 95% of the web traffic is encrypted and was not being inspected. To integrate the two companies, they standardized on Zscaler, implemented SSL inspection, and are ripping out all the branch firewalls. The result, significant savings and a big improvement in their security posture. Next, I'd like to share considerable momentum we are building in the U.S. Federal market. Last year, ZIA and ZPA received FedRAMP certification at the moderate level, and last month ZPA reached FedRAMP readiness at the high impact level which puts Zscaler in an elite group of technology companies. ZIA is the only FedRAMP certified secure cloud Internet gateway today. ZPA is the first and only cloud security service that has received FedRAMP certification for zero trust remote access. This positions us very well in this large market. In Q1, we won two deals with civilian agencies, each with an annual contract value greater than $0.5 million. The first win is with a large strategic agency with an initial order for ZIA and ZPA for 15,000 mobile users to deliver secure access to applications with zero trust network access. The second agency purchased the complete ZIA and ZPA platform for all 6,800 employees to enable cloud transformation to secure SD-WAN deployment for local breakouts and to provide direct access to any application from anywhere. Turning to Japan, we entered this large market only two years ago, but have been gaining great traction. In Q1, one-off Japan's largest transportation companies purchased our ZIA Business Bundle and cloud sandbox for all 30,000 employees to secure local breakouts and increased security for all users. Non proxy technologies such as next-gen firewalls were not considered since comprehensive security was important. A common theme, all these wins, is that a cloud-first world requires a cloud-native architecture. In a recent groundbreaking research note, Gartner defined a new product category named Secure Access Service Edge or as SASE pronounced SASE. Gartner predicts that the future of network security is in the cloud, and most organizations will move their network security to a SASE model.  Importantly Gartner recommends reducing the complexity of network security by moving to one vendor for Secure Web Gateway, CASB, DNS, zero trust network access and remote browser isolation capabilities. This is Zscaler. We strongly believe this validates our vision when we founded Zscaler over 10 years ago. Here are the core architectural principles Gartner has outlined for SASE. Number one SASE demands that the security providers offer security at the cloud EDGE close to the user for good user experience. Zscaler provides in line security at the cloud EDGE in more than 150 data centers around the world. In contrast, legacy security vendors claiming to offer a SASE service are spinning up virtual machines on public clouds the traffic backhauled to centralized compute that is not security at the edge. That is not SASE.  Number two, SASE recommends that a branch office should have a light footprint which simply an SD-WAN router and all security services in the cloud. While the Zscaler cloud is light branch architecture the legacy firewall vendors are peddling heavy branch Appliances again that is not SASE. Number three, Gartner specifically said, many of these SASE capabilities will use a proxy model, because our proxy is required to inspect encrypted traffic. Zscaler meet this requirement while next-gen firewalls don't hence next-gen firewalls or not SASE. Number four lastly; SASE advocates a cloud native multi-tenant architecture which is the foundation of Zscaler cloud platform. You can take legacy single tenant security appliances and stick them in the cloud as virtual machines and call it cloud security that would be like placing thousands of DVD players in a public cloud and calling it a Netflix streaming service. In summary Zscaler was designed for the SASE world that Gartner has spelled out. Some of you have asked questions about competition from next-gen firewall vendors. Over the last 10 years we have faced various competitors starting with large legacy secured web gateway vendors who claim to offer a cloud security service. Where they are today as security must move the cloud, legacy firewall vendors are now making similar noise. Next-gen firewalls are designed to build a moat around the castle, to secure the network and the data center. They are the wrong architecture for security users. The next question is why they can't build a platform like Zscaler, well the answer lies in the architecture. Architecture is like the foundation of a building you can't change the foundation unless you start all over which is hard and takes a long time. We know that start-ups like Salesforce and Workday competed and won against much larger on premise incumbent vendors, because of their cloud native architecture. We believe we are doing the same in the network security space. Let me talk about our product. I will highlight a few innovations data expanding our platform. Zscaler B2B and Zscaler digital experience or DDX. The two major product lines we announced at Zenith Live are getting great initial feedback from our customers. The outdoor band CASB that we announced at Zenith Live is receiving very good early reception combined with our existing in line CASB capabilities. We will now offer a complete CASB solution. The integration of browser isolation technology, we acquired through Appsulate is ahead of plan and is already being tested by customers. Building upon the TrustPath acquisition we did last year. We have significantly enhanced our threat detection capabilities with machine learning and AI. Moving on to tech partnerships to complement our comprehensive platform we believe in partnering with tech leaders. This provides an integrated solution for customers and creates go to market leverage for Zscaler. For example, we have a deep and wide partnership with Microsoft Office 365 and Azure public cloud. Microsoft names Zscaler the first and only cloud security provider to be a certified partner in the Microsoft Networking Partner Program or NPP for Office 365, which has stringent requirements for user performance. Microsoft only recommends NPP partners for Office 365 connectivity. We are working closely with both VMware and Silver Peak the only two leaders in Gartner's recently published SD-WAN Magic Quadrant. Let's now turn to our go-to-market. Zscaler is the enabler of cloud transformation. As a result we have a different top-down sales process and go-to-market strategy than legacy vendors. As I stated during the last earnings call, we are focused on improving our sales execution to take Zscaler beyond $1 billion in revenue. That is why I'm excited to have Dali on board as he is to building a highly scalable go-to-market machine. He has already driven rapid and tangible progress building a multi-dimensional go-to market model, putting us into a great position to scale. Let me give you a few examples; we implemented a more refined metrics based model of accountability and transparency giving us better visibility into how our business is run. We are ahead of our plan to build a new sales process and enablement program that will deliver consistent and high level execution in the field, it is already having a meaningful impact in our day-to-day execution, and we continue to mature our sales leadership structure. With all that we have implemented in a very short time. I'm very pleased with our progress and confident that we are building a solid foundation for a highly scalable sales machine for our long-term growth. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you, Remo. In closing, let me state four key points that make me excited. Number one architecture matters, especially for a cloud security platform that must set in line to inspect all traffic for policy enforcement. We believe we have the best architecture with 10 years of operational experience to run a massive cloud and enormous barrier to entry. Number two, with multiple tailwinds such as Office 365 SaaS adoption, SD-WAN and app migration to public clouds, we believe the market is coming to us. Number three, we are in early innings of the cloud journey we're disrupting a $20 billion TAM with ZIA and ZPA. In addition, we recently announced these got our B2B and ZDX, which we believe will expand our TAM significantly. Number four with new go-to-market leadership on board, we are building a sales machine that can deliver world-class execution and sustainable long-term growth. We thank you for your interest in Zscaler and look forward to reporting on our progress in the future. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes, Alex. Thank you. This is Jay. Regarding your question about our go-to-market, our CRO. As you know, we have done very well so far bill-to-business to hundreds of millions of dollars. Now, our goal is to take it to $1 billion and plus which means scaling our sales execution. Tony actually is the right guy who is driving a number of these things. Let me give you a perspective of what all he's driving. So, for execution at scale, I will give you three examples. One, when you have scores of salespeople, it's one thing; when you have hundreds of salespeople, you need far better sales enablement, far better training. For us, we used to have a small sales enablement team. Dali has come in and built a pretty sizable team, and the team has already rolling out some of the training programs. Number two; to really scale your business, you need a very consistent and repeatable sales process that may be more refined. And Dali has come in and taken our process and further refined and it's being rolled out to the whole field. Number three, while we had tools and systems in place to scale to the next level and to have better accountability, better visibility to give us better leading indicator in sales activities, he and the leadership team have started work on many areas. So, a lot of these things are already making a difference, and we're seeing it. And I think as each quarter goes by, we will see more and more impact of the work being done by Dali and his team. Remo, you want to add anything? Alex, regarding your second question about competition from firewall vendors, you know somehow discussion keeps on coming, I tried to address it during my statements, but fundamentally if you look at the large enterprises; to protect users, they almost always look for a proxy architecture. You guys deal with large banks. If you talk to top 20 banks and ask anyone, would you just depend upon on next-gen firewall for user protection, I haven't found a yes answer from a single bank so far. Now, it's probably true. There used to be some of that is happening on the lower end where the customer is less security savvy, and they are able to go with some of that solution happening. So, probably on the SD-WAN side, some of that is happening in the lower end. But where our primary focus is, we don't really think any of the impact from the firewall vendors making noise has happened and impacted us. So far, I think it's the architecture that we got much better that's giving us an edge, and I think it's a long-term edge. Yes. Changes in terms of the sales cycle and all haven't really changed a whole lot for us. I think what we are doing is tightening our sales process and tightening our execution. We aren't really seeing much market impact in terms of slowdown of any of the stuff with better leadership and some of the things I outlined, I think it's focused execution is what we are doing, and we are beginning to see it's making a difference for us. And I think it'll help us in the long run because we're building a stronger infrastructure to scale our sales. Yes. If I may add, we are engaged with customers as you would expect in beta stages during evaluation and testing. Our interest is real. I mean just to clarify what we announced was two big product lines, Zscaler B2B and Zscaler Digital Experience. And then we also announced two, what I would call features, out-of-band CASB, CASB as a feature and browser isolation is another feature that's relevant for both ZI and ZPA. Early indications are very positive. These products become generally available in calendar Q2. Yes. So for a long time we have had what we call in-line CASB, if all traffic goes through us, we have to do CASB which includes threat detection and protection DLP and alike. And for Autoban, we dependent upon two partnerships. You mentioned McAfee and Microsoft. Our customers kept on telling us that it's small add-on we should be doing it. So we took them seriously, we built it. So we become a single provider. So it's a natural feature for us to add-on and we're seeing lots of traction. We will continue our partnership with Microsoft and Sky High McAfee in this area. If customers want something like that they have it, but we believe a large number of our customers will take Zscaler and if there is another CASB solution I think we will end up displacing it. Remo, if I may add. If a company is a single product company with a narrow offering, they have to keep on worrying about new customers in order to drive the growth. We have such a wide platform and more products being added to it. So we're less worried about making sure we just do new customers. So our number one goal is to maximize new ACV. Hence, we don't have a difference between new versus upsell. And Remo said the range of new has varied from 50% to 60%. And I think that's a good range. But as you see more new products coming, some of them can be sold on its own without the install base. We expect over time to go up. But we don't look at in or our net retention revenue as the most reliable indicator. It varies quite a bit. Remo, you have commented on in the past why it varies. Actually very excited with the opportunity. We started investing in FedRAMP certifications over two years ago. It's a very hard certification, but we made the investment and as you've seen in recent press releases and the like, we got certification for both ZPA and ZIA. And as I said, we're the only vendor that's FedRAMP-certified with cloud security gateway. And on the ZPA side only vendor certified for 0 trash remote access that puts us in a very, very good position. Now the way Zscaler works is it's independent of cloud. We can access Microsoft, AWS, Azure all these clouds worked with us, but having a good partnership already in place with Microsoft will help us work closely with them in the field from go-to-market point-of-view. So while we have begun to get some early deals, we are pretty optimistic about the opportunity.  Though we do realize that federal deals can take a little bit of a longer time. But very pleased with the team we have put in place. The team has grown quite a bit and it's delivering. Yes. Telco, they have been an important partner for us. I won't see any partner has been driving a lot of demand for us. As you know, as we drove transformation we have done a lot of evangelism. So we have been driving a lot of demand. It has been high-touch sales. But as customers are asking for more and more transformations, we do see no more leads coming from telco partners to say my customers asking for it. We're beginning to see RFPs coming out and say I need to do transformation. Deal I referred to in my earnings calls from Japan actually was an RFP that is issued three telcos in all three telcos were Zscaler because we met the requirements. So good business happening. We are trying to go further down market with telcos. That's a new project. Actually Dali is trying to drive. So far a lot of business we've done with telcos on the very high end with the large enterprises. So excited about the opportunity. They are natural partners for us even though there is, yes, some contention about network costs and what not. But we really don't impact that, it is the market that's looking for it and we're taking advantage of the market. Yes. When it comes to competition, our real competition from incumbency point-of-view is Secure Web Gateway because they have the right architecture as proxy architecture. Where we have been winning against them is because they have been good on-premise single-tenant proxy architecture, but they couldn't pivot to the cloud -- they couldn't build a viable multi-tenant architecture right. Remember my DVD versus Netflix example. Now among these traditional vendors for Secure Web Gateway, Blue Coat had big presence, a large enterprises as an appliance and with sales to a new owner. There's somewhat uncertainty out there. So we are seeing a lot of additional interest from large enterprises who are looking for alternatives and also some of these customers are moving to the cloud so it is actually helping us. So we're getting inbound inquiries that we're not getting before. So we think it's a big opportunity for us. We got some focus to take advantage of it. Yes. We are carrying on, as you pointed out, change of hands can present an opportunity. And if it did we will be open to it. Yes. The way these things are happening, it's still not process where market is mature and RFPs get sent out all the time. As we have mentioned, we are still in a high-tech sales model. There is good amount of evangelism needed though it's getting easier and easier what it used to be. A typical process, our sales team goes or they engages with customers shows them the value of transformation that can deliver user experience at lower-cost. And that basically leads to natural discussion in sale. Let's get an SP or SA together because it's generally involved in transformation SD vendor awareness is out there. We start collaborating with SD vendors out there. As I mentioned to you, VMware and Silver Peak are good partners for us, they're the leaders out there. And we come together and offer our proposal and solution. So what I see I would say a majority of the large deals that are driven and closed, there's still led us and we bring the partners along. But in a good number of them they do come from partners and many times our SD-WAN vendors introduced us to deal and sometimes we introduced us them to deals. So that's why we liked these technology partnerships. Microsoft, VMware are too big technology partners that are helping us on the SP front. The large SP the top four or five SP are globally are very good partners. Yes. I think we will be able to give you more tangible and meaningful customer feedback probably next quarter. Right now, I would say the degree of interest and opportunity higher anticipated three or six months ago. It seems bigger than that. So high customer interest but again it's limited engagement so far. So the limited engagement we have is very high degree of interest. But we'll give you more as we have more tangible feedback. We have no incentive. In fact, product management is actually working closely with selected number of customers. So we're not really pushing. We would rather not push till the products are properly cooked and all the kinks out auto fit. Once they become GA only then salesforce start selling. Yes. We're bullish on EMEA. I think we got good incumbent installed base and we will keep on growing it. We're making the right amount of investments for EMEA. So in the past few quarters, we have been seeing about half the new customers coming for ZPA, sorry half the ZPA deal is coming from new customers and half coming from upsell. So that's kind of number of customers. But having said that, the ZPA deals are smaller than ZIA deal. As we said before, when ZIA is bought it's bought for everyone in the company for all employees and ZPA are based on number of applications. So it's one. GPA is opening more doors for new logos than we had initially thought off. So pleased with that.  Your second question is competition for ZPA, ZPA market in what gotten calls 0 trust network access or others call, SDP, it is still a young market. We kind of really run into each other because it's relatively small. So it's not a very competitive space. It's more of a matter of evangelizing and showing people that doing traditional network security with things like VPN is a dangerous thing they don't need to do it. Once they get it you win the deal. Absolutely, there are number of points I could make there. In fact, I heard from someone other day, they said, it seemed like you're defocusing on channel. I said I'm not sure where that's coming from. Because actually we are putting more focus on channel. Now the point is it's not the same traditional channels. So what are we doing about channel? We know SPS have worked for us. We will keep on making more investments rather looking at going downstream with some of the SPS and not just do the very large enterprise deals. On the channel or maybe called the VAR channel traditionally guide. The people who largely on the box selling business that has limited synergy with us but Dali is focused on two types or channel partners. One, we have done cloud native boutique VARs well but only limited. We are expanding the reach. Dali has successfully done those cloud-native types of vendors in his previous life. So we're focused on getting those things done. Two, finding more vendors who are ready to pivot. Every channel person doesn't want to pivot or they wish they don't have to pivot because boxes will keep on selling forever. So those are the two things we're doing. I talked about sales enablement and training. That's really not just needed for channel, sorry for internal things, that's needed for channel as well. So we are actually putting a lot of focus in that area as well because that's needed for them to become more effective. Does it make sense? Yes. I would add that in the past quarter, we have raised the bar in hiring better quality people. And also acceleration hiring. In fact, under Dali we have put together new recruiting playbook where we're educating, we're training all of our frontline sales leaders to make sure we hired the right kind of people. Again part of scaling, when you only have 10 leaders who are hiring. It's a small problem. When you have 50 sales leaders who are hiring it needs better scaling and better methodology and process. And that's what we're really scaling out. Yes. I think I'll add upon what I said earlier. Getting FedRAMP certifications is the first thing unless you have been nothing, not much matter so we have done that. And also in FedRAMP there's a moderate level certification is a high impact, having done both of them for ZIA, sorry ZPA is post done, ZIA, we are at more rates we will get to high impact shortly. The door is wide open for us to leverage. And Azure with Microsoft partnership is a good opportunity but we also worked with a fair amount of AWS out there. Very bullish on it. Remo, can I say that? Good team. I would say, if you asked me a year ago versus today, I feel we are significantly ahead of where I thought it would be. So it's a good question. ZIA is generally driven by transformation in our ideal world we start from the CIO, go down to head of infrastructure who wants to transform the network and security gets brought along. And it's a full blown play. ZPA actually has a few different paths. I will talk about three of them because it's very different opportunities. One case that we go to the customer, say if your applications are going to the cloud, public cloud like Azure and AWS. You don't need to go back through your datacenter. Go direct through Zscalar. It's good opportunity in that case. So who is the buyer? It's actually generally Head of Infrastructure because he was providing that connectivity before. Number two, many customers say, yes, I look at cloud but I have one problem to solve today. My remote access VPN. I hate it, it's slow and it's not secured. So replacing that, the VPN a buyer could be security. The buyer could be network. A third area, very different buyer, M&A, when companies are bought generally they want to bring the networks together in the old world of network security. In the Zscaler world, you don't bring the networks together. You simply with ZPA provide access to each of those applications transparently. In that case traditional IT is less open buyer. You basically deal with, it is --it's a CIO level but it's also sometimes M&A team that's put in place to bring the two companies together. Some common buyers, some different buyers.  End of Q&A Well, thank you all for your time. And we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences this quarter. Thank you again."

We had a very strong quarter to close out spectacularly in Q4. we delivered growth of 57% in revenue and 70% in billings as customers embraced our expanded cloud platform to accelerate. Each told transformation. Let me share a few highlights of fiscal 2021, our full-year revenue grew 56% to $673 million and billings grew 70% to reach $934 billion. We are seeing revenue growth across all verticals, customer segments, and geographies. 51% of revenue was from outside the United States. I'm very excited to see our ARR approaching $1 billion and pleased to note that our new annualized bookings and new logo acquisition accelerated throughout the year.  All product pillars of our platform saws strong demand. Notably, ZPA revenue surpassed $100 million in fiscal 2021, growing 166% year-over-year. To increase cyber security risks and accelerating digital transformation, have increased the need for our Zero Trust architecture. We're uniquely positioned to reduce business and make businesses at trial and more competitive. We are the only cloud provider at scale with a proxy-based architecture to deliver through zero-trust security. Finally, loan and VP and based castle-and-moat security connect users to the corporate network, which facilitates lateral movement of Trex, increasing cyber risks.  Zscaler connects users only to applications, now to the network of the core principle of Zero Trust architecture that reduces then similar tax and other cyber risks. Build from the start to enforce policy at the edge, as advocated by the SASE framework. That this color Cloud spends 150 datacenters with five-nines availability, providing fast and secure access to all applications. whether in you with a data center or in a multi-Cloud environment. Because of these architectural advantages and our proven ability to scale [Indiscernible] Zero Trust Exchange has become the foundation for big sold Transformation. With a record number of seven-figure ACV deals in Q4.  We now have over 200 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR. Over 5,600 enterprises, including 35% of the Fortune 500, Trust Zscaler, to secure their transformation journey. While the entries Net Promoter Score of fast companies is 30, Zscalers is 74, which is 2.5 times higher, proof out the values these killers deliver. Now, I will like to discuss the fee market segment. We have made significant progress during the quarter and the fiscal year. First, the financial service sector has become our top vertical. These companies are embracing the cloud and Office 365. Let me highlight 3 new customer wins in Q4 for the purchase of ZIA and ZPA together.  First-day as, a global bank that's adopting a Zero Trust strategy to protect over 100,000 employees with our high-end. and ZPA bundle. They've purchased every module we offer in the CIS color, including firewall, Sandbox, CASB, DLP, and browser isolation. Fast user experience and enhanced Cybersecurity were the key factors in our win. Our second new logo win is a Fortune 500 asset management Company that purchased ZIA and ZPA to secure over 30, 000 employees.  And third is a Fortune 500 insurance Company that purchased ZIA CPA CPA or 26,000 employees to enable work-from-anywhere. These wins illustrate when companies are ready to embrace the cloud, Zscaler is the only cloud-native multi-tenant platform that meets the need. With security as a major requirement, these financial services customers only considered a proxy architecture that can provide SSL inspection at scale. and rejected firewall based on the detection. We now count eight of the top ten global banks and seven of the top ten insurance companies outside of China as our customers.  Next, let me highlight our progress in the enterprise market segment, which includes organizations with 2,000 to 6000 employees. We started focusing on the segment at the start of fiscal 21, and the results have exceeded our expectations. This segment includes over 12,000 organizations representing $8 billion of our serviceable market for user protection. DU sizes in the segment are growing as customers adopt more of our platform. I'm excited to see our first seven-figure upsell win in our enterprise segment, whether the customer is buying all four pillars off our platform. ZPA and CDx for 6 thousand users. And CCP Workload Segmentation for almost 3,000 servers. Our ARR with this customer now exceeds $1.5 million, validating a significant opportunity in this market segment.  To further penetrate the segment, we are developing targeted marketing programs, significantly growing our sales team, and doubling down on our Summit Partner program to recruit and enable channel partners to drive further sales leverage. Finally, we continue to invest to capture a large federal opportunity, with a sizable Fed sales team and the highest FedRAMP certifications, we count well over 100 government agencies, and federal integrators as customers. In Q4 alone, we added over 20 new federal customers, including 4 with over $1 million in annual contract value.  Each purchasing ZIA and ZPA together. Driven by the President's recent Executive order, we're seeing increased interest in our Zero Trust Exchange across all levels of the government. We are among a select group of companies chosen by NIST, our national standards body, run a pilot program in support of the executive order. We are excited about this opportunity to help our country dramatically improve our security posture while significantly reducing legacy IT costs. Next, let me highlight our technology innovations and emerging products which are expanding our opportunities.  We started with a highly scalable, multi - [Indiscernible], globally distributed cloud capable of providing in-line inspectional Internet and SaaS traffic with ZI, and securing access to private applications with ZP. Over the past few, we extended our platform to protect cloud workflows and to manage the digital user experience. We're very excited about the early traction of our emerging products, the next growth engines for us. Our emerging products contributed a high single-digit percentage of new and upsell business in fiscal '21, which is well ahead of our expectations.  CDx is the fastest-growing solution in our history. And a natural complement to ZIA and ZPA. With a single lightweight endpoint agent. It is frictionless to turn on ZDX to provide end-to-end visibility to help resolve performance issues for every Zscaler user. In Q4, one of our largest ZDX deals came from a Fortune 500 tech Company. The purchase of the entire ZIA portfolio, as well as ZPA and ZDX, all 60,000 employees to support work-from-anywhere while embracing Zero Trust architecture. We were pleasantly surprised to see so many large enterprises adopt ZDX so rapidly. Under notable CDx explains include a Fortune 500 RevPAR Company for 70 thousand users, a Fortune 50 energy Company for 55 thousand users, a Fortune 500 European bank for 39,000 users and industrial and manufacturing Company for 28,000 users, and a healthcare Company for 25,000 users.  I believe that every ZIA and ZPA customer will embrace ZDX as user experience is one of the highest priorities of our CIO. We're receiving very positive feedback from customers. Our fortunate 600 healthcare executive indicated ZDX contributor to an 18.0 gain in employee net Promoter score for the IT service task, in two Quarters. And after having disrupted premier best security with our Zero Trust Exchange for users, our next big opportunity is to bring Zero Trust to workloads with Zscaler Cloud Protection or ZCP. Every organization is building its applications in the Cloud. And we'll look to implement Zero Trust security to protect workloads.  Our Zero Trust exchange securely connects workloads to workloads and processes to process, using business policies, eliminating the need for traditional networks and associated cyber risks. Solutions within our ZCP killer include Cloud partial, which includes Zv, and CIEM, ensure proper configuration and enforces lease privileged access for multi-cloud environments. What cloud communication-powered by ZIA and CPA technology, secures app-to-app and cloud-to-cloud communication. And Workload Segmentation achieves Micro-Segmentation without Legacy Network Segmentation.  We have over 300 ZCP customers and are seeing increasingly strong interest from new and existing customers. Let me highlight a few ZCP wins during Q4. An existing ZIA and ZPA customer in the consumer goods sector with over 100,000 employees, purchase, Workload communication for 25,000 workloads. And Workload Segmentation for 10,000 workloads. This customer has a large software environment on a traditional network. Implementing our Zero Trust for workloads, to reduce their cyber risks by minimizing lateral movement while securing the app migration to the cloud.  We're also lending new logos within ZCP. For example, we landed a Fortune 500 professional services Company where ZCP was the main driver. This customer purchased Workload Communications for 6,000 workloads, Workload Segmentation or 500 workloads, as well as the entire ZIA bundle for 40,000 employees. [Indiscernible] collaborated with CrowdStrike, our technology partner, and a global SI, our channel partner for this deal. Let me conclude some thoughts on our vision and strategy. We envision a world in which the exchange of information is always secure and seamless.  In today's [Indiscernible] connected digital world, our Zero Trust Exchange secures any to any connectivity for users, applications, workloads, and IOT and OT systems, regardless of their location. And our Analyst Day in January, we laid out our [Indiscernible] the goal of solving 200 million users and 100 million workloads. In order to achieve this goal, we are focused on attracting and developing talent, and creating a culture of excellence. We hired over 1,100 employees over the past year and enabled them to be productive and successful all during the pandemic. We're investing in our people through learning initiatives and building a culture where a global and task workforce can deliver excellence powering our customer success. Our employees are engaged and completely aligned with our mission.  On our last employee survey, 96% of employees understand and believe in the strategic direction of the Company. I'm proud that we are recognized as a great place to work in the 2021 Glassdoor ratings. We are focused on driving broad adoption, in All 4 pillars of our platform, the breadth and depth of our platform is resonating with customers, and are purchasing our higher-end bundles to consolidate the security and networking point products. I believe Zscaler is the go-to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity, and better cyber protection.  As we demonstrated over the last 12 months, we've built a sophisticated go-to-market machine that delivers business value and measurable outcomes at the [Indiscernible] low level. I'm extremely proud of our go-to-market team and how we executed our sales strategy this year. Even with significant growth in our sales force, sales productivity has increased over the prior year, exceeding our expectations. Our Summit Partner Channel program consists of hundreds of clones focus on each other, system integrators, and service providers that are contributing to our deal win and increasing sales leverage. As our market share, reputation, and brand awareness continues to strengthen.  A growing number of Cloud and SaaS providers on integrating with our platform, further strengthening our strategic position with our joint customers. Our expanding ecosystem is contributing to our sales philosophy and broadening our reach. I believe we are on the right track to capture a material share of our $72 billion serviceable markets. We also see additional opportunities to bring Zero Trust to IoT and OT systems. Modal 5G pushes computing further to the edge. opens up additional opportunities for Zscaler. To facilities markets. We have a two-pronged innovation strategy. 1.  Investing aggressively in internal R&D and scaling our world-class engineering organization, which continues to rapidly deliver new products and features. We recently opened a new [Indiscernible] Hub in Israel. And are expanding our [Indiscernible] centers across the U.S., India, Canada, and Spain. to making highly targeted acquisitions to enhance our platform and the same time to market. During fiscal '21, we completed two acquisitions. Trustdome strengthens on the ZCP pillar and positions us better to pursue our shift left strategy.  And Smokescreen enhances our active defense capabilities with honeypot technology. Through internal innovation and highly targeted acquisitions, we will further expand our leadership in the SASE and Zero Trust security markets. In summary, with all these drivers and innovations ahead of [Indiscernible], you can see why we are very excited about our future. Now, I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. Revenue for the quarter was $197 million up 12% sequentially, and 57% year-over-year. VTA product revenue was 17% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue. EMEA was 38% and APJ was 1%. For the full year, revenue was $673 million, up 56% year-over-year. This was an acceleration from the 42% growth we delivered in fiscal 2020. Our total calculated billings grew 70% year-over-year to $332 million with billing duration in the middle of our 10 to 14 months range. We're also pleased that year-over-year growth in short-term billings accelerated to 71% in the fourth quarter, from 61% in the previous quarter.  Our strong billings performance was driven by a record number of new seven-figure annualized contract value deals in the quarter and we sold more of our platform offering. We saw strong growth in our top 5 verticals. Finance, Manufacturing, Services, Healthcare, and Technology. The remaining Performance Obligations or RPO, were 1.553 billion as of July 31, up 98% from one year ago. The current RPO is 49% of the total RPO. Looking at our pillars, ZPA was 27% of our totally new and upsell business in fiscal 2021. Abridging products which include ZDX and ZCP, are tracking ahead of our expectations and contributed high-single digits of our totally new and upsell.  We are seeing strong customer interest and we expect emerging products to contribute a low-teens percentage of our totally new and upsell business in fiscal 2022. The adoption of our emerging products is pacing ahead of ZPA in its early years. In a large opportunity, with all our pillars, and we will continue to expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in the Zero Trust security market. Our strong customer retention, and the ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which was a 128% compared to a 126% last quarter and 120% a year ago.  As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter, while good for our business, our increased success selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster up-sells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 128% is outstanding. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. We had 202 customers with AIR greater than a million dollars up 87% from 108 in the prior year. We also had 1480 customers with an AIR greater than $100,000 which compares with 973 customers last year. Our new customer had accelerated in fiscal '21.  We organically added approximately 1,000 new logos in fiscal '21, excluding acquisitions. And we ended the year with over 5,600 customers expanding our field engagement with smaller enterprises with 2,000 to 6,000 employees, and the increased investments in our partner program are contributing to higher new customer growth. Turning to the rest of our Q4 financial performance, the total gross margin of 80% declined by 1 percentage point Quarter-Over-Quarter and improved by one percentage point year-over-year.  Our total operating expenses increased 15% sequentially and 60% year-over-year to $138 million operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 1 percentage point from 69% a year ago to 70% in the quarter, primarily due to increased hiring and higher compensation expenses, as well as $2 million in expenses related to [Indiscernible], and smokescreen operations. The operating margin was 10% and the free cash flow margin was 14%. We ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Now moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of intangible assets.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $210 million to $212 million reflecting year-over-year growth of 47% to 49%, gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind inventors, but a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation, and CSPM will initially have a lower gross margin in our core products because we're more focused on time-to-market and growth than optimizing them for gross margin. Operating profit in the range of $18 to $19 million, other income of $400 thousand, net of interest payments on senior convertible notes, income taxes of $1.2 million. Earnings per share of approximately $0.12, assuming 148 million fully diluted shares.  For the full-year fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $940 million to $950 million or year-over-year growth of 40% to 41%. Calculated billings in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion for year-over-year growth of 3% to 34%. We expect our first-half mix to be approximately 42% of our full-year billings, which is in line with the average of the last 3 to 4 years. Operating profit in the range of $85 million to $90 million earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.56, assuming approximately 149 to 150 million fully diluted shares. Please note that our share count guidance now includes dilution from our convertible debentures.  We have a capped call with a strike price of $246.76, every $10 increase in our stock price above the strike price will add 250 thousand to 300 thousand shares to our fully diluted share count. For your modeling purposes, I would like to discuss the anticipated [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible] impact on fiscal 2022 operating expenses. In fiscal 2021, we saw a 280-basis point benefit to margins from lower teeny compared to fiscal 2020, with plans for in-person meetings. And events in the second half of this year, including sales conferences in Q3, [Indiscernible] in Q4, we expect teeny as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 250 to 300 basis points higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. As mentioned previously, the recent acquisitions of Trustdome & Smokescreen are expected to have an immaterial impact on revenue in fiscal 2022.  We expect to incur approximately $13 million to $15 million in operating expenses to further invest in these products and incorporate their technologies into our platforms. This was incorporated into our guidance. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our businesses growing. At our Analyst Day with consensus estimates at that time, reflecting approximately 30% revenue CAGAR. We outline our target.  Good, I'm achieving 20 to 22% operating margins in fiscal 2024, which implied 300 basis points of margin expansion per year. Since then, we have delivered outstanding results with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. If we continue to have high growth and strong unit economics, we'll prioritize investing in the business, which would lead to lower than 300 basis points of margin expansion per year.  To that point, our fiscal 2022 guidance of 40 to 41% revenue growth and 9 to 9.5% operating margins reflects approximately 150 to 200 basis points of margin expansion after adjusting for the increased T&E and M&A expenses. We remain confident of reaching 20 to 22% operating margins in the long term. But growth will continue to take priority considering our strong business momentum. With a huge market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we're committed to investing aggressively in our Company. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. You may proceed with your question.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you very much. As we're looking out into the New Year, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the type of expansion you're planning relative to the sales capacity.  You've been extremely aggressive over the last year and infect, as I understand it, increased your targets three times over the course of the year. Certainly, the environment is extremely robust. Can you talk about where you're going as we go into the new fiscal year? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: I'll start with that, Alex, then Jay can come in. If you're right, though the thing that we called out in the call is that we're seeing strong momentum for our business and particularly in the second half and you're absolutely correct.  We did increase our field quota sales reps by. Number in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. As we go forward, we will be making continued investments in our sales organization, as well as marketing and also channel. But that's only a piece of it. And again, we will be increasing the number of headcounts for [Indiscernible] fuel quota sales reps in fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21.  But more broadly speaking, the opportunity is so big, we're going to continue to invest throughout the Company to really position ourselves to move forward and really be a substantial Company that's operating efficiently. That's across all areas.  RD, GNA, and an in our cloud. I started with Z-scalar. We're doing about 35 billion transactions a day were upwards. I don't know what the number is now, but I know it\u2019s well north of 160 billion transactions per day. It is critical if you're a Cloud Company like Zscaler, to provide a reliable service that customers can rely on to ensure they are operating efficiently and securely.  So, our focus is going forward. This can be brought throughout the Company, but with continuing to invest in sales and marketing and will increase part field rep sales headcount more in fiscal 22 versus fiscal '21.\nJay Chaudhry: Very well said. I don't think I need to add a whole lot more. We are hitting on all cylinders, I'm very excited.\nAlex Henderson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. You may proceed with your question.\nMatt Swanson: Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. If I could just dive in a little bit more to those guttural operators. Great color today on the call Jay. But when we're thinking about that Zero Trust directive.  You have really unique visibility both into the federal space with 100 customers and then obviously on the Zero Trust leader, what do you think the gap is right now in the current federal environment to achieving a Zero Trust framework and then I thought you can give us some kind of magnitude and the duration of the opportunity, suppose 3 months from now that mandate became mandatory for all federal environment skipped [Indiscernible] Zero Trust. How big is that GAAP?\nJay Chaudhry: If you think of where federal market. It's largely today doing network security. It's largely castle-and-moat depending on firewalls, VPNs, and the like. The good thing is that the Biden administration has recognized that Zero Trust. Architecture has to be done since great.  To see that IO is focused on implementing zero-cost. And look where we stand is, we started investing in the federal market about 3.5 years ago and got all the certifications that are needed and we also have the right architecture and we've built the sizable team. We already have pretty good business, but we're barely scratching the sub-business, the federal market, I think a lot of things have to do with education.  Good thing is that [Indiscernible] and some of the new meetings that Biden administration is having big high-profile CEOs [Indiscernible] is there anything visibility in the space, we aren't participating in some of these new pilots. All in all, we're excited, but we also know that some of these federal deals take their own time.\nMatt Swanson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montreal. You may proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Yes. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a little bit about the net retention rate was very strong this quarter. But you seem to be signaling that there may be some tension on the number, so I was wondering if you could comment on how investors should be thinking about the net retention rate as we lookout.  In particular, I did want to reference some of the information you provided at the Analyst Day where you talked about. Significant expansion on the annual price per user, both in the user Protection category and the workload protection category, as well as just seat growth.  So, I am just -- I'm a little bit surprised to hear you almost down -- I guess, downplay that 128 number, but if you could just talk a little bit about how investors should think about that over the next fiscal year. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: I'll start then Remo can add on. I think our comments on net retention rates have been consistent since we went public and here's the real thing, if I were a one-product Company, then it matters, new logo upsells, all those things. We are such a big platform that's growing rapidly.  We launched an internal debase, should we really pay sales are up more for new logo versus upsell. The answer is we really want to grow the overall new ACV, whether it's coming from upsell or coming from the new logo. So, the message is not to really say downplay, net retention rate. The message is the net retention rate by itself is not a good indicator. What we're doing is good.  We are proud of 128, I'll be proud of 125 too because if I can sell a bigger platform upfront, I'm okay with a lower NRO. That's the message. We are happy that bullish but this metrics by itself is not the best thing as a leading indicator. Follow along with that.\nRemo Canessa: Jay is absolutely 100% correct this because we talked about it on prior calls, the only time we understand the importance of net retention rate is because of basically our compensation structure which we pay the same for new and upsell. We really don't look at it until we have projections of what we're going to do during the quarter. We really look at it at the end of the Quarter.  Now, having said that, that you take a look at what we're -- what we talked about at the Analyst Day and you're absolutely right Keith, with the opportunity to sell at a higher price point than we've talked about for the users for 5 000 users, we expect to have basically a price point about a $145 per user.  We are seeing that. And so, we are seeing basically companies that are buying ZIA add-on, ZPA, and ZDX, we're seeing those types of dollar amounts. So, the other point which we haven't talked about, the average revenue per user is increasing substantially. And so, what we're seeing, is that we are seeing customers buy our broader platform. We're seeing customers who are actually buying ZCP and not buying the user protection initially. So, all indications are that things are going well. The net retention rate, the positive impacts are the new products. If you take a look at the number of Global 2,000 companies that have both ZIA and ZPA it's 44%.  So, I wouldn't take our comments related to the net retention rate that it's going to go down. We don't -- we really just don't focus on it and we're just trying to really condition our investors to really think about the broader platform we have both new and upsell and basically our top-line growth.\nKeith Bachman: Perfect, many thanks.\nRemo Canessa: No problem.\nOperator: Thank you, your next question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed with your question.\nMike Walkley: Great, thank you. Congratulations on the strong quarter in a year. Maybe just building on that last answer a little bit. You've highlighted the enterprise segment targeting 2,000 to 6,000 employees as your fastest-growing segment.  Did these smaller customers with the faster sales cycle, do they have a similar land as your larger customers and have a long runway for upselling or are they landing with a large amount of your platform?\nJay Chaudhry: Overall cost about today, whether as new enterprise segment of larger, one more and more, they're buying bigger and bigger platforms. It is true that enterprises are probably too good [Indiscernible] 6-K tends to go a little bit bigger from the start.  But it's a shorter sales cycle. And these guys have the same risk of [Indiscernible] similar tax and I'd like to understand. So, we're actually surprised to see how much traction we are getting in the segment in the past few quarters since we focused on it.\nRemo Canessa: The focus also in an enterprise is through our Summit program we put in place a year ago. So, we are seeing strong traction through our Summit program. And the Summit program is geared towards those customers in the next 2,000 to 6,000 range.  So very positive feedback, very positive. As a result, as they mentioned over this past year, and we're excited that this is an opportunity, as they mentioned, our fastest-growing segment. And we're excited about that opportunity.\nMike Walkley: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] you may proceed with your question.\nJonathan: Congratulations on the strong stronger. Jay, this is probably more for you, but when you look at the publicly traded firewall vendors, they're clearly experiencing very strong demand trends for -- for their virtual firewalls, for Cloud, Cloud applications, and cloud environments.  And I'm just wondering, how do you reconcile that with your comments around the benefits of a proxy, I mean, doesn't it seem to suggest that there could be different approaches, different architectures to securing Cloud.\nJay Chaudhry: I think about this quite a bit. If you would have called 34 years ago, we were asked this question quite a bit and this was being asked. Why are these proxy vendors like Bluecore still posting good numbers? I was telling them that we have barely made an impact.  A lot of traffic was so going through those proxy appliances in the data center, as you look at the local breakout business that's not their primary vendor itself. Others yes, have come out there. But the majority of the enterprise traffic still goes through a hub-and-spoke network, it's still going through a data center, it still goes through those firewalls.  If your traffic year-over-year goes up by 33%, you\u2019ll end up getting more data center devices, whether it's firewalls or other stuff. I think then you get to a certain level whereas traffic shifts significantly, the spend will shift. That's my personal view. So not surprised that why its legacy devices like firewalls are still growing. I think it's a matter of time.\nJonathan: Right. That's helpful, Jay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gray Powell with BTIG, may proceed with your question.\nGray Powell: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the strong results. So yes, I just I'm curious. Like, how are you thinking about the potential to increase the pricing on renewals, particularly now that cloud-based that were Securities more mainstream and the sales process is less evangelical olden say three or 4 years ago?\nJay Chaudhry: I want to be looking at increasing the renewal price? Is that what the questions are?\nGray Powell: Yes. Exactly.\nJay Chaudhry: Right. Our biggest increase in price is coming from selling bigger bundles. And there is some increase in price on each module, but that pace at which we're expanding our portfolio is quite significant and as customers see the value, and because we show business value, the increase in price per customer from ACV point-of-view becomes a natural thing.  Again, if you if we were to compete on price, if it competes on say, I'm a better firewall than those firewalls, then it gets hard. We don't really compete to replace our given firewall or proxy. We are the enabler of secured digital transformation.  A sale is often driven by the CIO to head of infrastructure to head of security. When they look at the amount of money, we can save them to replace all these legacy firewalls, security, and networking devices. The ROI is very impressive to justify, our price becomes a lot easier. So, value-based business, value-based pricing is what we have advocated.\nGray Powell: Yes, I think so, maybe I could have asked the question better, I guess my understanding was four or five years ago, you had to be more aggressive just because I mean, Fastly wasn't even an EBITDA turn back then, than people were less comfortable having security in the cloud today it's more mainstream. So, I thought I'd give you. More ability to increase prices. That was my question.\nJay Chaudhry: Yeah. I would think, yes, we have done some price increases on the original products, but a big increase has come from adding allotment modules. If you look at the time of IPO 3 1/2 years ago, it was largely secured Web Gateway with a few things.  It was largely a business bundle sale or professional bundle. Today, what we're selling is very different than what we sold 3 years ago, very different than what we sold one year ago. The [Indiscernible] the market that gotten [Indiscernible] is a very expensive market, it includes everything you need to have at what used to be the network security level.  I'm [Indiscernible] in these kinds of private access. It's not just a VPN replacement. It eliminates the need for a higher inbound DMZ. That's a big thing. So, as we expand our platform, it further differentiates us. It further consolidates its point products. We love the fact that the market is moving so fast, so rapidly, and we are innovating soft fast. That's why we think it will be very hard for some of the mid-2s to come from behind and catch up with us.\nGray Powell: Understood. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Jay, perhaps the question for you. So last year, Zscaler saw a huge uptick in demand with the Zscaler private access solution. To what extent are those customers who may have bought perhaps smaller licenses or perhaps temporary licenses last year, are coming back now as they renew and signing larger perhaps [Indiscernible] as you guys\u2019 progress to the next few quarters?\nJay Chaudhry: So last year, when customers needed to buy ZPA, and I should with inventory during our earnings sales that very few, if any, temporary licenses. Okay. The one-year deals. Most spec deals were done with us on a month's databases.  And when they've on ZPA during the pandemic, most of the time, it was not for a subset of users. It was nearly done for most of the users. So, from our point of view, that sale that got made last year was really made for the long term. Is that impacting us in the short term?  Not really, but having said that on reselling more and more ZPA to every ZIA customer, absolutely. No other market thinks that ZIA and ZPA together should be bought because once you have both of them together, you can access any application from [Indiscernible] In fact, Gartner has further clarified SaaS positioning.  It's kind of interesting, SASE was a good loose framework, but it was confusing to some degree because it kind of got interpreted as it's the network and SD ban and security must be with a single vendor. Not true.  In fact, Gartner has a new position paper that came out about a month or two, which basically said the security part of SSE, a Secure Service Edge, and SSE. And there's a new end-to that will come out Magic Quadrant they'll come out in X months. And the second part that decoupled the Network part of it, they're calling it wireless than the edge.  And that's where the SD-WAN park 60. We have the most comprehensive offering of what Gartner is calling now, secured service hedge, that's really what gives us differentiation that allows us to compete and win and charge good prices and really make sure ZIA [Indiscernible] gets sold to every user, not just a subset of users.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with [Indiscernible]. Please proceed with your question.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on results and guidance. Jay, want to go back to the difficult competitive landscape question. I know when we've been discussing that as of late, but just wanted to check out if there is anything new or anyone new that has come to mind as of late, some of these have been seeing in a more pronounced way, operating within your markets. Thank you for that.\nJay Chaudhry: All-in-all., if you ask me, has the landscape changed significantly in terms of players out there? Not really. The biggest change in the landscape, it\u2019s in the Workload posture market in the Cloud Protection [Indiscernible].  When it comes to SaaS, ZIA ZCP competition, there's not a whole lot. Now there is a fair amount of noise that's coming out there. Because when Legacy network security vendors are getting disrupted, they must do something to make noise so they really don't become extinct, that's why we do it here good every saw fundamental Customer SaaS. Although I am doing my firewall VPN in the Cloud, that is Zero Trust right. Now, Zero Trust and firewall or VP in the Cloud doesn\u2019t go together. So, if you ask me one of the main things, we need to make sure is be clear that you can go to Zero Trust Architecture with firewalls and VPNs. The good thing is smart folks like NIST and Gartner on helping that area.  But our momentum is building, businesses are doing good and we want to keep on investing aggressively as Remo said, to take a big share of this increasing, evolving sizable market. The last one I want to make is, the number of modules we saw sell today on average, versus a year ago, versus 3 years ago has increased significantly, which is very good. It's no longer the status quo [Indiscernible] firewall or secured [Indiscernible] re-market. Did I make sense?\nShaul Eyal: Got it.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nShaul Eyal: Absolutely. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Hey, Remo, I want to ask a nitpicky question. Obviously, the results are fantastic, well above guidance and expectation. But given that the current RPO has accelerated for three straight quarters, short-term deferred revenue accelerated. Billings calculated remained at 70%. Why would revenue actually tick down a couple of percent? Why wouldn't it tick up?\nRemo Canessa: Hurley, you know me pretty well. I think for 20 years, our philosophy related to guidance is to be prudent. And we're continuing to be prudent with our guidance. Everything you called out is 100% correct. But what I tried to do that SeaScape since I've come here is basically, I don't want to look back. I want to look forward. I want to give ourselves the ability to really run the business.\nUnidentified Analyst: I was asking --\nRemo Canessa: -- So, your guidance.\nUnidentified Analyst: I was asking about the Current Quarter. The Quarter you just reported the 56 and change versus --\nRemo Canessa: I get it, I get it --\nUnidentified Analyst: I know.\nRemo Canessa: Got it.\nUnidentified Analyst: I got ramps\nRemo Canessa: Okay, I got it, I'm sorry.\nUnidentified Analyst:  [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] I think that may have impacted [Indiscernible].\nRemo Canessa: No, I've got it. Thank you. So, it's really linearity-based. And if you take a look at it, in Q4 of 20 last year, related to the COVID impact that we had. We had strong billings growth is basically the first part of the quarter. Since Q4 21 went to more normalized.  So that is what primarily impacted the revenue of growing. 57% in Q4. Now, when you take a look at Q3, 20 versus Q3 21, just the opposite effect occurred with COVID in Q3 of 20, what happened was that the world basically, I don't want to say stop, but really slowed down in March time frame, even early April.  So, the linearity in Q3 last year was lower. For Q3 of 21, this year could be linearity was more normalized. So, we had 60% revenue growth in Q3 21 versus Q3 20. And we had 57% revenue growth in Q4. For 21 versus Q4, 20 are directly related to the impact of COVID-19. In addition, in addition, Sterling, there's one other element which is basically when you take a look at the large number of deals that we have, but we called out a million-dollar type deals. A lot of those deals have ramps. So, with those ramps, you're not going to get the full revenue in that current quarter. That's a smaller part of it. But that is a part of it. But the majority of it is related to linearity.\nUnidentified Analyst: Remo, thank you. Appreciate it.\nRemo Canessa: No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nBrian Essex: Yes, good afternoon and thank you for my -- for taking my question. Jay, I'd love it if you Cloud characterize the nature of enterprise adoption on your platform, primarily from the perspective of enabling meaningful change in digital transformation and a shift in architecture versus maybe, more evolving with a large enterprise and enabling them to get started down that journey.  Is there any difference this year versus last year? And maybe if you could characterize the Environment of basically enabling a big architectural shift as opposed to enabling, I guess a slower migration towards your technology platform.\nJay Chaudhry: Brian great question. The biggest shift got caused by COVID. Before COVID, enterprises used to think about, I don't think Zscaler with network transformation branches being broken into the local breaker and the like, with COVID, since network got an outer loop, the enterprise said, I'm going to download this [Indiscernible] agent.  And I'm ready to go with ZIA to external applications, ZPA to internal applications. That mindset is still there. I love it because when you don't have to deal with the net for your sales and deployments go much faster. So, our Phase one.  These days are getting everyone turn ON from wherever they are. Phase two ends up being, let's do local breakout for network transformation. And then Phase III ends up being, let's look at the Cloud workload protection and the like. So, it is evolving and it's evolving, but things are moving at a faster phase. faster pace\nBrian Essex: Got it. That's helpful context. Thank you very much.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with GMP Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nErik Suppiger: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a very strong quarter. Say, Remo, I think you had mentioned that pricing is around $145 for an organization of 5,000 users. Can you remind us where that was? About a year ago?  And then also, you talked about some accounts that have been buying the full breadth of modules for VIA, what kind of discount do you give to that customer when they buy the full breadth of modules?\nRemo Canessa: We\u2019re not -- first of all, I don't want to get into how math much is for discounting customers because that's more competitive. The when, when you take a look at those 5,000 users, the $145 that's how much that we're seeing customers 5,000 users paying for the full complement of our offerings.  Now, with that, ZDX is new okay. ZIA which is $25 of that $145, largely the ZIA add-ons are new, related to browser isolation, DLP, and CASB out-of-band, and that's around $30. If a customer buys the full Transformation level, which is, we have three bundles, probe business transformation, it's about $45 and ZPA is about $45 also.  Whereas a gone from a price per user basis overall, year-over-year, we're seeing between 35% and 40% increased price per user on a year-over-year basis. So that's kind of put in the context of what we're seeing and again, that increase in price per user, it\u2019s related to customers buying more of our platform and also expanding their business with these scaling.\nErik Suppiger: And do you think that 35% to 40% is that sustainable going into next year given the accelerating expansion of the portfolio?\nRemo Canessa: I don't want to comment related to the expansion. I don't want to make those types of Forward-looking statements. But if you step back and take a look at the importance of the platform that we're selling and also more customers buying more of our platform. In addition to that with the new products we talked about, our emerging products represent high single-digits of our new and upsell business.  As we go forward, we're seeing the emerging products represent low team basically of our new and upsell business in fiscal '22. As the market evolves and like the comments [Indiscernible] made, we're not in the same place we were 4 years ago, or 3 years ago, or even 2 years ago. And so, my expectation is that we'll continue to see increased pricing, but I don't want to quantify it. And we'll just report on it as we go forward.\nErik Suppiger: That's great. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question.\nJustin Kessler: Hey guys, this is Justin on for Rob. I just want to double-click on the commentary around the federal business. I know you guys usually put it around mid-single-digits of new ACV in prior quarters, any sense at this was higher in the current Quarter and then maybe some assumptions for the federal business in the pipeline and the guidance for next year. Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: I'll start it Jay, so federal in the Current Quarter was mid to higher single digits in Q4. As Jay talked about, the Federal business for us with the executive order from President Biden, as well as federal embracing and Zero Trust, and also our investment with our certification in our field organization that we have in federal.  We feel very good about it. Now, how's it going to play through in fiscal '22? We'll say we feel there's a very big opportunity and we also feel that could be a substantial portion of our business. But it takes time with federal, but we're well well-positioned. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Yeah. I think the pipeline is good, we have all the certifications, right architecture that the federal government recognizes. But acquiring Zero Trust Architecture, we are investing and pretty positive and confident.\nJustin Kessler: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: With that, I will like to thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. Revenue for the quarter was $197 million up 12% sequentially, and 57% year-over-year. VTA product revenue was 17% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue. EMEA was 38% and APJ was 1%. For the full year, revenue was $673 million, up 56% year-over-year. This was an acceleration from the 42% growth we delivered in fiscal 2020. Our total calculated billings grew 70% year-over-year to $332 million with billing duration in the middle of our 10 to 14 months range. We're also pleased that year-over-year growth in short-term billings accelerated to 71% in the fourth quarter, from 61% in the previous quarter.  Our strong billings performance was driven by a record number of new seven-figure annualized contract value deals in the quarter and we sold more of our platform offering. We saw strong growth in our top 5 verticals. Finance, Manufacturing, Services, Healthcare, and Technology. The remaining Performance Obligations or RPO, were 1.553 billion as of July 31, up 98% from one year ago. The current RPO is 49% of the total RPO. Looking at our pillars, ZPA was 27% of our totally new and upsell business in fiscal 2021. Abridging products which include ZDX and ZCP, are tracking ahead of our expectations and contributed high-single digits of our totally new and upsell.  We are seeing strong customer interest and we expect emerging products to contribute a low-teens percentage of our totally new and upsell business in fiscal 2022. The adoption of our emerging products is pacing ahead of ZPA in its early years. In a large opportunity, with all our pillars, and we will continue to expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in the Zero Trust security market. Our strong customer retention, and the ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which was a 128% compared to a 126% last quarter and 120% a year ago.  As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter, while good for our business, our increased success selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster up-sells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 128% is outstanding. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. We had 202 customers with AIR greater than a million dollars up 87% from 108 in the prior year. We also had 1480 customers with an AIR greater than $100,000 which compares with 973 customers last year. Our new customer had accelerated in fiscal '21.  We organically added approximately 1,000 new logos in fiscal '21, excluding acquisitions. And we ended the year with over 5,600 customers expanding our field engagement with smaller enterprises with 2,000 to 6,000 employees, and the increased investments in our partner program are contributing to higher new customer growth. Turning to the rest of our Q4 financial performance, the total gross margin of 80% declined by 1 percentage point Quarter-Over-Quarter and improved by one percentage point year-over-year.  Our total operating expenses increased 15% sequentially and 60% year-over-year to $138 million operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by 1 percentage point from 69% a year ago to 70% in the quarter, primarily due to increased hiring and higher compensation expenses, as well as $2 million in expenses related to [Indiscernible], and smokescreen operations. The operating margin was 10% and the free cash flow margin was 14%. We ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Now moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of intangible assets.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $210 million to $212 million reflecting year-over-year growth of 47% to 49%, gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind inventors, but a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation, and CSPM will initially have a lower gross margin in our core products because we're more focused on time-to-market and growth than optimizing them for gross margin. Operating profit in the range of $18 to $19 million, other income of $400 thousand, net of interest payments on senior convertible notes, income taxes of $1.2 million. Earnings per share of approximately $0.12, assuming 148 million fully diluted shares.  For the full-year fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $940 million to $950 million or year-over-year growth of 40% to 41%. Calculated billings in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion for year-over-year growth of 3% to 34%. We expect our first-half mix to be approximately 42% of our full-year billings, which is in line with the average of the last 3 to 4 years. Operating profit in the range of $85 million to $90 million earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.56, assuming approximately 149 to 150 million fully diluted shares. Please note that our share count guidance now includes dilution from our convertible debentures.  We have a capped call with a strike price of $246.76, every $10 increase in our stock price above the strike price will add 250 thousand to 300 thousand shares to our fully diluted share count. For your modeling purposes, I would like to discuss the anticipated [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible] impact on fiscal 2022 operating expenses. In fiscal 2021, we saw a 280-basis point benefit to margins from lower teeny compared to fiscal 2020, with plans for in-person meetings. And events in the second half of this year, including sales conferences in Q3, [Indiscernible] in Q4, we expect teeny as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 250 to 300 basis points higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021. As mentioned previously, the recent acquisitions of Trustdome & Smokescreen are expected to have an immaterial impact on revenue in fiscal 2022.  We expect to incur approximately $13 million to $15 million in operating expenses to further invest in these products and incorporate their technologies into our platforms. This was incorporated into our guidance. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our businesses growing. At our Analyst Day with consensus estimates at that time, reflecting approximately 30% revenue CAGAR. We outline our target.  Good, I'm achieving 20 to 22% operating margins in fiscal 2024, which implied 300 basis points of margin expansion per year. Since then, we have delivered outstanding results with revenue growth exceeding our expectations. If we continue to have high growth and strong unit economics, we'll prioritize investing in the business, which would lead to lower than 300 basis points of margin expansion per year.  To that point, our fiscal 2022 guidance of 40 to 41% revenue growth and 9 to 9.5% operating margins reflects approximately 150 to 200 basis points of margin expansion after adjusting for the increased T&E and M&A expenses. We remain confident of reaching 20 to 22% operating margins in the long term. But growth will continue to take priority considering our strong business momentum. With a huge market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we're committed to investing aggressively in our Company. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. I'll start with that, Alex, then Jay can come in. If you're right, though the thing that we called out in the call is that we're seeing strong momentum for our business and particularly in the second half and you're absolutely correct.  We did increase our field quota sales reps by. Number in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. As we go forward, we will be making continued investments in our sales organization, as well as marketing and also channel. But that's only a piece of it. And again, we will be increasing the number of headcounts for [Indiscernible] fuel quota sales reps in fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21.  But more broadly speaking, the opportunity is so big, we're going to continue to invest throughout the Company to really position ourselves to move forward and really be a substantial Company that's operating efficiently. That's across all areas.  RD, GNA, and an in our cloud. I started with Z-scalar. We're doing about 35 billion transactions a day were upwards. I don't know what the number is now, but I know it's well north of 160 billion transactions per day. It is critical if you're a Cloud Company like Zscaler, to provide a reliable service that customers can rely on to ensure they are operating efficiently and securely.  So, our focus is going forward. This can be brought throughout the Company, but with continuing to invest in sales and marketing and will increase part field rep sales headcount more in fiscal 22 versus fiscal '21. Jay is absolutely 100% correct this because we talked about it on prior calls, the only time we understand the importance of net retention rate is because of basically our compensation structure which we pay the same for new and upsell. We really don't look at it until we have projections of what we're going to do during the quarter. We really look at it at the end of the Quarter.  Now, having said that, that you take a look at what we're -- what we talked about at the Analyst Day and you're absolutely right Keith, with the opportunity to sell at a higher price point than we've talked about for the users for 5 000 users, we expect to have basically a price point about a $145 per user.  We are seeing that. And so, we are seeing basically companies that are buying ZIA add-on, ZPA, and ZDX, we're seeing those types of dollar amounts. So, the other point which we haven't talked about, the average revenue per user is increasing substantially. And so, what we're seeing, is that we are seeing customers buy our broader platform. We're seeing customers who are actually buying ZCP and not buying the user protection initially. So, all indications are that things are going well. The net retention rate, the positive impacts are the new products. If you take a look at the number of Global 2,000 companies that have both ZIA and ZPA it's 44%.  So, I wouldn't take our comments related to the net retention rate that it's going to go down. We don't -- we really just don't focus on it and we're just trying to really condition our investors to really think about the broader platform we have both new and upsell and basically our top-line growth. No problem. The focus also in an enterprise is through our Summit program we put in place a year ago. So, we are seeing strong traction through our Summit program. And the Summit program is geared towards those customers in the next 2,000 to 6,000 range.  So very positive feedback, very positive. As a result, as they mentioned over this past year, and we're excited that this is an opportunity, as they mentioned, our fastest-growing segment. And we're excited about that opportunity. Hurley, you know me pretty well. I think for 20 years, our philosophy related to guidance is to be prudent. And we're continuing to be prudent with our guidance. Everything you called out is 100% correct. But what I tried to do that SeaScape since I've come here is basically, I don't want to look back. I want to look forward. I want to give ourselves the ability to really run the business. -- So, your guidance. I get it, I get it -- Got it. Okay, I got it, I'm sorry. No, I've got it. Thank you. So, it's really linearity-based. And if you take a look at it, in Q4 of 20 last year, related to the COVID impact that we had. We had strong billings growth is basically the first part of the quarter. Since Q4 21 went to more normalized.  So that is what primarily impacted the revenue of growing. 57% in Q4. Now, when you take a look at Q3, 20 versus Q3 21, just the opposite effect occurred with COVID in Q3 of 20, what happened was that the world basically, I don't want to say stop, but really slowed down in March time frame, even early April.  So, the linearity in Q3 last year was lower. For Q3 of 21, this year could be linearity was more normalized. So, we had 60% revenue growth in Q3 21 versus Q3 20. And we had 57% revenue growth in Q4. For 21 versus Q4, 20 are directly related to the impact of COVID-19. In addition, in addition, Sterling, there's one other element which is basically when you take a look at the large number of deals that we have, but we called out a million-dollar type deals. A lot of those deals have ramps. So, with those ramps, you're not going to get the full revenue in that current quarter. That's a smaller part of it. But that is a part of it. But the majority of it is related to linearity. No problem. We're not -- first of all, I don't want to get into how math much is for discounting customers because that's more competitive. The when, when you take a look at those 5,000 users, the $145 that's how much that we're seeing customers 5,000 users paying for the full complement of our offerings.  Now, with that, ZDX is new okay. ZIA which is $25 of that $145, largely the ZIA add-ons are new, related to browser isolation, DLP, and CASB out-of-band, and that's around $30. If a customer buys the full Transformation level, which is, we have three bundles, probe business transformation, it's about $45 and ZPA is about $45 also.  Whereas a gone from a price per user basis overall, year-over-year, we're seeing between 35% and 40% increased price per user on a year-over-year basis. So that's kind of put in the context of what we're seeing and again, that increase in price per user, it's related to customers buying more of our platform and also expanding their business with these scaling. I don't want to comment related to the expansion. I don't want to make those types of Forward-looking statements. But if you step back and take a look at the importance of the platform that we're selling and also more customers buying more of our platform. In addition to that with the new products we talked about, our emerging products represent high single-digits of our new and upsell business.  As we go forward, we're seeing the emerging products represent low team basically of our new and upsell business in fiscal '22. As the market evolves and like the comments [Indiscernible] made, we're not in the same place we were 4 years ago, or 3 years ago, or even 2 years ago. And so, my expectation is that we'll continue to see increased pricing, but I don't want to quantify it. And we'll just report on it as we go forward. Thank you. I'll start it Jay, so federal in the Current Quarter was mid to higher single digits in Q4. As Jay talked about, the Federal business for us with the executive order from President Biden, as well as federal embracing and Zero Trust, and also our investment with our certification in our field organization that we have in federal.  We feel very good about it. Now, how's it going to play through in fiscal '22? We'll say we feel there's a very big opportunity and we also feel that could be a substantial portion of our business. But it takes time with federal, but we're well well-positioned. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jay. Thank you. Goodbye."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. We had a very strong quarter to close out spectacularly in Q4. we delivered growth of 57% in revenue and 70% in billings as customers embraced our expanded cloud platform to accelerate. Each told transformation. Let me share a few highlights of fiscal 2021, our full-year revenue grew 56% to $673 million and billings grew 70% to reach $934 billion. We are seeing revenue growth across all verticals, customer segments, and geographies. 51% of revenue was from outside the United States. I'm very excited to see our ARR approaching $1 billion and pleased to note that our new annualized bookings and new logo acquisition accelerated throughout the year.  All product pillars of our platform saws strong demand. Notably, ZPA revenue surpassed $100 million in fiscal 2021, growing 166% year-over-year. To increase cyber security risks and accelerating digital transformation, have increased the need for our Zero Trust architecture. We're uniquely positioned to reduce business and make businesses at trial and more competitive. We are the only cloud provider at scale with a proxy-based architecture to deliver through zero-trust security. Finally, loan and VP and based castle-and-moat security connect users to the corporate network, which facilitates lateral movement of Trex, increasing cyber risks.  Zscaler connects users only to applications, now to the network of the core principle of Zero Trust architecture that reduces then similar tax and other cyber risks. Build from the start to enforce policy at the edge, as advocated by the SASE framework. That this color Cloud spends 150 datacenters with five-nines availability, providing fast and secure access to all applications. whether in you with a data center or in a multi-Cloud environment. Because of these architectural advantages and our proven ability to scale [Indiscernible] Zero Trust Exchange has become the foundation for big sold Transformation. With a record number of seven-figure ACV deals in Q4.  We now have over 200 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR. Over 5,600 enterprises, including 35% of the Fortune 500, Trust Zscaler, to secure their transformation journey. While the entries Net Promoter Score of fast companies is 30, Zscalers is 74, which is 2.5 times higher, proof out the values these killers deliver. Now, I will like to discuss the fee market segment. We have made significant progress during the quarter and the fiscal year. First, the financial service sector has become our top vertical. These companies are embracing the cloud and Office 365. Let me highlight 3 new customer wins in Q4 for the purchase of ZIA and ZPA together.  First-day as, a global bank that's adopting a Zero Trust strategy to protect over 100,000 employees with our high-end. and ZPA bundle. They've purchased every module we offer in the CIS color, including firewall, Sandbox, CASB, DLP, and browser isolation. Fast user experience and enhanced Cybersecurity were the key factors in our win. Our second new logo win is a Fortune 500 asset management Company that purchased ZIA and ZPA to secure over 30, 000 employees.  And third is a Fortune 500 insurance Company that purchased ZIA CPA CPA or 26,000 employees to enable work-from-anywhere. These wins illustrate when companies are ready to embrace the cloud, Zscaler is the only cloud-native multi-tenant platform that meets the need. With security as a major requirement, these financial services customers only considered a proxy architecture that can provide SSL inspection at scale. and rejected firewall based on the detection. We now count eight of the top ten global banks and seven of the top ten insurance companies outside of China as our customers.  Next, let me highlight our progress in the enterprise market segment, which includes organizations with 2,000 to 6000 employees. We started focusing on the segment at the start of fiscal 21, and the results have exceeded our expectations. This segment includes over 12,000 organizations representing $8 billion of our serviceable market for user protection. DU sizes in the segment are growing as customers adopt more of our platform. I'm excited to see our first seven-figure upsell win in our enterprise segment, whether the customer is buying all four pillars off our platform. ZPA and CDx for 6 thousand users. And CCP Workload Segmentation for almost 3,000 servers. Our ARR with this customer now exceeds $1.5 million, validating a significant opportunity in this market segment.  To further penetrate the segment, we are developing targeted marketing programs, significantly growing our sales team, and doubling down on our Summit Partner program to recruit and enable channel partners to drive further sales leverage. Finally, we continue to invest to capture a large federal opportunity, with a sizable Fed sales team and the highest FedRAMP certifications, we count well over 100 government agencies, and federal integrators as customers. In Q4 alone, we added over 20 new federal customers, including 4 with over $1 million in annual contract value.  Each purchasing ZIA and ZPA together. Driven by the President's recent Executive order, we're seeing increased interest in our Zero Trust Exchange across all levels of the government. We are among a select group of companies chosen by NIST, our national standards body, run a pilot program in support of the executive order. We are excited about this opportunity to help our country dramatically improve our security posture while significantly reducing legacy IT costs. Next, let me highlight our technology innovations and emerging products which are expanding our opportunities.  We started with a highly scalable, multi - [Indiscernible], globally distributed cloud capable of providing in-line inspectional Internet and SaaS traffic with ZI, and securing access to private applications with ZP. Over the past few, we extended our platform to protect cloud workflows and to manage the digital user experience. We're very excited about the early traction of our emerging products, the next growth engines for us. Our emerging products contributed a high single-digit percentage of new and upsell business in fiscal '21, which is well ahead of our expectations.  CDx is the fastest-growing solution in our history. And a natural complement to ZIA and ZPA. With a single lightweight endpoint agent. It is frictionless to turn on ZDX to provide end-to-end visibility to help resolve performance issues for every Zscaler user. In Q4, one of our largest ZDX deals came from a Fortune 500 tech Company. The purchase of the entire ZIA portfolio, as well as ZPA and ZDX, all 60,000 employees to support work-from-anywhere while embracing Zero Trust architecture. We were pleasantly surprised to see so many large enterprises adopt ZDX so rapidly. Under notable CDx explains include a Fortune 500 RevPAR Company for 70 thousand users, a Fortune 50 energy Company for 55 thousand users, a Fortune 500 European bank for 39,000 users and industrial and manufacturing Company for 28,000 users, and a healthcare Company for 25,000 users.  I believe that every ZIA and ZPA customer will embrace ZDX as user experience is one of the highest priorities of our CIO. We're receiving very positive feedback from customers. Our fortunate 600 healthcare executive indicated ZDX contributor to an 18.0 gain in employee net Promoter score for the IT service task, in two Quarters. And after having disrupted premier best security with our Zero Trust Exchange for users, our next big opportunity is to bring Zero Trust to workloads with Zscaler Cloud Protection or ZCP. Every organization is building its applications in the Cloud. And we'll look to implement Zero Trust security to protect workloads.  Our Zero Trust exchange securely connects workloads to workloads and processes to process, using business policies, eliminating the need for traditional networks and associated cyber risks. Solutions within our ZCP killer include Cloud partial, which includes Zv, and CIEM, ensure proper configuration and enforces lease privileged access for multi-cloud environments. What cloud communication-powered by ZIA and CPA technology, secures app-to-app and cloud-to-cloud communication. And Workload Segmentation achieves Micro-Segmentation without Legacy Network Segmentation.  We have over 300 ZCP customers and are seeing increasingly strong interest from new and existing customers. Let me highlight a few ZCP wins during Q4. An existing ZIA and ZPA customer in the consumer goods sector with over 100,000 employees, purchase, Workload communication for 25,000 workloads. And Workload Segmentation for 10,000 workloads. This customer has a large software environment on a traditional network. Implementing our Zero Trust for workloads, to reduce their cyber risks by minimizing lateral movement while securing the app migration to the cloud.  We're also lending new logos within ZCP. For example, we landed a Fortune 500 professional services Company where ZCP was the main driver. This customer purchased Workload Communications for 6,000 workloads, Workload Segmentation or 500 workloads, as well as the entire ZIA bundle for 40,000 employees. [Indiscernible] collaborated with CrowdStrike, our technology partner, and a global SI, our channel partner for this deal. Let me conclude some thoughts on our vision and strategy. We envision a world in which the exchange of information is always secure and seamless.  In today's [Indiscernible] connected digital world, our Zero Trust Exchange secures any to any connectivity for users, applications, workloads, and IOT and OT systems, regardless of their location. And our Analyst Day in January, we laid out our [Indiscernible] the goal of solving 200 million users and 100 million workloads. In order to achieve this goal, we are focused on attracting and developing talent, and creating a culture of excellence. We hired over 1,100 employees over the past year and enabled them to be productive and successful all during the pandemic. We're investing in our people through learning initiatives and building a culture where a global and task workforce can deliver excellence powering our customer success. Our employees are engaged and completely aligned with our mission.  On our last employee survey, 96% of employees understand and believe in the strategic direction of the Company. I'm proud that we are recognized as a great place to work in the 2021 Glassdoor ratings. We are focused on driving broad adoption, in All 4 pillars of our platform, the breadth and depth of our platform is resonating with customers, and are purchasing our higher-end bundles to consolidate the security and networking point products. I believe Zscaler is the go-to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity, and better cyber protection.  As we demonstrated over the last 12 months, we've built a sophisticated go-to-market machine that delivers business value and measurable outcomes at the [Indiscernible] low level. I'm extremely proud of our go-to-market team and how we executed our sales strategy this year. Even with significant growth in our sales force, sales productivity has increased over the prior year, exceeding our expectations. Our Summit Partner Channel program consists of hundreds of clones focus on each other, system integrators, and service providers that are contributing to our deal win and increasing sales leverage. As our market share, reputation, and brand awareness continues to strengthen.  A growing number of Cloud and SaaS providers on integrating with our platform, further strengthening our strategic position with our joint customers. Our expanding ecosystem is contributing to our sales philosophy and broadening our reach. I believe we are on the right track to capture a material share of our $72 billion serviceable markets. We also see additional opportunities to bring Zero Trust to IoT and OT systems. Modal 5G pushes computing further to the edge. opens up additional opportunities for Zscaler. To facilities markets. We have a two-pronged innovation strategy. 1.  Investing aggressively in internal R&D and scaling our world-class engineering organization, which continues to rapidly deliver new products and features. We recently opened a new [Indiscernible] Hub in Israel. And are expanding our [Indiscernible] centers across the U.S., India, Canada, and Spain. to making highly targeted acquisitions to enhance our platform and the same time to market. During fiscal '21, we completed two acquisitions. Trustdome strengthens on the ZCP pillar and positions us better to pursue our shift left strategy.  And Smokescreen enhances our active defense capabilities with honeypot technology. Through internal innovation and highly targeted acquisitions, we will further expand our leadership in the SASE and Zero Trust security markets. In summary, with all these drivers and innovations ahead of [Indiscernible], you can see why we are very excited about our future. Now, I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Very well said. I don't think I need to add a whole lot more. We are hitting on all cylinders, I'm very excited. If you think of where federal market. It's largely today doing network security. It's largely castle-and-moat depending on firewalls, VPNs, and the like. The good thing is that the Biden administration has recognized that Zero Trust. Architecture has to be done since great.  To see that IO is focused on implementing zero-cost. And look where we stand is, we started investing in the federal market about 3.5 years ago and got all the certifications that are needed and we also have the right architecture and we've built the sizable team. We already have pretty good business, but we're barely scratching the sub-business, the federal market, I think a lot of things have to do with education.  Good thing is that [Indiscernible] and some of the new meetings that Biden administration is having big high-profile CEOs [Indiscernible] is there anything visibility in the space, we aren't participating in some of these new pilots. All in all, we're excited, but we also know that some of these federal deals take their own time. I'll start then Remo can add on. I think our comments on net retention rates have been consistent since we went public and here's the real thing, if I were a one-product Company, then it matters, new logo upsells, all those things. We are such a big platform that's growing rapidly.  We launched an internal debase, should we really pay sales are up more for new logo versus upsell. The answer is we really want to grow the overall new ACV, whether it's coming from upsell or coming from the new logo. So, the message is not to really say downplay, net retention rate. The message is the net retention rate by itself is not a good indicator. What we're doing is good.  We are proud of 128, I'll be proud of 125 too because if I can sell a bigger platform upfront, I'm okay with a lower NRO. That's the message. We are happy that bullish but this metrics by itself is not the best thing as a leading indicator. Follow along with that. Overall cost about today, whether as new enterprise segment of larger, one more and more, they're buying bigger and bigger platforms. It is true that enterprises are probably too good [Indiscernible] 6-K tends to go a little bit bigger from the start.  But it's a shorter sales cycle. And these guys have the same risk of [Indiscernible] similar tax and I'd like to understand. So, we're actually surprised to see how much traction we are getting in the segment in the past few quarters since we focused on it. I think about this quite a bit. If you would have called 34 years ago, we were asked this question quite a bit and this was being asked. Why are these proxy vendors like Bluecore still posting good numbers? I was telling them that we have barely made an impact.  A lot of traffic was so going through those proxy appliances in the data center, as you look at the local breakout business that's not their primary vendor itself. Others yes, have come out there. But the majority of the enterprise traffic still goes through a hub-and-spoke network, it's still going through a data center, it still goes through those firewalls.  If your traffic year-over-year goes up by 33%, you'll end up getting more data center devices, whether it's firewalls or other stuff. I think then you get to a certain level whereas traffic shifts significantly, the spend will shift. That's my personal view. So not surprised that why its legacy devices like firewalls are still growing. I think it's a matter of time. I want to be looking at increasing the renewal price? Is that what the questions are? Right. Our biggest increase in price is coming from selling bigger bundles. And there is some increase in price on each module, but that pace at which we're expanding our portfolio is quite significant and as customers see the value, and because we show business value, the increase in price per customer from ACV point-of-view becomes a natural thing.  Again, if you if we were to compete on price, if it competes on say, I'm a better firewall than those firewalls, then it gets hard. We don't really compete to replace our given firewall or proxy. We are the enabler of secured digital transformation.  A sale is often driven by the CIO to head of infrastructure to head of security. When they look at the amount of money, we can save them to replace all these legacy firewalls, security, and networking devices. The ROI is very impressive to justify, our price becomes a lot easier. So, value-based business, value-based pricing is what we have advocated. Yeah. I would think, yes, we have done some price increases on the original products, but a big increase has come from adding allotment modules. If you look at the time of IPO 3 1/2 years ago, it was largely secured Web Gateway with a few things.  It was largely a business bundle sale or professional bundle. Today, what we're selling is very different than what we sold 3 years ago, very different than what we sold one year ago. The [Indiscernible] the market that gotten [Indiscernible] is a very expensive market, it includes everything you need to have at what used to be the network security level.  I'm [Indiscernible] in these kinds of private access. It's not just a VPN replacement. It eliminates the need for a higher inbound DMZ. That's a big thing. So, as we expand our platform, it further differentiates us. It further consolidates its point products. We love the fact that the market is moving so fast, so rapidly, and we are innovating soft fast. That's why we think it will be very hard for some of the mid-2s to come from behind and catch up with us. So last year, when customers needed to buy ZPA, and I should with inventory during our earnings sales that very few, if any, temporary licenses. Okay. The one-year deals. Most spec deals were done with us on a month's databases.  And when they've on ZPA during the pandemic, most of the time, it was not for a subset of users. It was nearly done for most of the users. So, from our point of view, that sale that got made last year was really made for the long term. Is that impacting us in the short term?  Not really, but having said that on reselling more and more ZPA to every ZIA customer, absolutely. No other market thinks that ZIA and ZPA together should be bought because once you have both of them together, you can access any application from [Indiscernible] In fact, Gartner has further clarified SaaS positioning.  It's kind of interesting, SASE was a good loose framework, but it was confusing to some degree because it kind of got interpreted as it's the network and SD ban and security must be with a single vendor. Not true.  In fact, Gartner has a new position paper that came out about a month or two, which basically said the security part of SSE, a Secure Service Edge, and SSE. And there's a new end-to that will come out Magic Quadrant they'll come out in X months. And the second part that decoupled the Network part of it, they're calling it wireless than the edge.  And that's where the SD-WAN park 60. We have the most comprehensive offering of what Gartner is calling now, secured service hedge, that's really what gives us differentiation that allows us to compete and win and charge good prices and really make sure ZIA [Indiscernible] gets sold to every user, not just a subset of users. Thank you. All-in-all., if you ask me, has the landscape changed significantly in terms of players out there? Not really. The biggest change in the landscape, it's in the Workload posture market in the Cloud Protection [Indiscernible].  When it comes to SaaS, ZIA ZCP competition, there's not a whole lot. Now there is a fair amount of noise that's coming out there. Because when Legacy network security vendors are getting disrupted, they must do something to make noise so they really don't become extinct, that's why we do it here good every saw fundamental Customer SaaS. Although I am doing my firewall VPN in the Cloud, that is Zero Trust right. Now, Zero Trust and firewall or VP in the Cloud doesn't go together. So, if you ask me one of the main things, we need to make sure is be clear that you can go to Zero Trust Architecture with firewalls and VPNs. The good thing is smart folks like NIST and Gartner on helping that area.  But our momentum is building, businesses are doing good and we want to keep on investing aggressively as Remo said, to take a big share of this increasing, evolving sizable market. The last one I want to make is, the number of modules we saw sell today on average, versus a year ago, versus 3 years ago has increased significantly, which is very good. It's no longer the status quo [Indiscernible] firewall or secured [Indiscernible] re-market. Did I make sense? Thank you. Brian great question. The biggest shift got caused by COVID. Before COVID, enterprises used to think about, I don't think Zscaler with network transformation branches being broken into the local breaker and the like, with COVID, since network got an outer loop, the enterprise said, I'm going to download this [Indiscernible] agent.  And I'm ready to go with ZIA to external applications, ZPA to internal applications. That mindset is still there. I love it because when you don't have to deal with the net for your sales and deployments go much faster. So, our Phase one.  These days are getting everyone turn ON from wherever they are. Phase two ends up being, let's do local breakout for network transformation. And then Phase III ends up being, let's look at the Cloud workload protection and the like. So, it is evolving and it's evolving, but things are moving at a faster phase. faster pace Thank you. Yeah. I think the pipeline is good, we have all the certifications, right architecture that the federal government recognizes. But acquiring Zero Trust Architecture, we are investing and pretty positive and confident. With that, I will like to thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you."

We encourage everyone to register and attend our summit from our website, zscaler.com/zenithlive Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry : Thank you, Bill. As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered outstanding results for the third quarter, with accelerating growth at scale while increasing adoption of our broader platform. We drove 60% growth in revenue and 71% growth in billings. We also generated strong growth in operating profits and delivered record free cash flow.  Enterprises are looking to Zscaler to secure their digital transformation and architect for the work-from-anywhere economy, which we believe is the new normal. Our results exceeded our expectations, and we are again increasing our guidance for fiscal \u201821. Our business is firing on all cylinders. Our superior architecture and optimized go-to-market engine is elevating us above the competitive noise. Our Zero Trust Exchange platform connects users, devices and applications, which is fundamentally different from firewall-based castle-and-moat security. Our platform prevents lateral threat movement and eliminates the attack surface by making applications invisible from the Internet, hence reducing business risk.  Furthermore, our proxy architecture, designed to inspect SSL-encrypted traffic, blocks sophisticated threats and prevents loss of sensitive data. Faced with the latest news-making ransomware and other cyberattacks, CISOs and CIOs are turning to Zscaler to dramatically improve their security posture while reducing their legacy IT costs. As you have heard me say before, architecture matters. Zscaler purpose built the right high-performance, multi-tenant proxy architecture from day one, whereas many vendors are trying to retrofit their existing solutions, which inevitably fails. Built from the start to enforce policy at the edge, as advocated by SASE framework, we are deployed across 150 data centers with five nines of availability.  We are processing more than 160 billion transactions daily, preventing up to 7 billion security incidents and policy violations. This unmatched network effect provides better security and user experience.  Let me highlight 3 factors that drove our strong performance in the quarter. First, building on our strength with large enterprises, we closed a record number of seven-figure ACV deals across a broad range of industries. Most of these wins are 3-year commitments to provide our customers the foundation for application, network and security transformation.  Second, an increasing share of our sales is coming from broader platform purchases by new and existing customers. Strong platform upsells drove our 126% dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter. Our newer solutions like out-of-band CASB, Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX and Zscaler Cloud Protection or ZCP, are increasingly contributing to our wins. The breadth and depth of our platform is resonating with customers, and I believe Zscaler is the go-to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity and better cyber protection.  Third, our strategic decision last year to increase our investments in go-to-market is yielding fantastic results. I am very pleased with our performance and momentum across all geos, all market segments and all products.  Earlier this year, we expanded our investment in the Enterprise segment, which consists of organizations with 2,000 to 6,000 employees. This quarter, we saw a higher mix of new business from this segment.  Now let me highlight key wins in the quarter, starting with ZIA. Because of the pandemic, a Global 500 technology company in Asia was routing Internet traffic of their employees working from home over VPN through the corporate data center. This created a poor user experience for SaaS applications like Office 365 and overwhelmed their security appliances. To power their workplace modernization initiative for their [80,000] employees, the customer purchased ZIA Transformation Edition including SSL inspection, cloud firewall, and sandboxing as well as ZDX. ZDX improves productivity by identifying and helping resolve user performance issues over the entire cloud network path in real-time before users complain.  In another new logo win, a global business services company facing challenges supporting work-from-anywhere purchased our Business Edition plus cloud firewall, CASB, DLP and ZDX for all 46,000 employees to directly access SaaS applications to reduce business risk and improve user experience. In addition, they replaced their legacy VPN with ZPA to provide zero trust access to private applications for their 29,000 call center employees. With the purchase of 3 of our 4 platform pillars, this customer is accelerating their digital transformation from a 5-year goal into a 6-month reality.  Next, let me share two significant deals that show our growing momentum in the financial services vertical and our increasing success working with our tech partners. A top tier global investment bank is pursuing a zero trust strategy by rebuilding its security architecture for the modern, hybrid work environment. They purchased our ZIA Business Edition plus DLP, Cloud Sandbox and ZDX for 50,000 users. With security as a major requirement, only a proxy architecture with SSL inspection at scale was considered. Our 10-year track record of running a massive, highly reliable and available inline security cloud made us the best choice. Taking advantage of the breadth of our platform, this customer also started limited deployments of additional products, including browser isolation, CASB, workload segmentation and ZPA. This deal is a great example of the successful field sales collaboration between Zscaler and our tech partner CrowdStrike.  In another financial services win, a multi-national company embracing cloud transformation purchased the entire ZIA portfolio including CASB, advanced DLP and CSPM for Microsoft Office 365, plus ZDX for 30,000 employees. Like the prior deal, this customer only considered a proxy architecture and firewall architectures were disqualified. Their Zscaler platform purchase consolidated 4 vendors, streamlined their operations and reduced IT costs. This is another great example of field sales engagement with another important tech partner, in this case, Microsoft. As these new customer wins show, the attach rate of our data protection products, including DLP, out-of-band CASB, browser isolation and CSPM for SaaS is growing.  Now, let me discuss an upsell deal that was primarily driven by data protection. An existing Global 200 pharma customer with headquarters in Europe purchased CASB, advanced DLP and Sandbox for all 79,000 employees to up-level their security. We displaced the incumbent out-of-band CASB point product, a trend we are increasingly seeing as customers are standardizing on Zscaler\u2019s integrated platform. In addition, to access private applications, they bought 3,000 ZPA seats, the first step to eliminate their legacy VPN. This latest purchase was a seven-figure ACV deal, which doubled the customer\u2019s ARR.  As we look forward to a post-pandemic world, in which employees unwittingly bring infected laptops back to the office, organizations need a true zero trust platform to eliminate the risk of lateral threat movement. Secondly, we\u2019re also seeing SD-WAN projects restarting, with companies moving to direct-to-cloud architecture from their legacy hub-and-spoke network and castle-and-moat security.  In the quarter, an existing Global 200 manufacturing customer with headquarters in Europe upgraded their 120,000 user subscription from Business to Transformation bundle to secure local breakouts at their 1,000 locations worldwide, some with SD-WAN and some without SD-WAN. The Transformation bundle added Cloud Sandbox and cloud firewall, which doubled this customer\u2019s ARR.  And finally, I\u2019ll highlight an upsell win with a global pharma company that previously purchased the Transformation bundle and ZPA for 15,000 users. Their SD-WAN deployment was delayed last year, and now they are accelerating their network and application transformation with a 5-year commitment to Zscaler. This quarter, they purchased an additional 50,000 ZIA and ZPA seats to cover all 65,000 employees, while also adding DLP for all users. They also purchased our new ZPA Private Service Edge, to enable zero trust access for their employees returning to the office. This demonstrates customers are implementing ZPA for all employees, not just for remote users.  In addition to our ongoing success in protecting users, our next big opportunity is protecting workloads with Zscaler Cloud Protection. We are rapidly expanding our ZCP portfolio, through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions.  Let me highlight our recent M&A activity. As announced last month, we acquired Trustdome, a leading provider of Cloud Infrastructure and Entitlement Management or CIEM, to complement our CSPM solution. CIEM and CSPM together, properly integrated, can correlate identity information with configuration data and enforce least privileged access for cloud environments, hence reducing business risk. This further expands our market opportunity for workload security.  In addition, today, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Smokescreen Technologies, which provides us with a deception technology to detect active attacks and lateral threat movement. We plan to integrate Smokescreen with our ZIA and ZPA solutions to enhance our active defense capabilities. You will hear more about these solutions at our Zenith Live Cloud Summit next month.  As we look forward to the next few years, we are focused on driving broader adoption of our four platform pillars, which together maximize the success of digital transformation. Our core ZIA and ZPA business has never been stronger. And we\u2019re excited about the early traction of ZDX and ZCP, the next growth engines for the company.  Now I will highlight three points about our go-to-market machine which is scaling very well. Our field organization continues to scale and is executing on all cylinders.  Moving to our partners. As I mentioned in our deal wins, we have strong and growing technology partnerships. In addition to incremental product integrations, we continue to grow our go-to-market partnership with CrowdStrike, who also became a customer this quarter. I am proud that Zscaler was named the Zero Trust Champion at Microsoft\u2019s 20/20 Partner Awards. Further expanding our technology relationships, we recently partnered with IBM to add Zscaler services to their zero trust security offerings. This partnership includes integrating with their identity, MDM and SIEM solutions, and joint go-to-market initiatives.  On the channel front, we are expanding our Summit Partner program and adding VARs that are building cloud transformation practices. Our service provider relationships are strong and we\u2019re building joint engagements with system integrators.  On the marketing front, we are aggressively investing in thought leadership for zero trust security and expanding demand generation programs.  In summary, we are making tremendous progress across all three areas, sales organization, marketing and channel partners, and delivering strong results quarter after quarter. I believe we are on track to capture a material share of our $72 billion serviceable market.  Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the third quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter was $176.4 million, up 12% sequentially and 60% year-over-year. ZPA product revenue was 16% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions: Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 38% and APJ was 11%.  Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 71% year-over-year to $225 million, with billing duration towards the upper-end of our 10 to 14 months range. We had several customers choosing to pay upfront for their multi-year contracts. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we do not offer any special incentives for upfront payments. With that in mind, we are also pleased that short-term billings, which are calculated based on the change in short-term deferred revenue plus reported revenue for the period, grew 61% over the prior year.  Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which represent our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, were $1.2 billion as of April 30th. RPO grew 85% from one year ago. The current RPO is 51% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which was 126% compared to 127% last quarter and 119% a year ago. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger bundles and selling multiple-pillars from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 126% is outstanding.  Total gross margin of 81% was flat quarter-over-quarter and improved by 1 percentage point year over year. As a reminder, gross margins in the second half of last fiscal year were pressured by the augmented use of public cloud to meet the 10x surge in ZPA traffic as pandemic lockdowns began.  Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 6% sequentially and 53% year-over-year to $119.7 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined by 3 percentage points from 71% a year ago to 68% in the quarter primarily due to lower T&E, which was partially offset by increased hiring and M&A expenses.  Sales and marketing expense increased 6% sequentially and 56% year-over-year to $80.9 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives. R&D expenses increased 8% sequentially and 55% year-over-year to $25.9 million. The increase is primarily due to continued investments in our engineering teams. G&A expenses increased 4% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $12.9 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation-related expenses and professional fees.  Our third quarter operating margin was 13% compared to 9% in the same quarter last year, and T&E spending had a positive 270 basis point benefit. Operating margin was better than our guidance range due to stronger than expected performance in the business and due to the timing of certain sales and marketing spend.  Net income in the quarter was $21.4 million or a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.15. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $56 million in the quarter, which compares to $9 million during the same quarter last year. The increase was driven by our strong billings growth, receivables collection and operating performance.  Now, moving to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets and any associated tax effects.  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $185 million to $187 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 47% to 49%; gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. With this in mind, we believe 79% to 80% is a good range for us in the near-term; operating profit in the range of $13.5 million to $14.5 million; other income of $300,000, net of interest payments on the senior convertible notes; income taxes of $1.7 million; earnings per share of $0.08 to $0.09, assuming approximately 146 million fully diluted shares.  For the full-year fiscal 2021 we now expect revenue in the range of $660 million to $664 million or year-over-year growth of 53% to 54%; calculated billings in the range of $878 million to $880 million or year-over-year growth of approximately 60%; operating profit in the range of $71 million to $72 million; earnings per share of $0.47 assuming approximately 145 million fully diluted shares.  The acquisitions of Trustdome and Smokescreen are expected to have an immaterial impact on revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2022, as they are early stage companies. Our plan is to further develop these products and incorporate their technologies into our platform. We expect to incur $2.5 million to $3.0 million in additional operating expenses in Q4 related to the acquisitions, including a new R&D center of excellence in Israel. This is incorporated into our Q4 guidance. For your modeling purposes, we expect to incur approximately $13 million to $15 million in operating expenses related to the acquisitions in fiscal 2022.  With a huge market opportunity, we remain committed to investing aggressively in our company behind the growth in our business. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will continue to take priority considering our strong business momentum. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question or comment comes from the line of Alex Henderson.\nAlex Henderson: First off, let me thank you for a superb quarter. Outstanding results. And the question I have is really on the sales capacity you've been adding over the last year. To what extent do you see that capacity now maturing in terms of its productivity? And how do you think about additional continuation of that incredibly successful program?\nJay Chaudhry: Alex, thank you. As you know, we have been adding and rather accelerating sales capacity. We are pleased with performance, and we are counting on it to deliver us accelerating growth. Remo, do you want to give a better color to it?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. Majority of our field sales reps are still ramping. So a significant portion of our organization is still in ramp phase. The key thing that we brought up in the past is that we are aggressively hiring. And we had a good quarter of hiring in Q3. We're expecting to have a very good quarter in Q4. So our plans, as Jay talked about in the earnings call, is that the market is really strong. It's moving to us. All indications are that we're in a great position. So we're going to continue to aggressively hire and really go after the growth of the Zscaler going forward.\nJay Chaudhry: And if I may add one more statement. One, it's a competitive market for talent. Zscaler has become a top destination for top talent. So we're able to attract good talent and grow our sales team stronger.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital.\nMatt Hedberg: Jay, there's obviously a lot of success you're seeing in the enterprise on upsell and large deals. I had a question on the federal or, I guess, public sector market. Obviously, the Colonial Pipeline attack highlighted the risk here that some utilities are at. Just can you talk to us about how you think about Zero Trust architecture could benefit the public sector? And might that be an accelerant as we look forward for the next year or 2?\nJay Chaudhry: I think we have been hearing enterprises talk about Zero Trust more and more for the last 12 to 18 months, especially after some of the SolarWinds type of attacks. This is bigger theme. But now, it's good to see that federal government is braking up and saying they need to do something. It's good to see a very clear directive coming from Biden administration, which highlights a need for Zero Trust. And by the way, I must say that many vendors are trying to hijack upon Zero Trust, but Zero Trust as written by the [EU] based on the MIJST research paper, it is not done by firewall. It is connecting entities to entities without a pass-through connection, and we believe we'll have a big advantage of it. We started investing in federal space about 3 years ago, had to go through a lengthy process of certifications of FedRAMP and the like. We are very well certified. We started investing in sales organization about 2 years ago, have a strong team, a strong and growing pipeline. So federal business seems great.  And the second part of your question is actually public sector, which is the non-federal part, which is state, local and education stuff. We are doing in that part very well as well. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: No, I think, Jay, you hit it. I mean the key thing is that we've invested significantly in federal. As Jay talked about, the FedRAMP certifications. FedRAMP High for ZPA. And also, we are moving towards FedRAMP High for ZIA, which puts us in a completely different position than other companies.  In addition, I think one of the strengths is that we've been able to build the sales organization at the organization very strongly and partners in federal. So I feel we're well positioned in the federal market going forward.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Greg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Congratulations on a phenomenal quarter. Jay, maybe to follow-up a bit on the last question, and you sort of touched on this a little bit, but from what you're able to gather, have the recent high-profile breaches dating back to SolarWinds that inclusive of the Colonial Pipeline attack, have they had any discernible impact on your pipeline. So again, we hear the anecdotes, much like you do. I'm just kind of curious if there's anything that is able to translate to some extent from what you're able to tell?\nJay Chaudhry: So first of all, the number of inbound engagement from not just CIO and CISOs, and in many instances, the Board has stepped up. So it's clear that there's a high degree of interest in making sure that companies are secured. That's point number one. Point number two, when those level of C-level get engaged, the budgets open up, they become less of an issue. When you're dealing with the CIO, whose budget is hundreds of millions of dollars, to get a few million dollar deal for us generally becomes a lot easier. So we are seeing tremendous interest. Our customers having discussions that they need to do Zero Trust implementation because of security factors, including Colonials and SolarWinds? Yes. Can I quantify what part of business and pipeline? Probably I'll be guesstimating too much. So I'll leave it open to, say, a positive impact, but hard to quantify.\nOperator: Our next question comment comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG.\nGray Powell: So yes, you mentioned that you expanded investment in the mid-market or the mid-enterprise segment -- companies with 2,000 to 6,000 employees contributed a higher mix this quarter. Is there a way to roughly quantify how much of the upside this segment is driving? And then how should we think about the potential contribution from the segment ramping over the next 6 to 12 months?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, just for clarification, the Enterprise segment is for employees of 2,000 to 6,000 employees per company, and it is the fastest-growing segment that we have. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the growth for new and upsell business has been a couple of percentage points. What this shows basically is our investments in the Summit Program that we've made so the Summit Program targeted primarily towards bars and bars -- primarily towards the segment, we are seeing very, very good growth, and we're happy with the growth. As I mentioned, it's the fastest-growing segment that we have. The segments we have are majors, large enterprise, enterprise and commercial. So this is the largest one. So this is growing large assets.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. If I may add, it was natural for us to expand into enterprise. We started from the high end, having strong presence in majors and large enterprises. It's a natural part for us, and we are pleased to see the performance. In this area, we have been adding quite a bit of sales force in this area and partner program together is delivering good results.\nGray Powell: Got it. And are sales cycles faster there? Or is there anything different in the competitive environment?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, they are faster. As you would expect, typically, the bigger the deal, the longer the sales cycle. The smaller the company, fewer the stakeholders and faster the sales cycle.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mike Walkley from Canaccord.\nMike Walkley: Just wanted to dig in on the comments on ZPA, about it's going to all users, not this remote. Any way to size the opportunity of further penetration within your customer base? And just thinking about ZPA with it taking off with the pandemic, any thoughts on longer-term modeling, giving potential tougher comps even though the pipeline sounds strong?\nJay Chaudhry: So first of all, from day 1, our belief was that ZPA was never designed for remote access VPN only. It was designed as a Zero Trust architecture implementation. No matter where the users are, they go through our switchboard, so they never on the corporate network. And when pandemic happened, since everyone was remote, so ZPA actually got bought from almost every employee most of the companies, that was a big shift we saw. Whereby previously, companies would buy ZPA for 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% of the employees. But we knew the number will get to 100%. And as employees are coming back to the office, in fact, customers are worried about these people bringing their infected machines back to the office, so they want to do Zero Trust even when they're in the office. So for that, they want to go through our Zero Trust Exchange. In fact, for that, we built another service, we call it Private Service Edge. Imagine a private switchboard running in your data center to implement Zero Trust for on-prem users, which is actually a great opportunity further giving customer segmentations for the applications, which is what customers are looking for. So I think it's a matter of time. And every employee of our customers will have ZIA, ZPA and actual ZDX as well. Because while ZIA and ZPA allows you to work anywhere and access any applications, ZDX makes sure users have a great experience and the issues, they can be easily solved.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. And from a penetration perspective for our ZT customers, a little over 40% have ZPA. So significant opportunity for us to upsell into our existing customers -- sorry a little over 40% of ZIA customers, to clarify.\nJay Chaudhry: That is correct.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from D.A. Davidson.\nAndrew Nowinski: So had a question on the CrowdStrike win. You hear a lot about how endpoint security and specifically EDR technology is necessary to stop breaches like the Colonial Pipeline attack. And given that CrowdStrike prides themselves on stopping those breaches, I'm wondering why they would need Zscaler? So if you could provide any more color on -- maybe on what they're deploying and how they're using Zscaler and whether you think any other enterprises may follow their lead and deploy both CrowdStrike and Zscaler together?\nJay Chaudhry: We are yet to come across a serious large enterprise who doesn't believe in clear security approach, but endpoint serves as an important layer and cloud serves as a second layer. That's the most common thing I do. So it's -- when you bind to that notion, which is what we do and most customers do, it's natural for customers say, endpoint from CrowdStrike and cloud security from Zscaler. And what's exciting for customers is for the 2 to be able to work together with proper API-based integration, CrowdStrike and Zscaler had done this product integration over the past 12 to 18 months and that integration keeps on going to the next level, where we can help each other and customers get the benefit of it. So driven by product integration that customers wanted and then our joint sales engagements on field, where our teams are working together because we complement each other, it's a great win-win partnership for both of our -- both of us, CrowdStrike and us. Did I answer your question?\nAndrew Nowinski: Yes, it did. Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: Our next question come comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman: Jay, I wanted to see if you could give some more color around both ZCP and ZDX. And the question really is, any comments or color on attach rates? How much are contributing? Where the wins are? Any more color, so we could get a sense about how much those assets, new solutions rather contribute today? And how you see that unfolding over the next 12 months?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Thank you. I'll start with the strategic positioning, and Remo can add on the point at side of it. As you know, ZCP, is cloud protection is a massive opportunity for protecting workloads. There are a couple of areas there. One big one is communication among workloads, which has traditionally done the whole school way by connecting various workloads and availability zones with a wide area network, site-to-site VPN and the like, which creates big risks because of lateral moment. So with workload segmentation, we have implemented a zero trust architecture which will disrupt legacy network-based security for workload just like with direct users with ZIA and ZPA. That's one part of it. And obviously, it's easy for us to start with our own customers, and that's a large customer base, and that's where early traction is.  And then on second side is the security posture type of stuff. This is where some of offering is cloud security, posture management, CSPM and Trustdome acquisition combined give us a strong offering. We are bullish about the ZCP market, which is nascent, but it's growing rapidly. The ZDX part is very interesting. This is complementing ZIA and ZPA to identify and resolve any user performance issues. So this is a natural add on to any ZIA and ZPA sales. Normally we used to sell ZIA only. Then we started selling ZIA and ZPA together. More and more deals are with ZIA and ZPA together at the start. And now we are seeing more and more deals with ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together, which makes a natural bundle for our customers to enable their employees to work here and have great experience. Remo color on...\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, just from a numbers perspective, we still expect the contribution for new and upsell for ZCP and ZDX to be mid-single-digits this year. As Jay mentioned, the reception of both products has been high, and we feel good about those products going forward. But think about the contribution this year for new and upsell in that mid-single-digit range.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank.\nPatrick Colville: So just on the math, CRPO billings, if I'm not mistaken, rose 85% this quarter, which looking at the disclosure since you guys have been kind of giving RPO and CRPO seems to be the kind of highest growth rate ever. So hugely impressive. What are you guys seeing to kind of have this real acceleration this quarter, what are the kind of confidence and factors? And I guess kind of importantly, how sustainable are they as we look forward into the rest of calendar '21 and '22?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll take the first part and have, Jay, give some color. You're right, Patrick, outstanding results. I mean the CRPO growth is 68% and the RPO growth is 85%, which is absolutely outstanding. When you couple that with our billings growth of 71%, it just shows that, basically, things are going very well for us. What's changing is basically what we've seen. We've been talking about with the accelerant last year related to with COVID hit, and companies recognized that they had to get their employees connected to their networks in order to -- or applications in order to do business. And we saw that. That was the big increase for last year with ZPA, which is 43% of our new and upsell business. Since then, basically, that brought to light, it's basically that yesterday's networks aren't going to work. Infrastructure is not going to work. Those are the discussions that we've been having with customers. That is basically a change, which is occurring, is recognizing the current infrastructure in place is really not the optimal infrastructure that companies need going forward.  With that, what we've done as a company, we broadened our platform. We broadened our platform. We just talked about ZDX workload protection and additional basically features onto our product. So the broadening of the platform related to the movement to really transforming your networks has led to basically deal sizes becoming larger, more strategic partnership. And also, just the credibility of the Zscaler, now that they've on a public company for 3-plus years and we've got a strong balance sheet, and we've got a strong team. And again, the key thing is Zscaler was built for this world. The platform was built for this world over 10 years ago. And it was -- if you take a look at the expansion basically of the amount of traffic that we put through to have the type of gross margins with the type of traffic across over 150 data centers, with SLAs being almost zero, quite frankly, on a quarterly basis, is a testament to the strength of Zscaler. And I think that's what's playing through with our communications with our customers. Jay?\nJay Chaudhry: I think you said it all, but accelerating digital transformation being one; expanded portfolio and platform being 2; large, great sales force being three; and our brand and customer [acquisitions], all four are accelerating our sales.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Catherine Trebnick from Colliers.\nCatharine Trebnick: Can you unpack a little bit the Summit Program and how well you're doing there versus your sales through the service provider channel to give us a better idea where you're really seeing explosion in your opportunities?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Our service provider channel evolved fairly early on. As our customers want transformation and CIOs told SPs to work with us to make that happen. It's a strong channel. It's a growing channel. For us took time in the past couple of years, more and more of the VARs, they realized that. The box sales are not going to last forever, so they are pivoting more. The one who are pivoting to embrace cloud transformation services, they are our favors. They're actually becoming part of our Summit Program. That's what the part -- program was built, and we have good participation for programs. And as a result of that, we're seeing the growth of VAR contribution to business growing at a faster rate.\nRemo Canessa: From a numbers perspective, also, VARs as a percentage of our revenue is in the low 50% range. SPs and SIs combined in the low 40%. And direct is mid-single-digits. The growth rate in SPs and SIs has been significant year-over-year also. So we've had significant growth in SPs, SIs on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Actually, maybe just to piggyback off that last question on channel. Maybe a little bit more of a strategic one for you, Jay. The service provider channel has been an area that these dealers worked with for years, as you noted, and it felt like this quarter, you're starting to see some other security vendors maybe start to work with them a little bit as well. I guess the question is, how are your conversations with those service providers? And how do you think that sort of plays out in the future as other security vendors maybe start to work with that channel as well on SASE specifically?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So first of all, as Remo said, our business, the SP, SIs year-over-year is growing quite well. Think in terms of other firewall type of vendors, that's not new news. Service providers have been selling firewalls, have this stuff, especially for MSSP servers for years and years. So not a new area. Yes, adding the SD-WAN to those firewalls is probably a new area of we hear about. But most of that stuff has happened on the lower end. When you talk to larger enterprises, they actually engage with us and then partner together and drive the transformation. None of that has changed. On the lower end, probably this combination of some SD-WAN combined with firewalls, but we are bullish about the SP channel, SI channel as well as the VAR channel. In fact, our investments in channel are growing significantly because that's giving us more and more leverage, and we will continue to do so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America.\nTal Liani: When I ask you, why are you successful? The answer is always the same. So I'm not going to ask you again. But I want to ask you about condition. And the fact that you're so successful for such a long period of time, and we do see new players in the space. I'm wondering how the competitive landscape changed? What's the -- what do you see today in competitive bids versus what you've seen before? And how is the gap between you and the competitors? So anything you can share with us on the competitive landscape?\nJay Chaudhry: We ask this question to ourselves many, many times. We analyze it every quarter. Frankly, the truth is not a whole lot has changed on the competitive landscape. We\u2019re hearing so much noise from firewall vendors and the like. Have we seen any change? On the larger segment, larger customers that we always talked about haven't seen change much at all. We have seen a few cases. And I mentioned a couple of them during our prepared remarks. We have firewall vendors trying to go in and compete but got disqualified because they don't have the architecture.  Well, you could say that now, some of them are saying, yes, we have a proxy architecture. But announcing is one thing, building a scalable, reliable proxy that a larger enterprise would depend upon is a very different thing altogether. Having said that, when we come down to the lower end of the spectrum, say, under 5,000 users, so we do see some of them. Vendors where it's kind of less security savvy customers. But as we are engaging more and more in this space with our Enterprise segment, we do some of them. But once we engage, we are winning pretty handsomely. So very comfortable on the competitive front because customers are more and more actually on every segment looking for consolidation and simplification.  So low end players that are coming from point product and trying to expand, so to speak, don't really make it well. Some of the bigger ones, our legacy vendors, the old story, our Zero Trust Exchange platform does much better because we are truly a zero trust architecture. And as I said, you can convert a firewall into a zero trust architecture. That's kind of oxymoron.\nTal Liani: Got it. And do you feel that you need to make acquisitions in order to grow the TAM? Or is it more time to focus on execution and sales and marketing and just try to -- within your current TAM, try to get more market share? Where is your focus between the two?\nJay Chaudhry: It's a good question. Both. Why not? Having said that, I would say we won't be looking for acquisitions to grow TAM. We're looking for acquisition to fill in any potential areas that need to kind of strengthen or expand into adjacent markets. It's pretty open to. We've done a few small acquisitions at the right opportunity with the right technology. We'll look for everything that makes business sense. We see that as a market opportunity for us, our momentum is so good, so why not keep on moving at a faster pace.  And on sales and marketing, we are investing. We're investing heavily. In fact, Remo and I have lots of internal debates, our top-line growth versus bottom-line. We kind of say, hey, top-line is a priority, so both of us happen to be such that we can't be spending like drunken sailors. You'll also see our bottom-line being pretty good.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP.\nErik Suppiger: Just in the SD-WAN space, who are your best partners at this point? Are there different architectures for SD-WAN that fit well with you? Or how do you look at that space?\nJay Chaudhry: SD-WAN. So the answer is pretty simple. Starting with vendors who compete on the higher end who have enterprise-class architecture, they are natural to work with us because our large customers want them. As I said kind of before there, 3 vendors we see frequently for SD-WAN deployments of large enterprises. It's VMware, it's HP Aruba, and it is Cisco. Most of our customers have one of the three deployed on the high end. Then the low end customers coming from the firewall side of it, do they have some large enterprise customers? Yes, but a lot of their business ends up being on the lower end, and we see them less often. But we do have customers who may have and other SD-WAN vendors, but they decided that we were the security cloud of choice. And we're open. We integrate with everyone. I can take traffic from almost any SD-WAN vendor but with some of them we have stronger working relationships. VMware is our best partner when it comes to go to market.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Jay, just maybe a high level market question for you. I think some of this you touched on earlier, but we're clearly seeing a critical math in terms of adoption of trends such as SASE and Zero Trust network access, a lot of the stuff that, obviously, you've been aligned towards in day 1, and you're clearly a big beneficiary of that and have been. But at the same time, I think at least in the short-term, it seems to be kind of a rising tide lifts all boats, right? And many of the firewall competitors that you mentioned earlier are talking about similar approaches. Not to necessarily go you to talk about any one particular vendor. But at what point do you think that some of the FUD, right, from your perspective, kind of winnows down and people are -- look for a solution that's truly architected for this trend like you've talked about?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. We've seen this movie before. If you recall, there's some proxy vendors whose sales were rising and [indiscernible] Jay, you guys are winning, why aren't they losing? I mean we are still young. We still have a small for the market, with 25%, 30% of the customers deployed us. What are other guys doing to keep on dealing with the data-centric architecture, network-centric architecture? They're buying more and more firewalls, right? It will be -- it will take some time and that is powerful thing. But I think when it comes to doing truly the new architecture with Zero Trust, where you don't put people on the network, you don't have a pass-through architecture, that's the only way to stop Colonial type kind of threats and SolarWinds type of threats. I think you'll see things changing. And that's what I think. Overall, the market is pretty big right now. We aren't really inhibited or impacted by any of those competitors who are doing well. I think -- and our share will keep them going for some time until the architecture really changes. Take, for example, spinning a VPN in the cloud doesn't make anyone Zero Trust. It's still VPN. Our customers are buying and deploying it? Of course, they are, alright? Will that change over time? Of course, it will. Can you make VPN into Zero Trust? You can't.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rob Owens from Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Great. Jay, relative to return to work and we think about reopening, how would you expect the pace of digital transformation and therefore, network transformation potentially change? And where are customer conversations right now around the sense of urgency?\nJay Chaudhry: So customers are beginning to make plans to come and work from the office. Many of them have partially opened up. What they learned during the COVID crisis was that the corporate network doesn't play a very important role. They could work from anywhere. But having said that, when employees are in the branch office, they need to make sure the traffic and go directly from the branch office to the cloud, just like it went from employee\u2019s home directly without going back to the data centers. So that is actually restarting some of the SD-WAN projects so they can do local breakout. But the bigger issue that's helping us, or the bigger opportunity that's helping us is, they want to make sure employees in the office still do Zero Trust architecture with a product like ZPA. So we are seeing good interest in fully Zero Trust, so they don't have an issue where the lateral movement of threats like SolarWinds can get them in trouble. Or the infected machines coming back to the office and get them trouble. And we are helping companies implement better security, full security asset return to the office as well. Overall, a good positive opportunity for us.\nOperator: We have time for one final question. Our last question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: All right. Back on the bus. I really appreciate it and congrats on the results. I was wondering, maybe, Jay, if you could expand a little bit on some of the drivers here in terms of -- you've got macro headwinds. You've got sales productivity. You've got transformational shift to the cloud. Expansion of your platform. How does that relate to customer growth? Is there any way to kind of quantify customer growth and then grade those tailwinds in terms of which are the most meaningful with regard to the growth trajectory that you're experiencing now?\nJay Chaudhry: When you said customer growth, are you telling a number of customers or revenue growth?\nBrian Essex: Yes. I guess I'm looking for logo growth relative to some of the kind of platform expansion and sales productivity initiatives that you have currently in play?\nJay Chaudhry: Right. We are doing well in both areas, new logo growth and upsell. It's an interesting bearing in the company should be -- pay more for new logo or not, okay? And we decided not to do because there's so much an opportunity to sell the platform, which falls under upsell. The new logo, we have a good mix of business coming from new logo as well as upsell. So the opportunities, as you said, the macro environment is helping, more focus on security is helping us. Sales force, they have done a phenomenal job in the sales organization. Now we are seeing very good results from our early focus on channel, Summit partners. Marketing, we've got a new CMO. We expanded and strengthened the marketing team, a lot more investments in the marketing area. And platform and product machine is really coming at a very good speed. Very bullish on our opportunity going forward.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. From a total customer perspective, we grew our customer base by about 20% year-over-year.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session at this time. I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: I'd like to thank you all for your continued support. Please join us at our Zenith Live Annual Cloud Summit in mid-June. Thank you again.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the third quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter was $176.4 million, up 12% sequentially and 60% year-over-year. ZPA product revenue was 16% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions: Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 38% and APJ was 11%.  Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 71% year-over-year to $225 million, with billing duration towards the upper-end of our 10 to 14 months range. We had several customers choosing to pay upfront for their multi-year contracts. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we do not offer any special incentives for upfront payments. With that in mind, we are also pleased that short-term billings, which are calculated based on the change in short-term deferred revenue plus reported revenue for the period, grew 61% over the prior year.  Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which represent our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, were $1.2 billion as of April 30th. RPO grew 85% from one year ago. The current RPO is 51% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which was 126% compared to 127% last quarter and 119% a year ago. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger bundles and selling multiple-pillars from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 126% is outstanding.  Total gross margin of 81% was flat quarter-over-quarter and improved by 1 percentage point year over year. As a reminder, gross margins in the second half of last fiscal year were pressured by the augmented use of public cloud to meet the 10x surge in ZPA traffic as pandemic lockdowns began.  Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 6% sequentially and 53% year-over-year to $119.7 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined by 3 percentage points from 71% a year ago to 68% in the quarter primarily due to lower T&E, which was partially offset by increased hiring and M&A expenses.  Sales and marketing expense increased 6% sequentially and 56% year-over-year to $80.9 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives. R&D expenses increased 8% sequentially and 55% year-over-year to $25.9 million. The increase is primarily due to continued investments in our engineering teams. G&A expenses increased 4% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $12.9 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation-related expenses and professional fees.  Our third quarter operating margin was 13% compared to 9% in the same quarter last year, and T&E spending had a positive 270 basis point benefit. Operating margin was better than our guidance range due to stronger than expected performance in the business and due to the timing of certain sales and marketing spend.  Net income in the quarter was $21.4 million or a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.15. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $56 million in the quarter, which compares to $9 million during the same quarter last year. The increase was driven by our strong billings growth, receivables collection and operating performance.  Now, moving to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets and any associated tax effects.  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $185 million to $187 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 47% to 49%; gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. With this in mind, we believe 79% to 80% is a good range for us in the near-term; operating profit in the range of $13.5 million to $14.5 million; other income of $300,000, net of interest payments on the senior convertible notes; income taxes of $1.7 million; earnings per share of $0.08 to $0.09, assuming approximately 146 million fully diluted shares.  For the full-year fiscal 2021 we now expect revenue in the range of $660 million to $664 million or year-over-year growth of 53% to 54%; calculated billings in the range of $878 million to $880 million or year-over-year growth of approximately 60%; operating profit in the range of $71 million to $72 million; earnings per share of $0.47 assuming approximately 145 million fully diluted shares.  The acquisitions of Trustdome and Smokescreen are expected to have an immaterial impact on revenue in Q4 and in fiscal 2022, as they are early stage companies. Our plan is to further develop these products and incorporate their technologies into our platform. We expect to incur $2.5 million to $3.0 million in additional operating expenses in Q4 related to the acquisitions, including a new R&D center of excellence in Israel. This is incorporated into our Q4 guidance. For your modeling purposes, we expect to incur approximately $13 million to $15 million in operating expenses related to the acquisitions in fiscal 2022.  With a huge market opportunity, we remain committed to investing aggressively in our company behind the growth in our business. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will continue to take priority considering our strong business momentum. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes. Majority of our field sales reps are still ramping. So a significant portion of our organization is still in ramp phase. The key thing that we brought up in the past is that we are aggressively hiring. And we had a good quarter of hiring in Q3. We're expecting to have a very good quarter in Q4. So our plans, as Jay talked about in the earnings call, is that the market is really strong. It's moving to us. All indications are that we're in a great position. So we're going to continue to aggressively hire and really go after the growth of the Zscaler going forward. No, I think, Jay, you hit it. I mean the key thing is that we've invested significantly in federal. As Jay talked about, the FedRAMP certifications. FedRAMP High for ZPA. And also, we are moving towards FedRAMP High for ZIA, which puts us in a completely different position than other companies.  In addition, I think one of the strengths is that we've been able to build the sales organization at the organization very strongly and partners in federal. So I feel we're well positioned in the federal market going forward. Yes. I mean, just for clarification, the Enterprise segment is for employees of 2,000 to 6,000 employees per company, and it is the fastest-growing segment that we have. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the growth for new and upsell business has been a couple of percentage points. What this shows basically is our investments in the Summit Program that we've made so the Summit Program targeted primarily towards bars and bars -- primarily towards the segment, we are seeing very, very good growth, and we're happy with the growth. As I mentioned, it's the fastest-growing segment that we have. The segments we have are majors, large enterprise, enterprise and commercial. So this is the largest one. So this is growing large assets. Yes. And from a penetration perspective for our ZT customers, a little over 40% have ZPA. So significant opportunity for us to upsell into our existing customers -- sorry a little over 40% of ZIA customers, to clarify. Yes. I mean, just from a numbers perspective, we still expect the contribution for new and upsell for ZCP and ZDX to be mid-single-digits this year. As Jay mentioned, the reception of both products has been high, and we feel good about those products going forward. But think about the contribution this year for new and upsell in that mid-single-digit range. Yes. I'll take the first part and have, Jay, give some color. You're right, Patrick, outstanding results. I mean the CRPO growth is 68% and the RPO growth is 85%, which is absolutely outstanding. When you couple that with our billings growth of 71%, it just shows that, basically, things are going very well for us. What's changing is basically what we've seen. We've been talking about with the accelerant last year related to with COVID hit, and companies recognized that they had to get their employees connected to their networks in order to -- or applications in order to do business. And we saw that. That was the big increase for last year with ZPA, which is 43% of our new and upsell business. Since then, basically, that brought to light, it's basically that yesterday's networks aren't going to work. Infrastructure is not going to work. Those are the discussions that we've been having with customers. That is basically a change, which is occurring, is recognizing the current infrastructure in place is really not the optimal infrastructure that companies need going forward.  With that, what we've done as a company, we broadened our platform. We broadened our platform. We just talked about ZDX workload protection and additional basically features onto our product. So the broadening of the platform related to the movement to really transforming your networks has led to basically deal sizes becoming larger, more strategic partnership. And also, just the credibility of the Zscaler, now that they've on a public company for 3-plus years and we've got a strong balance sheet, and we've got a strong team. And again, the key thing is Zscaler was built for this world. The platform was built for this world over 10 years ago. And it was -- if you take a look at the expansion basically of the amount of traffic that we put through to have the type of gross margins with the type of traffic across over 150 data centers, with SLAs being almost zero, quite frankly, on a quarterly basis, is a testament to the strength of Zscaler. And I think that's what's playing through with our communications with our customers. Jay? From a numbers perspective, also, VARs as a percentage of our revenue is in the low 50% range. SPs and SIs combined in the low 40%. And direct is mid-single-digits. The growth rate in SPs and SIs has been significant year-over-year also. So we've had significant growth in SPs, SIs on a year-over-year basis. Yes. From a total customer perspective, we grew our customer base by about 20% year-over-year. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered outstanding results for the third quarter, with accelerating growth at scale while increasing adoption of our broader platform. We drove 60% growth in revenue and 71% growth in billings. We also generated strong growth in operating profits and delivered record free cash flow.  Enterprises are looking to Zscaler to secure their digital transformation and architect for the work-from-anywhere economy, which we believe is the new normal. Our results exceeded our expectations, and we are again increasing our guidance for fiscal \u201821. Our business is firing on all cylinders. Our superior architecture and optimized go-to-market engine is elevating us above the competitive noise. Our Zero Trust Exchange platform connects users, devices and applications, which is fundamentally different from firewall-based castle-and-moat security. Our platform prevents lateral threat movement and eliminates the attack surface by making applications invisible from the Internet, hence reducing business risk.  Furthermore, our proxy architecture, designed to inspect SSL-encrypted traffic, blocks sophisticated threats and prevents loss of sensitive data. Faced with the latest news-making ransomware and other cyberattacks, CISOs and CIOs are turning to Zscaler to dramatically improve their security posture while reducing their legacy IT costs. As you have heard me say before, architecture matters. Zscaler purpose built the right high-performance, multi-tenant proxy architecture from day one, whereas many vendors are trying to retrofit their existing solutions, which inevitably fails. Built from the start to enforce policy at the edge, as advocated by SASE framework, we are deployed across 150 data centers with five nines of availability.  We are processing more than 160 billion transactions daily, preventing up to 7 billion security incidents and policy violations. This unmatched network effect provides better security and user experience.  Let me highlight 3 factors that drove our strong performance in the quarter. First, building on our strength with large enterprises, we closed a record number of seven-figure ACV deals across a broad range of industries. Most of these wins are 3-year commitments to provide our customers the foundation for application, network and security transformation.  Second, an increasing share of our sales is coming from broader platform purchases by new and existing customers. Strong platform upsells drove our 126% dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter. Our newer solutions like out-of-band CASB, Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX and Zscaler Cloud Protection or ZCP, are increasingly contributing to our wins. The breadth and depth of our platform is resonating with customers, and I believe Zscaler is the go-to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity and better cyber protection.  Third, our strategic decision last year to increase our investments in go-to-market is yielding fantastic results. I am very pleased with our performance and momentum across all geos, all market segments and all products.  Earlier this year, we expanded our investment in the Enterprise segment, which consists of organizations with 2,000 to 6,000 employees. This quarter, we saw a higher mix of new business from this segment.  Now let me highlight key wins in the quarter, starting with ZIA. Because of the pandemic, a Global 500 technology company in Asia was routing Internet traffic of their employees working from home over VPN through the corporate data center. This created a poor user experience for SaaS applications like Office 365 and overwhelmed their security appliances. To power their workplace modernization initiative for their [80,000] employees, the customer purchased ZIA Transformation Edition including SSL inspection, cloud firewall, and sandboxing as well as ZDX. ZDX improves productivity by identifying and helping resolve user performance issues over the entire cloud network path in real-time before users complain.  In another new logo win, a global business services company facing challenges supporting work-from-anywhere purchased our Business Edition plus cloud firewall, CASB, DLP and ZDX for all 46,000 employees to directly access SaaS applications to reduce business risk and improve user experience. In addition, they replaced their legacy VPN with ZPA to provide zero trust access to private applications for their 29,000 call center employees. With the purchase of 3 of our 4 platform pillars, this customer is accelerating their digital transformation from a 5-year goal into a 6-month reality.  Next, let me share two significant deals that show our growing momentum in the financial services vertical and our increasing success working with our tech partners. A top tier global investment bank is pursuing a zero trust strategy by rebuilding its security architecture for the modern, hybrid work environment. They purchased our ZIA Business Edition plus DLP, Cloud Sandbox and ZDX for 50,000 users. With security as a major requirement, only a proxy architecture with SSL inspection at scale was considered. Our 10-year track record of running a massive, highly reliable and available inline security cloud made us the best choice. Taking advantage of the breadth of our platform, this customer also started limited deployments of additional products, including browser isolation, CASB, workload segmentation and ZPA. This deal is a great example of the successful field sales collaboration between Zscaler and our tech partner CrowdStrike.  In another financial services win, a multi-national company embracing cloud transformation purchased the entire ZIA portfolio including CASB, advanced DLP and CSPM for Microsoft Office 365, plus ZDX for 30,000 employees. Like the prior deal, this customer only considered a proxy architecture and firewall architectures were disqualified. Their Zscaler platform purchase consolidated 4 vendors, streamlined their operations and reduced IT costs. This is another great example of field sales engagement with another important tech partner, in this case, Microsoft. As these new customer wins show, the attach rate of our data protection products, including DLP, out-of-band CASB, browser isolation and CSPM for SaaS is growing.  Now, let me discuss an upsell deal that was primarily driven by data protection. An existing Global 200 pharma customer with headquarters in Europe purchased CASB, advanced DLP and Sandbox for all 79,000 employees to up-level their security. We displaced the incumbent out-of-band CASB point product, a trend we are increasingly seeing as customers are standardizing on Zscaler's integrated platform. In addition, to access private applications, they bought 3,000 ZPA seats, the first step to eliminate their legacy VPN. This latest purchase was a seven-figure ACV deal, which doubled the customer's ARR.  As we look forward to a post-pandemic world, in which employees unwittingly bring infected laptops back to the office, organizations need a true zero trust platform to eliminate the risk of lateral threat movement. Secondly, we're also seeing SD-WAN projects restarting, with companies moving to direct-to-cloud architecture from their legacy hub-and-spoke network and castle-and-moat security.  In the quarter, an existing Global 200 manufacturing customer with headquarters in Europe upgraded their 120,000 user subscription from Business to Transformation bundle to secure local breakouts at their 1,000 locations worldwide, some with SD-WAN and some without SD-WAN. The Transformation bundle added Cloud Sandbox and cloud firewall, which doubled this customer's ARR.  And finally, I'll highlight an upsell win with a global pharma company that previously purchased the Transformation bundle and ZPA for 15,000 users. Their SD-WAN deployment was delayed last year, and now they are accelerating their network and application transformation with a 5-year commitment to Zscaler. This quarter, they purchased an additional 50,000 ZIA and ZPA seats to cover all 65,000 employees, while also adding DLP for all users. They also purchased our new ZPA Private Service Edge, to enable zero trust access for their employees returning to the office. This demonstrates customers are implementing ZPA for all employees, not just for remote users.  In addition to our ongoing success in protecting users, our next big opportunity is protecting workloads with Zscaler Cloud Protection. We are rapidly expanding our ZCP portfolio, through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions.  Let me highlight our recent M&A activity. As announced last month, we acquired Trustdome, a leading provider of Cloud Infrastructure and Entitlement Management or CIEM, to complement our CSPM solution. CIEM and CSPM together, properly integrated, can correlate identity information with configuration data and enforce least privileged access for cloud environments, hence reducing business risk. This further expands our market opportunity for workload security.  In addition, today, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Smokescreen Technologies, which provides us with a deception technology to detect active attacks and lateral threat movement. We plan to integrate Smokescreen with our ZIA and ZPA solutions to enhance our active defense capabilities. You will hear more about these solutions at our Zenith Live Cloud Summit next month.  As we look forward to the next few years, we are focused on driving broader adoption of our four platform pillars, which together maximize the success of digital transformation. Our core ZIA and ZPA business has never been stronger. And we're excited about the early traction of ZDX and ZCP, the next growth engines for the company.  Now I will highlight three points about our go-to-market machine which is scaling very well. Our field organization continues to scale and is executing on all cylinders.  Moving to our partners. As I mentioned in our deal wins, we have strong and growing technology partnerships. In addition to incremental product integrations, we continue to grow our go-to-market partnership with CrowdStrike, who also became a customer this quarter. I am proud that Zscaler was named the Zero Trust Champion at Microsoft's 20/20 Partner Awards. Further expanding our technology relationships, we recently partnered with IBM to add Zscaler services to their zero trust security offerings. This partnership includes integrating with their identity, MDM and SIEM solutions, and joint go-to-market initiatives.  On the channel front, we are expanding our Summit Partner program and adding VARs that are building cloud transformation practices. Our service provider relationships are strong and we're building joint engagements with system integrators.  On the marketing front, we are aggressively investing in thought leadership for zero trust security and expanding demand generation programs.  In summary, we are making tremendous progress across all three areas, sales organization, marketing and channel partners, and delivering strong results quarter after quarter. I believe we are on track to capture a material share of our $72 billion serviceable market.  Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Alex, thank you. As you know, we have been adding and rather accelerating sales capacity. We are pleased with performance, and we are counting on it to deliver us accelerating growth. Remo, do you want to give a better color to it? And if I may add one more statement. One, it's a competitive market for talent. Zscaler has become a top destination for top talent. So we're able to attract good talent and grow our sales team stronger. I think we have been hearing enterprises talk about Zero Trust more and more for the last 12 to 18 months, especially after some of the SolarWinds type of attacks. This is bigger theme. But now, it's good to see that federal government is braking up and saying they need to do something. It's good to see a very clear directive coming from Biden administration, which highlights a need for Zero Trust. And by the way, I must say that many vendors are trying to hijack upon Zero Trust, but Zero Trust as written by the [EU] based on the MIJST research paper, it is not done by firewall. It is connecting entities to entities without a pass-through connection, and we believe we'll have a big advantage of it. We started investing in federal space about 3 years ago, had to go through a lengthy process of certifications of FedRAMP and the like. We are very well certified. We started investing in sales organization about 2 years ago, have a strong team, a strong and growing pipeline. So federal business seems great.  And the second part of your question is actually public sector, which is the non-federal part, which is state, local and education stuff. We are doing in that part very well as well. Remo? So first of all, the number of inbound engagement from not just CIO and CISOs, and in many instances, the Board has stepped up. So it's clear that there's a high degree of interest in making sure that companies are secured. That's point number one. Point number two, when those level of C-level get engaged, the budgets open up, they become less of an issue. When you're dealing with the CIO, whose budget is hundreds of millions of dollars, to get a few million dollar deal for us generally becomes a lot easier. So we are seeing tremendous interest. Our customers having discussions that they need to do Zero Trust implementation because of security factors, including Colonials and SolarWinds? Yes. Can I quantify what part of business and pipeline? Probably I'll be guesstimating too much. So I'll leave it open to, say, a positive impact, but hard to quantify. Yes. If I may add, it was natural for us to expand into enterprise. We started from the high end, having strong presence in majors and large enterprises. It's a natural part for us, and we are pleased to see the performance. In this area, we have been adding quite a bit of sales force in this area and partner program together is delivering good results. Yes, they are faster. As you would expect, typically, the bigger the deal, the longer the sales cycle. The smaller the company, fewer the stakeholders and faster the sales cycle. So first of all, from day 1, our belief was that ZPA was never designed for remote access VPN only. It was designed as a Zero Trust architecture implementation. No matter where the users are, they go through our switchboard, so they never on the corporate network. And when pandemic happened, since everyone was remote, so ZPA actually got bought from almost every employee most of the companies, that was a big shift we saw. Whereby previously, companies would buy ZPA for 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% of the employees. But we knew the number will get to 100%. And as employees are coming back to the office, in fact, customers are worried about these people bringing their infected machines back to the office, so they want to do Zero Trust even when they're in the office. So for that, they want to go through our Zero Trust Exchange. In fact, for that, we built another service, we call it Private Service Edge. Imagine a private switchboard running in your data center to implement Zero Trust for on-prem users, which is actually a great opportunity further giving customer segmentations for the applications, which is what customers are looking for. So I think it's a matter of time. And every employee of our customers will have ZIA, ZPA and actual ZDX as well. Because while ZIA and ZPA allows you to work anywhere and access any applications, ZDX makes sure users have a great experience and the issues, they can be easily solved. That is correct. We are yet to come across a serious large enterprise who doesn't believe in clear security approach, but endpoint serves as an important layer and cloud serves as a second layer. That's the most common thing I do. So it's -- when you bind to that notion, which is what we do and most customers do, it's natural for customers say, endpoint from CrowdStrike and cloud security from Zscaler. And what's exciting for customers is for the 2 to be able to work together with proper API-based integration, CrowdStrike and Zscaler had done this product integration over the past 12 to 18 months and that integration keeps on going to the next level, where we can help each other and customers get the benefit of it. So driven by product integration that customers wanted and then our joint sales engagements on field, where our teams are working together because we complement each other, it's a great win-win partnership for both of our -- both of us, CrowdStrike and us. Did I answer your question? Yes. Thank you. I'll start with the strategic positioning, and Remo can add on the point at side of it. As you know, ZCP, is cloud protection is a massive opportunity for protecting workloads. There are a couple of areas there. One big one is communication among workloads, which has traditionally done the whole school way by connecting various workloads and availability zones with a wide area network, site-to-site VPN and the like, which creates big risks because of lateral moment. So with workload segmentation, we have implemented a zero trust architecture which will disrupt legacy network-based security for workload just like with direct users with ZIA and ZPA. That's one part of it. And obviously, it's easy for us to start with our own customers, and that's a large customer base, and that's where early traction is.  And then on second side is the security posture type of stuff. This is where some of offering is cloud security, posture management, CSPM and Trustdome acquisition combined give us a strong offering. We are bullish about the ZCP market, which is nascent, but it's growing rapidly. The ZDX part is very interesting. This is complementing ZIA and ZPA to identify and resolve any user performance issues. So this is a natural add on to any ZIA and ZPA sales. Normally we used to sell ZIA only. Then we started selling ZIA and ZPA together. More and more deals are with ZIA and ZPA together at the start. And now we are seeing more and more deals with ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together, which makes a natural bundle for our customers to enable their employees to work here and have great experience. Remo color on... I think you said it all, but accelerating digital transformation being one; expanded portfolio and platform being 2; large, great sales force being three; and our brand and customer [acquisitions], all four are accelerating our sales. Yes. Our service provider channel evolved fairly early on. As our customers want transformation and CIOs told SPs to work with us to make that happen. It's a strong channel. It's a growing channel. For us took time in the past couple of years, more and more of the VARs, they realized that. The box sales are not going to last forever, so they are pivoting more. The one who are pivoting to embrace cloud transformation services, they are our favors. They're actually becoming part of our Summit Program. That's what the part -- program was built, and we have good participation for programs. And as a result of that, we're seeing the growth of VAR contribution to business growing at a faster rate. Yes. So first of all, as Remo said, our business, the SP, SIs year-over-year is growing quite well. Think in terms of other firewall type of vendors, that's not new news. Service providers have been selling firewalls, have this stuff, especially for MSSP servers for years and years. So not a new area. Yes, adding the SD-WAN to those firewalls is probably a new area of we hear about. But most of that stuff has happened on the lower end. When you talk to larger enterprises, they actually engage with us and then partner together and drive the transformation. None of that has changed. On the lower end, probably this combination of some SD-WAN combined with firewalls, but we are bullish about the SP channel, SI channel as well as the VAR channel. In fact, our investments in channel are growing significantly because that's giving us more and more leverage, and we will continue to do so. We ask this question to ourselves many, many times. We analyze it every quarter. Frankly, the truth is not a whole lot has changed on the competitive landscape. We're hearing so much noise from firewall vendors and the like. Have we seen any change? On the larger segment, larger customers that we always talked about haven't seen change much at all. We have seen a few cases. And I mentioned a couple of them during our prepared remarks. We have firewall vendors trying to go in and compete but got disqualified because they don't have the architecture.  Well, you could say that now, some of them are saying, yes, we have a proxy architecture. But announcing is one thing, building a scalable, reliable proxy that a larger enterprise would depend upon is a very different thing altogether. Having said that, when we come down to the lower end of the spectrum, say, under 5,000 users, so we do see some of them. Vendors where it's kind of less security savvy customers. But as we are engaging more and more in this space with our Enterprise segment, we do some of them. But once we engage, we are winning pretty handsomely. So very comfortable on the competitive front because customers are more and more actually on every segment looking for consolidation and simplification.  So low end players that are coming from point product and trying to expand, so to speak, don't really make it well. Some of the bigger ones, our legacy vendors, the old story, our Zero Trust Exchange platform does much better because we are truly a zero trust architecture. And as I said, you can convert a firewall into a zero trust architecture. That's kind of oxymoron. It's a good question. Both. Why not? Having said that, I would say we won't be looking for acquisitions to grow TAM. We're looking for acquisition to fill in any potential areas that need to kind of strengthen or expand into adjacent markets. It's pretty open to. We've done a few small acquisitions at the right opportunity with the right technology. We'll look for everything that makes business sense. We see that as a market opportunity for us, our momentum is so good, so why not keep on moving at a faster pace.  And on sales and marketing, we are investing. We're investing heavily. In fact, Remo and I have lots of internal debates, our top-line growth versus bottom-line. We kind of say, hey, top-line is a priority, so both of us happen to be such that we can't be spending like drunken sailors. You'll also see our bottom-line being pretty good. SD-WAN. So the answer is pretty simple. Starting with vendors who compete on the higher end who have enterprise-class architecture, they are natural to work with us because our large customers want them. As I said kind of before there, 3 vendors we see frequently for SD-WAN deployments of large enterprises. It's VMware, it's HP Aruba, and it is Cisco. Most of our customers have one of the three deployed on the high end. Then the low end customers coming from the firewall side of it, do they have some large enterprise customers? Yes, but a lot of their business ends up being on the lower end, and we see them less often. But we do have customers who may have and other SD-WAN vendors, but they decided that we were the security cloud of choice. And we're open. We integrate with everyone. I can take traffic from almost any SD-WAN vendor but with some of them we have stronger working relationships. VMware is our best partner when it comes to go to market. Yes. We've seen this movie before. If you recall, there's some proxy vendors whose sales were rising and [indiscernible] Jay, you guys are winning, why aren't they losing? I mean we are still young. We still have a small for the market, with 25%, 30% of the customers deployed us. What are other guys doing to keep on dealing with the data-centric architecture, network-centric architecture? They're buying more and more firewalls, right? It will be -- it will take some time and that is powerful thing. But I think when it comes to doing truly the new architecture with Zero Trust, where you don't put people on the network, you don't have a pass-through architecture, that's the only way to stop Colonial type kind of threats and SolarWinds type of threats. I think you'll see things changing. And that's what I think. Overall, the market is pretty big right now. We aren't really inhibited or impacted by any of those competitors who are doing well. I think -- and our share will keep them going for some time until the architecture really changes. Take, for example, spinning a VPN in the cloud doesn't make anyone Zero Trust. It's still VPN. Our customers are buying and deploying it? Of course, they are, alright? Will that change over time? Of course, it will. Can you make VPN into Zero Trust? You can't. So customers are beginning to make plans to come and work from the office. Many of them have partially opened up. What they learned during the COVID crisis was that the corporate network doesn't play a very important role. They could work from anywhere. But having said that, when employees are in the branch office, they need to make sure the traffic and go directly from the branch office to the cloud, just like it went from employee's home directly without going back to the data centers. So that is actually restarting some of the SD-WAN projects so they can do local breakout. But the bigger issue that's helping us, or the bigger opportunity that's helping us is, they want to make sure employees in the office still do Zero Trust architecture with a product like ZPA. So we are seeing good interest in fully Zero Trust, so they don't have an issue where the lateral movement of threats like SolarWinds can get them in trouble. Or the infected machines coming back to the office and get them trouble. And we are helping companies implement better security, full security asset return to the office as well. Overall, a good positive opportunity for us. When you said customer growth, are you telling a number of customers or revenue growth? Right. We are doing well in both areas, new logo growth and upsell. It's an interesting bearing in the company should be -- pay more for new logo or not, okay? And we decided not to do because there's so much an opportunity to sell the platform, which falls under upsell. The new logo, we have a good mix of business coming from new logo as well as upsell. So the opportunities, as you said, the macro environment is helping, more focus on security is helping us. Sales force, they have done a phenomenal job in the sales organization. Now we are seeing very good results from our early focus on channel, Summit partners. Marketing, we've got a new CMO. We expanded and strengthened the marketing team, a lot more investments in the marketing area. And platform and product machine is really coming at a very good speed. Very bullish on our opportunity going forward. I'd like to thank you all for your continued support. Please join us at our Zenith Live Annual Cloud Summit in mid-June. Thank you again."

We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q2, which showed accelerating growth at scale and rapid innovation of our Zero Trust platform. We drove 55% growth in revenue and 71% growth in billings, while also generating growth in operating profits and free cash flow. Our optimized go-to-market engine is driving significant velocity, including a strong pace of new customer additions. During the quarter, we achieved a milestone of over 5,000 customers, including over 500 of the Global 2000. Our strategic decision last year to increase our investments across all areas, particularly the expansion of our go-to-market and R&D teams, is yielding strong results. We drove increased wins in our enterprise segment, as we begin to pursue smaller enterprises with 2,000 to 6,000 employees. We are helping our customers to securely accelerate their digital transformation journey, which remains their top priority. With our Zero Trust Exchange, Zscaler provides secure, any-to-any connectivity for users, applications, workloads and IoT and OT systems, regardless of their location. The recent SolarWinds security incident has further elevated the need for a true zero trust platform like Zscaler. During such sophisticated attacks, our proxy-based architecture would prevent loss of sensitive data and our application-level segmentation eliminates lateral threat movement. We provide users access to applications, not the network, which is fundamentally different from firewalls and legacy network security architecture. The CIO level awareness, engagements and inbound requests for our purpose-built zero trust platform have significantly increased, and we are viewed as a foundation of application, network and security transformation. I\u2019m proud of our speed of innovation, which is accelerating and further expanding our substantial technology lead. There are four pillars of our Zero Trust Exchange: ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for user protection and experience, and ZCP for workload protection.  Last quarter, we launched our fourth pillar called Zscaler Cloud Protection or ZCP, which extends our Zero Trust Exchange from users to workloads, and has an expanding portfolio of products including: CSPM to ensure proper configuration and compliance; Workload Communication to secure app-to-app and cloud-to-cloud secure communication; and Workload Segmentation to achieve app segmentation without legacy network segmentation. In our latest major cloud upgrade, we added over 100 new product enhancements. Over the past 12 months, we have significantly increased the number of solutions delivered through our platform, including Zscaler Browser Isolation, Out-of-band CASB, Zscaler B2B and Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX. All this innovation is making our cloud platform wider and deeper. For enterprises who want network and security modernization, we believe we are the only zero-trust, multitenant platform that meets their needs. Many vendors have tried and failed to build a high performance, highly reliable proxy required for proper cybersecurity protection and data loss prevention. As a true SASE framework, we are deployed across 150 data centers, enforcing policy at the edge instead of a limited number of public cloud locations. Every day, we are processing more than 150 billion transactions, while preventing up to seven billion security incidents and policy violations. We are operating at a massive scale and doing so with environmental sustainability in mind. Our platform uses over 75% renewable energy today with a goal to use over 90%. I would like to thank our engineering teams for an exceptional job in expanding our platform and keeping Zscaler at the forefront of innovation. Now, on to the customer wins. There is an accelerated market shift towards work from anywhere, which is the world Zscaler was built for. In an upsell win, a Fortune 500 chemical company that was using ZIA for a subset of its workforce, accelerated their zero-trust initiative by purchasing ZIA transformation, ZPA and ZDX for all 45,000 employees. In addition, they bought two of our recently announced ZCP solutions. They purchased Workload Communications to secure server traffic out to the Internet from 200 plants, and Workload Segmentation for 7,000 servers to secure east/west traffic in the public cloud and data center. I am excited to see wins like this where the customer is buying all four pillars of the Zscaler platform. In a new logo win, a new Global 2000 customer in the high tech-industry purchased all three pillars of our user protection service. They purchased ZIA Transformation, ZPA and ZDX for all 10,000 employees to move away from network security to a zero-trust architecture. This customer had standardized on next-gen firewalls and VPNs, which left gaps in security leading to a ransomware attack. In spite of an ELA license from their firewall vendor, they couldn\u2019t do SSL inspection at scale. Since Zscaler is a purpose-built proxy architecture, the customer can now inspect encrypted traffic without impacting user experience, leading to better security and reduced business risk. In another new logo win, a customer in the transportation services industry purchased three of our four pillars, ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for their 7,500 employees. With their cloud and mobile first strategy, they purchased our best-in-class DLP and CASB to protect sensitive information from leaking, no matter where the user is. ZDX was purchased to pinpoint and resolve performance issues in real-time by monitoring the digital experience score of every user and application regardless of their location. We are seeing a strong customer interest for our new pillars, ZDX and ZCP. Over 200 customers to-date have purchased ZDX. ZCP is also off to a great start, with a few dozen deals closed in Q2 and great excitement for our ZCP Workload Communication. Moving on to ZPA. Our customers view ZPA as the foundation for their architectural shift to zero-trust access for private applications. ZPA is the clear market leader, with proven maturity and scalability, supporting millions of daily active users and nearly 40% of our global 2000 customers. Today, ZPA is delivering over million unique application segments without operational overhead of traditional network segmentation. Let me highlight several ZPA deals in the quarter. A Global 500 consumer products company with headquarters in EMEA that has been a ZIA customer, purchased ZPA for all 100,000 employees and 10,000 third-party B2B partners. This customer wanted to eliminate the security risk of VPN, which provides unfettered access to network resources. ZPA represents the next step in zero trust adoption for their IT transformation journey. In an upsell deal, a Global 2000 bank with headquarters in EMEA started with ZIA and ZPA for 10,000 employees in July to expand their work-from-home capacity as a result of the pandemic. Within six months of the initial purchase, the customer bought ZIA and ZPA for the remaining 30,000 employees and CASB for all 40,000 employees. In addition, they purchased ZPA to enable 3,000 third-party B2B partners. Let me highlight a ZIA and ZPA new logo win in the federal space. A research organization mandated with advising federal agencies on cybersecurity, purchased our ZIA Transformation bundle and ZPA for all 10,000 employees after evaluating various zero-trust architectures. This customer concluded that if a user connects to the network with a VPN, that is not zero trust. Based on this criteria, the legacy firewall and VPN providers were disqualified. An important consideration for our selection was ZPA\u2019s position as the first and only cloud security service with FedRAMP certification for Zero Trust Remote Access. With the highest levels of FedRAMP certifications for both ZIA and ZPA, we are very well positioned to serve the Federal government. Lastly, I would like to share another new customer win that highlights our continued ZIA success with large enterprises that are embracing direct to cloud architecture and migrating away from their complex, legacy onpremise appliances. A Fortune 100 professional services customer purchased our ZIA Transformation bundle plus CASB, advanced DLP and CSPM for Office 365 to protect 125,000 employees across 150 countries as they embraced work from anywhere. Zscaler eliminated the need for 30 different gateways and consolidated six different legacy point products, while meeting the customer\u2019s environmental goals for their ESG program. With sensitive customer data at risk, security was a major requirement and the customer only considered solutions with a proxy architecture. Let me conclude with some thoughts on our vision and strategy. At our Analyst Day in January, we laid out our audacious goal of serving 200 million users and 100 million workloads on our Zero Trust Exchange. To achieve that: Our entire organization is focused on attracting and developing talent and creating a culture of excellence. Our commitment to culture starts at the top with our executive team and creates an environment where a global and diverse workforce can deliver excellence to help our customers succeed. We are scaling our world-class engineering organization, which continues to rapidly deliver new products and features to our customers. On the go-to-market front, as we have demonstrated over the last 12 months, we have built a sophisticated sales machine to sell value and deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level. We will continue to scale our sales organization, as we are a destination for top talent. Our Marketing organization is augmenting talent in all critical areas while specializing campaigns by persona and segment to better address our significant opportunity. We are focused on driving broader adoption of our four pillars. We will continue to expand our ecosystem of technology partners and value-based channel partners, who are contributing to sales velocity and expanding our reach. I believe we are on the right track to capture a material share of the $72 billion serviceable market that we outlined on our Analyst Day. We are also seeing opportunities in bringing zero trust to IoT and OT systems, and are excited about 5G, which pushes computing further to the edge and opens up additional opportunities for Zscaler. We are excited about our future. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the second quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter was a $157.0 million, up 10% sequentially and 55% year-over-year. ZPA product revenue was 14% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions: Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 38% and APJ was 11%. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 71% year-over-year to $232.0 million, with billing duration around the mid-point of our 10-14 month range. As a reminder our contract terms are typically one to three years, and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancellable future revenue, exceeded $1 billion during the quarter and ended at $1.025 billion as of January 31. RPO grew 68% from one year ago. The current RPO is 53% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which was 127% compared to 122% last quarter and 116% a year ago. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger transformation bundles, selling both ZIA and ZPA from the start, and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 127% is outstanding. Total gross margin of 81% was flat quarter-over-quarter and declined one percentage point year-over-year, but exceeded our expectations. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of newly introduced products. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, which includes ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 80% for the full year in fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 18% sequentially and 60% year-over-year to $112.9 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by two percentage points from 70% a year ago to 72% in the quarter. Sales and marketing expense increased 19% sequentially and 57% year-over-year to $76.5 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives offset by lower T&E with our employees working from home. We've been very successful in hiring and onboarding remotely, and we are accelerating our sales and marketing hiring throughout the second half of the fiscal year. R&D expenses increased 15% sequentially and 71% year-over-year to $24.0 million. The increase is primarily due to continued investments in our engineering teams. G&A expenses increased 14% sequentially and 57% year-over-year to $12.5 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation-related expenses and professional fees. Our second quarter operating margin was 9% compared to 12% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $14 million or a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $18 million in the quarter, which compares to negative $2 million during the same quarter last year. The strength in free cash flow was driven by strong receivable collections. Now, moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $162 million to $164 million reflecting a year-over-year growth of 47% to 48%. Operating profit of $11 million to $12 million, Other Income of $300,000, net of interest payments on our senior convertible notes. Income taxes of $1.5 million and earnings per share of approximately $0.07 assuming approximately 146 million common shares outstanding. Due to better than expected first half performance and our strong pipeline, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2021 guidance for revenue, calculated billings and operating profit. For fiscal 2021 we now expect revenue in the range of $634 million to $638 million or year-over-year growth of 47% to 48%. Calculated billings in the range of $820 million to $825 million or year-over-year growth of 49% to 50%. Operating profit in the range of $59 million to $61 million. Other income of $2.4 million, income taxes of $5.3 million, and earnings per share in the range of $0.39 to $0.40 assuming approximately 145 million to 146 million common shares outstanding. For your modeling, we would like to remind investors that Q2 and Q4 have historically been our strongest billing quarters with declines in Q1 and Q3 quarters, respectively. The average sequential decline in billings during fiscal third quarters over the last five years was approximately 20%. We continue to see the market coming to us and we remain committed to investing aggressively in our company behind the growth in our business. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will continue to take priority considering our strong business momentum. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Well, thank you so much. And congratulations guys on all the success really phenomenal results. Jay, I wanted to ask you a high level question around the impact that the Sunburst Breach is having on the industry. At your Analyst Day in January, you'd mentioned that the impact is likely to be larger than the Target breach was in 2013. And if you can maybe parse out for us how the event has impacted your pipeline across your strategic accounts, maybe all the way down to smaller commercial accounts and how, if at all, you've changed the way you approach initial conversations with new prospects?\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Brad. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, we are having increased conversations with our customers as well as prospects. We had Sunburst related webinar recently and had over 800 customers attended. This week, I was asked to talk to Board of Directors of a pharma company, and the primary topic was protecting against sophisticated threats like Sunburst. So all this is making cyber a bigger priority than it has been. It's a bigger priority for CIOs as well as the Board. So what is that causing? It is increasing engagements. I'm not sure I can quantify the impact on the pipeline, but we're seeing that the customers who are already educated on Zero Trust quite a bit are making implementation of Zero Trust a bigger priority. The number one question ends up being if people get compromised, how do make sure that the lateral movement doesn't happen? The answer is simple. Don't connect people to your network. Don't build a moat with firewalls and VPNs, do Zero Trust implementation where you connect users to applications not to the network.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much, Jay. Congrats.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. Good evening. This is Daniel on from Mike. Thanks for taking my question. So I know over the past quarters, you've been working on really improving your sales motion in the SMB and smaller enterprise area. Can you just provide some color on some of the investments you are making. And I guess, where you expect to be moving forward?\nJay Chaudhry: I will start and Remo going to add on. Yes, we talked about our expansion towards the enterprise segment that we defined as between 2,000 and 6,000 employees in a company. As you know, we have done extremely well in the higher end in large enterprises for the last several years. So in this segment, the progress we've made is ahead of our expectations. Our growth was faster in this segment. Well, it did come from a smaller base. Having said that, our large enterprise segment is driving the overall strength of our business. We are doing three specific things to grow our business in this enterprise segment, one, adding more sales reps, more sales teams. And we had done a lot of good progress in the past two quarters and we'll do more in the coming quarters. Secondly, adding and expanding channel partners who covered the segment. And third, we are directing our marketing programs to support the segment as well. So in summary, it's a good opportunity to expand the segment and we are doing well. We're pleased with the performance.\nRemo Canessa: Just as a quick follow on, we put together a \u2013 or initiated a Summit program a few quarters ago and that is doing well. And so \u2013 as a percentage of our revenue, VARs did pick up slightly in the quarter. VARs as a percentage of our revenues in the quarter was about \u2013 just above 50% where the quarter before it was in the high 40s. So, as Jay talked about, I mean the segments that we sell into commercial less than 2,000 employees enterprise to the 6,000 \u2013 large enterprise, 6,000 to 40,000 and majors at the 40,000. So the channel program, we're expecting to have positive results for us in the lower part of the market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Thank you very much. I was to talk to one of the architectural issues that I think is fairly interesting differentiator, which is the argument that you guys have built a network based off per user policy implementation versus architectures from some of your \u2013 one of your competitors that are unable to differentiate the traffic flows on a per user basis, or have the policy implementations on a per user basis. Can you talk about that delta between what you're doing and how that shows up in alternative competitors networks?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. The fundamental difference is being a pass through on network security architecture when traffic is flowing over the network and a traditional device, like a firewall is trying to scan what kind of application is, guess it and trying to stop it or not. With our proxy architecture, where we terminate every connection, inspect and decide to connect to a particular user. So we have policies that are per user by design. There's no \u2013 in fact, a user coming from company A or company B or company C each looks like an untrusted user. While in the traditional way, they are kind of batch based policies. The end result is \u2013 our architecture gives us two big benefits. One with proxy we can do far better inspection at a high scale high performance, including SSL. Two, it allows us to do Zero Trust where you don't connect people to a network. You connect to a specific application. Zero Trust is probably the biggest thing to help you minimize the damage of lateral movement if something gets infected.\nAlex Henderson: Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comments comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great, thanks. And congrats on a great quarter. So I just wanted to follow up on Brad's earlier question regarding SolarWinds. It sounds like that's creating more pipeline but not necessarily contributing to revenue yet. But your billings growth is the strongest that we've seen in over two years. So I'm wondering if you could just comment on what the key drivers are that are contributing to that inflection in your billings growth. Now SolarWinds winds, it doesn't look like it's really had much of an impact yet.\nJay Chaudhry: Generally, in all these sessions, analysts like to pinpoint to particular event that may cause something, so COVID was viewed as maybe the catalyst. This is being viewed as a catalyst. As we have said before, the overall catalyst is that everyone is driving towards digital transformation, COVID maybe helping it SolarWinds maybe helping it. But customers are realizing that they believe that they need to accelerate their transformation. And we are the one who enabled the transformation. If you do your transformation without something like Zscaler, your risk goes up significantly. So where is our growth coming from? ZIA, which has been our work course. Yes. Now we've got over 25% of global 2000 companies, but we have 75% more to go. It is generating pretty good sales, ZPA, which was relatively young product two or three years ago now is actually contributing significantly about 40% of our global 2000 customers already have our ZPA. So these two are the biggest contributors of our billings growth. And then the new pillars ZDX is picking up quite well. And also is that the new pillar off cloud protection? I think I'm very pleased that our customers are buying more and more bigger bundles together. I talked about ZIA, ZPA and ZDX being bought together by our customers during our in my prepared remarks. So across the board, we're seeing strength from product side of it, across [indiscernible] Remo, you want to add to my comments?\nRemo Canessa: No, I think, Jay is absolutely right. If you take a look at the breadth of our platform, before we're user centric, now basically we're also cloud protection \u2013 so workload protection. So the breadth of the platform is resonating with our customers. In addition when we talked at the Analyst Day that for companies of 5,000 employees on the user side, we'd expect, we're seeing ARPUs in that $145 range. I can say that in the quarter, we've had deals with customers at the 5,000 employee range in that range at $145. So what's happening basically is that there's a huge need in the market. Legacy architecture is not the answer. And so with Zscaler with the breadth of platform \u2013 in the increasing platform that we've created and we'll continue to create is really perfectly set to go forward into this market. \nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you guys so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nErik Suppiger: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Say given what you were saying earlier about proxy versus firewall, can you comment on how if \u2013 how difficult it is to augment firewall architectures with proxy capabilities, because I think one of your competitors is talking about introducing that kind of capability to their solution?\nJay Chaudhry: Well, what should I say? Imitation is the best form of flattery. Having said that, I would say that there's something called native architecture, or purpose-built architecture. There's something called bolt-on. Building proxy is hard, because you terminate, you inspect and you reconnect, compare that to a pass through firewall, you don't stop anything. You let it to go. If you catch something, it's great. If you don't, you don't. Many vendors have tried and failed to build a high-performance proxy because it's hard. The only two vendors in the past 20 years have successfully penetrated enterprises for user security, blue code for on-prem and they've done it for the cloud. So I think am I surprised that people try to get by without a proxy? And finally the customer said, no, no, no. So they change it. I think delivering this thing will be tricky. I've seen many companies do it. There have been vendors, who have been saying that they had a proxy for six, seven years. I would rather not name them, but I still haven't seen them in the market. So we keep on, we are not sitting still. We keep on advancing. The most functionality you add browser isolation, to CASB, to content inspection, or DLP and all, your proxy has to do more and more work and still deliver throughput and still do threat inspections. So we welcome the competition, but we are very pleased with our performance, that kind of lead we have over traditional legacy vendors.\nErik Suppiger: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. So how about the networks on the earnings call pointed out the success that they've had with prisma access and given the commentary about the success that you're seeing in the enterprise. I'm curious, are you running into each other in an increasing fashion in that segment? And it's just that the space is so big that you're both able to grow at these rates, or do you think you're serving different segments of the overall opportunity in the market?\nJay Chaudhry: New firewall vendors started making noise a couple of years ago, a lot of noise, then it died down about six months after that. In the field, we haven't really changed, seen a whole lot of change to it. When it comes to large enterprises where we dominate, we haven't seen any change in competitive landscape. And I can understand why. Large enterprises are security savvy. They understand the difference between proxy and non proxy. They understand Zero Trust and VPN. And that's why we don't expect to see firewall-based architecture in those enterprises. And all of you guys are so close to banks. Find a large bank who believes in not having proxy, but using firewall architecture for security. I have not found one. I think when it comes to lower end of the spectrum, probably in the 5,000 users or below, we do see firewall vendors from time to time. And from time to time, these guys on that sophisticated, they can be probably tricked into find something that may not be that sophisticated. So I think you'll see less sophisticated solutions being bought on the lower end. But on the higher end, we haven't seen any change in competition.\nSterling Auty: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the lie of Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Hey, thank you for taking my question and congrats on a very impressive quarter. Just asking about head count and hiring. I mean, that was a major theme of fiscal 2020. And it looks potentially in the numbers that that was probably helping to contribute to growth this quarter. I mean, can you just help us understand how you guys think about hiring now? And if you can share any numbers around net headcount adds year-on-year sequentially, that'd be great.\nRemo Canessa: I'll take that. So the net headcount as we had in the quarter was about 240 and it was about 260 in Q1. Generally speaking, it's around 60% sales and marketing heads. And that's what it was also \u2013 and historically, it's been pretty much every quarter, and that was the case in Q2. The comment about accelerating, hiring, yes, we are. We're accelerating, hiring. We see a huge market opportunity. We see that we are doing well. We see that we've got the right product for the market. So we're going to continue to invest across the board in the company in particular with quota [ph] sales reps. We had a record quarter hiring in Q4. We had a comparable quarter in Q1 and we had a very good quarter in Q2 and we plan to continue to hire aggressively throughout the back half of the year. Again, from our perspective, we've talked about putting growth and a profitability. We'll be mindful of profitability. Since our public offering, we've been positive profitability and free cash flow, Jay and I are very mindful of that. And we'll continue to be mindful of that. But this is such a big opportunity that we feel that we want to take advantage of it and we're going to invest in it. And we're going to try to capture it. \nJay Chaudhry: Yes, if I may add, over the past four quarters we have pretty openly shared with you a game plan, of scaling our sales organization, building our sales engine from enablement to training and all of those things. And I think you're seen the results being delivered quarter-after-quarter. So, we are bullish about it and we'll keep on increasing our head count, and sales, and engineering, and customer support and all other related areas.\nPatrick Colville: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from UBS. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my questions. Remo question for you, Jay, in his prepared remarks alluded to a number of very large sort of wall-to-wall transactions that were also multi-product. So, I'm wondering if you could comment on the large deal activity that you saw in the quarter and if it was maybe outsized in any particular regions? It would be really helpful if you can give us some quantification of that?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. A good question. So large deal activity was strong in the quarter, it was comparable to Q1. It was significantly higher than last year. From a geographic perspective, all regions did well. I mean, we are investing in all regions, pretty much the same, same level. APJ, probably a little bit faster than the other regions, but all regions have done well and we continue to invest. Related to the comment I made before, when companies see \u2013 with the breadth of the platform that we have and companies see the value of Zscaler. And the ease of implementation, the increased security and also the ROI. The value proposition is resonating with our customers. And so, we're seeing that. And so, by adding ZDX and ZCP and broadening the platform, it actually increases the value of what we're \u2013 of Zscaler. If I may add a couple of points to it, we have truly expanded the platform. We haven't gone on a buying spree and throw them in there and call it a platform because those \u2013 these unintegrated products don't add a lot of value, our customers see the value. For example, to turn on ZDX, it's literally a few minutes. It hardly takes anything because the traffic is already flowing through everything is happening. The second one, I like to make is, yes, we did have what you call wall-to-wall deals. I guess that meant all teller deals. But there are no mega deals in the quarter. Okay. And there's no one time kind of special deal that artificially increased our billings numbers. It was properly distributed various pillars, and across all geos.\nRemo Canessa: As a follow-on for Jay also it was a new record quarter also for new customers. So, it was broad, it was strong, and as Jay mentioned, there's no mega deals that we've had in the quarter.\nFatima Boolani: Thanks. Thank you so much.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Swanson: Yes, thank you. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt. Jay, kind of going back on some of those large deals, it seemed like you had a lot of success upselling the, INVPA [ph]. I know at the Analyst Day, we talked about maybe six times upsell opportunity within your base. When it comes to kind of realizing that opportunity is it more just a matter of time and as the customer see the value they are coming back, or are there steps you can take to kind of more aggressively pursue that expansion?\nJay Chaudhry: So, I think our customers are happy and trusting us. So that's a starting point. If that's not the case, you want to sell; two, you need proper sales, execution, engagement, our engagement, staffs in C-level, the sales machine that built is helping us. So, we are getting pretty good share of upsell deals. In fact, we don't have differentiation between incentive, sales incentive, or sales that we upsell. So, we aren't pleased with the upsell performance and new performance. We have internal debate between how much do we need new versus upsell, Remo and I decide, let the total ACV rule, we have both opportunities. But we have seen good growth, good upsell numbers every quarter.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. And there's a quick follow-on for Jay to some numbers. Upsell was very strong, new business was very strong also. If the split between new and upsell in the first half was approximately fifty-fifty upsell in Q2 was slightly below 50%\nJay Chaudhry: Sorry new was 50%.\nRemo Canessa: Excuse me new was slightly below 50%.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes.\nRemo Canessa: And going forward, we think a good mix, for Zscaler is fifty-fifty. In the reasons, the point that you brought up, I mean the 6x, ability to upsell into existing customers, just for ZIA and ZPA. And so, it is significant. \nMatt Swanson: Thank you, guys. Great quarter.\nBill Choi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Great to see that billings acceleration. And on that, I was wondering, if we could get a little bit of color around your hiring rate, I think, it was brought up in a previous question, but wondering, have you ever reached some kind of a terminal velocity in terms of the rate of hiring, and the rate of training and the rate of maturation within your salesforce? And maybe a little bit of color too, around how you're attracting talent in the market? Is it primarily in localized area or is it from multiple geographies that you're able to attract better count on your platform?\nJay Chaudhry: I will start, then you can add on. So, first of all, we have become the top destination for the top talent. While on the market is competitive, we actually don't have problem in attracting good talent, whether that's in sales organization or engineering. So please obviously with that, you need to make sure you have things in place, a proper team for hiring, but that's happening. Related to Joe's or where the concentration is from sales point of view, we are where the customer is. We are a very global organization with big presence all over U.S., all over Europe, APJ, Japan, India, Singapore, all of these places. So, we are attracting talent from everywhere. And generally, on the sales side, we are looking for talent coming from companies who know how to sell solutions, who need to solve software, who know how to sell transformation sales. That's the first part. The second part was at ability to train. Over the past four quarters we shared with you how we build the sales enablement team, how we built the team with sales leaders that proper \u2013 even proper process for interview for these people, with the whole documented process. I think we are very optimized. I would say it's as optimized as I ever seen out there. So that's why you are able to add significantly large number and make them pretty productive in a shorter amount of time that we would do otherwise. We shared a little bit off that during our Analyst Day, the kind of impact that's being made with better training and better enablement.\nRemo Canessa: As just a quick follow-on from my perspective, from being around, sales organizations, my career, really good sales organizations, nothing matches what we have here at Zscaler. Nothing. The organization top to bottom from the way it's structured and the ability to scale. And as Jay talked about the training with the sales enablement group, never seen anything like it in my career. It gives us the ability, as Jay said, we're not looking for people who sell traditional, right. We're looking for people who could sell transformation. And to do that, you need to be trained and we are a destination. So, do we have the ability to increase our hiring phase? We do. Do we have the ability to onboard quickly? We do. Do we see salespeople getting to productivity faster? We are. So, I mean, it's a good place to be.\nBrian Essex: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTal Liani: Hi guys. My question is about the comps for 2021. Do you feel, or do you have any data to think that some of the growth this year was related to COVID an increase in license take rate because of COVID. And if that's the case, we might have an issue second half 2021 with the comps. I know that this is on investors\u2019 mind, and I'm wondering if you have any data to support the view one way or another?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, let me start with the general comments Remo, you can be more specific. I give you the hard part. \nRemo Canessa: I will have to give numbers.\nJay Chaudhry: Look we do believe that work [indiscernible] has had to stay, I guess, COVID became a catalyst to shake off inertia. It actually changed the mindset and it really not just gave momentum, but also brought to light the limitations of legacy network and security. So, we are seeing our customers saying we are implementing zero trust, which means any ZIA ZPA top on deployments even after everything gets back to normal. If that was not the case, they would be doing short term ZPA deal and saying, I'm going back to the office, I no longer need to renewal of ZPA, beyond seeing that. So, we think the world is changing. So, going back to the office should not be impacting our momentum of the business. That's how I look at it overall. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Pipeline is strong and interest is high in Zscaler, and engagement is significant.\nTal Liani: Got it. Not much \u2013 thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nHamza Fodderwala: Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Jay my first question for you, you talked about really strong traction with VDX. I think it was over 200 customers on that product. When you initially launched the solution, it seemed like it would be something that would be perhaps more complimentary with the monitoring vendors. I'm wondering, given the strong traction that you've had, what is your sort of ambition with this product?\nRemo Canessa: It is complimentary with application monitoring, right? Okay. So, but it's not complimentary, but network monitoring vendors because network monitoring vendors are monitoring traffic between your branch office and the data center over your private network. Private networks are going away, people are sitting anywhere. When you're sitting at home and going to office 365, all your data center, what network monitoring tools can you use? Hardly any. So, we are sitting on the endpoint, we are connecting to user application, we are sitting in the middle, we see the application side, we see the end point side and the best players to give you end-to-end monitoring and compliment application monitoring vendors.\nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. And then just maybe a follow-up question for Remo obviously, massive expansion of the Salesforce and the channel over the past couple of years. But I'm curious what percentage of, these reps are fully productive, right, given the traditional ramp period that they have?\nRemo Canessa: Yes, let me just answer it saying that two thirds of our sales reps are still ramping, so they're not fully ramped. When I say ramping, they have been here for less than year.\nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for working me in. So yes, I'll be quick. So just looking back last year a lot of companies that they went out and they purchased additional VPN capacity from legacy vendors, really as part of continuity initiatives, are you seeing some of those deals come up for renewal? And do you think that gives you an incremental opportunity to gain share as those companies look to modernize their solutions?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, I would say as I have discussion with our large enterprises and I personally do quite a few. We are yet to find a customer who has I talked to who said, I want to keep VPN for the long run. They're all, in various stages of the journey, the growth you see often ZPA, a former customer base is a result of more and more Zscaler customers embracing Zero Trust and ZPA. I do believe that all there would be some exception, but most of Zscaler ZIA customers will embrace ZPA. And I see them more and more embracing ZDX as well. Our strategy of all prime, up well [ph], design, integrated platform with four pillars is working well. Two years ago, the question used to be, can ZPA take off? Right? That question has been answered over and over. Now, the question is can ZDX and ZCP take off? Early indications are very good. But back to your question s VPN replacement vendors an opportunity for us? Absolutely, yes. Our starting point of ZIA is replacing the user protection, which typically is a proxy. And then we start expanding it to the full bundle. Our ZPA entry point is generally a VPN vendor. And then you expand to, Zero Trust with app segmentation.\nGray Powell: Got it. Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one last question. Our final question will be from the line of Yun Kim from Loop Capital Market. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: So, Jay on the new cloud workload protection product since you are already getting some early traction there, are you seeing an opportunity to partner with hyperscalers, such as AWS and Azure since a lot of the cloud workloads reside on those hyperscaler platforms, and I know you already have partnership with VIA VTA for AWS. And then also in addition, do you see the need to begin to target like dev-ops team for your cloud workload product?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, it's a good question. So, as you said, we have already engaged with leading cloud providers with ZIA and ZPA. On the cloud protection area, we got some early initiative going, there's a good complimentary fit-PC with them. And I think it's a little bit early. I mean, it's only a quarter or so, but the momentum is strong, the pipeline, we\u2019re building is strong. The way you should look at Zscaler Cloud Protection is not the way you look at traditional vendors who say, I'm going to take my firewall and put the virtual firewall in the cloud. We think that trying to replicate your data center in the cloud never worked for even moving apps. How is it going to work for security? We look at workloads like mirror image of users and should be protected like users. So that Zero Trust Exchange, we are able to connect a workload in Region A to workload Region B over the Internet, coming through our Zero Trust Exchange. That's truly what makes us very different architecturally. Now, the next part of your question was left-shift stuff. As we are engaging with our customers, they are having dialogue with us as they are figuring out their left-shift strategy. It's a new area and we are closely monitoring it. As the market evolves, you can rest assured we will be there to serve our customers.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jay Chaudhry, Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Great. Thank you for joining us. I hope the session was worthwhile. We hope to see you as our next earnings call or before that in one of the investor events we'll be joining. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you,\nBill Choi: Good bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the second quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter was a $157.0 million, up 10% sequentially and 55% year-over-year. ZPA product revenue was 14% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions: Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 38% and APJ was 11%. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter. Billings grew 71% year-over-year to $232.0 million, with billing duration around the mid-point of our 10-14 month range. As a reminder our contract terms are typically one to three years, and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancellable future revenue, exceeded $1 billion during the quarter and ended at $1.025 billion as of January 31. RPO grew 68% from one year ago. The current RPO is 53% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which was 127% compared to 122% last quarter and 116% a year ago. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger transformation bundles, selling both ZIA and ZPA from the start, and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 127% is outstanding. Total gross margin of 81% was flat quarter-over-quarter and declined one percentage point year-over-year, but exceeded our expectations. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of newly introduced products. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, which includes ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 80% for the full year in fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 18% sequentially and 60% year-over-year to $112.9 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by two percentage points from 70% a year ago to 72% in the quarter. Sales and marketing expense increased 19% sequentially and 57% year-over-year to $76.5 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives offset by lower T&E with our employees working from home. We've been very successful in hiring and onboarding remotely, and we are accelerating our sales and marketing hiring throughout the second half of the fiscal year. R&D expenses increased 15% sequentially and 71% year-over-year to $24.0 million. The increase is primarily due to continued investments in our engineering teams. G&A expenses increased 14% sequentially and 57% year-over-year to $12.5 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation-related expenses and professional fees. Our second quarter operating margin was 9% compared to 12% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $14 million or a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.10. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $18 million in the quarter, which compares to negative $2 million during the same quarter last year. The strength in free cash flow was driven by strong receivable collections. Now, moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $162 million to $164 million reflecting a year-over-year growth of 47% to 48%. Operating profit of $11 million to $12 million, Other Income of $300,000, net of interest payments on our senior convertible notes. Income taxes of $1.5 million and earnings per share of approximately $0.07 assuming approximately 146 million common shares outstanding. Due to better than expected first half performance and our strong pipeline, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2021 guidance for revenue, calculated billings and operating profit. For fiscal 2021 we now expect revenue in the range of $634 million to $638 million or year-over-year growth of 47% to 48%. Calculated billings in the range of $820 million to $825 million or year-over-year growth of 49% to 50%. Operating profit in the range of $59 million to $61 million. Other income of $2.4 million, income taxes of $5.3 million, and earnings per share in the range of $0.39 to $0.40 assuming approximately 145 million to 146 million common shares outstanding. For your modeling, we would like to remind investors that Q2 and Q4 have historically been our strongest billing quarters with declines in Q1 and Q3 quarters, respectively. The average sequential decline in billings during fiscal third quarters over the last five years was approximately 20%. We continue to see the market coming to us and we remain committed to investing aggressively in our company behind the growth in our business. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will continue to take priority considering our strong business momentum. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Just as a quick follow on, we put together a \u2013 or initiated a Summit program a few quarters ago and that is doing well. And so \u2013 as a percentage of our revenue, VARs did pick up slightly in the quarter. VARs as a percentage of our revenues in the quarter was about \u2013 just above 50% where the quarter before it was in the high 40s. So, as Jay talked about, I mean the segments that we sell into commercial less than 2,000 employees enterprise to the 6,000 \u2013 large enterprise, 6,000 to 40,000 and majors at the 40,000. So the channel program, we're expecting to have positive results for us in the lower part of the market. No, I think, Jay is absolutely right. If you take a look at the breadth of our platform, before we're user centric, now basically we're also cloud protection \u2013 so workload protection. So the breadth of the platform is resonating with our customers. In addition when we talked at the Analyst Day that for companies of 5,000 employees on the user side, we'd expect, we're seeing ARPUs in that $145 range. I can say that in the quarter, we've had deals with customers at the 5,000 employee range in that range at $145. So what's happening basically is that there's a huge need in the market. Legacy architecture is not the answer. And so with Zscaler with the breadth of platform \u2013 in the increasing platform that we've created and we'll continue to create is really perfectly set to go forward into this market. I'll take that. So the net headcount as we had in the quarter was about 240 and it was about 260 in Q1. Generally speaking, it's around 60% sales and marketing heads. And that's what it was also \u2013 and historically, it's been pretty much every quarter, and that was the case in Q2. The comment about accelerating, hiring, yes, we are. We're accelerating, hiring. We see a huge market opportunity. We see that we are doing well. We see that we've got the right product for the market. So we're going to continue to invest across the board in the company in particular with quota [ph] sales reps. We had a record quarter hiring in Q4. We had a comparable quarter in Q1 and we had a very good quarter in Q2 and we plan to continue to hire aggressively throughout the back half of the year. Again, from our perspective, we've talked about putting growth and a profitability. We'll be mindful of profitability. Since our public offering, we've been positive profitability and free cash flow, Jay and I are very mindful of that. And we'll continue to be mindful of that. But this is such a big opportunity that we feel that we want to take advantage of it and we're going to invest in it. And we're going to try to capture it. As a follow-on for Jay also it was a new record quarter also for new customers. So, it was broad, it was strong, and as Jay mentioned, there's no mega deals that we've had in the quarter. Excuse me new was slightly below 50%. And going forward, we think a good mix, for Zscaler is fifty-fifty. In the reasons, the point that you brought up, I mean the 6x, ability to upsell into existing customers, just for ZIA and ZPA. And so, it is significant. As just a quick follow-on from my perspective, from being around, sales organizations, my career, really good sales organizations, nothing matches what we have here at Zscaler. Nothing. The organization top to bottom from the way it's structured and the ability to scale. And as Jay talked about the training with the sales enablement group, never seen anything like it in my career. It gives us the ability, as Jay said, we're not looking for people who sell traditional, right. We're looking for people who could sell transformation. And to do that, you need to be trained and we are a destination. So, do we have the ability to increase our hiring phase? We do. Do we have the ability to onboard quickly? We do. Do we see salespeople getting to productivity faster? We are. So, I mean, it's a good place to be. I will have to give numbers. Pipeline is strong and interest is high in Zscaler, and engagement is significant. It is complimentary with application monitoring, right? Okay. So, but it's not complimentary, but network monitoring vendors because network monitoring vendors are monitoring traffic between your branch office and the data center over your private network. Private networks are going away, people are sitting anywhere. When you're sitting at home and going to office 365, all your data center, what network monitoring tools can you use? Hardly any. So, we are sitting on the endpoint, we are connecting to user application, we are sitting in the middle, we see the application side, we see the end point side and the best players to give you end-to-end monitoring and compliment application monitoring vendors. Yes, let me just answer it saying that two thirds of our sales reps are still ramping, so they're not fully ramped. When I say ramping, they have been here for less than year. Thank you,"

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. We are very pleased with our strong performance in Q2, which showed accelerating growth at scale and rapid innovation of our Zero Trust platform. We drove 55% growth in revenue and 71% growth in billings, while also generating growth in operating profits and free cash flow. Our optimized go-to-market engine is driving significant velocity, including a strong pace of new customer additions. During the quarter, we achieved a milestone of over 5,000 customers, including over 500 of the Global 2000. Our strategic decision last year to increase our investments across all areas, particularly the expansion of our go-to-market and R&D teams, is yielding strong results. We drove increased wins in our enterprise segment, as we begin to pursue smaller enterprises with 2,000 to 6,000 employees. We are helping our customers to securely accelerate their digital transformation journey, which remains their top priority. With our Zero Trust Exchange, Zscaler provides secure, any-to-any connectivity for users, applications, workloads and IoT and OT systems, regardless of their location. The recent SolarWinds security incident has further elevated the need for a true zero trust platform like Zscaler. During such sophisticated attacks, our proxy-based architecture would prevent loss of sensitive data and our application-level segmentation eliminates lateral threat movement. We provide users access to applications, not the network, which is fundamentally different from firewalls and legacy network security architecture. The CIO level awareness, engagements and inbound requests for our purpose-built zero trust platform have significantly increased, and we are viewed as a foundation of application, network and security transformation. I'm proud of our speed of innovation, which is accelerating and further expanding our substantial technology lead. There are four pillars of our Zero Trust Exchange: ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for user protection and experience, and ZCP for workload protection.  Last quarter, we launched our fourth pillar called Zscaler Cloud Protection or ZCP, which extends our Zero Trust Exchange from users to workloads, and has an expanding portfolio of products including: CSPM to ensure proper configuration and compliance; Workload Communication to secure app-to-app and cloud-to-cloud secure communication; and Workload Segmentation to achieve app segmentation without legacy network segmentation. In our latest major cloud upgrade, we added over 100 new product enhancements. Over the past 12 months, we have significantly increased the number of solutions delivered through our platform, including Zscaler Browser Isolation, Out-of-band CASB, Zscaler B2B and Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX. All this innovation is making our cloud platform wider and deeper. For enterprises who want network and security modernization, we believe we are the only zero-trust, multitenant platform that meets their needs. Many vendors have tried and failed to build a high performance, highly reliable proxy required for proper cybersecurity protection and data loss prevention. As a true SASE framework, we are deployed across 150 data centers, enforcing policy at the edge instead of a limited number of public cloud locations. Every day, we are processing more than 150 billion transactions, while preventing up to seven billion security incidents and policy violations. We are operating at a massive scale and doing so with environmental sustainability in mind. Our platform uses over 75% renewable energy today with a goal to use over 90%. I would like to thank our engineering teams for an exceptional job in expanding our platform and keeping Zscaler at the forefront of innovation. Now, on to the customer wins. There is an accelerated market shift towards work from anywhere, which is the world Zscaler was built for. In an upsell win, a Fortune 500 chemical company that was using ZIA for a subset of its workforce, accelerated their zero-trust initiative by purchasing ZIA transformation, ZPA and ZDX for all 45,000 employees. In addition, they bought two of our recently announced ZCP solutions. They purchased Workload Communications to secure server traffic out to the Internet from 200 plants, and Workload Segmentation for 7,000 servers to secure east/west traffic in the public cloud and data center. I am excited to see wins like this where the customer is buying all four pillars of the Zscaler platform. In a new logo win, a new Global 2000 customer in the high tech-industry purchased all three pillars of our user protection service. They purchased ZIA Transformation, ZPA and ZDX for all 10,000 employees to move away from network security to a zero-trust architecture. This customer had standardized on next-gen firewalls and VPNs, which left gaps in security leading to a ransomware attack. In spite of an ELA license from their firewall vendor, they couldn't do SSL inspection at scale. Since Zscaler is a purpose-built proxy architecture, the customer can now inspect encrypted traffic without impacting user experience, leading to better security and reduced business risk. In another new logo win, a customer in the transportation services industry purchased three of our four pillars, ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for their 7,500 employees. With their cloud and mobile first strategy, they purchased our best-in-class DLP and CASB to protect sensitive information from leaking, no matter where the user is. ZDX was purchased to pinpoint and resolve performance issues in real-time by monitoring the digital experience score of every user and application regardless of their location. We are seeing a strong customer interest for our new pillars, ZDX and ZCP. Over 200 customers to-date have purchased ZDX. ZCP is also off to a great start, with a few dozen deals closed in Q2 and great excitement for our ZCP Workload Communication. Moving on to ZPA. Our customers view ZPA as the foundation for their architectural shift to zero-trust access for private applications. ZPA is the clear market leader, with proven maturity and scalability, supporting millions of daily active users and nearly 40% of our global 2000 customers. Today, ZPA is delivering over million unique application segments without operational overhead of traditional network segmentation. Let me highlight several ZPA deals in the quarter. A Global 500 consumer products company with headquarters in EMEA that has been a ZIA customer, purchased ZPA for all 100,000 employees and 10,000 third-party B2B partners. This customer wanted to eliminate the security risk of VPN, which provides unfettered access to network resources. ZPA represents the next step in zero trust adoption for their IT transformation journey. In an upsell deal, a Global 2000 bank with headquarters in EMEA started with ZIA and ZPA for 10,000 employees in July to expand their work-from-home capacity as a result of the pandemic. Within six months of the initial purchase, the customer bought ZIA and ZPA for the remaining 30,000 employees and CASB for all 40,000 employees. In addition, they purchased ZPA to enable 3,000 third-party B2B partners. Let me highlight a ZIA and ZPA new logo win in the federal space. A research organization mandated with advising federal agencies on cybersecurity, purchased our ZIA Transformation bundle and ZPA for all 10,000 employees after evaluating various zero-trust architectures. This customer concluded that if a user connects to the network with a VPN, that is not zero trust. Based on this criteria, the legacy firewall and VPN providers were disqualified. An important consideration for our selection was ZPA's position as the first and only cloud security service with FedRAMP certification for Zero Trust Remote Access. With the highest levels of FedRAMP certifications for both ZIA and ZPA, we are very well positioned to serve the Federal government. Lastly, I would like to share another new customer win that highlights our continued ZIA success with large enterprises that are embracing direct to cloud architecture and migrating away from their complex, legacy onpremise appliances. A Fortune 100 professional services customer purchased our ZIA Transformation bundle plus CASB, advanced DLP and CSPM for Office 365 to protect 125,000 employees across 150 countries as they embraced work from anywhere. Zscaler eliminated the need for 30 different gateways and consolidated six different legacy point products, while meeting the customer's environmental goals for their ESG program. With sensitive customer data at risk, security was a major requirement and the customer only considered solutions with a proxy architecture. Let me conclude with some thoughts on our vision and strategy. At our Analyst Day in January, we laid out our audacious goal of serving 200 million users and 100 million workloads on our Zero Trust Exchange. To achieve that: Our entire organization is focused on attracting and developing talent and creating a culture of excellence. Our commitment to culture starts at the top with our executive team and creates an environment where a global and diverse workforce can deliver excellence to help our customers succeed. We are scaling our world-class engineering organization, which continues to rapidly deliver new products and features to our customers. On the go-to-market front, as we have demonstrated over the last 12 months, we have built a sophisticated sales machine to sell value and deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level. We will continue to scale our sales organization, as we are a destination for top talent. Our Marketing organization is augmenting talent in all critical areas while specializing campaigns by persona and segment to better address our significant opportunity. We are focused on driving broader adoption of our four pillars. We will continue to expand our ecosystem of technology partners and value-based channel partners, who are contributing to sales velocity and expanding our reach. I believe we are on the right track to capture a material share of the $72 billion serviceable market that we outlined on our Analyst Day. We are also seeing opportunities in bringing zero trust to IoT and OT systems, and are excited about 5G, which pushes computing further to the edge and opens up additional opportunities for Zscaler. We are excited about our future. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you, Brad. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, we are having increased conversations with our customers as well as prospects. We had Sunburst related webinar recently and had over 800 customers attended. This week, I was asked to talk to Board of Directors of a pharma company, and the primary topic was protecting against sophisticated threats like Sunburst. So all this is making cyber a bigger priority than it has been. It's a bigger priority for CIOs as well as the Board. So what is that causing? It is increasing engagements. I'm not sure I can quantify the impact on the pipeline, but we're seeing that the customers who are already educated on Zero Trust quite a bit are making implementation of Zero Trust a bigger priority. The number one question ends up being if people get compromised, how do make sure that the lateral movement doesn't happen? The answer is simple. Don't connect people to your network. Don't build a moat with firewalls and VPNs, do Zero Trust implementation where you connect users to applications not to the network. Thank you. I will start and Remo going to add on. Yes, we talked about our expansion towards the enterprise segment that we defined as between 2,000 and 6,000 employees in a company. As you know, we have done extremely well in the higher end in large enterprises for the last several years. So in this segment, the progress we've made is ahead of our expectations. Our growth was faster in this segment. Well, it did come from a smaller base. Having said that, our large enterprise segment is driving the overall strength of our business. We are doing three specific things to grow our business in this enterprise segment, one, adding more sales reps, more sales teams. And we had done a lot of good progress in the past two quarters and we'll do more in the coming quarters. Secondly, adding and expanding channel partners who covered the segment. And third, we are directing our marketing programs to support the segment as well. So in summary, it's a good opportunity to expand the segment and we are doing well. We're pleased with the performance. Yes. The fundamental difference is being a pass through on network security architecture when traffic is flowing over the network and a traditional device, like a firewall is trying to scan what kind of application is, guess it and trying to stop it or not. With our proxy architecture, where we terminate every connection, inspect and decide to connect to a particular user. So we have policies that are per user by design. There's no \u2013 in fact, a user coming from company A or company B or company C each looks like an untrusted user. While in the traditional way, they are kind of batch based policies. The end result is \u2013 our architecture gives us two big benefits. One with proxy we can do far better inspection at a high scale high performance, including SSL. Two, it allows us to do Zero Trust where you don't connect people to a network. You connect to a specific application. Zero Trust is probably the biggest thing to help you minimize the damage of lateral movement if something gets infected. Thank you. Generally, in all these sessions, analysts like to pinpoint to particular event that may cause something, so COVID was viewed as maybe the catalyst. This is being viewed as a catalyst. As we have said before, the overall catalyst is that everyone is driving towards digital transformation, COVID maybe helping it SolarWinds maybe helping it. But customers are realizing that they believe that they need to accelerate their transformation. And we are the one who enabled the transformation. If you do your transformation without something like Zscaler, your risk goes up significantly. So where is our growth coming from? ZIA, which has been our work course. Yes. Now we've got over 25% of global 2000 companies, but we have 75% more to go. It is generating pretty good sales, ZPA, which was relatively young product two or three years ago now is actually contributing significantly about 40% of our global 2000 customers already have our ZPA. So these two are the biggest contributors of our billings growth. And then the new pillars ZDX is picking up quite well. And also is that the new pillar off cloud protection? I think I'm very pleased that our customers are buying more and more bigger bundles together. I talked about ZIA, ZPA and ZDX being bought together by our customers during our in my prepared remarks. So across the board, we're seeing strength from product side of it, across [indiscernible] Remo, you want to add to my comments? Well, what should I say? Imitation is the best form of flattery. Having said that, I would say that there's something called native architecture, or purpose-built architecture. There's something called bolt-on. Building proxy is hard, because you terminate, you inspect and you reconnect, compare that to a pass through firewall, you don't stop anything. You let it to go. If you catch something, it's great. If you don't, you don't. Many vendors have tried and failed to build a high-performance proxy because it's hard. The only two vendors in the past 20 years have successfully penetrated enterprises for user security, blue code for on-prem and they've done it for the cloud. So I think am I surprised that people try to get by without a proxy? And finally the customer said, no, no, no. So they change it. I think delivering this thing will be tricky. I've seen many companies do it. There have been vendors, who have been saying that they had a proxy for six, seven years. I would rather not name them, but I still haven't seen them in the market. So we keep on, we are not sitting still. We keep on advancing. The most functionality you add browser isolation, to CASB, to content inspection, or DLP and all, your proxy has to do more and more work and still deliver throughput and still do threat inspections. So we welcome the competition, but we are very pleased with our performance, that kind of lead we have over traditional legacy vendors. New firewall vendors started making noise a couple of years ago, a lot of noise, then it died down about six months after that. In the field, we haven't really changed, seen a whole lot of change to it. When it comes to large enterprises where we dominate, we haven't seen any change in competitive landscape. And I can understand why. Large enterprises are security savvy. They understand the difference between proxy and non proxy. They understand Zero Trust and VPN. And that's why we don't expect to see firewall-based architecture in those enterprises. And all of you guys are so close to banks. Find a large bank who believes in not having proxy, but using firewall architecture for security. I have not found one. I think when it comes to lower end of the spectrum, probably in the 5,000 users or below, we do see firewall vendors from time to time. And from time to time, these guys on that sophisticated, they can be probably tricked into find something that may not be that sophisticated. So I think you'll see less sophisticated solutions being bought on the lower end. But on the higher end, we haven't seen any change in competition. Yes, if I may add, over the past four quarters we have pretty openly shared with you a game plan, of scaling our sales organization, building our sales engine from enablement to training and all of those things. And I think you're seen the results being delivered quarter-after-quarter. So, we are bullish about it and we'll keep on increasing our head count, and sales, and engineering, and customer support and all other related areas. Yes. A good question. So large deal activity was strong in the quarter, it was comparable to Q1. It was significantly higher than last year. From a geographic perspective, all regions did well. I mean, we are investing in all regions, pretty much the same, same level. APJ, probably a little bit faster than the other regions, but all regions have done well and we continue to invest. Related to the comment I made before, when companies see \u2013 with the breadth of the platform that we have and companies see the value of Zscaler. And the ease of implementation, the increased security and also the ROI. The value proposition is resonating with our customers. And so, we're seeing that. And so, by adding ZDX and ZCP and broadening the platform, it actually increases the value of what we're \u2013 of Zscaler. If I may add a couple of points to it, we have truly expanded the platform. We haven't gone on a buying spree and throw them in there and call it a platform because those \u2013 these unintegrated products don't add a lot of value, our customers see the value. For example, to turn on ZDX, it's literally a few minutes. It hardly takes anything because the traffic is already flowing through everything is happening. The second one, I like to make is, yes, we did have what you call wall-to-wall deals. I guess that meant all teller deals. But there are no mega deals in the quarter. Okay. And there's no one time kind of special deal that artificially increased our billings numbers. It was properly distributed various pillars, and across all geos. Thank you. So, I think our customers are happy and trusting us. So that's a starting point. If that's not the case, you want to sell; two, you need proper sales, execution, engagement, our engagement, staffs in C-level, the sales machine that built is helping us. So, we are getting pretty good share of upsell deals. In fact, we don't have differentiation between incentive, sales incentive, or sales that we upsell. So, we aren't pleased with the upsell performance and new performance. We have internal debate between how much do we need new versus upsell, Remo and I decide, let the total ACV rule, we have both opportunities. But we have seen good growth, good upsell numbers every quarter. Sorry new was 50%. Yes. I will start, then you can add on. So, first of all, we have become the top destination for the top talent. While on the market is competitive, we actually don't have problem in attracting good talent, whether that's in sales organization or engineering. So please obviously with that, you need to make sure you have things in place, a proper team for hiring, but that's happening. Related to Joe's or where the concentration is from sales point of view, we are where the customer is. We are a very global organization with big presence all over U.S., all over Europe, APJ, Japan, India, Singapore, all of these places. So, we are attracting talent from everywhere. And generally, on the sales side, we are looking for talent coming from companies who know how to sell solutions, who need to solve software, who know how to sell transformation sales. That's the first part. The second part was at ability to train. Over the past four quarters we shared with you how we build the sales enablement team, how we built the team with sales leaders that proper \u2013 even proper process for interview for these people, with the whole documented process. I think we are very optimized. I would say it's as optimized as I ever seen out there. So that's why you are able to add significantly large number and make them pretty productive in a shorter amount of time that we would do otherwise. We shared a little bit off that during our Analyst Day, the kind of impact that's being made with better training and better enablement. Yes, let me start with the general comments Remo, you can be more specific. I give you the hard part. Look we do believe that work [indiscernible] has had to stay, I guess, COVID became a catalyst to shake off inertia. It actually changed the mindset and it really not just gave momentum, but also brought to light the limitations of legacy network and security. So, we are seeing our customers saying we are implementing zero trust, which means any ZIA ZPA top on deployments even after everything gets back to normal. If that was not the case, they would be doing short term ZPA deal and saying, I'm going back to the office, I no longer need to renewal of ZPA, beyond seeing that. So, we think the world is changing. So, going back to the office should not be impacting our momentum of the business. That's how I look at it overall. Remo? Yes, I would say as I have discussion with our large enterprises and I personally do quite a few. We are yet to find a customer who has I talked to who said, I want to keep VPN for the long run. They're all, in various stages of the journey, the growth you see often ZPA, a former customer base is a result of more and more Zscaler customers embracing Zero Trust and ZPA. I do believe that all there would be some exception, but most of Zscaler ZIA customers will embrace ZPA. And I see them more and more embracing ZDX as well. Our strategy of all prime, up well [ph], design, integrated platform with four pillars is working well. Two years ago, the question used to be, can ZPA take off? Right? That question has been answered over and over. Now, the question is can ZDX and ZCP take off? Early indications are very good. But back to your question s VPN replacement vendors an opportunity for us? Absolutely, yes. Our starting point of ZIA is replacing the user protection, which typically is a proxy. And then we start expanding it to the full bundle. Our ZPA entry point is generally a VPN vendor. And then you expand to, Zero Trust with app segmentation. Yes, it's a good question. So, as you said, we have already engaged with leading cloud providers with ZIA and ZPA. On the cloud protection area, we got some early initiative going, there's a good complimentary fit-PC with them. And I think it's a little bit early. I mean, it's only a quarter or so, but the momentum is strong, the pipeline, we're building is strong. The way you should look at Zscaler Cloud Protection is not the way you look at traditional vendors who say, I'm going to take my firewall and put the virtual firewall in the cloud. We think that trying to replicate your data center in the cloud never worked for even moving apps. How is it going to work for security? We look at workloads like mirror image of users and should be protected like users. So that Zero Trust Exchange, we are able to connect a workload in Region A to workload Region B over the Internet, coming through our Zero Trust Exchange. That's truly what makes us very different architecturally. Now, the next part of your question was left-shift stuff. As we are engaging with our customers, they are having dialogue with us as they are figuring out their left-shift strategy. It's a new area and we are closely monitoring it. As the market evolves, you can rest assured we will be there to serve our customers. Great. Thank you for joining us. I hope the session was worthwhile. We hope to see you as our next earnings call or before that in one of the investor events we'll be joining. Thank you."

First of all, I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. I am proud of our strong results and an exceptionally strong start to fiscal 2021 in our first quarter. We delivered 52% growth in revenue and 64% growth in billings, while also generating record operating profits and free cash flow. I believe our financial results demonstrate Zscaler's pivotal role in enabling our customers' digital transformation journeys, which are accelerating at a pace never seen before. Our visibility and business momentum remains strong and we are pleased to increase our fiscal year guidance. I believe the market is coming to us and we are investing across our organization to capture a significant share of our large and growing opportunity. I would like to thank the Zscaler team and our partners for their tireless efforts and commitment to our customer success. I am also pleased and excited to welcome, Chris Kozup to the Zscaler team as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Let me highlight three factors that drove our strong performance in the quarter. One, building on our growing traction with large enterprises. We closed a record number of seven-figure ACV deals. The majority of these wins are three-year commitments to provide the foundation for application, network, and security transformation. In particular, I am pleased with our increasing wins in the financial services vertical, which is now embracing the cloud and the Office 365 deployments have become an important catalyst for us. Two, our optimized go-to-market engine is driving significant velocity, including a strong pace of new logo acquisitions. I am very pleased with our performance across all geos. Last year, we doubled down on our investment in our sales organization. We scaled our sales enablement team and built a repeatable and metrics-driven process, which is giving us better visibility into our business and ultimately resulting in a strong and growing pipeline. These efforts are also bearing fruit in two big ways. One, our newly hired sales reps are contributing at a faster pace. And two, our sales productivity is higher than a year ago, despite a high percentage of ramping sales reps. Three, the power of our Zero Trust Exchange platform is resonating with CxOs. Our platform is comprised of four key pillars with each enabling a critical element of the transformation. ZIA to secure direct access to Internet and SaaS, ZPA for zero trust access to private applications, Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX to deliver user experience for work from anywhere, cloud workload segmentation to protect applications. An increasing share of our sales is coming from initial platform purchases by new customers and also growing upsell to existing customers, which is driving a record 122% net retention rate. I believe in the current challenging environment and in the post-COVID economy, Zscaler will be the go-to-platform for vendor consolidation, cost saving, increased user productivity, and better cyber protection. We are excited about our mission to make the cloud safe for business and enjoyable for users. We enable our customers to increasingly use the Internet as their corporate network, any place legacy perimeter-based security with zero trust security. As the CIO of a Zscaler customer told us, we ended up with the security posture that's better than when we had a complex network and network security and have a user experience that's materially better. As we look forward to the next few years, we are focused on driving broader adoption of our four major cloud solutions, which together maximize the value for our customers' digital transformation. From pre-sales to deployment and customer success, we have built a sophisticated sales machine to sell value and deliver measurable outcome at the CxO level. We continue to scale our organization as the market increasingly moves our way. We will continue to build our ecosystem of technology and channel partners, which are contributing to overall sales velocity and expanding our reach across our total addressable market. Additionally, we are demonstrating our value to customers through an increased focus on thought leadership and demand generation programs. At our recent Virtual CXO Summit Series, we hosted six events that drew over 400 CxOs and IT leaders to discuss secured digital transformation. Many CxOs shared with me that their current work from home environment, while temporary, has helped them realize that zero trust architecture is the future, and it can be implemented easily and rapidly. COVID was a catalyst in changing the mindset and shaking off inertia, resulting in a reduced need for educating customers about the value of the Zscaler architecture over legacy approaches. Inbound customer requests have greatly increased, and we are becoming an integral part of a growing number of larger transformation projects. We continue to see more customers buying ZIA and ZPA together, which enables a true transformation with direct and seamless access to SaaS applications or applications in your datacenter or the public cloud. For example, a global manufacturing company purchased our Transformation Bundle plus DLP and CASB for 45,000 users and ZPA for 25,000 users. Drivers for this deal were network and security transformation. They had a traditional hub and spoke network for 300 manufacturing facilities, which were slowing their adoption of cloud applications such as WebEx, Office 365 and Workday. A next-gen firewall vendor tried to sell its hybrid offering but failed to meet their security and performance requirements, including SSL inspection. Interestingly, this initiative was part of a five-year managed services RFP where all six system integrators and service providers bid Zscaler. We are seeing customers increasingly migrate away from their large installed base of legacy on-prem gateway and security appliances to pursue direct to cloud architecture. In one new customer win, a Fortune 50 retail customer replaced a legacy web gateway with ZIA for cybersecurity and data protection. This customer purchased ZIA Professional Bundle plus CASB, Sandbox, and DLP for 45,000 users. Security was a major requirement and only a proxy architecture with SSL inspection was considered. This deal was a good example of Zscaler leveraging our tech partners, where CrowdStrike became the endpoint security provider and Microsoft, the identity provider. I am very pleased with our growing success with the financial industry where adoption of cloud is accelerating. A Fortune 100 financial services company purchased our Transformation Bundle with advanced DLP and CASB for 18,000 employees to overcome capacity issues with their security appliances when they deployed Office 365. Firewall-based technologies were ruled out due to strict security requirements or SSL inspection and DLP with exact data match. As these three deals show, our comprehensive data protection offering within ZIA has been gaining traction as customers are concerned about data leakage with employees working from anywhere. Our new out-of-band CASB is helping us displace CASB point products and increase our deal size. The most common themes in our customer wins are to increase user productivity, reduce business risk, simplify IT and reduce cost. The Zscaler platform enables this by consolidating and eliminating point products. Moving on to ZPA. Our customers view ZPA as the foundation for their architectural shift to zero trust access for private applications. Our platform eliminates the Internet attack surface of customers' applications, resulting in reduced business risk. ZPA is the clear market leader with proven maturity and scalability. We are supporting hundreds of large enterprises in the complex multi-cloud environment. Let me highlight two ZPA deals in the quarter. First, a global bank with headquarters in Europe needed to scale its remote access after the legacy VPN and VDI became a performance bottleneck and a security concern. Their IT team had to cope with over 4,000 trouble tickets per month from users having issues with their connectivity. This customer purchased ZPA for over 100,000 employees to deliver a seamless always-on experience. While the immediate objective for this deal was to replace legacy VPN, ZPA was selected to implement zero trust architecture by establishing an application level policy, where users connect to specific applications, not to a network. In another deal, a Fortune 500 tech company purchased ZPA to accelerate M&A integration. After one year, 6,000 employees at the acquired division were still using two laptops with separate VPNs to two separate networks. Integrating two complex corporate networks can take 12 months or more. ZPA is the elegant solution to this problem. Without having to connect to corporate networks, ZPA provides secure application access across both companies in weeks. Purchasing our high-end ZPA offering, the customer is leveraging ZPA's multiple identity support to accelerate deployment. The customer plans to use ZPA as a standard solution for future M&A, a core strategy for growth at this customer. In addition to ZPA, that customer purchased ZDX for 6,000 users to quickly troubleshoot issues and increase employee productivity. To close my business review, I will touch on some early success with our new emerging products. There is an accelerated market shift towards work from anywhere, which aligns with our platform and emerging products like ZDX. We had a number of ZDX wins in the quarter, including an upsell with a European Bank for 40,000 employees. This customer had ZIA for all employees. And it was frictionless to turn on ZDX to get end-to-end visibility and resolve performance issues. We also had wins for our CSPM offering, giving us additional opportunities for growth. Our emerging products are increasing our overall competitive differentiation. For large enterprises who want network and security modernization, we believe we are the only cloud native multi-tenant platform that meets their needs. Zscaler is the largest in-line cloud security platform in the world. We are processing more than 140 billion transactions daily, while preventing seven billion security incidents and policy violations. Deployed across more than 150 data centers, our Zero Trust Exchange platform was built from the ground up for the Secure Access Service Edge or SASE framework. Building a cloud native architecture with full security and minimal latency is very hard and running a massive in-line global cloud with five 9s of availability is an order of magnitude harder. As the world moves to SASE framework and zero trust architecture, some of you have asked about competition and why others can't build a cloud native platform like Zscaler. Well, the answer lies in the architecture, which is like the foundation of a building that supports everything. Our foundation is a multi-tenant architecture built from the ground up for in-line traffic inspection. It delivers over 20 key security solutions including antivirus, cloud sandbox, cloud firewall, DLP, advanced threat prevention and SSL inspection at scale. That's extremely hard to build and complex to operate as a cloud service without compromising user experience. It is like the difference between building a simple SaaS application versus a highly complex SaaS platform like an ERP. How many cloud native ERP systems are you aware of since NetSuite started two decades ago? While single dimensional SaaS applications are easy to develop, multi-dimensional platforms like an ERP and Zscaler are much harder to design, build and operate. With our business momentum, we are also demonstrating that our strategic sales process and world-class execution are important competitive advantages. First, our consultative sales model identifies the value we can drive for the customers and enables them to fully realize the benefits of digital transformation. This strategic sales process requires top sales talent. I believe we are the best sales team top to bottom and we are hiring at a rapid pace. We are now a destination for top talent around the globe. Second, we are deepening our ecosystem of technology partners, which are contributing to deal wins and adding leverage to our sales model. In addition to our ongoing partnership with Microsoft and CrowdStrike, we have now extended our strategic partnership with VMware to integrate with their SD-WAN solution and to partner for joint go-to-market engagements. I believe we have built a go-to-market engine that will generate long term sustainable growth. Now, I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter was $142.6 million, up 13% sequentially and 52% year-over-year. ZPA revenue was 13% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we have broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 39% and APJ was 10%. Revenue exceeded our guidance due to stronger than expected deal activity as the value proposition of ZIA and ZPA is increasingly becoming clear to customers. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter, billings grew 64% year-over-year to $144.7 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years. We primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, was $864 million on October 31, up 56% from a year ago. The current RPO is 54% of the total RPO. We had a healthy mix between new and existing customers with new customers contributing over 50% of new and upsell ACV. Our strong customer retention ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which is 122% compared to 120% last quarter a year ago. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger transformation bundles, selling both ZIA and ZPA from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 122% is outstanding. Total gross margin of 81% increased two percentage points sequentially and was comparable on a year-over-year basis. Sequential improvement was driven by migrating most of the ZPA infrastructure to our data centers during the quarter, as well as timing of expenses. While we are pleased with the gross margin performance, I would like to remind investors that a number of our new emerging products, which include ZDX, workload segmentation and CSPM will be running in the public cloud until we scale them into our own data centers in the future. While in the public cloud, these products will have lower gross margins than our core products. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 79% for the full year in fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $96 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 10 percentage points from 77% a year ago to 67% in the quarter. Sales and marketing increased 12% sequentially and 31% year-over-year to $64.2 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives offset by lower T&E with our employees working from home. We have been very successful in hiring and onboarding remotely and we are accelerating our sales and marketing hiring throughout this fiscal year. R&D increased 8% sequentially and 42% year-over-year to $20.9 million. The increase was primarily due to continued investments in our team. G&A increased 9% sequentially and 29% year-over-year to $10.9 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation-related expenses and professional fees. Our first quarter operating margin was 14%, which compares to 4% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $20 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.14. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $42 million in the quarter, which is a meaningful improvement from $11 million in the prior quarter and $9 million in the year ago quarter. The strength of free cash flow was driven by strong receivable collections and better underlying profitability in the quarter. Now moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $146 million to $148 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 44% to 46%. Operating profit of $11 million to $12 million, other income of $800,000, net of interest payments on the senior convertible notes, income taxes of $1,250,000 and earnings per share of approximately $0.07 to $0.08, assuming $144 million common shares outstanding. Due to better than expected first quarter performance and our strong pipeline, we are increasing our full-year fiscal 2021 guidance for revenue, billings and profit. For fiscal 2021, we now expect revenue in the range of $608 million to $612 million or year-over-year growth of 41% to 42%. Calculated billings in the range of $755 million to $765 million or year-over-year growth of 37% to 39%. Operating profit in the range of $55 million to $57 million. Other income of $2.7 million, income taxes of $4.5 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.37 to $0.38, assuming approximately $145 million common shares outstanding. We continue to see the market coming to us and remain committed to investing aggressively in our company behind the growth in our business. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will continue to take priority considering our significant market momentum. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Remo. Coming off a record Q1, we are seeing the market coming to us and validating our vision for zero trust cloud native platform. We believe we are in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to enable secure digital transformation. The value proposition of our zero trust platform is resonating with customers and we are seeing this reflected in our business momentum over the last three quarters. We have scaled our go-to-market engine and are delivering world-class sales execution, which we believe will drive sustainable long term growth. Thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We hope to see you at Zenith Live next week. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. I show our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks guys. So Jay, you mentioned financial services a number of times in terms of the traction that you are seeing. Where would you say or where would you characterize the penetration in that industry? How big is it as a percentage of revenue? And perhaps, are we seeing some continued momentum as maybe it catches up to other industries?\nJay Chaudhry: Sterling, thank you. Financial services have been slow in embracing the cloud, but now they are all opening up. They are embracing cloud and Office 365 is becoming the catalyst. To make Office 365 work, there had to be some transformation in the network and security, and we have done so much work with Microsoft to make sure Office 365 can be enabled securely delivering a fast user experience. So that's becoming our number one application to get into that space, and then it\u2019s expanding from there. Remo, you want to add anything to it?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So I mean the three top verticals that we have are financial, manufacturing, and health. But we are broad across all verticals. So there's really no vertical that's dominant. So we haven't given out the percentages of each of those verticals, but we are very broad.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Hedberg: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on really strong results here. Jay, I am curious, the conversations with CIOs obviously is showing up in numbers, really the importance of Zscaler. I am curious, though, how are those conversations in the tone of a vaccine? I mean, to me it would feel like a lot of the momentum has sort of cemented the change, but I am sort of curious on sort of post-vaccine, would you think the tone of buying behavior is in your target customer?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Lots of questions are being asked pre-COVID, post-COVID, and whatnot. If you look at our record pre-COVID, we had very good growth, our business is accelerating. It's driven by acceleration in digital transformation. Now, COVID was a catalyst in shaking off inertia. The change in mindset has accelerated demand for zero trust. When I talk to CIOs, they tell me, we did not realize how important it was to do transformation being able to embrace cloud for collaboration, for security, and the like. So, they are really moving faster than they did before. And so, momentum to our business clearly has picked up because it has highlighted the limitation of the old legacy and old network, and need to transform and this transformation works. So, we are pretty bullish. We think even after a vaccine, our business will keep on accelerating.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks a lot. Well done, guys.\nRemo Canessa: One follow-on with Jay is that, if we take a look at our pipeline, our pipeline is accelerating. So, we are seeing an acceleration in our pipeline and that's across the board, both in ZIA and ZPA.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Jay, maybe for you, the question is do you have any statistics or just general thoughts on how many of your engagements are competitive? Meaning, a competitive breakup process versus perhaps being brought in by a service provider where there really isn't a competitive process. Does that makes sense?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Saket, thank you. Your question reminds me of my days at AirDefense and CipherTrust when I used to sell security appliances and we used to have lots of bake-offs, which box is faster, which big box is cheaper. At Zscaler, we are all driven by transformation. Transformation is not a box you sell. It actually starts with CIO level discussion to help them enable their applications to network, to security, all of them together. So, most of our deals at the higher end, at the large enterprise level aren't really competitive much at all. When you come to lower end, we do see some of the competition, but bake-offs are rare. In fact, I highlighted a win in my prepared remarks where even though there was an RFP that we won with a managed services partners, all six SI and SPs bid Zscaler, okay. I am very proud of it. That's because the customers and the SI/SP channel understands that you can take typical legacy boxes and try to make them do cloud transformation. So when it comes to competition, I think we got some big, big lead. Unless someone tries really purpose-build something, have a good architecture, we will maintain this lead.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Please go ahead.\nAlex Henderson: Thank you very much. Kind of hard to decide what's more to like in your numbers, the margin expansion or the accelerated topline. Good job. I wanted to look forward a little bit, if I could with you, when you talk about machine-to-machine environments, domain-to-domain and what you are doing on that front, it seems pretty clear to me that as we see more and more modern applications coming out that it's not just the cloud direct architecture that's important, but actually the cross-domain traffic. Can you talk a little bit about how you participate in that and what you are doing to secure it?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. There are two aspects to your question. One is machine-to-machine or app-to-app communication within a public cloud. And the second part is, across clouds, maybe Azure East and Azure West type of stuff. While companies are trying to do this, doing traditional network security way, doing virtual firewalls and whatnot, we have taken zero trust approach to the public cloud where we can have app-to-app communication, and where we have the zero trust or switching technology, we needed identity technology. Identity for various apps would be built using the acquisition we did a few months ago through a company called, Edgewise Networks. So with that, we can do within the datacenter machine-to-machine communication without doing network segmentation and achieve app segmentation. And we can also go across clouds. But having said that, that's a young market. That's a nascent market. It needs some education. So, it will take some time for the market to grow. But if we are well-positioned to go in early and get a position there, that's a big area of investment for us.\nAlex Henderson: Super. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please go ahead.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi. I am wondering, Jay, on the cloud workload protection market, you are in that market, fairly new product for you, a number of players are in that market. Could you help us understand what you are seeing in the early deals and sales cycles there? Who is the competition? Is the buyer the same as the buyer that you have generally been selling to? And the differentiation you have there when you are competing in that market kind of as maybe a starting point or when it's a pretty competitive situation? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Thank you. Good question, Walter. Cloud protection is not one piece, it's multiple pieces and they are in different stages of the market. CSPM is one area where we are actually competing well. That's a fairly well understood and fairly simple market. Your cloud traffic from Azure AWS workload going to Internet, which most of these workloads do, you can try to do some virtual firewall and whatnot, which doesn't work or you can simply send it through Zscaler Internet Access by simply pointing traffic. We are very well positioned in that part of the segment. Then the third segment is what Alex asked about, machine-to-machine communication and whatnot, app-to-app. That's a younger area and that's where we see some young players, some start-ups in the game. But generally, the market being so young, there's not a whole lot of competition in that space. And only selected customers are kind of trying to pursue that. I see many customers who said, I tried to do network segmentation doing this and this. It hasn't worked. I had tried this. And the buyer is somewhat different, as you said. There are two types of buyer for cloud protection. One is actually the IT organization that's actually building application, the DevOps team. Because they are actually driven by application and they often ignore security. Then CSO comes and says, wait a second, you can do things fast, but you must put security in place. So we end up dealing with two parties, CSOs that we already deal with and DevOps party, that's a little bit new for us to get to know and learn.\nWalter Pritchard: Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTal Liani: Hi guys. Great quarter. My question is more higher level. I am trying to understand the expectations for next year. So if I look at your guidance and I add a little bit more for beaten raise which you have done in the last few years, you are going to be staying in the same growth rate we have seen this year. And I am trying to get the qualitative part of, you have older solutions and you have newer markets. How do you view the growth rate in older solutions like ZPA? How do you view your level of competition there? The ability to gain new customers versus grow with existing customers? And then, same question about your newer areas. What are the driving factors? I am trying to understand how to build a spreadsheet for next year when it comes to the various solutions that you are offering.\nJay Chaudhry: I mean it's a very good question, Tal. Think about the four key solutions I talked about. ZIA has been a workhorse. It has been growing rapidly. But in spite of that, if you look at our penetration, in Global 2000 we are just under 25%. And there's a big market, majority of the market sitting open out there. In fact, there is still a sizable market of legacy where proxies like Blue Coat and that's to be removed and we are taking more and more part of that. So that's kind of one-piece. And ZIA is not one product. As you know, ZIA is a portfolio of several offerings and more and more customers are buying either bigger bundles like Transformation to start with or they are moving up from business bundles or professional bundles. So that's a pretty sizable thing on ZIA. We know nowhere close to leveling off at all. ZPA, relatively younger, only about four years old, have gone from zero to about 30% and offer new business in that range. And if you look at our customer base, just about in the mid-30%, somewhere 30% or so of the Global 2000 ZIA customer have ZPA. So even in our installed base of ZIA, there's a big market out there. So we think these two big proven product portfolios or call them, too big pillars, they have plenty of room for opportunity. And then ZDX, digital experience, is becoming an interesting product. It's a new product in a new area. Because as you go over the Internet, no one has any meaningful offering to let someone know end-to-end response time. We expect pretty good growth from it. One day we expect almost every user will have ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. And that's the way we are driving towards. The fourth area is new area, the cloud workload, the data center. I think that market will take some time to mature. As Remo has said, we are now really pulling tons of revenue in some of the new areas. But you shouldn't think about CASB type of things as new products. I mean, they are new, but they are part of ZIA portfolio. They automatically attach to our ZIA bundle. In the same way, we are seeing browser isolation picking up, which either goes with ZIA or goes with ZPA. But plenty of room in all areas. And I always said to my sales leaders, we have lots of product to sell. Let's scale our sales organization and that's what we are focused on. We are focused on growing go-to-market, which is doing very well. So excited for next year. Remo, did I cover?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, it's a great question. I mean you take a look at the percentage of customers that have transformation, we have indicated it was 49%, over the last call in July. And it has gone up this quarter and it has continually gone up. ZPA is 13% of revenue, so big opportunity with their installed base for that in our emerging products. We had an acceleration in growth of new customers in Q1 versus the growth in Q4. So we are seeing momentum. We are seeing deal sizes getting bigger. We are seeing the need for transformation on a broader scale, as Jay mentioned, driven by COVID. But COVID started the visibility. What we are seeing right now is the realization on the part of CIOs and others and companies at high level who understand the legacy architectures they have got are really not the architectures. That's what's driving the business for us. It is that. In addition to that, proof points that we have pipeline, interest, productivity. Just you feel the momentum. You feel momentum that's coming our way. What it comes down to? At the end, it comes down to the people. It comes down to the execution. The market is there. The product is there. The vision is there. And I believe the people are there also. And I think in the past three quarters we had done an amazing job in scaling our go-to-market, which was the last piece we needed to scale and we are feeling very good about it.\nJay Chaudhry: Agreed.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Jay, a question for you. You mentioned earlier that COVID has been a catalyst for Zscaler more longer term in terms of the market coming to you, in terms of customers coming to you for cloud transformation deals as well as talent coming to you as well. And you mentioned a really strong hiring environment for you guys. I am wondering, where are these newer hires coming from? Are they coming from some of your competitors within the security space? Or they are coming from cyber security space? Can you give us any sort of color on that?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So first of all, I think our hiring is happening at a faster pace than we had even expected. So very good actually. Remember about a year or two years ago, we used to say we are behind in hiring sales reps. Remo, you recall that. All that is past. I think probably our brand is helping that well known out there. Also our sales leadership has put a deep and wide leadership in place. And then getting more specific to answer your question, if you look at two broad areas of sales hiring, even though there are multiple areas beyond that are RSMs. Typically sales reps are not coming from box-selling background. Majority of our sales rep come from solution selling, SaaS type of background, because our sales is very different from than a typical box security selling. So they come from generally software and SaaS type of companies, by and large. That's number one. On the technical side, the SC side, we generally hire from someone that comes with a little bit networking and security background because they need domain expertise, which takes a little longer. But we are getting tons and tons of interest and we are trying to stay selective when we hire. But we are pretty much tracking our progress on hiring very well. On a net hiring basis, one of the things that I would call out, we had a record quarter for net hires. In the quarter, we hired over 260 people. A quarter before, it was 200. A quarter before, it was 150. And the quarter before that, it was 100. Of that 260, about 60% were in the sales and marketing area. We had a record quarter for quota-carrying sales rep hires in Q4. We had a comparable number in Q1. We are accelerating the hiring even more than what we had anticipated on our last call, given what we are seeing.\nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDan Caiello: Hi guys. This is Dan Caiello, on for Patrick. Congratulations on a great quarter. I just wanted to ask on the pricing environment. Obviously, it seems really strong. But I am just curious if you guys could comment on how prices have trended? And then obviously really impressive retention rate. So I am curious how much of that is adding new product on versus expanding more into the organization, if that makes sense?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So it's a comparable pricing environment. Our price per user did go up quarter-over-quarter. Related to what drove the net retention rate, as Jay mentioned, the emerging products are not significant impact. So it's more of the existing products, the movement to transformation as well as ZPA, which is what drove the increase in net retention rate.\nDan Caiello: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question and congrats from me as well on a great result in the quarter. Jay, I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of color on the sales force and the maturity of deals that you are seeing. I think in your 10-K, it looks like customer growth was just over 15%. But it sounds like deals are getting larger, as you noted record number of seven-figure ACV deals. Can you maybe help me understand what factor is the maturity of the sales force playing into the type of deals that you are seeing? How much is new customer versus expansion into your installed base or better penetration into your installed base? And how do you see that maturing throughout the rest of the year? I know that you noted previously that the elevated hiring in last year should drive better growth in the back half of this year. Is that accelerating? Just to maybe get a little bit of color in terms of the level of confidence you have for growth through the back end of the year based on the deal activity and sales force maturity.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. That's quite a few questions. So let me give a piece at a time. Sales force maturity, right. Since Dali joined us, we spent about 3.5 to four quarters to make sure we bring in a systematic and disciplined sales process, sales enablement and sales metrics to understand the business leading indicators and all that stuff plus putting a number of leaders in place. So, you asked me what do I think about the maturity of the sales organization? I would say, extremely happy, very good about it. Because having that in place drives the rest of the stuff. So very comfortable and it's because of that comfort, we are accelerating hiring more and more salespeople in the field. Next question is related to deals, customers, new customers, customer growth. I think if you look at one number of holistically, that out of whatever 4,500 or 4,800 whatever those customers are, those percentages will be misleading. Because there is some small customers, some large customers. We need to get to a level where we start kind of looking at proper segmentation and growth within segmentations. Our big focus traditionally has been large enterprises and we have done extremely well among the penetration we are doing in those customers in terms of percentage and in terms of the deal, the ARR we are having in those customers is actually going up very well. We are very pleased with that. And as I finish, I will let Remo talk about some of those numbers. And then we also are expanding more into the lower enterprises, so to speak. I think over time, we will give you more color. So you can start computing the growth better. But if you look at the segment, we are now getting more focused on 2,000 user to 10,000 user segments, because we already got the largest segment over 10,000 and pretty well covered and we are getting great wins out there. So there is a big market for us to come downstream and expand as well. Remo, you want to add more.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, Jay is absolutely correct. The ARR per customer is definitely increasing. One of the ways we break it out is, customers with greater than 3,000 users were over $450,000 ARR per customer, which is up year-over-year, just keeps on going up. New customer growth, we have stated, it's within the range of our historical range of 50%, 60%. As I had mentioned before, we had an acceleration of new customer growth in Q1. Also, the comment about sales productivity, the thing to keep in mind, which is really encouraging is that, significant majority of the RSM headcount increase occurred in the second half of fiscal 2020. Also the comment that I made about Q1 that the hiring that we had for RSMs in Q1 was comparable to our record quarter in Q4 and our sales productivity on a year-over-year basis in Q1 was up. Those are all good indicators from my perspective and give me confidence. But things are looking strong for the company, as well as what we put in place the structure, the organization. I have been around for a long time and I have seen a lot. I have never seen anything like we have got here at Zscaler with our go-to-market, quite frankly.\nBrian Essex: Super helpful multi-part answer. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nowinski: Hi. Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to ask about the partnerships. So you announced a new partnership with VMware and you have always had a very strong partnership with Microsoft. So I am just wondering, if Microsoft contributed to the record number of seven-figure deals you had in the quarter? And how you are thinking about the new partnership with VMware?\nJay Chaudhry: So let me start with VMware. VMware has been a good partner for us. The portfolio of SD-WAN, if you look at SD-WANs, we have always said that SD-WAN is a good complementary area for us and we have been actually securing some very, very large SD-WAN deployments out there. And it was natural for us to team up with VMware. So what did we do? We had done integrations. So those SD-WANs can be deployed lot more easily with a single click. But more exciting than that, we are actually working with them on a number of joint go-to-market initiatives. Our sales people are kind of doing joint account planning and we have a number of market initiatives. So we think that would be a good partnership for incremental revenue for both the companies. That's on the VMware side of it. Microsoft, you know that partner goes for several years. It started with Office 365 deployments with great user experience, single configuration type of deployments. And then expanded beyond to Azure AD to Azure Access to Azure Sentinel and even to endpoint areas. Microsoft is pushing now Office 365 in financial services, because they have been the late adopter of Office 365. And that's particularly helping us because those large companies want to make sure this deployment goes well and Zscaler is their go-to partner in those deployments. So Microsoft is helping or we are helping Microsoft and they are helping us in these financial services customers. I am not sure if any of the specific deals this quarter was impacted by Microsoft. But in large companies, there will be large deals where we will be working together with Microsoft to close those deals. Remo, did I miss something?\nRemo Canessa: No. You got it.\nAndrew Nowinski: Yes. That's great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani from UBS. Please go ahead.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thank you for taking the questions. Jay or Remo, I wanted to hit back on some of the commentary in the prepared remarks around ZPA deployment. I mean, we have gone from zero to mid-teens percentage of your revenue now derived from ZPA. So I am wondering and appreciating some of the bigger picture factors that are driving the demand for ZPA. I am wondering if you can be more specific about where are some of the budget dollars are coming from that are getting reallocated in your favor for ZPA adoption? And to what extent is there a more expansion runway here that hasn't necessarily been pulled forward, because we have all started working from home overnight over the course of this year? So just getting some more specificity around where sort of the ZPA budgetary dollars are being earmarked away from in your favor?\nJay Chaudhry: So if you think about it, while a lot of stuff we do are transformation, generally there's an entry point for each area that's the easiest one from budget point of view. So VPN ends up being the entry point and the first point. But as we have said many times, ZPA is being bought for zero trust implementation. In the past one year, I have seen interest in zero trust gone big, big time. And it's a specific architecture, where you don't put connect users to the network. So any product that's a VPN related, whether it is an on-prem product or it's a cloud-based VPN, it's still VPN and doesn't really get counted as the zero trust offering. So it starts with taking out the VPN budget. But more importantly, all the wins we are having are being done to make sure they can also do zero trust access to not only your data center, but also to cloud application sitting in Azure AWS and more and more customers want to implement zero trust even when you are in the office. So we don't think that ZPA wins are coming because some of the deals are being pulled forward. We think COVID is actually accelerating and showing the need for zero trust being able to access anything from anywhere. And we see this acceleration continue. So very confident about the ZPA projection and that's reflected in the pipeline we are seeing for ZPA. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. For new customer business, you take a look at what percentage of our new customers are buying both ZIA and ZPA, right. It's in the high 30% range. That's up from Q4 and was low 30% range. That's what's resonating. That is the digital transformation occurring that we see. So that gets, again, the things that we are seeing internally related to what's occurring in the market indicates that digital transformation is top of mind for many IT professionals. And Zscaler has got a great solution or the best solution for them. And so that's giving us confidence.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. If I may say, the combination of ZIA and ZPA ensures that any user can work from anywhere, office, home, wherever. And that's where the zero trust comes in. It's a same user experience, same level of security, same level of policy and that's what CIOs are buying.\nFatima Boolani: That's super helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Colliers. Please go ahead.\nCatharine Trebnick: Congratulations on a phenomenal quarter. You have said in your prepared remarks that you had done well in the three verticals, finance, healthcare and manufacturing. But it seems like the federal government is a pretty big greenfield for you in 2021. And can you describe or give us some background on what you are doing to prepare to do well in that, because they are also moving to Office 365, similar to the financial folks? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Catharine, thank you. Federal is a big opportunity for us and our business is making good progress there. Our market, we have a sizable team in place now. We have some very good FedRAMP certifications and we have got a growing pipeline in 2021 and beyond. We expect federal to be a bigger part of our business. Remo, do you want to give a color of where it is now?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. Federal in Q1 was mid single digit of our new and upsell business. And as Jay mentioned, we are very pleased with the progress of our federal and see that as a substantial opportunity going forward.\nCatharine Trebnick: Okay. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: All right. So I think we are done with the questions. And I will like to say thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We hope to see you at Zenith Live and upcoming several investor conferences that we are participating in. Goodbye.\nRemo Canessa: Great. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter of 2021. Revenue for the quarter was $142.6 million, up 13% sequentially and 52% year-over-year. ZPA revenue was 13% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we have broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 39% and APJ was 10%. Revenue exceeded our guidance due to stronger than expected deal activity as the value proposition of ZIA and ZPA is increasingly becoming clear to customers. Turning to calculated billings, which we define as the change in deferred revenue for the quarter plus total revenue recognized in that quarter, billings grew 64% year-over-year to $144.7 million. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years. We primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which represents our total committed non-cancelable future revenue, was $864 million on October 31, up 56% from a year ago. The current RPO is 54% of the total RPO. We had a healthy mix between new and existing customers with new customers contributing over 50% of new and upsell ACV. Our strong customer retention ability to upsell have resulted in a consistently high dollar-based net retention rate, which is 122% compared to 120% last quarter a year ago. As we have highlighted, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter. While good for our business, our increased success selling bigger transformation bundles, selling both ZIA and ZPA from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. Considering these factors, we feel that 122% is outstanding. Total gross margin of 81% increased two percentage points sequentially and was comparable on a year-over-year basis. Sequential improvement was driven by migrating most of the ZPA infrastructure to our data centers during the quarter, as well as timing of expenses. While we are pleased with the gross margin performance, I would like to remind investors that a number of our new emerging products, which include ZDX, workload segmentation and CSPM will be running in the public cloud until we scale them into our own data centers in the future. While in the public cloud, these products will have lower gross margins than our core products. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 79% for the full year in fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. Our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $96 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 10 percentage points from 77% a year ago to 67% in the quarter. Sales and marketing increased 12% sequentially and 31% year-over-year to $64.2 million. The year-over-year increase was due to higher compensation expenses and investments in building our teams and go-to-market initiatives offset by lower T&E with our employees working from home. We have been very successful in hiring and onboarding remotely and we are accelerating our sales and marketing hiring throughout this fiscal year. R&D increased 8% sequentially and 42% year-over-year to $20.9 million. The increase was primarily due to continued investments in our team. G&A increased 9% sequentially and 29% year-over-year to $10.9 million. The growth in G&A includes investments in building our teams, compensation-related expenses and professional fees. Our first quarter operating margin was 14%, which compares to 4% in the same quarter last year. Net income in the quarter was $20 million or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.14. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Free cash flow was positive $42 million in the quarter, which is a meaningful improvement from $11 million in the prior quarter and $9 million in the year ago quarter. The strength of free cash flow was driven by strong receivable collections and better underlying profitability in the quarter. Now moving on to guidance. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount, amortization of intangible assets, facility exit costs and any associated tax effects. For the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $146 million to $148 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 44% to 46%. Operating profit of $11 million to $12 million, other income of $800,000, net of interest payments on the senior convertible notes, income taxes of $1,250,000 and earnings per share of approximately $0.07 to $0.08, assuming $144 million common shares outstanding. Due to better than expected first quarter performance and our strong pipeline, we are increasing our full-year fiscal 2021 guidance for revenue, billings and profit. For fiscal 2021, we now expect revenue in the range of $608 million to $612 million or year-over-year growth of 41% to 42%. Calculated billings in the range of $755 million to $765 million or year-over-year growth of 37% to 39%. Operating profit in the range of $55 million to $57 million. Other income of $2.7 million, income taxes of $4.5 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.37 to $0.38, assuming approximately $145 million common shares outstanding. We continue to see the market coming to us and remain committed to investing aggressively in our company behind the growth in our business. We have a highly efficient business model and are making investments across the organization today in order to capitalize on the large opportunity ahead of us. While we will balance growth and profitability, growth will continue to take priority considering our significant market momentum. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Jay. Yes. So I mean the three top verticals that we have are financial, manufacturing, and health. But we are broad across all verticals. So there's really no vertical that's dominant. So we haven't given out the percentages of each of those verticals, but we are very broad. One follow-on with Jay is that, if we take a look at our pipeline, our pipeline is accelerating. So, we are seeing an acceleration in our pipeline and that's across the board, both in ZIA and ZPA. Yes. I mean, it's a great question. I mean you take a look at the percentage of customers that have transformation, we have indicated it was 49%, over the last call in July. And it has gone up this quarter and it has continually gone up. ZPA is 13% of revenue, so big opportunity with their installed base for that in our emerging products. We had an acceleration in growth of new customers in Q1 versus the growth in Q4. So we are seeing momentum. We are seeing deal sizes getting bigger. We are seeing the need for transformation on a broader scale, as Jay mentioned, driven by COVID. But COVID started the visibility. What we are seeing right now is the realization on the part of CIOs and others and companies at high level who understand the legacy architectures they have got are really not the architectures. That's what's driving the business for us. It is that. In addition to that, proof points that we have pipeline, interest, productivity. Just you feel the momentum. You feel momentum that's coming our way. What it comes down to? At the end, it comes down to the people. It comes down to the execution. The market is there. The product is there. The vision is there. And I believe the people are there also. And I think in the past three quarters we had done an amazing job in scaling our go-to-market, which was the last piece we needed to scale and we are feeling very good about it. Yes. So it's a comparable pricing environment. Our price per user did go up quarter-over-quarter. Related to what drove the net retention rate, as Jay mentioned, the emerging products are not significant impact. So it's more of the existing products, the movement to transformation as well as ZPA, which is what drove the increase in net retention rate. Yes. I mean, Jay is absolutely correct.

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. First of all, I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. I am proud of our strong results and an exceptionally strong start to fiscal 2021 in our first quarter. We delivered 52% growth in revenue and 64% growth in billings, while also generating record operating profits and free cash flow. I believe our financial results demonstrate Zscaler's pivotal role in enabling our customers' digital transformation journeys, which are accelerating at a pace never seen before. Our visibility and business momentum remains strong and we are pleased to increase our fiscal year guidance. I believe the market is coming to us and we are investing across our organization to capture a significant share of our large and growing opportunity. I would like to thank the Zscaler team and our partners for their tireless efforts and commitment to our customer success. I am also pleased and excited to welcome, Chris Kozup to the Zscaler team as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Let me highlight three factors that drove our strong performance in the quarter. One, building on our growing traction with large enterprises. We closed a record number of seven-figure ACV deals. The majority of these wins are three-year commitments to provide the foundation for application, network, and security transformation. In particular, I am pleased with our increasing wins in the financial services vertical, which is now embracing the cloud and the Office 365 deployments have become an important catalyst for us. Two, our optimized go-to-market engine is driving significant velocity, including a strong pace of new logo acquisitions. I am very pleased with our performance across all geos. Last year, we doubled down on our investment in our sales organization. We scaled our sales enablement team and built a repeatable and metrics-driven process, which is giving us better visibility into our business and ultimately resulting in a strong and growing pipeline. These efforts are also bearing fruit in two big ways. One, our newly hired sales reps are contributing at a faster pace. And two, our sales productivity is higher than a year ago, despite a high percentage of ramping sales reps. Three, the power of our Zero Trust Exchange platform is resonating with CxOs. Our platform is comprised of four key pillars with each enabling a critical element of the transformation. ZIA to secure direct access to Internet and SaaS, ZPA for zero trust access to private applications, Zscaler Digital Experience or ZDX to deliver user experience for work from anywhere, cloud workload segmentation to protect applications. An increasing share of our sales is coming from initial platform purchases by new customers and also growing upsell to existing customers, which is driving a record 122% net retention rate. I believe in the current challenging environment and in the post-COVID economy, Zscaler will be the go-to-platform for vendor consolidation, cost saving, increased user productivity, and better cyber protection. We are excited about our mission to make the cloud safe for business and enjoyable for users. We enable our customers to increasingly use the Internet as their corporate network, any place legacy perimeter-based security with zero trust security. As the CIO of a Zscaler customer told us, we ended up with the security posture that's better than when we had a complex network and network security and have a user experience that's materially better. As we look forward to the next few years, we are focused on driving broader adoption of our four major cloud solutions, which together maximize the value for our customers' digital transformation. From pre-sales to deployment and customer success, we have built a sophisticated sales machine to sell value and deliver measurable outcome at the CxO level. We continue to scale our organization as the market increasingly moves our way. We will continue to build our ecosystem of technology and channel partners, which are contributing to overall sales velocity and expanding our reach across our total addressable market. Additionally, we are demonstrating our value to customers through an increased focus on thought leadership and demand generation programs. At our recent Virtual CXO Summit Series, we hosted six events that drew over 400 CxOs and IT leaders to discuss secured digital transformation. Many CxOs shared with me that their current work from home environment, while temporary, has helped them realize that zero trust architecture is the future, and it can be implemented easily and rapidly. COVID was a catalyst in changing the mindset and shaking off inertia, resulting in a reduced need for educating customers about the value of the Zscaler architecture over legacy approaches. Inbound customer requests have greatly increased, and we are becoming an integral part of a growing number of larger transformation projects. We continue to see more customers buying ZIA and ZPA together, which enables a true transformation with direct and seamless access to SaaS applications or applications in your datacenter or the public cloud. For example, a global manufacturing company purchased our Transformation Bundle plus DLP and CASB for 45,000 users and ZPA for 25,000 users. Drivers for this deal were network and security transformation. They had a traditional hub and spoke network for 300 manufacturing facilities, which were slowing their adoption of cloud applications such as WebEx, Office 365 and Workday. A next-gen firewall vendor tried to sell its hybrid offering but failed to meet their security and performance requirements, including SSL inspection. Interestingly, this initiative was part of a five-year managed services RFP where all six system integrators and service providers bid Zscaler. We are seeing customers increasingly migrate away from their large installed base of legacy on-prem gateway and security appliances to pursue direct to cloud architecture. In one new customer win, a Fortune 50 retail customer replaced a legacy web gateway with ZIA for cybersecurity and data protection. This customer purchased ZIA Professional Bundle plus CASB, Sandbox, and DLP for 45,000 users. Security was a major requirement and only a proxy architecture with SSL inspection was considered. This deal was a good example of Zscaler leveraging our tech partners, where CrowdStrike became the endpoint security provider and Microsoft, the identity provider. I am very pleased with our growing success with the financial industry where adoption of cloud is accelerating. A Fortune 100 financial services company purchased our Transformation Bundle with advanced DLP and CASB for 18,000 employees to overcome capacity issues with their security appliances when they deployed Office 365. Firewall-based technologies were ruled out due to strict security requirements or SSL inspection and DLP with exact data match. As these three deals show, our comprehensive data protection offering within ZIA has been gaining traction as customers are concerned about data leakage with employees working from anywhere. Our new out-of-band CASB is helping us displace CASB point products and increase our deal size. The most common themes in our customer wins are to increase user productivity, reduce business risk, simplify IT and reduce cost. The Zscaler platform enables this by consolidating and eliminating point products. Moving on to ZPA. Our customers view ZPA as the foundation for their architectural shift to zero trust access for private applications. Our platform eliminates the Internet attack surface of customers' applications, resulting in reduced business risk. ZPA is the clear market leader with proven maturity and scalability. We are supporting hundreds of large enterprises in the complex multi-cloud environment. Let me highlight two ZPA deals in the quarter. First, a global bank with headquarters in Europe needed to scale its remote access after the legacy VPN and VDI became a performance bottleneck and a security concern. Their IT team had to cope with over 4,000 trouble tickets per month from users having issues with their connectivity. This customer purchased ZPA for over 100,000 employees to deliver a seamless always-on experience. While the immediate objective for this deal was to replace legacy VPN, ZPA was selected to implement zero trust architecture by establishing an application level policy, where users connect to specific applications, not to a network. In another deal, a Fortune 500 tech company purchased ZPA to accelerate M&A integration. After one year, 6,000 employees at the acquired division were still using two laptops with separate VPNs to two separate networks. Integrating two complex corporate networks can take 12 months or more. ZPA is the elegant solution to this problem. Without having to connect to corporate networks, ZPA provides secure application access across both companies in weeks. Purchasing our high-end ZPA offering, the customer is leveraging ZPA's multiple identity support to accelerate deployment. The customer plans to use ZPA as a standard solution for future M&A, a core strategy for growth at this customer. In addition to ZPA, that customer purchased ZDX for 6,000 users to quickly troubleshoot issues and increase employee productivity. To close my business review, I will touch on some early success with our new emerging products. There is an accelerated market shift towards work from anywhere, which aligns with our platform and emerging products like ZDX. We had a number of ZDX wins in the quarter, including an upsell with a European Bank for 40,000 employees. This customer had ZIA for all employees. And it was frictionless to turn on ZDX to get end-to-end visibility and resolve performance issues. We also had wins for our CSPM offering, giving us additional opportunities for growth. Our emerging products are increasing our overall competitive differentiation. For large enterprises who want network and security modernization, we believe we are the only cloud native multi-tenant platform that meets their needs. Zscaler is the largest in-line cloud security platform in the world. We are processing more than 140 billion transactions daily, while preventing seven billion security incidents and policy violations. Deployed across more than 150 data centers, our Zero Trust Exchange platform was built from the ground up for the Secure Access Service Edge or SASE framework. Building a cloud native architecture with full security and minimal latency is very hard and running a massive in-line global cloud with five 9s of availability is an order of magnitude harder. As the world moves to SASE framework and zero trust architecture, some of you have asked about competition and why others can't build a cloud native platform like Zscaler. Well, the answer lies in the architecture, which is like the foundation of a building that supports everything. Our foundation is a multi-tenant architecture built from the ground up for in-line traffic inspection. It delivers over 20 key security solutions including antivirus, cloud sandbox, cloud firewall, DLP, advanced threat prevention and SSL inspection at scale. That's extremely hard to build and complex to operate as a cloud service without compromising user experience. It is like the difference between building a simple SaaS application versus a highly complex SaaS platform like an ERP. How many cloud native ERP systems are you aware of since NetSuite started two decades ago? While single dimensional SaaS applications are easy to develop, multi-dimensional platforms like an ERP and Zscaler are much harder to design, build and operate. With our business momentum, we are also demonstrating that our strategic sales process and world-class execution are important competitive advantages. First, our consultative sales model identifies the value we can drive for the customers and enables them to fully realize the benefits of digital transformation. This strategic sales process requires top sales talent. I believe we are the best sales team top to bottom and we are hiring at a rapid pace. We are now a destination for top talent around the globe. Second, we are deepening our ecosystem of technology partners, which are contributing to deal wins and adding leverage to our sales model. In addition to our ongoing partnership with Microsoft and CrowdStrike, we have now extended our strategic partnership with VMware to integrate with their SD-WAN solution and to partner for joint go-to-market engagements. I believe we have built a go-to-market engine that will generate long term sustainable growth. Now, I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you, Remo. Coming off a record Q1, we are seeing the market coming to us and validating our vision for zero trust cloud native platform. We believe we are in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to enable secure digital transformation. The value proposition of our zero trust platform is resonating with customers and we are seeing this reflected in our business momentum over the last three quarters. We have scaled our go-to-market engine and are delivering world-class sales execution, which we believe will drive sustainable long term growth. Thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We hope to see you at Zenith Live next week. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Sterling, thank you. Financial services have been slow in embracing the cloud, but now they are all opening up. They are embracing cloud and Office 365 is becoming the catalyst. To make Office 365 work, there had to be some transformation in the network and security, and we have done so much work with Microsoft to make sure Office 365 can be enabled securely delivering a fast user experience. So that's becoming our number one application to get into that space, and then it's expanding from there. Remo, you want to add anything to it? Yes. Lots of questions are being asked pre-COVID, post-COVID, and whatnot. If you look at our record pre-COVID, we had very good growth, our business is accelerating. It's driven by acceleration in digital transformation. Now, COVID was a catalyst in shaking off inertia. The change in mindset has accelerated demand for zero trust. When I talk to CIOs, they tell me, we did not realize how important it was to do transformation being able to embrace cloud for collaboration, for security, and the like. So, they are really moving faster than they did before. And so, momentum to our business clearly has picked up because it has highlighted the limitation of the old legacy and old network, and need to transform and this transformation works. So, we are pretty bullish. We think even after a vaccine, our business will keep on accelerating. Yes. Saket, thank you. Your question reminds me of my days at AirDefense and CipherTrust when I used to sell security appliances and we used to have lots of bake-offs, which box is faster, which big box is cheaper. At Zscaler, we are all driven by transformation. Transformation is not a box you sell. It actually starts with CIO level discussion to help them enable their applications to network, to security, all of them together. So, most of our deals at the higher end, at the large enterprise level aren't really competitive much at all. When you come to lower end, we do see some of the competition, but bake-offs are rare. In fact, I highlighted a win in my prepared remarks where even though there was an RFP that we won with a managed services partners, all six SI and SPs bid Zscaler, okay. I am very proud of it. That's because the customers and the SI/SP channel understands that you can take typical legacy boxes and try to make them do cloud transformation. So when it comes to competition, I think we got some big, big lead. Unless someone tries really purpose-build something, have a good architecture, we will maintain this lead. Yes. There are two aspects to your question. One is machine-to-machine or app-to-app communication within a public cloud. And the second part is, across clouds, maybe Azure East and Azure West type of stuff. While companies are trying to do this, doing traditional network security way, doing virtual firewalls and whatnot, we have taken zero trust approach to the public cloud where we can have app-to-app communication, and where we have the zero trust or switching technology, we needed identity technology. Identity for various apps would be built using the acquisition we did a few months ago through a company called, Edgewise Networks. So with that, we can do within the datacenter machine-to-machine communication without doing network segmentation and achieve app segmentation. And we can also go across clouds. But having said that, that's a young market. That's a nascent market. It needs some education. So, it will take some time for the market to grow. But if we are well-positioned to go in early and get a position there, that's a big area of investment for us. Yes. Thank you. Good question, Walter. Cloud protection is not one piece, it's multiple pieces and they are in different stages of the market. CSPM is one area where we are actually competing well. That's a fairly well understood and fairly simple market. Your cloud traffic from Azure AWS workload going to Internet, which most of these workloads do, you can try to do some virtual firewall and whatnot, which doesn't work or you can simply send it through Zscaler Internet Access by simply pointing traffic. We are very well positioned in that part of the segment. Then the third segment is what Alex asked about, machine-to-machine communication and whatnot, app-to-app. That's a younger area and that's where we see some young players, some start-ups in the game. But generally, the market being so young, there's not a whole lot of competition in that space. And only selected customers are kind of trying to pursue that. I see many customers who said, I tried to do network segmentation doing this and this. It hasn't worked. I had tried this. And the buyer is somewhat different, as you said. There are two types of buyer for cloud protection. One is actually the IT organization that's actually building application, the DevOps team. Because they are actually driven by application and they often ignore security. Then CSO comes and says, wait a second, you can do things fast, but you must put security in place. So we end up dealing with two parties, CSOs that we already deal with and DevOps party, that's a little bit new for us to get to know and learn. Thank you. I mean it's a very good question, Tal. Think about the four key solutions I talked about. ZIA has been a workhorse. It has been growing rapidly. But in spite of that, if you look at our penetration, in Global 2000 we are just under 25%. And there's a big market, majority of the market sitting open out there. In fact, there is still a sizable market of legacy where proxies like Blue Coat and that's to be removed and we are taking more and more part of that. So that's kind of one-piece. And ZIA is not one product. As you know, ZIA is a portfolio of several offerings and more and more customers are buying either bigger bundles like Transformation to start with or they are moving up from business bundles or professional bundles. So that's a pretty sizable thing on ZIA. We know nowhere close to leveling off at all. ZPA, relatively younger, only about four years old, have gone from zero to about 30% and offer new business in that range. And if you look at our customer base, just about in the mid-30%, somewhere 30% or so of the Global 2000 ZIA customer have ZPA. So even in our installed base of ZIA, there's a big market out there. So we think these two big proven product portfolios or call them, too big pillars, they have plenty of room for opportunity. And then ZDX, digital experience, is becoming an interesting product. It's a new product in a new area. Because as you go over the Internet, no one has any meaningful offering to let someone know end-to-end response time. We expect pretty good growth from it. One day we expect almost every user will have ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. And that's the way we are driving towards. The fourth area is new area, the cloud workload, the data center. I think that market will take some time to mature. As Remo has said, we are now really pulling tons of revenue in some of the new areas. But you shouldn't think about CASB type of things as new products. I mean, they are new, but they are part of ZIA portfolio. They automatically attach to our ZIA bundle. In the same way, we are seeing browser isolation picking up, which either goes with ZIA or goes with ZPA. But plenty of room in all areas. And I always said to my sales leaders, we have lots of product to sell. Let's scale our sales organization and that's what we are focused on. We are focused on growing go-to-market, which is doing very well. So excited for next year. Remo, did I cover? Agreed. Yes. So first of all, I think our hiring is happening at a faster pace than we had even expected. So very good actually. Remember about a year or two years ago, we used to say we are behind in hiring sales reps. Remo, you recall that. All that is past. I think probably our brand is helping that well known out there. Also our sales leadership has put a deep and wide leadership in place. And then getting more specific to answer your question, if you look at two broad areas of sales hiring, even though there are multiple areas beyond that are RSMs. Typically sales reps are not coming from box-selling background. Majority of our sales rep come from solution selling, SaaS type of background, because our sales is very different from than a typical box security selling. So they come from generally software and SaaS type of companies, by and large. That's number one. On the technical side, the SC side, we generally hire from someone that comes with a little bit networking and security background because they need domain expertise, which takes a little longer. But we are getting tons and tons of interest and we are trying to stay selective when we hire. But we are pretty much tracking our progress on hiring very well. On a net hiring basis, one of the things that I would call out, we had a record quarter for net hires. In the quarter, we hired over 260 people. A quarter before, it was 200. A quarter before, it was 150. And the quarter before that, it was 100. Of that 260, about 60% were in the sales and marketing area. We had a record quarter for quota-carrying sales rep hires in Q4. We had a comparable number in Q1. We are accelerating the hiring even more than what we had anticipated on our last call, given what we are seeing. Yes. That's quite a few questions. So let me give a piece at a time. Sales force maturity, right. Since Dali joined us, we spent about 3.5 to four quarters to make sure we bring in a systematic and disciplined sales process, sales enablement and sales metrics to understand the business leading indicators and all that stuff plus putting a number of leaders in place. So, you asked me what do I think about the maturity of the sales organization? I would say, extremely happy, very good about it. Because having that in place drives the rest of the stuff. So very comfortable and it's because of that comfort, we are accelerating hiring more and more salespeople in the field. Next question is related to deals, customers, new customers, customer growth. I think if you look at one number of holistically, that out of whatever 4,500 or 4,800 whatever those customers are, those percentages will be misleading. Because there is some small customers, some large customers. We need to get to a level where we start kind of looking at proper segmentation and growth within segmentations. Our big focus traditionally has been large enterprises and we have done extremely well among the penetration we are doing in those customers in terms of percentage and in terms of the deal, the ARR we are having in those customers is actually going up very well. We are very pleased with that. And as I finish, I will let Remo talk about some of those numbers. And then we also are expanding more into the lower enterprises, so to speak. I think over time, we will give you more color. So you can start computing the growth better. But if you look at the segment, we are now getting more focused on 2,000 user to 10,000 user segments, because we already got the largest segment over 10,000 and pretty well covered and we are getting great wins out there. So there is a big market for us to come downstream and expand as well. Remo, you want to add more. So let me start with VMware. VMware has been a good partner for us. The portfolio of SD-WAN, if you look at SD-WANs, we have always said that SD-WAN is a good complementary area for us and we have been actually securing some very, very large SD-WAN deployments out there. And it was natural for us to team up with VMware. So what did we do? We had done integrations. So those SD-WANs can be deployed lot more easily with a single click. But more exciting than that, we are actually working with them on a number of joint go-to-market initiatives. Our sales people are kind of doing joint account planning and we have a number of market initiatives. So we think that would be a good partnership for incremental revenue for both the companies. That's on the VMware side of it. Microsoft, you know that partner goes for several years. It started with Office 365 deployments with great user experience, single configuration type of deployments. And then expanded beyond to Azure AD to Azure Access to Azure Sentinel and even to endpoint areas. Microsoft is pushing now Office 365 in financial services, because they have been the late adopter of Office 365. And that's particularly helping us because those large companies want to make sure this deployment goes well and Zscaler is their go-to partner in those deployments. So Microsoft is helping or we are helping Microsoft and they are helping us in these financial services customers. I am not sure if any of the specific deals this quarter was impacted by Microsoft. But in large companies, there will be large deals where we will be working together with Microsoft to close those deals. Remo, did I miss something? So if you think about it, while a lot of stuff we do are transformation, generally there's an entry point for each area that's the easiest one from budget point of view. So VPN ends up being the entry point and the first point. But as we have said many times, ZPA is being bought for zero trust implementation. In the past one year, I have seen interest in zero trust gone big, big time. And it's a specific architecture, where you don't put connect users to the network. So any product that's a VPN related, whether it is an on-prem product or it's a cloud-based VPN, it's still VPN and doesn't really get counted as the zero trust offering. So it starts with taking out the VPN budget. But more importantly, all the wins we are having are being done to make sure they can also do zero trust access to not only your data center, but also to cloud application sitting in Azure AWS and more and more customers want to implement zero trust even when you are in the office. So we don't think that ZPA wins are coming because some of the deals are being pulled forward. We think COVID is actually accelerating and showing the need for zero trust being able to access anything from anywhere. And we see this acceleration continue. So very confident about the ZPA projection and that's reflected in the pipeline we are seeing for ZPA. Remo? Yes. If I may say, the combination of ZIA and ZPA ensures that any user can work from anywhere, office, home, wherever. And that's where the zero trust comes in. It's a same user experience, same level of security, same level of policy and that's what CIOs are buying. Yes. Catharine, thank you. Federal is a big opportunity for us and our business is making good progress there. Our market, we have a sizable team in place now. We have some very good FedRAMP certifications and we have got a growing pipeline in 2021 and beyond. We expect federal to be a bigger part of our business. Remo, do you want to give a color of where it is now? All right. So I think we are done with the questions. And I will like to say thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We hope to see you at Zenith Live and upcoming several investor conferences that we are participating in. Goodbye."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. I am very pleased to share our strong Q4 results to end another outstanding year. In the quarter, we delivered 61% revenue growth and 57% billings growth, as customers continued to embrace our Zero Trust Exchange platform to secure their digital transformation. We are delivering this strong growth while generating strong profitability. Our free cash flow margin was 24%, which was a record for Q4. While many Public SaaS companies are happy to get to Rule-of-40, we surpassed the Rule-of-80 for the quarter and for the full year. These outstanding results reflect the strong underlying unit economics of our business that has high-90% gross retention rate and over 80% gross margins. This is possible because of our differentiated service and purpose-built, multi-tenant cloud platform that scales efficiently. For the full year, our revenue grew 62% to $1.1 billion and billings grew 59% to $1.5 billion. We are seeing revenue growth across all products, industry verticals, market segments and geographies. Our platform is securing over 34 million users for over 6,700 customers, and we\u2019re making great progress towards our goal of protecting 200 million users. To reach our goal, we will continue to invest aggressively in growing our business and driving innovation, while focusing on operational efficiencies to drive the bottom line. Let me share with you some of my observations and how we plan to manage through the uncertain macro environment in fiscal \u201823. First, my conversations with hundreds of IT executives confirm that cybersecurity remains the number one IT priority and a top Board level issue. Independent CIO surveys confirm Zero Trust security and SASE will continue to be a top priority. Zscaler\u2019s proxy-based cloud platform is the best solution for tackling sophisticated cybersecurity challenges. In addition, the rise of hybrid work and the need for secure digital transformation are driving the demand for Zscaler. We believe periods of macro uncertainty can accelerate adoption of disruptive technologies like ours, which offer better security and user experience while substantially reducing cost and IT complexity. As the pioneer and recognized leader in Security Service Edge, we are well positioned to capture this ongoing market shift towards Zero Trust. Second, we address a $72 billion market, with significant new customer and upsell opportunities. Our superior architecture and proven experience delivering measurable outcomes at the CXO level, elevate us above the competitive noise. We drove 62% year-over-year growth in customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, ending with over 320 of these customers, including over 20 customers exceeding $5 million in ARR. We have a blueprint for delivering great value, which drives strong upsell for us. Approximately 60% of our new business comes from existing customers, and our net retention rate has again exceeded 125%, now for seven consecutive quarters. Happy customers buy more, and our net promoter score continues to exceed 70, which is more than 2 times the average NPS for SaaS companies. In addition, we expect our deep and wide platform together with our enviable customer base of large enterprises, to continue to drive upsells. As we have indicated before, we have a 6 times upsell opportunity with our existing customers just for our core ZIA and ZPA product pillars. Lastly, our consultative sales process plays a major role in our success and enables us to maintain a high-level of engagement with our customers, especially at the C-level. As part of this process, we produce CFO-ready business cases with ROI and payback periods calculated in collaboration with our customers. In Q4, as we saw more deals getting scrutinized, we delivered more of these business value assessments, which helped us close many large multi-year, multi-product pillar deals. We believe our adaptive sales process makes us resilient to changing business environment and will continue to drive our business. Looking forward, I am excited about fiscal \u201823 as we continue to win opportunities with new and existing customers. Increasingly, customers are buying ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together to deliver a complete Zero Trust solution for users. This accelerates our customers\u2019 transformation journey and makes us a critical partner for them. Let me discuss two such deals in Q4. In a new logo win, a Fortune 50 pharmaceutical company purchased ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all 145,000 employees. This deal started with a regional need to improve security without compromising user experience in China. With multiple data centers in China covering various regions with premium connectivity options, Zscaler has superior zero trust access for multi-nationals out of China. Next, this customer engaged us for global M&A IT integration and hybrid work use cases. Impressed with these results, they accelerated their company-wide zero trust adoption with us. They disqualified their incumbent next-gen firewall vendor who had no referenceable customer at the required scale for its SASE cloud VPN product. This customer understands that a VPN, either as an appliance or hosted in the cloud under any name, is not zero trust and is the biggest security risk. This customer also purchased Zscaler for Workloads for 10,000 workloads to enable multi-cloud, app-to-app connectivity to support their M&A strategy. This was a three-year, eight-figure deal for all four pillars of our platform: ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads, or what we used to call Cloud Protection. We closed this deal with AWS marketplace, which is becoming a larger channel for us. Next, one of our largest deals in the quarter came from a delighted Fortune 500 tech customer who deployed the entire Zscaler for Users offering including ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. This provided fast and direct access for users working from anywhere to applications in the data center or in the cloud. With dramatic improvements in user experience, employees were buzzing about the change. One employee slacked, and I quote, \u201cEvery morning I log into my machine, I\u2019m thankful for Zscaler!\u201d This customer doubled their seats to 120,000 users and extended the commitment for another three years. Their journey with us started with a small M&A IT integration use case, which quickly expanded into a company-wide zero trust initiative. In less than two years, this customer\u2019s annual spend with Zscaler grew 13x to well over $10 million. Next, from a product perspective, we saw strong performance across all pillars of our platform. Our core pillars, ZIA and ZPA, have never been stronger, and we are excited about the rapid adoption of our emerging products: ZDX to manage digital user experience, and Zscaler for Workloads to secure servers and workloads. Emerging products contributed 14% of our new business in fiscal \u201822, and we expect continued growth in fiscal \u201823. We continue to innovate rapidly and expand our platform. At our Zenith Live conference in June, we launched Posture Control for public clouds as a fully integrated solution that correlates vulnerabilities and risks across CSPM, CIEM, and Infrastructure as Code scanning. In addition, we integrated our recently acquired deception technology into our platform and saw great adoption by our customers. This is an example of our highly targeted early-stage acquisition strategy shortening our time to market for new innovations and expanding our market opportunity. Let me highlight three deals that were driven by our emerging products: We won a seven-figure ACV with a government agency in Australia for ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, where ZDX accounted for approximately $1 million of the total ACV value. ZDX pinpoints and resolves performance issues in real-time by monitoring experience of every user, every network hop, and every application, regardless of their location. The customer said ZDX is a must-have, as it delivered immediate value by reducing troubleshooting time and improving employee productivity. In a seven-figure ACV upsell win, a Fortune 50 insurance company purchased ZPA Transformation bundle for Zero Trust Access to implement user-to-app segmentation. This customer understands that if a user connects to the network with an on-prem or cloud VPN, that\u2019s not zero trust. With this latest purchase, they plan to replace their legacy network security, including VPN, Network Access Control or NAC, network-based segmentation, and VDI infrastructure. They purchased Zscaler Deception to detect and intercept bad actors trying to infiltrate the network. Finally, a Global 500 financial services customer in APJ purchased Zscaler for Workloads for 36,000 workloads to complement their ZIA and ZPA services for users. With many apps running in AWS and Azure, they wanted to implement a Zero Trust architecture to prevent lateral threat movement and eliminate backhauling workload traffic through the data center for inspection. We reduced cost and complexity by eliminating the need for virtual firewalls and site-to-site VPN networks, while improving security and operational efficiency. Next, let me discuss the progress we are making in Federal vertical. We now have FedRAMP High authorization for ZIA, which together with ZPA, makes us the only cloud security service to have two products at the highest level of FedRAMP certification. In addition, ZPA is the only Zero Trust solution with DoD IL5 certification. These certifications are driving our federal business. In Q4, we added over 25 new Federal customers and over half of them purchased ZIA and ZPA together. Now, we have landed 10 of the 15 Cabinet-level agencies as customers, with plenty of opportunities for upsell at these large organizations. I want to highlight one federal deal that I\u2019m particularly excited about: We were awarded a five-year, $46 million contract by a large cabinet agency with over 100,000 users. The value of this contract will be granted over time, based on deployment. Against this award, we received an initial low-seven-figure ACV task order for ZIA and ZPA. Next, let me comment on the increased leverage we\u2019re driving with our channel programs. We saw over 50% year-over-year growth in channel sourced-deal registrations. Working closely with our cloud-centric VAR partners, we are building momentum down-market in the Enterprise and Commercial segments, which is providing higher contribution to our new business. At RSA conference, you heard a key partner, Optiv, talk about their plans to grow with us and further invest in Zscaler certifications for their consultants. I\u2019m also excited about the opportunities we can unlock together with the global SIs that are building large Zero Trust and SASE transformation practices. Moving to cloud marketplaces, this channel is growing very well for us. We have made strategic investments in our collaboration with AWS and Azure, including deep technology integrations, co-selling opportunities and demand generation programs. In Q4, our new business through cloud marketplaces grew nearly 5x year-over-year. For example, we signed five greater-than-$1 million deals through the AWS marketplace, including two of our top five new and upsell deals of the quarter. Our strengthening Azure and AWS partnerships also give us access to their customers\u2019 sizable cloud budgets which can streamline the deal close process. I want to highlight another important area for our customers, their ESG goals. Our highly efficient cloud eliminates the need for on-prem appliances, which significantly decreases IT waste, energy usage, and carbon emissions. We are also committed to our own ESG goals. Since achieving 100% renewable energy last year, we are proud to be Carbon Neutral for calendar \u201822, covering relevant Scope 1, 2, and 3 categories, including travel, customer use, public cloud use, and procurement. I am excited to announce our goal to be Net Zero by 2025, joining our customers in a collective effort to transition to a low carbon economy. In closing, even with uncertain macro conditions, we continue to see favorable demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform, which makes businesses more agile and competitive, simplifies IT, consolidates point products and reduces cost. We believe customers trust Zscaler more than any other provider for securing their cloud journey. We have grown our global team to approximately 5,000 employees who share a mission to secure the hyperconnected world of cloud and mobility. I am extremely proud of the strong growth and profitability we delivered in 2022. I want to thank our employees and our partners for their tireless efforts and commitment to our customers\u2019 success. We will continue to invest aggressively to delight our customers and capture the large opportunity ahead of us, while delivering operational excellence. Now, I\u2019d like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. We are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and full year. Revenue for the quarter was $318 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 19% of total revenue, growing 80% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions: Americas represented 52% of revenue, EMEA was 33% and APJ was 15%. APJ continues to be our fastest growing region with revenue growth of 88% year-over-year. For the full year, revenue was $1.09 billion, up 62% year-over-year. This is an acceleration from the 56% growth we delivered in fiscal 2021. Our total calculated billings in Q4 grew 57% year-over-year to $520 million, with billing duration comparable to a year ago and slightly above the midpoint of our normal 10 to 14 months range. We saw strong growth in our top five verticals: Finance, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Technology and Services. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 68% from one year ago to $2.607 billion. The current RPO is 49% of the total RPO. As a point of clarification, the total contract value of the five-year, $46 million award from a U.S. Federal government agency that Jay mentioned is not included in our RPO. RPO for this contract will be recognized as the individual task orders are received, which are 12-months in term length as is typical for our federal customers. Moving on to our product pillars, for the full year, emerging products, which include ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads, or what we used to call Cloud Protection, met our targets and contributed 14% to our total new business. Including our new CNAPP and deception offerings in the Zscaler for Workloads pillar, we expect emerging products to contribute high-teens percentage of our total new business in fiscal 2023. ZPA was 27% of our total new business in fiscal 2022, and grew as a mix between the two core ZIA and ZPA pillars. We have a large opportunity with all our pillars, and we will continue to innovate and expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in the Zero Trust security market. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which was again above 125% for the last seven quarters. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. We had 327 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 62% from 202 in the prior year. The continued strength in this metric speaks to our large enterprise focus and the strategic role we play in our customers\u2019 digital transformation initiatives. We added 198 customers in the quarter paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the year at 2,089 such customers. Expanding our field engagement with smaller enterprises with 2,000 to 6,000 employees and the increased investments in our Summit Partner program are contributing to overall customer growth. Turning to the rest of our Q4 financial performance, total gross margin of 81.6% was up nearly 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 8% sequentially and 60% year-over-year to $221 million. Operating margin was 12% and free cash flow margin was 24%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around high-single digit percent of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.73 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Before providing our guidance, I would like to share a few thoughts about the framework for our business outlook in the current environment. Zscaler is operating from a position of strength. We are entering this fiscal year with a record pipeline and a large set of customer opportunities. We have confidence in the durability of our business model, with very high contribution margins after the initial land, and proven ability to retain and upsell to our enterprise customer base. With customers increasingly adopting the broader platform with long-term commitments, we plan to continue to invest in capturing our large market opportunity. As Jay mentioned, there was more deal scrutiny at the end of Q4, which resulted in business being more backend loaded. We think it's prudent to expect this higher level of review and scrutiny by our customers to continue given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook. While demand for the Zscaler platform remains very strong, if the business environment changes, our business model allows us to adapt quickly and to deliver on our operating profit and margin goals. In fiscal \u201823, in our guidance, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of approximately 150 basis points. Now, moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, and amortization of intangible assets. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $339 million to $341 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 47% to 48%; gross margins of approximately 80%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products will initially have lower gross margins than our core products, because we are more focused on time-to-market and growth rather than optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $37 million to $38 million. Net other income of $5 million. Income taxes of $2.5 million. Earnings per share of approximately $0.26, assuming 155 million fully-diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard which requires the use of if-converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes, you will need to add back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense and include 7.63 million shares to the fully-diluted share count. For the full-year fiscal 2023 we expect revenue in the range of $1.49 billion to $1.5 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 37%; calculated billings in the range of $1.92 billion to $1.94 billion or year-over-year growth of 30% to 31%. While we don\u2019t normally guide to quarterly billings, I want to remind you that we will have a difficult year-over-year comparison in Q1. In the year ago quarter, we had a one-off deal and multi-year invoices that resulted in billings duration at the high-end of our normal 10 to 14 months range. With that in mind, we expect Q1 \u201823 billings to grow approximately mid-30% year-over-year. We also expect our first half mix to be approximately 42% to 43% of our full year billings guide, which is higher than the first half mix in the last few years. Operating profit in the range of $173 million to $176 million. Income taxes of $14 million. Earnings per share in the range of $1.16 to $1.18, assuming approximately 157 million fully diluted shares. As noted earlier, to account for our convertible notes in EPS, you will need to add back $1.44 million in annual interest expense and include 7.63 million shares to the fully-diluted share count. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing. If we continue to have high growth, we will prioritize investing in the business. As we have discussed, if we are growing revenue faster than 30%, you can expect less than 300 basis points of margin expansion in the year. We remain confident of reaching 20% to 22% operating margins in the long-term. With a huge market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we\u2019re committed to investing aggressively in our company while balancing this with our operating profit goals. However, if we see a deteriorating global economic environment, we have the flexibility to place a higher priority on operating profitability. Operator, you may now open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: A lot of interesting data points, I guess, but I'll start with the big Fed deal. It doesn't sound like it contributed maybe any revenue in Q4 given that it's not in RPO yet, but wanted to clarify that. And I'd imagine a deal that size was likely competitive. So just wondering if you could discuss which vendors you beat in that deal. And then finally, given the upcoming fiscal year end with the Fed, how does the remaining pipeline in the Fed look this quarter given the strong results you just put up? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: I'll take the first part, Andy. You're absolutely right. There's not much revenue in the quarter for that large deal. But your call-out also that it's not in the RPO is a great call-out also, which is what we've been talking about with RPO growth, it's better for Zscaler to look at billings growth because an entire $46 million or most -- almost all that $46 million is not in RPO. Now, I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Good. So, regarding the deal, the nature and competitiveness, you can imagine that almost all federal deals need to go through a very competitive offer process. And all the obvious names you would expect were all competing, all legacy vendors, network security firewalls and the like. They all competed for it. But it was the architecture that won at the end of the day. So, we are excited about it. But as you know, some of these federal deals take time. We do have 10 of the 15 Cabinet-level agencies as our customers, and there's a lot of opportunity for us in the federal market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: [Technical Difficulty] on a fantastic end and unbelievable execution against a tough environment, which leads to my question. Jay, I think it's well understood that security and connectivity are essential nondiscretionary budget items for customers. But two related questions. One, it would seem in tougher times, it's more difficult to land new logo customers. And I'm curious if that's true for Zscaler and how you mitigate that. And just related, is there any shift that you're seeing in terms of where the budget is coming from for customers to fund their network and IT transformation initiatives? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Thanks, Brad. It is true that it takes more time and effort than new logos, especially when your current customers are very happy and delighted. That's why our business is coming from what size, expansion and new logos. And what are we trying to do to get new logos in current market? I'll tell you one very exciting thing which is very unusual. A bit for -- for new logos for us is when CXOs who frequently move from company A to company B, they often call us. I mean, I can tell you I've personally seen probably well over 100 -- probably a few hundred tests. The CXOs went, they called us. And once they do, the discussion -- the conversation goes a lot faster. In addition, we are doing a lot of demand gen program. A lot of demand-gen programs are doing to help our channel partners and the like are largely focused on new logos because we want to do both, new logos as well as upsell. Both are important for us. Second probably your question is where the budget is coming from to fund. Yes, we are driving transformation, but the nature of our transformation has been changing. First of all, before COVID, network transformation used to be a big problem. COVID killed all of that discussion and said the Internet is the corporate network. So network transformation evangelist has gone away. It's mainstream that you should be able to go and work for many do. Now, where is the budget coming from? Number one thing CIOs and CFOs are asking now is, please help me eliminate a lot of point products. Help me save money. So cost reduction by elimination is a big thing and especially a platform for wireline Zscaler, which can eliminate lots of products. We actually end up showing good ROI and in the process of getting a bigger budget sale. That's one part. The second part is, I highlighted in my prepared remarks that marketplace banks are helping us. Some of these large deals are actually coming out of our hyperscaler budgets because their revenues already commit for them. And it is true that customers are asking for better business value and quantification, and that's what we're doing with a very mature business value process. That's why you've seen us do very well in spite of increased group.\nBrad Zelnick: Fantastic. Thank you so much. And congrats again, guys.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Henderson.\nAlex Henderson: I think back at your Zenith Live event, you talked about conditions such that, yes, there may be some stretching of duration. But that, in turn, is resulting in a higher adoption rate, mainly because you're able to help them lower cost and lower the amount of employees they need to run their operations as well as eliminating the point products. So as the conditions have tightened further over the last 1.5 months, have you seen an increased win rates and some larger deal sizes as a result of that ability to help companies significantly diminish their staffing and cost requirements?\nJay Chaudhry: We have actually many, many customers who have publicly stated in our conferences that the number of resources needed to one, operate Zscaler service is much sold. Often it's kind of -- fit all what it takes to run appliance companies, firewall companies and the like. So, that's part of the operational cost that you talk about. There are four pieces of cost that customer looks at from reduction from Zscaler. Operational is obviously one part of it. Cost savings from elimination of point products is an important area. You won't believe so many security products are sitting at any large enterprises. And one CISO called it appliance for peak. Our third area is improved business productivity, which is linked to user experience. It is interesting as users are working from everywhere accessing very critical information out in the cloud, users are very, how should I say, intolerant of any slowness and store experience. And fourth thing is risk reduction. It's hard to quantify risk, but our customers are looking and saying, \"What's the cost of breach? What's the cost of downtime and the like?\" So, we have always had a good business value assessment process. It has short book. And also when we work the C level and the C level becomes sponsor of the process, it helps us show them savings and it helps us get our deal done.\nAlex Henderson: The question, just to be clear, was, has there been a change in that environment that has then amplified the benefit of those four factors?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Probably the direct answer would be, it is more and more need to do a strong assessment, quantification and commitment to delivering those results. Absolutely, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joel Fishbein of Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Congrats on the great execution. Remo, just two -- one question, two parts. Great outperformance on the gross margin side of the business. Want to understand what the drivers of leverage going forward will be? I know you gave us some -- a little bit of color on FY23. And then also, $1.7 billion in cash, what do you -- what's the best use of cash at this point in the evolution?\nRemo Canessa: I mean, good questions. So the outperformance in gross margins in Q4, we did 81.6%. Basically, it's the efficiency that we've created with our software authorization and just overall lower cost, bandwidth cost, colo cost, depreciation as well as the outperformance on the top line. Those are the primary reasons. Key thing to recognize with our gross margin, we have the ability to come out with applications faster by putting basically applications in public cloud. We will continue to do that. Again, from our perspective, we are going to deliver the best products as quickly as we can to our customers. In our gross margin, we expect in fiscal '23 and also the midterm is 80%. From a long-term perspective, we expect gross margins between 78% and 82%. So, as long as we're within that bound, it just gives tremendous flexibility from a modeling perspective for Zscaler because we have such high gross margins with high growth to invest in the business. From a perspective of the $1.7 billion in cash, really no plans for that. It will be used for strategic purposes. We clearly don't need it for working capital as our free cash flow last year was significant. And also from a free cash flow perspective in fiscal '23, I'd expect free cash flow margin to be 20% or above. So really just for strategic purposes is that cash.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci of Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: My question is sort of a high-level question, and it goes back to Brad's a little bit. And it's on the macro environment, which no one really escapes. And it's good to hear you acknowledge it, even though you really don't see it in your financial results. Your new ACV per our calculations accelerated against a more difficult comp, and your guidance implies some confidence in the future, right? So -- but you kind of talked about how you think about the macro softness and why it's not affecting your business right now. But I think this is probably for Remo. How did you think about it, or how is it implied in your annual guidance, if at all, like any -- the softness or whether it can get worse? Other than -- I mean you did mention businesses being more back-end loaded and that was sort of assumed, but you've closed it anyway. It's just back-end loaded. Is there any other color you can give us on that?\nRemo Canessa: No. I mean, I think it's a great question. I think it's one of the key questions, and thank you for asking it. We did see higher deal scrutiny in Q4. So, that played into our guidance. And that higher deal scrutiny related mostly to large, multiyear, multi-product pillar-type deals. As you mentioned, John, not a significant impact on our business. And from our perspective, when we took a look at our guidance, many customers have not put their budgets in place for calendar '23. That will happen in a few months or a couple of quarters. So, that does create a level of uncertainty in the second half of our fiscal \u201823. So, we took a look at all those factors in consideration when we did our guidance, and that is the reason that we guided for a higher contribution in the first half of our billings, between 42% and 43%. And that compares to last year, which was 41.5%. So, a lot of thought went into the guidance. We feel it's prudent. And also, again, we're recognizing that the second half of our fiscal year, there's -- we don't have as good a visibility. And that's why we have better visibility in the first half.\nJay Chaudhry: And if I may add on two things. I may ask two things we've done to make sure we do a good job. One is we are working more closely with our customers to identify what needs to go, what needs to change from a savings point of view. We are a lot more focused on helping customers save money because CIO is asking us, what can you do to save money? I have a lot of legacy debt products, please help. So, our sales process is focused more on that than it used to be before. That's one point. And the second, we alluded to it, but the business value assessment needs to be much sharper now than it used to be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Boyd of UBS.\nRoger Boyd: Just to touch on the cloud marketplaces, it seems for a couple of quarters now you've highlighted the momentum with AWS and Azure, but 5x growth really stuck up this quarter. Any sense for how big of a channel that is for Zscaler today and how big that could get given it seems like a win-win for customers, VARs and ISVs like yourself? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll start then I'll have Jay. It's still relatively early. It's still relatively a small part of our business. But the cloud marketplace is increasing, and we do see it as a very important and strategic basically channel for us. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. It becomes a new channel of revenue for us. Over the -- let me put this way. In the past three years, it has gone from nothing to pretty significant. That's why from a small base, the numbers are looking big. But those big providers are now working with us and co-selling to considerate net new pipeline for us. That's good. The other part that's helping us, it's kind of interesting is some of these budgets are committed for hyperscalers on an annual basis. And our solutions qualify to become after those budgets. That becomes one more justification with a little bit easier budget approval becomes one more area for us. We are dedicating resources. We are making investment in this channel to become bigger.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Walkley of CGF.\nMike Walkley: Thank you very much. And congratulations on the strong results. Jay, I just wanted to get your thoughts, just given the economic uncertainty and increased deal scrutiny, given Zscaler's value proposition, why wouldn't this year be a year you even accelerate share gains in the market? Or alternatively, are you just seeing customers, given the uncertainty, just tighten budgets and sticking with what they currently have?\nJay Chaudhry: I mean, that's what I tell Remo. Come on, let's be more aggressive. Remo, go ahead.\nRemo Canessa: It's a great question. We'll have to wait and see. I mean, you've got our guidance. When we give guidance, we would like to be prudent. However, when -- again, from my perspective, and you take a look at Zscaler, it was purpose-built for this world. The highest level of security, proxy-based, going down to SSL traffic. As Jay talked about, lower complexity. The number of security professionals in the world, there's a major need for it. And that's going to get worse, then lower cost. Again, we like to do our guidance, we like to be prudent, and we'll see how things play through. But I don't see any other -- well, I shouldn't say -- we are well positioned. Let's just say that we're well positioned as a company.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. That's what I would say. I mean certain hard times obviously require a lot extra effort to make things happen. I would say with all the great things that are positioning us well, I expect us to do far better than first to the vendors out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Jay, we've obviously had a lot of change over the last couple of years in terms of the nature of work and IT. But to me, it seems like security architectures still haven't fully caught up to that, and there's still a lot of technical debt. I'm curious, when Zscaler does come in and do some of these transformational deals, is there more pressure for CIOs and CISOs to want to replace existing solutions? And who do you -- who are you or what technologies are you seeing yourself replace more often these days as we are entering into a more hybrid world going forward?\nJay Chaudhry: It's a very good question. So, if you think about our big product portfolio with ZIA and ZPA, we are essentially replacing all branch kind of devices or any of the firewall proxies and the like calculate it the first wave of the replacement out there. Number two, with ZPA, we are beginning to replace. Obviously, the VPN was a starting point. But think of the entire inbound DMZ that many customers have to deploy. That's the second point. So branch finals, branch proxies, all this stuff is number one. The cloud workload, with the announcement of the new solutions we have done with Zscaler for Workloads where zero trust is being brought to the cloud, and this is relatively new -- in the past 8 or 9 months. We have now quite a few customers who have no firewalls in the cloud. So typically, they buy a bunch of virtual firewalls in the cloud. We see, we like -- we think our customers will be firewall-free in the cloud. The third part is data sector. That's the slowest moving part. The data center, DMZ, all these boxes are very complicated. And we actually don't like to go and fight in that area because that area is kind of pretty clumsy and cluttered, and data centers are shrinking over time. I would rather put my focus on where the park is headed rather than the park is. So that's where we see a number of customers buying firewalls for data centers and the like because there's also a little bit of demand coming from the corporate side of it. But all the branches replace almost everything out there. Public cloud, early stage with very promising signs. And data center, we'll leave it alone for a while. Did I answer your question?\nHamza Fodderwala: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Tilton of Wolfe Research.\nJosh Tilton: I'll echo my congratulations on the quarter. You guys obviously gave operating margin guidance for next year. Are there any guardrails you can provide us and how we should think about maybe the delta between the operating margin and the free cash flow margin for the full year?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, when you take a look at the last two years, our free cash flow has been above 20%. When you take a look at our guidance that we gave for fiscal '23, it's the same. Basically, it should follow what have done in the last two years being over 20%. The value that Zscaler has, we\u2019re a very efficient company. Take a look at our cloud. Typically, our cloud capital expenditure or expenses are high single digits in any one quarter, which is relatively low. Our high gross margins, just our overall operating profitability. The key thing also with the -- our cash flow is that we typically bill annually. So, our billing range is between 10 and 14 months. So, it's just -- we're just in a really good position. It's a very efficient model. And again, looking at the last two years, I wouldn't expect anything different from a free cash flow margin perspective. And I would expect things to be similar, higher than 20%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho Group.\nGregg Moskowitz: Congrats on ZIA's FedRAMP authorization. Given that you're clearly already seeing a lot of momentum in your federal business, Jay, maybe you could expand on what having dual FedRAMP high authority will add to Zscaler incrementally. And then for Remo, it's interesting to me that your headcount growth actually accelerated in fiscal '22 to 58%, especially since you grew a robust mid-50s in the prior year. Given the macro uncertainty, how are you thinking about hiring growth over the next 6, 12 months? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: I will start. We did good results in Q4. We are expecting good and healthy results for federal business in Q1. But we do know that federal business takes time. It has taken us years to get the very high-level certification coming, probably more painful than any other certification I've seen, but they're good ones. So they are positioning us well. But on the certification still is on us with smaller deal, and there's a lot of opportunity to expand. For example, 10 of the 15 Cabinet-level agencies we talked about, they have -- mostly, they've started small, plan give opportunity for us to expand. So, we are investing in these sources. Our pipeline is growing, and we have high expectations for our Fed business.\nRemo Canessa: From a headcount perspective, Gregg, you're absolutely right. It was a great year for us. It hit expansion in fiscal '22. What we talked about, we are excited about the opportunity. We feel the best interest for everyone to continue to prioritize growth but being mindful of operating profitability. We plan to continue to still prioritize growth going forward. But because of the leverage in our model, we're able to deliver -- we're planning to deliver 150 basis points, basically margin expansion. The reason for that that we're able to do that is that SaaS model with ratable revenue with the ARR balance, you've got pretty good visibility coming into the year. When you couple that with the high gross margins at 80%-plus, it just makes it a very attractive model for us to really manage our business. Right now, where we're at, we feel we have the right product at the right time, which addresses a significant need for our customers. We plan to invest across the board in the company. We're going to be investing in go-to-market, R&D and our cloud to really help customers navigate through this difficult time where they can lower their cost increase their security and basically decrease their complexity. So from my perspective, we will continue to prioritize growth and we will continue to hire. So, that is our plan for fiscal '23.\nJay Chaudhry: Remo, if I may add, just to comment. We did well last year. We are [Technical Difficulty] this year. We have become the top destination for [Technical Difficulty]. I mean in R&D and in sales, we're probably the best organization to go. 6 to 9 months ago, some of these start-ups that are funded like nothing out there, they're all trying to hire people, they're all laying people off, and we are investing heavily in it. And by that way, we hired Brendan Castle, our new Chief People Officer. He comes from Google with a deep expertise in scaling talent acquisition and development. So very, very excited and bullish about the business opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal of Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Guys, congrats on the ongoing strong performance and guidance. A question for either Remo or Jay. So clearly, Jay, as you've indicated, you're showing great ROI for your customers. I want to actually focus on your ARPU trends. Maybe can you provide us with some color on recent ARPU trends? Are they on par with recent quarters? Have they been moving up in recent months? Have you instituted any pricing increase over the course of the past few months? Thanks for that.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll take that. ARPU has been increasing on a year-over-year basis. Our ARPU has increased 20%. Related to price increases, we typically do it on an annual basis. And really, it's related to additional applications and bundling. And with that, prices do go up, but they go up probably in the mid-single-digit-type range, nothing really significant, but it relates to additional applications and bundling. But that's typically done on an annual basis.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. We haven't done anything just like some of the hardware vendors you saw recently, they talked about as a deadline of price. You kind of give the order before that. We have no deadline. So not of that -- any of the pricing type of stuff got pulled into our business in Q3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO.\nKeith Bachman: The question is, how are you thinking about mix in particular? And what I mean by that is, I think, Jay, you said about 60% of your new biz is from existing customers. Do you see that changing as perhaps new logos get more challenging? And/or do you see a different composition associated with the solution set, meaning VPN replacement has been a really strong business for the last couple of years. Is there any saturation there? Just any comments on how we should be thinking about mix. And finally, within the guidance, I also wanted to ask, Remo, you mentioned visibility is lower in the second half of the year, which I think is completely understandable. But did you take a heavier cut, so to speak, or a more prudent approach, shall we say, versus what you're seeing in the current macro environment as you thought about the second half of that guidance?\nJay Chaudhry: I'll start, Keith. By the way, regarding a mix, I think the 60% I said is upsell, 40% is new. It's not the other way around. So with that, we are [Technical Difficulty]. Now historically, we've grown our enterprise business very well. The large enterprise will come from there. As our business is getting bigger, our customer base is getting bigger. So upsell is getting bigger. Because the platform is bigger, more customers to sell to, the bigger platforms to sell to is naturally increasing our upsell percentage of the total business we're doing. And you'll see both, upside and new large customers. When it comes to lower end of the market that's relatively newer for us. We are largely focused on getting new logos in that market. Our demand gen channel programs are helping us to get more logos there. And our channel partners, sorry, are helping us with logo there. So, I think you'll see a combination. But Remo, you probably can give a little normal guidance, but I expect our upsell to go higher over time because our customer base is growing.\nRemo Canessa: Absolutely, Jay. I think the upsell will go above the 60%, which it was this past year, just for the reasons Jay mentioned. We've got 6,700 customers. And when you take a look at -- we've talked about a 6x opportunity to sell just the ZIA and ZPA at our last Analyst Day. That does not include workloads. So, another part of our business. So, significant opportunity to upsell to customers. Related to -- consideration related to second half, yes, that's why we gave the first half contribution of our total billings being at the midpoint, 42.5% versus 41.5%, which we had last year. So again, we're saying of our total guide of the 30%, 31% billings growth year-over-year, we expect to see 42% of that in the first half this year versus 41.5% last year. That's how we took it into account.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Congrats on another great quarter. I mean, obviously, the sales productivity metrics that we can follow from the outside looking remain super strong. I wonder if you could give us just more color on sort of what you're seeing there, particularly in terms of the time to ramp new reps, their productivity metrics. And as you think about just the forward guidance, obviously, you're talking about continuing to lean in on the go-to-market in terms of headcount. But when you think about what's implied in terms of guidance, what sort of productivity levels relative to what we have been seeing are baked in there?\nRemo Canessa: So, time to ramp is faster. I mean there's no doubt. And that's basically -- the market is more mature as well as our sales operation, our sales enablement group. We have an absolutely outstanding sales enablement group, which gets our sales reps basically trained very quickly. In addition to that, the channel -- as Jay talked about, the contribution of the channels of the marketplace, the cloud marketplace also, all those things basically are helping for these sales reps to ramp faster. Related to what's embedded in the guidance for fiscal '23 for sales rep productivity, we're expecting sales rep productivity to be flattish to down. The reason for that is basically, again, we talked about, we're still going to prioritize growth over operating profitability. But even with flattish to down sales productivity, we can still bring in about 150 basis points of operating margin expansion year-over-year, which is what our guidance is. Again, the model we have with the high gross margin and the high top line growth gives us the flexibility to what we feel we can do to make the right decisions to really capture this market.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. And if I may add, I think I understand the importance of operating profitability, especially in today's market. We'll definitely be mindful of that. Remo said more balanced growth and profitability.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude our conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you for your continued interest in period. I hope to see many of you at the upcoming sell-side events. Goodbye.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. We are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and full year. Revenue for the quarter was $318 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 19% of total revenue, growing 80% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions: Americas represented 52% of revenue, EMEA was 33% and APJ was 15%. APJ continues to be our fastest growing region with revenue growth of 88% year-over-year. For the full year, revenue was $1.09 billion, up 62% year-over-year. This is an acceleration from the 56% growth we delivered in fiscal 2021. Our total calculated billings in Q4 grew 57% year-over-year to $520 million, with billing duration comparable to a year ago and slightly above the midpoint of our normal 10 to 14 months range. We saw strong growth in our top five verticals: Finance, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Technology and Services. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 68% from one year ago to $2.607 billion. The current RPO is 49% of the total RPO. As a point of clarification, the total contract value of the five-year, $46 million award from a U.S. Federal government agency that Jay mentioned is not included in our RPO. RPO for this contract will be recognized as the individual task orders are received, which are 12-months in term length as is typical for our federal customers. Moving on to our product pillars, for the full year, emerging products, which include ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads, or what we used to call Cloud Protection, met our targets and contributed 14% to our total new business. Including our new CNAPP and deception offerings in the Zscaler for Workloads pillar, we expect emerging products to contribute high-teens percentage of our total new business in fiscal 2023. ZPA was 27% of our total new business in fiscal 2022, and grew as a mix between the two core ZIA and ZPA pillars. We have a large opportunity with all our pillars, and we will continue to innovate and expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in the Zero Trust security market. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which was again above 125% for the last seven quarters. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. We had 327 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 62% from 202 in the prior year. The continued strength in this metric speaks to our large enterprise focus and the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added 198 customers in the quarter paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the year at 2,089 such customers. Expanding our field engagement with smaller enterprises with 2,000 to 6,000 employees and the increased investments in our Summit Partner program are contributing to overall customer growth. Turning to the rest of our Q4 financial performance, total gross margin of 81.6% was up nearly 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 8% sequentially and 60% year-over-year to $221 million. Operating margin was 12% and free cash flow margin was 24%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around high-single digit percent of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.73 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Before providing our guidance, I would like to share a few thoughts about the framework for our business outlook in the current environment. Zscaler is operating from a position of strength. We are entering this fiscal year with a record pipeline and a large set of customer opportunities. We have confidence in the durability of our business model, with very high contribution margins after the initial land, and proven ability to retain and upsell to our enterprise customer base. With customers increasingly adopting the broader platform with long-term commitments, we plan to continue to invest in capturing our large market opportunity. As Jay mentioned, there was more deal scrutiny at the end of Q4, which resulted in business being more backend loaded. We think it's prudent to expect this higher level of review and scrutiny by our customers to continue given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook. While demand for the Zscaler platform remains very strong, if the business environment changes, our business model allows us to adapt quickly and to deliver on our operating profit and margin goals. In fiscal \u201823, in our guidance, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of approximately 150 basis points. Now, moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, and amortization of intangible assets. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $339 million to $341 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 47% to 48%; gross margins of approximately 80%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products will initially have lower gross margins than our core products, because we are more focused on time-to-market and growth rather than optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $37 million to $38 million. Net other income of $5 million. Income taxes of $2.5 million. Earnings per share of approximately $0.26, assuming 155 million fully-diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard which requires the use of if-converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes, you will need to add back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense and include 7.63 million shares to the fully-diluted share count. For the full-year fiscal 2023 we expect revenue in the range of $1.49 billion to $1.5 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 37%; calculated billings in the range of $1.92 billion to $1.94 billion or year-over-year growth of 30% to 31%. While we don't normally guide to quarterly billings, I want to remind you that we will have a difficult year-over-year comparison in Q1. In the year ago quarter, we had a one-off deal and multi-year invoices that resulted in billings duration at the high-end of our normal 10 to 14 months range. With that in mind, we expect Q1 \u201823 billings to grow approximately mid-30% year-over-year. We also expect our first half mix to be approximately 42% to 43% of our full year billings guide, which is higher than the first half mix in the last few years. Operating profit in the range of $173 million to $176 million. Income taxes of $14 million. Earnings per share in the range of $1.16 to $1.18, assuming approximately 157 million fully diluted shares. As noted earlier, to account for our convertible notes in EPS, you will need to add back $1.44 million in annual interest expense and include 7.63 million shares to the fully-diluted share count. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing. If we continue to have high growth, we will prioritize investing in the business. As we have discussed, if we are growing revenue faster than 30%, you can expect less than 300 basis points of margin expansion in the year. We remain confident of reaching 20% to 22% operating margins in the long-term. With a huge market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we're committed to investing aggressively in our company while balancing this with our operating profit goals. However, if we see a deteriorating global economic environment, we have the flexibility to place a higher priority on operating profitability. Operator, you may now open the call to questions. I'll take the first part, Andy. You're absolutely right. There's not much revenue in the quarter for that large deal. But your call-out also that it's not in the RPO is a great call-out also, which is what we've been talking about with RPO growth, it's better for Zscaler to look at billings growth because an entire $46 million or most -- almost all that $46 million is not in RPO. Now, I'll turn it over to Jay. Thanks, Brad. It is true that it takes more time and effort than new logos, especially when your current customers are very happy and delighted. That's why our business is coming from what size, expansion and new logos. And what are we trying to do to get new logos in current market? I'll tell you one very exciting thing which is very unusual. A bit for -- for new logos for us is when CXOs who frequently move from company A to company B, they often call us. I mean, I can tell you I've personally seen probably well over 100 -- probably a few hundred tests. The CXOs went, they called us. And once they do, the discussion -- the conversation goes a lot faster. In addition, we are doing a lot of demand gen program. A lot of demand-gen programs are doing to help our channel partners and the like are largely focused on new logos because we want to do both, new logos as well as upsell. Both are important for us. Second probably your question is where the budget is coming from to fund. Yes, we are driving transformation, but the nature of our transformation has been changing. First of all, before COVID, network transformation used to be a big problem. COVID killed all of that discussion and said the Internet is the corporate network. So network transformation evangelist has gone away. It's mainstream that you should be able to go and work for many do. Now, where is the budget coming from? Number one thing CIOs and CFOs are asking now is, please help me eliminate a lot of point products. Help me save money. So cost reduction by elimination is a big thing and especially a platform for wireline Zscaler, which can eliminate lots of products. We actually end up showing good ROI and in the process of getting a bigger budget sale. That's one part. The second part is, I highlighted in my prepared remarks that marketplace banks are helping us. Some of these large deals are actually coming out of our hyperscaler budgets because their revenues already commit for them. And it is true that customers are asking for better business value and quantification, and that's what we're doing with a very mature business value process. That's why you've seen us do very well in spite of increased group. Thank you. I mean, good questions. So the outperformance in gross margins in Q4, we did 81.6%. Basically, it's the efficiency that we've created with our software authorization and just overall lower cost, bandwidth cost, colo cost, depreciation as well as the outperformance on the top line. Those are the primary reasons. Key thing to recognize with our gross margin, we have the ability to come out with applications faster by putting basically applications in public cloud. We will continue to do that. Again, from our perspective, we are going to deliver the best products as quickly as we can to our customers. In our gross margin, we expect in fiscal '23 and also the midterm is 80%. From a long-term perspective, we expect gross margins between 78% and 82%. So, as long as we're within that bound, it just gives tremendous flexibility from a modeling perspective for Zscaler because we have such high gross margins with high growth to invest in the business. From a perspective of the $1.7 billion in cash, really no plans for that. It will be used for strategic purposes. We clearly don't need it for working capital as our free cash flow last year was significant. And also from a free cash flow perspective in fiscal '23, I'd expect free cash flow margin to be 20% or above. So really just for strategic purposes is that cash. No. I mean, I think it's a great question. I think it's one of the key questions, and thank you for asking it. We did see higher deal scrutiny in Q4. So, that played into our guidance. And that higher deal scrutiny related mostly to large, multiyear, multi-product pillar-type deals. As you mentioned, John, not a significant impact on our business. And from our perspective, when we took a look at our guidance, many customers have not put their budgets in place for calendar '23. That will happen in a few months or a couple of quarters. So, that does create a level of uncertainty in the second half of our fiscal \u201823. So, we took a look at all those factors in consideration when we did our guidance, and that is the reason that we guided for a higher contribution in the first half of our billings, between 42% and 43%. And that compares to last year, which was 41.5%. So, a lot of thought went into the guidance. We feel it's prudent. And also, again, we're recognizing that the second half of our fiscal year, there's -- we don't have as good a visibility. And that's why we have better visibility in the first half. Yes. I'll start then I'll have Jay. It's still relatively early. It's still relatively a small part of our business. But the cloud marketplace is increasing, and we do see it as a very important and strategic basically channel for us. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jay. It's a great question. We'll have to wait and see. I mean, you've got our guidance. When we give guidance, we would like to be prudent. However, when -- again, from my perspective, and you take a look at Zscaler, it was purpose-built for this world. The highest level of security, proxy-based, going down to SSL traffic. As Jay talked about, lower complexity. The number of security professionals in the world, there's a major need for it. And that's going to get worse, then lower cost. Again, we like to do our guidance, we like to be prudent, and we'll see how things play through. But I don't see any other -- well, I shouldn't say -- we are well positioned. Let's just say that we're well positioned as a company. Yes. I mean, when you take a look at the last two years, our free cash flow has been above 20%. When you take a look at our guidance that we gave for fiscal '23, it's the same. Basically, it should follow what have done in the last two years being over 20%. The value that Zscaler has, we're a very efficient company. Take a look at our cloud. Typically, our cloud capital expenditure or expenses are high single digits in any one quarter, which is relatively low. Our high gross margins, just our overall operating profitability. The key thing also with the -- our cash flow is that we typically bill annually. So, our billing range is between 10 and 14 months. So, it's just -- we're just in a really good position. It's a very efficient model. And again, looking at the last two years, I wouldn't expect anything different from a free cash flow margin perspective. And I would expect things to be similar, higher than 20%. From a headcount perspective, Gregg, you're absolutely right. It was a great year for us. It hit expansion in fiscal '22. What we talked about, we are excited about the opportunity. We feel the best interest for everyone to continue to prioritize growth but being mindful of operating profitability. We plan to continue to still prioritize growth going forward. But because of the leverage in our model, we're able to deliver -- we're planning to deliver 150 basis points, basically margin expansion. The reason for that that we're able to do that is that SaaS model with ratable revenue with the ARR balance, you've got pretty good visibility coming into the year. When you couple that with the high gross margins at 80%-plus, it just makes it a very attractive model for us to really manage our business. Right now, where we're at, we feel we have the right product at the right time, which addresses a significant need for our customers. We plan to invest across the board in the company. We're going to be investing in go-to-market, R&D and our cloud to really help customers navigate through this difficult time where they can lower their cost increase their security and basically decrease their complexity. So from my perspective, we will continue to prioritize growth and we will continue to hire. So, that is our plan for fiscal '23. Yes. I'll take that. ARPU has been increasing on a year-over-year basis. Our ARPU has increased 20%. Related to price increases, we typically do it on an annual basis. And really, it's related to additional applications and bundling. And with that, prices do go up, but they go up probably in the mid-single-digit-type range, nothing really significant, but it relates to additional applications and bundling. But that's typically done on an annual basis. Absolutely, Jay. I think the upsell will go above the 60%, which it was this past year, just for the reasons Jay mentioned. We've got 6,700 customers. And when you take a look at -- we've talked about a 6x opportunity to sell just the ZIA and ZPA at our last Analyst Day. That does not include workloads. So, another part of our business. So, significant opportunity to upsell to customers. Related to -- consideration related to second half, yes, that's why we gave the first half contribution of our total billings being at the midpoint, 42.5% versus 41.5%, which we had last year. So again, we're saying of our total guide of the 30%, 31% billings growth year-over-year, we expect to see 42% of that in the first half this year versus 41.5% last year. That's how we took it into account. So, time to ramp is faster. I mean there's no doubt. And that's basically -- the market is more mature as well as our sales operation, our sales enablement group. We have an absolutely outstanding sales enablement group, which gets our sales reps basically trained very quickly. In addition to that, the channel -- as Jay talked about, the contribution of the channels of the marketplace, the cloud marketplace also, all those things basically are helping for these sales reps to ramp faster. Related to what's embedded in the guidance for fiscal '23 for sales rep productivity, we're expecting sales rep productivity to be flattish to down. The reason for that is basically, again, we talked about, we're still going to prioritize growth over operating profitability. But even with flattish to down sales productivity, we can still bring in about 150 basis points of operating margin expansion year-over-year, which is what our guidance is. Again, the model we have with the high gross margin and the high top line growth gives us the flexibility to what we feel we can do to make the right decisions to really capture this market. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. I am very pleased to share our strong Q4 results to end another outstanding year. In the quarter, we delivered 61% revenue growth and 57% billings growth, as customers continued to embrace our Zero Trust Exchange platform to secure their digital transformation. We are delivering this strong growth while generating strong profitability. Our free cash flow margin was 24%, which was a record for Q4. While many Public SaaS companies are happy to get to Rule-of-40, we surpassed the Rule-of-80 for the quarter and for the full year. These outstanding results reflect the strong underlying unit economics of our business that has high-90% gross retention rate and over 80% gross margins. This is possible because of our differentiated service and purpose-built, multi-tenant cloud platform that scales efficiently. For the full year, our revenue grew 62% to $1.1 billion and billings grew 59% to $1.5 billion. We are seeing revenue growth across all products, industry verticals, market segments and geographies. Our platform is securing over 34 million users for over 6,700 customers, and we're making great progress towards our goal of protecting 200 million users. To reach our goal, we will continue to invest aggressively in growing our business and driving innovation, while focusing on operational efficiencies to drive the bottom line. Let me share with you some of my observations and how we plan to manage through the uncertain macro environment in fiscal \u201823. First, my conversations with hundreds of IT executives confirm that cybersecurity remains the number one IT priority and a top Board level issue. Independent CIO surveys confirm Zero Trust security and SASE will continue to be a top priority. Zscaler's proxy-based cloud platform is the best solution for tackling sophisticated cybersecurity challenges. In addition, the rise of hybrid work and the need for secure digital transformation are driving the demand for Zscaler. We believe periods of macro uncertainty can accelerate adoption of disruptive technologies like ours, which offer better security and user experience while substantially reducing cost and IT complexity. As the pioneer and recognized leader in Security Service Edge, we are well positioned to capture this ongoing market shift towards Zero Trust. Second, we address a $72 billion market, with significant new customer and upsell opportunities. Our superior architecture and proven experience delivering measurable outcomes at the CXO level, elevate us above the competitive noise. We drove 62% year-over-year growth in customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, ending with over 320 of these customers, including over 20 customers exceeding $5 million in ARR. We have a blueprint for delivering great value, which drives strong upsell for us. Approximately 60% of our new business comes from existing customers, and our net retention rate has again exceeded 125%, now for seven consecutive quarters. Happy customers buy more, and our net promoter score continues to exceed 70, which is more than 2 times the average NPS for SaaS companies. In addition, we expect our deep and wide platform together with our enviable customer base of large enterprises, to continue to drive upsells. As we have indicated before, we have a 6 times upsell opportunity with our existing customers just for our core ZIA and ZPA product pillars. Lastly, our consultative sales process plays a major role in our success and enables us to maintain a high-level of engagement with our customers, especially at the C-level. As part of this process, we produce CFO-ready business cases with ROI and payback periods calculated in collaboration with our customers. In Q4, as we saw more deals getting scrutinized, we delivered more of these business value assessments, which helped us close many large multi-year, multi-product pillar deals. We believe our adaptive sales process makes us resilient to changing business environment and will continue to drive our business. Looking forward, I am excited about fiscal \u201823 as we continue to win opportunities with new and existing customers. Increasingly, customers are buying ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together to deliver a complete Zero Trust solution for users. This accelerates our customers' transformation journey and makes us a critical partner for them. Let me discuss two such deals in Q4. In a new logo win, a Fortune 50 pharmaceutical company purchased ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all 145,000 employees. This deal started with a regional need to improve security without compromising user experience in China. With multiple data centers in China covering various regions with premium connectivity options, Zscaler has superior zero trust access for multi-nationals out of China. Next, this customer engaged us for global M&A IT integration and hybrid work use cases. Impressed with these results, they accelerated their company-wide zero trust adoption with us. They disqualified their incumbent next-gen firewall vendor who had no referenceable customer at the required scale for its SASE cloud VPN product. This customer understands that a VPN, either as an appliance or hosted in the cloud under any name, is not zero trust and is the biggest security risk. This customer also purchased Zscaler for Workloads for 10,000 workloads to enable multi-cloud, app-to-app connectivity to support their M&A strategy. This was a three-year, eight-figure deal for all four pillars of our platform: ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads, or what we used to call Cloud Protection. We closed this deal with AWS marketplace, which is becoming a larger channel for us. Next, one of our largest deals in the quarter came from a delighted Fortune 500 tech customer who deployed the entire Zscaler for Users offering including ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. This provided fast and direct access for users working from anywhere to applications in the data center or in the cloud. With dramatic improvements in user experience, employees were buzzing about the change. One employee slacked, and I quote, \u201cEvery morning I log into my machine, I'm thankful for Zscaler!\u201d This customer doubled their seats to 120,000 users and extended the commitment for another three years. Their journey with us started with a small M&A IT integration use case, which quickly expanded into a company-wide zero trust initiative. In less than two years, this customer's annual spend with Zscaler grew 13x to well over $10 million. Next, from a product perspective, we saw strong performance across all pillars of our platform. Our core pillars, ZIA and ZPA, have never been stronger, and we are excited about the rapid adoption of our emerging products: ZDX to manage digital user experience, and Zscaler for Workloads to secure servers and workloads. Emerging products contributed 14% of our new business in fiscal \u201822, and we expect continued growth in fiscal \u201823. We continue to innovate rapidly and expand our platform. At our Zenith Live conference in June, we launched Posture Control for public clouds as a fully integrated solution that correlates vulnerabilities and risks across CSPM, CIEM, and Infrastructure as Code scanning. In addition, we integrated our recently acquired deception technology into our platform and saw great adoption by our customers. This is an example of our highly targeted early-stage acquisition strategy shortening our time to market for new innovations and expanding our market opportunity. Let me highlight three deals that were driven by our emerging products: We won a seven-figure ACV with a government agency in Australia for ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, where ZDX accounted for approximately $1 million of the total ACV value. ZDX pinpoints and resolves performance issues in real-time by monitoring experience of every user, every network hop, and every application, regardless of their location. The customer said ZDX is a must-have, as it delivered immediate value by reducing troubleshooting time and improving employee productivity. In a seven-figure ACV upsell win, a Fortune 50 insurance company purchased ZPA Transformation bundle for Zero Trust Access to implement user-to-app segmentation. This customer understands that if a user connects to the network with an on-prem or cloud VPN, that's not zero trust. With this latest purchase, they plan to replace their legacy network security, including VPN, Network Access Control or NAC, network-based segmentation, and VDI infrastructure. They purchased Zscaler Deception to detect and intercept bad actors trying to infiltrate the network. Finally, a Global 500 financial services customer in APJ purchased Zscaler for Workloads for 36,000 workloads to complement their ZIA and ZPA services for users. With many apps running in AWS and Azure, they wanted to implement a Zero Trust architecture to prevent lateral threat movement and eliminate backhauling workload traffic through the data center for inspection. We reduced cost and complexity by eliminating the need for virtual firewalls and site-to-site VPN networks, while improving security and operational efficiency. Next, let me discuss the progress we are making in Federal vertical. We now have FedRAMP High authorization for ZIA, which together with ZPA, makes us the only cloud security service to have two products at the highest level of FedRAMP certification. In addition, ZPA is the only Zero Trust solution with DoD IL5 certification. These certifications are driving our federal business. In Q4, we added over 25 new Federal customers and over half of them purchased ZIA and ZPA together. Now, we have landed 10 of the 15 Cabinet-level agencies as customers, with plenty of opportunities for upsell at these large organizations. I want to highlight one federal deal that I'm particularly excited about: We were awarded a five-year, $46 million contract by a large cabinet agency with over 100,000 users. The value of this contract will be granted over time, based on deployment. Against this award, we received an initial low-seven-figure ACV task order for ZIA and ZPA. Next, let me comment on the increased leverage we're driving with our channel programs. We saw over 50% year-over-year growth in channel sourced-deal registrations. Working closely with our cloud-centric VAR partners, we are building momentum down-market in the Enterprise and Commercial segments, which is providing higher contribution to our new business. At RSA conference, you heard a key partner, Optiv, talk about their plans to grow with us and further invest in Zscaler certifications for their consultants. I'm also excited about the opportunities we can unlock together with the global SIs that are building large Zero Trust and SASE transformation practices. Moving to cloud marketplaces, this channel is growing very well for us. We have made strategic investments in our collaboration with AWS and Azure, including deep technology integrations, co-selling opportunities and demand generation programs. In Q4, our new business through cloud marketplaces grew nearly 5x year-over-year. For example, we signed five greater-than-$1 million deals through the AWS marketplace, including two of our top five new and upsell deals of the quarter. Our strengthening Azure and AWS partnerships also give us access to their customers' sizable cloud budgets which can streamline the deal close process. I want to highlight another important area for our customers, their ESG goals. Our highly efficient cloud eliminates the need for on-prem appliances, which significantly decreases IT waste, energy usage, and carbon emissions. We are also committed to our own ESG goals. Since achieving 100% renewable energy last year, we are proud to be Carbon Neutral for calendar \u201822, covering relevant Scope 1, 2, and 3 categories, including travel, customer use, public cloud use, and procurement. I am excited to announce our goal to be Net Zero by 2025, joining our customers in a collective effort to transition to a low carbon economy. In closing, even with uncertain macro conditions, we continue to see favorable demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform, which makes businesses more agile and competitive, simplifies IT, consolidates point products and reduces cost. We believe customers trust Zscaler more than any other provider for securing their cloud journey. We have grown our global team to approximately 5,000 employees who share a mission to secure the hyperconnected world of cloud and mobility. I am extremely proud of the strong growth and profitability we delivered in 2022. I want to thank our employees and our partners for their tireless efforts and commitment to our customers' success. We will continue to invest aggressively to delight our customers and capture the large opportunity ahead of us, while delivering operational excellence. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Good. So, regarding the deal, the nature and competitiveness, you can imagine that almost all federal deals need to go through a very competitive offer process. And all the obvious names you would expect were all competing, all legacy vendors, network security firewalls and the like. They all competed for it. But it was the architecture that won at the end of the day. So, we are excited about it. But as you know, some of these federal deals take time. We do have 10 of the 15 Cabinet-level agencies as our customers, and there's a lot of opportunity for us in the federal market. Thank you. We have actually many, many customers who have publicly stated in our conferences that the number of resources needed to one, operate Zscaler service is much sold. Often it's kind of -- fit all what it takes to run appliance companies, firewall companies and the like. So, that's part of the operational cost that you talk about. There are four pieces of cost that customer looks at from reduction from Zscaler. Operational is obviously one part of it. Cost savings from elimination of point products is an important area. You won't believe so many security products are sitting at any large enterprises. And one CISO called it appliance for peak. Our third area is improved business productivity, which is linked to user experience. It is interesting as users are working from everywhere accessing very critical information out in the cloud, users are very, how should I say, intolerant of any slowness and store experience. And fourth thing is risk reduction. It's hard to quantify risk, but our customers are looking and saying, \"What's the cost of breach? What's the cost of downtime and the like?\" So, we have always had a good business value assessment process. It has short book. And also when we work the C level and the C level becomes sponsor of the process, it helps us show them savings and it helps us get our deal done. Yes. Probably the direct answer would be, it is more and more need to do a strong assessment, quantification and commitment to delivering those results. Absolutely, yes. And if I may add on two things. I may ask two things we've done to make sure we do a good job. One is we are working more closely with our customers to identify what needs to go, what needs to change from a savings point of view. We are a lot more focused on helping customers save money because CIO is asking us, what can you do to save money? I have a lot of legacy debt products, please help. So, our sales process is focused more on that than it used to be before. That's one point. And the second, we alluded to it, but the business value assessment needs to be much sharper now than it used to be. Yes. It becomes a new channel of revenue for us. Over the -- let me put this way. In the past three years, it has gone from nothing to pretty significant. That's why from a small base, the numbers are looking big. But those big providers are now working with us and co-selling to considerate net new pipeline for us. That's good. The other part that's helping us, it's kind of interesting is some of these budgets are committed for hyperscalers on an annual basis. And our solutions qualify to become after those budgets. That becomes one more justification with a little bit easier budget approval becomes one more area for us. We are dedicating resources. We are making investment in this channel to become bigger. I mean, that's what I tell Remo. Come on, let's be more aggressive. Remo, go ahead. Yes. That's what I would say. I mean certain hard times obviously require a lot extra effort to make things happen. I would say with all the great things that are positioning us well, I expect us to do far better than first to the vendors out there. It's a very good question. So, if you think about our big product portfolio with ZIA and ZPA, we are essentially replacing all branch kind of devices or any of the firewall proxies and the like calculate it the first wave of the replacement out there. Number two, with ZPA, we are beginning to replace. Obviously, the VPN was a starting point. But think of the entire inbound DMZ that many customers have to deploy. That's the second point. So branch finals, branch proxies, all this stuff is number one. The cloud workload, with the announcement of the new solutions we have done with Zscaler for Workloads where zero trust is being brought to the cloud, and this is relatively new -- in the past 8 or 9 months. We have now quite a few customers who have no firewalls in the cloud. So typically, they buy a bunch of virtual firewalls in the cloud. We see, we like -- we think our customers will be firewall-free in the cloud. The third part is data sector. That's the slowest moving part. The data center, DMZ, all these boxes are very complicated. And we actually don't like to go and fight in that area because that area is kind of pretty clumsy and cluttered, and data centers are shrinking over time. I would rather put my focus on where the park is headed rather than the park is. So that's where we see a number of customers buying firewalls for data centers and the like because there's also a little bit of demand coming from the corporate side of it. But all the branches replace almost everything out there. Public cloud, early stage with very promising signs. And data center, we'll leave it alone for a while. Did I answer your question? I will start. We did good results in Q4. We are expecting good and healthy results for federal business in Q1. But we do know that federal business takes time. It has taken us years to get the very high-level certification coming, probably more painful than any other certification I've seen, but they're good ones. So they are positioning us well. But on the certification still is on us with smaller deal, and there's a lot of opportunity to expand. For example, 10 of the 15 Cabinet-level agencies we talked about, they have -- mostly, they've started small, plan give opportunity for us to expand. So, we are investing in these sources. Our pipeline is growing, and we have high expectations for our Fed business. Remo, if I may add, just to comment. We did well last year. We are [Technical Difficulty] this year. We have become the top destination for [Technical Difficulty]. I mean in R&D and in sales, we're probably the best organization to go. 6 to 9 months ago, some of these start-ups that are funded like nothing out there, they're all trying to hire people, they're all laying people off, and we are investing heavily in it. And by that way, we hired Brendan Castle, our new Chief People Officer. He comes from Google with a deep expertise in scaling talent acquisition and development. So very, very excited and bullish about the business opportunity. Yes. We haven't done anything just like some of the hardware vendors you saw recently, they talked about as a deadline of price. You kind of give the order before that. We have no deadline. So not of that -- any of the pricing type of stuff got pulled into our business in Q3. I'll start, Keith. By the way, regarding a mix, I think the 60% I said is upsell, 40% is new. It's not the other way around. So with that, we are [Technical Difficulty]. Now historically, we've grown our enterprise business very well. The large enterprise will come from there. As our business is getting bigger, our customer base is getting bigger. So upsell is getting bigger. Because the platform is bigger, more customers to sell to, the bigger platforms to sell to is naturally increasing our upsell percentage of the total business we're doing. And you'll see both, upside and new large customers. When it comes to lower end of the market that's relatively newer for us. We are largely focused on getting new logos in that market. Our demand gen channel programs are helping us to get more logos there. And our channel partners, sorry, are helping us with logo there. So, I think you'll see a combination. But Remo, you probably can give a little normal guidance, but I expect our upsell to go higher over time because our customer base is growing. Yes. And if I may add, I think I understand the importance of operating profitability, especially in today's market. We'll definitely be mindful of that. Remo said more balanced growth and profitability. Thank you for your continued interest in period. I hope to see many of you at the upcoming sell-side events. Goodbye."

Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report another strong quarter. In Q3, we delivered 63% year-over-year revenue growth, 54% billings growth and 15% free cash flow margins, all while investing for high growth. While most public SaaS companies are happy to get to Rule-of-40, we again exceeded the Rule-of-70 based on revenue growth and free cash flow margins. With our increased guidance today, we expect to achieve the Rule-of-80 for the full year. We are not only delivering excellent growth. We are also delivering strong profitability. We are disciplined in making investments for innovation and go-to-market scale. With the breadth and depth of our ever-expanding Zero Trust platform, we can efficiently sell to our growing base of enterprise customers. We believe our clear focus on securing large enterprises makes us the partner of choice for our customers' Zero Trust security journey. While there are broader macro challenges and economic uncertainties, we have seen an increase in large, multi-year commitments for multiple product pillars of Zscaler platform as periods of uncertainty can act as a catalyst for change. This, coupled with growing cyber threats such as ransomware, are driving IT leaders to transform security from castle-and-moat security to zero-trust architecture. In this environment, customers cannot risk transformational and mission-critical projects with immature offerings from unproven vendors. As the pioneer and category leader in Security Service Edge or SSE with the widest and deepest offerings, Zscaler is the trusted partner for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity and better cyber protection. We are adding new Global 2000 customers at a record pace. In the last two quarters, we added close to 80 G2K customers. Now 40% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of Global 2000 companies trust Zscaler to secure their digital transformation. Approximately half of our Global 2000 customers have both ZIA and ZPA, and I am excited to report that ZPA has surpassed over $200 million in annualized revenue. In Q3, we had significant growth in new $1-million plus ACV deals across major geographies and customer verticals. We are seeing an acceleration in multi-year, multi-product pillar deals as enterprises are racing to transform their business. We provide a path for large strategic customers to ramp into larger and longer commitments for our entire transformational platform, not just for elements of it. This is driving a strong growth in bookings, with the total value of our committed future revenue reaching a key milestone. It has surpassed $2 billion. Now, let me highlight some customer deal wins during the quarter. As I mentioned before, I believe all customers will ultimately purchase ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all users. This quarter, we have seen ample evidence that customers are buying ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together, providing Zero Trust security for users with fast user experience. In a new logo win, a global 500 food services conglomerate headquartered in Europe, purchased ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all 100,000 users. Leveraging our globally distributed SSE platform, this customer is consolidating dozens of different vendors point products across hundreds of locations in 45 countries. The customer was most excited about having a single Zero Trust security policy framework for in-line inspection across its business units in every location. Given the significant cost savings, upleveled security and improved user experience across the company, the CEO and CFO signed off on this non-budgeted, 4-year commitment. In addition, they started a paid pilot for our Zero Trust for Workloads offering for their sizable AWS footprint, which we are very excited about. Next, in an upsell deal, a Global 10 oil and gas customer headquartered in Europe, after deploying ZIA and ZPA for 100,000 users, purchased ZDX for all 100,000 employees. ZDX is delivering immediate value by reducing the customer\u2019s time to troubleshoot performance issues by 50% to 80%, while consolidating 40 legacy performance point products. In addition, the customer upgraded to our newly introduced ZPA Transformation bundle that includes browser isolation, application protection, and deception services. This is a 4-year deal that increased the customer\u2019s annual spend by over 70%. This customer\u2019s journey with Zscaler is remarkable: I remember sitting with the chief architect in their office, finalizing the purchase of our ZIA Professional bundle six years ago. Since then, their annual spend has increased over 14x to well over $10 million. Next, we look forward to working with them on Zero Trust for Workloads. In an upsell win, a Fortune 500 Bank in Asia that has deployed ZIA for over 50,000 users purchased ZPA and ZDX for all 50,000 employees. This is another example of a large customer buying ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all users. While the immediate objective for this deal was to replace a legacy multi-vendor VPN infrastructure, ZPA was selected to implement zero trust access by establishing an application-level policy, where users connect to specific applications, not to a network, hence achieving app segmentation without having to do legacy network segmentation. ZPA did not just replace VPN, it\u2019s eliminating the need for the entire inbound DMZ including DDoS protection, app delivery controllers, and firewalls, generating a payback on their Zscaler purchase within 6 months. Because of this substantial ROI, even in a tougher macro, Zscaler can help reduce cost while driving transformation. Our integration with Microsoft\u2019s E5 suite across ZIA and ZPA was also an important decision factor for them. This latest purchase more than doubled the customer\u2019s annual spend. ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together form a complete solution to implement Zero Trust for users. Our next immediate big opportunity is Zero Trust for workloads, powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. Let me highlight a few exciting wins in this area: An existing Fortune 100 financial services customer with ZIA deployed for 60,000 users, purchased Zero Trust for Workloads to protect 50,000 workloads spanning across multiple data centers and public clouds. This eliminates the need for virtual firewalls and site-to-site VPNs. This multi-million-dollar ACV deal is our largest workload deal to-date and more than doubles the customer\u2019s annual spend. The customer now protects both users and workloads under a single policy framework, enhancing their cyber protection, providing visibility and simplifying operations. Lastly, let me discuss a new customer purchasing all four product pillars together. An elite research university purchased our comprehensive ZIA, ZPA and ZDX offerings for 35,000 users and Zero Trust for Workloads for over 3,000 workloads for their multi-cloud environment. Their CIO\u2019s top priority is to eliminate the risk of legacy VPNs and lateral threat movement as universities are increasingly becoming a target for ransomware and intellectual property theft. Also, a critical requirement for this win was our Zero Trust platform meeting the criteria of Zero Trust framework as recommended by NIST. We closed this 3-year, 8-figure deal through AWS marketplace. I\u2019m very happy with our continued success in expanding our routes to market via cloud marketplaces. Next, I am excited to highlight U.S. Federal government where we\u2019re having considerable momentum. Driven in part by the President\u2019s Executive Order, we are seeing increased interest in our Zero Trust Exchange across all levels of the government. We are excited to help our country dramatically improve our security posture while significantly reducing legacy IT costs. We have the highest level of FedRAMP certifications for ZIA and ZPA. In addition, ZPA is the only Zero Trust solution with DoD IL5 certification. There are only a select few cloud companies that have this level of certification, and there is no other cybersecurity company at this level. IL5 certification is an important differentiator for us.  Let me highlight 2 new customer wins this quarter where this was an important factor: First, a defense contractor that purchased ZIA and ZPA in a 6-year seven-figure ACV deal. Second, a DOD unit also purchased ZPA for secure access to SAP instances in AWS Gov cloud. Two important considerations for our ongoing success in the Federal market are: First, ZPA is the only cloud security service with FedRAMP High authorization for Zero Trust Remote Access. We connect users to applications and not to the network, eliminating lateral threat movement, a core principle of zero trust architecture that can\u2019t be achieved by next gen firewalls or cloud VPNs. Second, ZIA\u2019s proxy architecture, which inspects TLS-encrypted traffic at scale delivering superior security. Our proven track record running the world\u2019s largest inline security cloud makes Zscaler the obvious and trusted partner of choice for governments and enterprises. We now have 288 customers exceeding $1 million in ARR, an increase of 77% year-over-year. We deliver a mission-critical service that requires unmatched reliability and availability for an in-line cloud. There is no compression algorithm for over 10 years of operational experience running such a cloud. An example of our proven scale is that Zscaler processes over 240 billion transactions inline per day, which is more than 20x the number of Google searches per day. Now, let me share a few observations about our high net retention rates, which has exceeded 125% for the last 6 quarters. We made a number of investments in customer success services, technical account managers, partner services, and certification of partners, which together are driving a faster and greater adoption across our broad portfolio. We have a solid blueprint for accelerating value delivery, which is driving upsells. All of these investments result in happy customers, demonstrated by our Net Promoter Score or NPS of more than 70, which is more than 2x that of an average SaaS company. Next let me now highlight our rapid pace of innovation. After having built the most comprehensive platform to provide Zero Trust for Users, we are now expanding it for Zero Trust for Workloads. Unlike scores of vendors who offer point-products for cloud native apps, Zscaler has developed a fully integrated CSPM, CIEM and Infrastructure-as-Code Scanning with a common backend and fully correlated, actionable dashboard. Gartner calls this functionality CNAPP, but we have moved beyond CNAPP by integrating the threat and data awareness from ZIA and ZPA. We will be highlighting it and other innovations at Zenith Live, our annual cloud summit next month. We enhanced our AI/ML engine for ZDX, our fastest growing new service, to leverage billions of telemetry points from millions of users to improve digital user experience. It can not only automatically figure out what and where performance issues are but can also provide information about the quality of voice, video and screen sharing due to our integration with Microsoft Teams and Zoom. We have also integrated ZDX with ServiceNow making customer end-user support far more efficient. ZDX also got certified and became available on our Federal cloud. Our ThreatLabZ security research team is tracking over a dozen APT groups and getting better reconnaissance about their tools and behavioral patterns resulting in higher order threat intelligence. This specific threat intel coupled with our massive cloud effect from 240 billion transactions and 300 trillion signals per day enables Zscaler to deliver better threat protection than other vendors. Moving beyond users and workloads, we are now bringing Zero Trust to IoT/OT systems, a large emerging opportunity. Today, Siemens and Zscaler announced the availability of an integrated all-in-one solution to accelerate secure access to OT systems. Our joint development with Siemens brings the benefits of Zscaler to factory and industrial control systems. We are thrilled to have Siemens, a long-standing customer, as a development and go-to-market partner. In closing, in spite of uncertain macro conditions, we continue to see strong demand for our services. We are in a strong financial position, and we will continue to aggressively invest in our business. We are focused on hiring and developing talent and creating a culture that rewards innovation at all levels. We have grown our global organization to approximately 4,500 employees who are energized by our shared mission to secure the hyperconnected world of cloud and mobility. We grew our total sales and marketing headcount by 54% year-over-year, and we remain focused on investing in our go-to-market machine. In today\u2019s competitive hiring market, Zscaler is a destination for top talent. To drive continued growth in hiring and to build on Zscaler\u2019s high-performing hybrid-work culture, this month, we welcomed Brendan Castle, Google\u2019s former global head of talent acquisition, as our new Chief People Officer. Brendan has proven experience in building highly motivated and productive teams at scale. With app transformation already mainstream, network and security transformation is also becoming mainstream, which we pioneered with our Zero Trust Exchange. We believe customers trust Zscaler more than any other provider for securing their cloud journey. Recent uncertainty in the macro environment is driving customers to accelerate their network and security transformation with our integrated platform, resulting in reductions in cost, complexity and business risk. We are adding a record number of Global 2000 customers, now with 30% of Global 2000 and 40% of Fortune 500 customers trusting Zscaler. These demanding customers are making large multi-year commitments to our platform. We are not just growing rapidly at any cost, we are also profitable and delivering efficient growth. We will continue our disciplined investment in innovation and growth to capture the large and growing opportunity ahead of us Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue for the quarter was $287 million, up 63% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, revenue growth exceeded 60% for the third straight quarter driven by strong customer demand for our Zero Trust platform. ZPA product revenue was approximately 18% of total revenue, growing 87% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our 3 major regions. Americas represented 52% of revenue, EMEA was 33% and APJ was 15%. APJ continues to be our fastest-growing region with revenue growth of 105% year-over-year.  Our total calculated billings grew 54% year-over-year to $346 million, with billing duration comparable to a year ago and above the midpoint of our normal 10 to14 months range. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 83% from one year ago to $2.216 billion. The current RPO is 49% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which was again above 125%. We had 288 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 77% from 163 in the prior year. I\u2019m very pleased with the pace at which we are adding these $1 million ARR customers: we increased by 37 customers in the quarter. The continued strength in this metric speaks to our large enterprise focus and the strategic role we play in our customers\u2019 digital transformation initiatives. We added 140 customers in the quarter paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the quarter at 1,891 such customers.  Turning to the rest of our Q3 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.6% was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 70% year-over-year to $204 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 71% compared to 68% in the year ago quarter, due to a partial return of T&E. Operating margin was 9% and free cash flow margin was 15%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around high-single digit percent of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.66 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.  Now, moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount and amortization of intangible assets.  We are once again increasing our guidance across all metrics. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $304 million to $306 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 54% to 55%; gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products, because we are more focused on time-to-market and growth rather than optimizing them for gross margins; operating profit in the range of $33 million to $34 million. We have more in-person events this quarter, including customer events, Zenith Live and RSA conferences; net loss on other income of $500,000; income taxes of $3 million; earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.21, assuming approximately 146 million to 147 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2022 we are increasing our revenue guidance to approximately $1.078 billion or year-over-year growth of 60%, increasing calculated billings to a range of $1.425 billion to $1.430 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 53%, increasing our operating profit to a range of $106 million to $108 million, increasing our earnings per share to a range of $0.64 to $0.65 assuming approximately 147 million to 148 million fully diluted shares; free cash flow of $215 million, reflecting free cash flow margin of approximately 20% for the full year. With a revenue growth outlook of 60% and free cash flow margin of 20%, we expect to operate at the Rule-of-80 for the full year. With customers increasingly adopting the broader platform with longer-term commitments, we plan to invest in capturing our large market opportunity. We have confidence in the durability of our business model, with very high contribution margins after the initial land and proven ability to retain and upsell to our enterprise customer base. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing, but we will continue to prioritize growth which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, employees, and customers. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski : Congrats on another amazing quarter. I wanted to ask about your federal demand. Jay, I think you said you saw you're seeing considerable momentum in the U.S. Federal this quarter or this -- which seems to be an uptick from Q2, where I think it was maybe one of the underperforming sectors. So just wondering if you could comment on maybe what changed and what caused that uptick in demand this quarter ahead of the usual budget flush in calendar Q3?\nRemo Canessa : Andrew, I'll start it last quarter, Q2, our federal was low single digit of new and upsell. And in Q3, it was mid-single digit, so definitely an uptick. Also, on a go-forward basis, we do see federal as being an important contributor to Zscaler. We feel that we're well positioned in the federal market. I'll let Jay speak more to that.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Andrew, as you know, President's executive order is to implement Zero Trust architecture, and it's well aligned it actually aligns with what we have done. To be success in federal, you need 2 things. One, you need the right architecture, Zero Trust, which we have. Two, unique FedRAMP certifications. And we have the highest FedRAMP certifications. And now there's a timing issue as well. White House issued a memo setting a timeline for agencies to achieve Zero Trust architecture within 2 years. These plans are being submitted and more budgets are becoming available. All of this is positive long-term development from our point of view. However, Fed opportunities always save time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham.\nAlex Henderson : Great. I've been listening to a lot of people trying to get into this Zero Trust market. And 1 of the things that really strikes me is highly differentiated is, one, the policy implementation mechanics are so radically different than what you're doing versus the traditional perimeter defense. And then second is the sharp increase in attacks that we're seeing in terms of encrypted traffic, received the report today talking about over a 300% increase in encrypted attacks over the last year. Can you talk to the relevance of those 2 data points or those 2 concepts relative to your platform? And how you solve that better than, say, alternative vendors? And in that context, can you just address Cloudflare's comments that they're getting more aggressive in this space?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, thank you, Alex. So first of all, Zero Trust implementation. People sometimes build a little VPN replacement they call it Zero Trust. What we built with Zscaler Private Access is a platform that replaces the entire inbound D&C. Literally, you need nothing between Zscaler and the workload and application running. And in fact, on top of that, we further expanded to a browser isolation, app protection, interior deception and EIM based policy that can help you do segmentation. It's because of that you're winning ZPA deals a big time. So that's 1 part. The second part was attacks. So first of all, for someone to attack, they need to find you. With our Zero Trust architecture, your applications hind behind Zscaler, they can\u2019t even find. And the next part of attacks is -- and this is impacted attacks. For that, you need a proper proxy architecture that actually terminate connection, look at the package and everything, decrypt them, find them and take care of them. For that, we have built a very, very highly scalable architecture that sets us apart, that scales like nothing else out there. So it's a combination of these things. With 10-plus years of experience running a massive in-line cloud is what sets us apart from others. Now regarding some of the competitors coming from CDN market are DDoS or DNS market, right, those guys generally have been focused on servers. We start focusing on users to start with. It takes a lot of time and experience to build our richness and breadth of functionality we have built with ZIA, ZPA and associated functionality. I think it will take a long, long time for someone to try to catch us. And we are setting. We are innovating at a very fast pace.\nOperator: Next, we have Hasma Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala : Just one question for Remo. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on how you're thinking about the margin trajectory going forward? It seems like you want to continue hiring against the market opportunity that you're seeing. Zscaler has obviously been more of a destination for talent in the last couple of years. And particularly the incentive structure around the stock, a lot of employees have done well. How are you thinking about that incentive structure between cash and stock going forward, given that we're probably going to be in a more difficult equity market in general and just the pace of hiring relative to what you've done in the last couple of years?\nRemo Canessa : There are a lot of questions Yes. Yes. Let me see if I can go through and just kind of give you my view and maybe Jay can tell that also. We -- currently, we're at the Rule-of-80. That's what we're projecting for this year. And the way we define the Rule-of-80 is our revenue growth and also free cash flow margin. Our free cash flow margin this year, we're projecting to be 20%. It was 20% last year. So we're in a unique position to really take advantage of this market opportunity because we've got significant cash flow coming into the company as well as we're in the early stages of this market. So we're going to continue to make investments as we go forward. Those investments are going to be across the board throughout the organization, and we're going to -- and our goal is to get to a $5 billion ARR company. So we're building the infrastructure in place to do that. And related to employees and incentives with the stock options and just cash incentives, the cash incentives that we talked about on the last call related to the frothy environment, last quarter with a lot of start-up companies and companies or PE-backed companies having really big packages. So we adjusted our merit to reflect to get our employees at market levels. So from a cash compensation perspective, we're in pretty good shape. Regarding stock. Stock, all companies basically have decreased stock prices and -- what we're doing is we're taking a look at that. No decisions made at this point regarding what we're going to do from a stock perspective. But what I can say is our stock-based compensation as we go forward, will decrease as a percentage of revenue. What happens is that when you get to a certain scale as a company and a very large company, their stock-based compensation becomes -- goes down. We'll follow the same path as the large companies, you'll see our stock base coming down over a period of time. Regarding the pace of hiring, -- and again, we're seeing all the things that you're seeing related to the global macro environment. We're not seeing it. From our perspective, we are strategic for our customers. As Jay talked about, our deal sizes are getting large. Our strategic nature and our engagement with our customers is increasing. So our plan is to continue the pace of hiring. And if we can increase the pace of hiring, we will.  Now regarding color to -- related to operating profitability and also growth. We'll put growth because, number one, we are mindful. Jay and I are mindful of operating profitability in world school, quite frankly, we look at the bottom line. So we see -- we see a huge market opportunity, huge we feel we're the leader in that market. We will continue to invest, and we'll do it on a prudent basis that we feel is the best interest of our shareholders and our employees.\nJay Chaudhry: If I may add 2 quick comments to what Remo said, with very high gross margins and unit economics, it becomes easier for us to invest in businesses. Secondly, the hiring environment has -- is actually getting easier. We are hearing of high-flying companies that raise funding and multibillion-dollar valuations last year, they're starting to lay off people or freeze hiring, and companies that are spending to grow at any cost are now starting to slow down. So we will keep on accelerating our plan because our customers want to leverage Zscaler, to accelerate their transformation because they want to be competitive NHI.\nOperator: And next, we have Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg : Congrats. Jay, what really stood out to me was the success in large deals and multiproduct sales. I think especially impressive given the partner momentum in some of these large deals. Can you talk about the importance of hyperscalers? I believe you called out on an 8-figure deal. Is there more -- is there even more that you guys can do to drive even faster partner contribution? Because it really does feel like that flywheel is really kicking in well?\nJay Chaudhry : Yes. So the partner momentum comes from 2 sides. One is partners like Microsoft, who have been helping us even without fulfilling through marketplace. That momentum has been leveraged for the last several years. Now it has extended over AWS quite a bit. So that's 1 area. The second area is being able to deliver orders through cloud marketplace. It is 1 more channel for us to revenue. Our business through both AWS and Azure has been steadily growing, and these current viewed as a part of a clone transformation solution. So when it's focal through a marketplace channel, it often comes out of an annual cloud spend that's already committed by the customer with a hyperscaler. So that makes it actually easier in many ways. In Q3, with 1 of our largest deals through AWS marketplace. And if you recall, we did a very large deal last quarter through Azure Marketplace, and we are training AWS and Microsoft sales teams. And I think there's a good opportunity to create more leverage. And these are generally larger deals. So you've seen our momentum in larger deals in the last 2 quarters, we have added almost 80 Global 2000 companies to our portfolio. I mean that's pretty remarkable, and we don't see any slowdown.\nOperator: Next, we have Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank.\nPatrick Colville : Thank you so much for having me on and echo everyone else's congratulations on a very impressive set of numbers. My question is on the billings guide, which to me was probably the standout metric of the quarter. So I think above probably where many investors were expecting, so very healthy there. Can you just talk to what you guys are seeing in the pipes for fiscal fourth quarter and the health that I guess you underline the confidence to give that strong billings guidance for the fiscal year.\nRemo Canessa : Yes. I'll start it. And Jay, if you'd like to contribute anything. We have a strong pipeline. As we talked about, we're becoming more strategic. Our deal sizes are getting bigger. We review our pipeline with our sales organization. And based on our projections, we did give a strong guide, Patrick, which is basically up 6%, basically guide up. The key thing is that with the world that's changed with in this way for a while with applications in the cloud and users removal and workloads both in the cloud and on-prem and other locations, platform Zscaler created really addresses this market head on. Also, the efficiency that we create for customers at a very attractive ROI. It's really what stands out. And so we're seeing with large customers that adopting more of the platform, as Jay has talked about, we're seeing that. So it is basically a review of the pipeline and review what we feel we're comfortable to guide to.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So I think what Remo said, our projections always take into account our pipeline, our customer engagements. But at a qualitative level, as I talked to lots and lots of CIOs and CSOs, I mean there is a sense of uncertainty out there. And they're beginning to think about how do I do my cost and complexity reduction by consolidation. And that's where we start becoming pretty important. And for that, customers are driving transformation. We help them with it. On top of that cyber is a big issue. So when you bring all these things together, we become more important for them, and they start a discussion with, Jay, what all security products and networking products can I replace with you? And now, we are able to actually talk about a bigger set of products that need to be removed, which actually leads to a bigger part of platform to be bought. Now on top of that, it's interesting to see certainly on the high-flying private start-up companies, which would talk about all kinds of different hiring, how many employees, all that stuff is getting tempered down. That means the unnecessary noise in the market, it's expected to slow down. And it's fascinating to see people calling us from those start-ups already. So we are bullish about the business.\nOperator: Next, we have Joel Fishbein of Truist.\nJoel Fishbein : I'll echo the congrats on the great execution this quarter. Jay, I just want to ask about workload segmentation. It sounds like your -- I know it's early days. You're very excited about it and have some good uptake. I'm really interested in go-to-market around workload segmentation and actually IoT and OT. It doesn't seem like they're natural -- they have different buying centers inside of organizations than ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. Love to hear how you're going to plan to go to market there and increase deal sizes around those specific areas.\nJay Chaudhry: Very good question. In Q2, we talked about how a number of our large customers are beginning to buy Workloads, our Zero Trust of Workloads, but at a small scale. This last quarter, we start to see them actually buying some very large orders in this area. So that's very encouraging now. In terms of the buyer and the products, the Cloud Protection products can be put in 2 broad buckets. One, what Gartner now called CNAPP is a collection of CSPM, CI and type of stuff. It's API-based security. It's a new area for everyone. It's a simple to build, and we have a very good offering in that space. We revamped our CNAPP offering, which we'll be launching at Zenith Live next month. And parallel with that is Zero Trust workload, which is taking ZIA and ZPA technology and making it available for workloads because at flows need to talk to Internet that goes through ZIA engine. They need to talk to each other, which goes to ZPA engine. This is bringing Zero Trust to workloads. Bringing the 2 together, in-line piece of it and API piece of it sets us apart from any other vendor in the market out there.  Regarding buying centers, if you really look at it, if we were selling at a lower level, buying will be very different. No matter what -- who buys the product, when it comes to security part, CSO is definitely involved. So our good relationship CSO are helping us with Zero Trust, with Workload and Cloud Protection. Our relationship with Head of Networking are helping us because in the old world, you are extending your data center to cloud with all these dedicated links out there. The area we are developing and building more relationship is the DevOps side of it. But since CSO relations are strong, it is helping us. We are not creating an overlay team, but we do have product specialist. You need overlay teams when you're selling point products at low level. When we have been selling platform at a high level, I don't need overlay teams. I do need product specialists, which we are hiring to work with our broad sales team. Did that help?\nOperator: And next, we have Fatima Boolani of Citi.\nFatima Boolani : Remo, this one is for you. In Jay's script, a lot of anecdotes around the multi-land transactions in the 8-figure deal momentum in the $1 million customer momentum. So what I wanted to ask you was just from a booking standpoint, I think you've called out that you are seeing a bigger multi-year commitments from some of your customers. So we're certainly not seeing that impact on billings in terms of your invoicing duration. But I'm curious if you can comment or share any sort of observations on your backlog? And if there's any duration impact in there that we should be thinking about more critically?\nRemo Canessa : Yes. That's a great question. If you take a look at our RPO and CRPO growth on a year-over-year basis. Those are committed deals. Our RPO growth was 83% and our CRPO growth was 75%. Related to duration, the duration was comparable on a year-over-year basis. There's no headwinds. We expect duration to be in that 10 to 14 months range. So I mean, the key things from billings. Billings is calculated billings, which is calculated off of deferred revenue. So that's what we actually build. But we look at the RPO and CRPO growth rates, RPO is 83% and CRPO at 75% growth rate on a year-over-year basis. Now having said that, even though those metrics are outstanding, we still feel that billings is the best measure for Zscaler because we found that duration period from 10 to 14 months. That's -- so I hope that answers your question. I believe that answers your question. But the actual commitment that customers are making to Zscaler is quite impressive.\nJay Chaudhry: And Remo, if I may add one thing. This is an outstanding quarter from lots of customers doing multi-product pillar deals for multi-years, which is very exciting.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research.\nBenjamin Bollin : Good afternoon, I wanted to go back to the topic around cloud marketplaces. Remo, can you quantify how much of the business is being transacted over cloud marketplaces today or how that has evolved? And then also interested in any way we should think about the margin implications of that business versus other sales channels?\nRemo Canessa : Yes. I mean not much business currently going through cloud new marketplace. There is business going through, but we see that as a very important channel for us. And related to margin, we expect good margins through a flat marketplace. Jay, if you want to?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. But one thing that business through cloud marketplaces has been steadily growing over time. So that is very good. For us, I don't think the driver is what's the fulfillment channel for us. I personally care about partners who actually helped me with strategic sales to the customer. When Microsoft accounting cancer able to sit together with the CIO and talk through a large deal. It is extremely useful. But it does help to get cloud hyperscaler sales team more engaged because they actually do compensate it for the business that flows through the channel part -- through cloud marketplace. So we actually are putting more focus on training AWS and Microsoft sales team, so which helps them and helps us.\nOperator: And next, we have Tal Liani of Bank of America.\nTal Liani : I have 2 questions. One, in general, but I'm trying -- I get this question along from investors. I'm trying to understand economic slowdown, what's the impact on your business? It's a little bit of a philosophical question, but it's a question we're being asked a lot, and I would like to hear your view on this topic. And second, we are at times of focus on cash flow and margins. And I look at your operating margin in the last 4 quarters, -- it went down from 13% to 8.7% in the previous quarter, this quarter slightly recovered. And at the same time, your revenues went up by 50%, give or take. So we don't see much leverage on the margin. And the question is if I pass forward 2 to 3 years, if I think about margin leverage and what needs to happen for you to have serious margin upside. Can you talk about the pros and cons of your operating margin?\nRemo Canessa : I'll start with that. We absolutely do have leverage in the model. In a SaaS model with 80% gross margin, growing at the scale that we're growing we absolutely have no leverage. What we talked about is that with this large market opportunity, it would be a disservice to our shareholders and our employees if we try to drive top line operating profitability at this stage. Having said that, when you take a look at our free cash flow margin, last year, it was around 20% or over 20%. And we're projecting free cash flow margin this year at 20%. So when you have that kind of free cash flow margin at the scale that we are, making the investments that we're making in the position that we are as a company in this very large market, there's no better use of our cash for our resources than investing in the business and really executing and trying to drive our top line growth. Having said that, we will be mindful, we will be mindful. If we wanted to drive operating profitability, it doesn't take much. But with our free cash flow margin where it is, we're very, very comfortable. Now from an economic slowdown perspective, Security is important. Companies basically are knocking out the attacks are going to keep coming, and they're probably going to increase. Also, companies going through this downturn have to find areas to save money. We are efficient. Our ROI is absolutely outstanding. It is significant ROI with the highest level of security down to the deepest level. And so from an economic slowdown perspective, we are not seeing it currently. Now can that change? It can. But right now, based on our pipeline, based on what we're seeing, and what we talked about, we're going to continue to hire at pace. Jay and I, as I mentioned before, have a lot of experience. We've been -- we've seen the 3 downturns -- 3 or 4 downturns actually in our lifetime, our careers. Zscaler is different and we feel we're in a great position. We will take things into account all things but -- and driving operating profitability at this stage, it's really -- we will increase operating profitability as we go. But we're going to be also trying to drive that top line growth. Jay?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Two quick comments. First of all, I do believe there's uncertainties helping us because we are going to help customers with cost reduction and complexity reduction. And on the other side, our flagship CIC products, they have reached significant scale and are generating good margins. But we are reinvesting that to drive the growth of new products. We have proven that when we brought ZPA on, we made it successful. We've seen -- we brought ZDX on. We're making it successful. It's growing even faster than ZPA did, and we have high expectations from Workload Protection as well. So I think with such a large platform, we expect that we'll keep on growing fairly efficiently.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Boyd of UBS Securities.\nRoger Boyd : Congrats on the results. Just a quick question on SD-WAN. Historically, you've had some success tied to adoption there. I know Zscaler agnostic to how customers ultimately onboard to the Zero Trust Exchange. But with some of the SD-WAN vendors facing some disruption in share losses and potential change of ownership. How do you think about those changes in terms of potential opportunities or risks?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Before COVID came in, Zscaler used to start with, let's do network transformation. When COVID started 2.5 years ago, SD-WAN went out the door, there's nobody working in the branch offices and customers start to roll out Zscaler by downloading a lightweight agent and here it goes. So with that, the role of any network or SD-WAN became really insignificant. Today, most of our customers roll it out or lapped our mobile with a lightweight agent they can work from home, they can work from office with SD-WAN, without SD-WAN. So we'll stay neutral to supporting SD-WAN vendors. Our sales processes are no longer led by SD-WAN. If a customer sales on rolling on SD-WAN, we are generally the preferred choice, and that's how we see it. So we don't really see any changes in the SD-WAN marketplace impacting us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research.\nJoshua Tilton : I don't believe you mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but can you talk about any impact to the business you're seeing either positive or negative from the Russia Ukraine prices?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Russia, Ukraine. It was a bigger thing a quarter ago. I decided years ago not to sell in Russia. Hence, we do not have any revenue exposure in Russia or Ukraine, but cybersecurity is a global threat. It's not a regional at -- our threat research team is tracking heightened cyber cat environment, which is making every CIO and CSO more nervous in this area. So this is driving the adoption of Zero Trust architecture and it is increasing our engagement with customers. More so in Europe, actually European customers are more worried about it, while Americans are, too. So we have some very large deals in Europe this quarter, including a couple of them I highlighted. We don't really see any negative impact of this conflict and we remain engaged with our customers to drive the transformation. They want to become agile, competitive, play a role there and then cyber on top of that. So I don't see any negative impact.\nOperator: The next question shall come from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens : I wonder if you guys could drill into the Siemens partnership a little bit. And I guess, Jay, more broadly, what you see as the opportunity in OT from where you sit?\nJay Chaudhry: OT plants and factories have been slow in changing typically plans take their own time, but all these critical infrastructure attacks and some threats have made it a priority. Vendors like Sims are big providers of 4P systems out there. They see this as an opportunity for really providing or should I say, taking fiber and VPN based security of OT systems to zero trust-based security, where you no longer connect these OT networks and IT networks where you no longer need remote VPN to access the systems. So Siemens has worked with us over the last year or so. They essentially chose us as a partner, we did joint development where we made our technology available on their hardened OT systems, and this combined solution of Siemens and ours is now available through our customers' office. I think it's a good opportunity for us. I think it's a matter of time when all IoT OT systems will embrace Zero Trust, and we are positioned well for that opportunity.\nOperator: And this concludes today's Q&A session. I would turn the conference back over to your CEO, Jay Chaudhry, for closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. I want to thank you all for your continued interest in Zscaler. I also want to thank Zscaler employees, customers and partners for delivering a strong quarter. We look forward to seeing many of you at Zenith Live, our annual cloud summit. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue for the quarter was $287 million, up 63% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, revenue growth exceeded 60% for the third straight quarter driven by strong customer demand for our Zero Trust platform. ZPA product revenue was approximately 18% of total revenue, growing 87% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our 3 major regions. Americas represented 52% of revenue, EMEA was 33% and APJ was 15%. APJ continues to be our fastest-growing region with revenue growth of 105% year-over-year.  Our total calculated billings grew 54% year-over-year to $346 million, with billing duration comparable to a year ago and above the midpoint of our normal 10 to14 months range. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 83% from one year ago to $2.216 billion. The current RPO is 49% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which was again above 125%. We had 288 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 77% from 163 in the prior year. I'm very pleased with the pace at which we are adding these $1 million ARR customers: we increased by 37 customers in the quarter. The continued strength in this metric speaks to our large enterprise focus and the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added 140 customers in the quarter paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the quarter at 1,891 such customers.  Turning to the rest of our Q3 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.6% was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 70% year-over-year to $204 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 71% compared to 68% in the year ago quarter, due to a partial return of T&E. Operating margin was 9% and free cash flow margin was 15%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around high-single digit percent of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.66 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.  Now, moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount and amortization of intangible assets.  We are once again increasing our guidance across all metrics. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $304 million to $306 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 54% to 55%; gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products, because we are more focused on time-to-market and growth rather than optimizing them for gross margins; operating profit in the range of $33 million to $34 million. We have more in-person events this quarter, including customer events, Zenith Live and RSA conferences; net loss on other income of $500,000; income taxes of $3 million; earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.21, assuming approximately 146 million to 147 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2022 we are increasing our revenue guidance to approximately $1.078 billion or year-over-year growth of 60%, increasing calculated billings to a range of $1.425 billion to $1.430 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 53%, increasing our operating profit to a range of $106 million to $108 million, increasing our earnings per share to a range of $0.64 to $0.65 assuming approximately 147 million to 148 million fully diluted shares; free cash flow of $215 million, reflecting free cash flow margin of approximately 20% for the full year. With a revenue growth outlook of 60% and free cash flow margin of 20%, we expect to operate at the Rule-of-80 for the full year. With customers increasingly adopting the broader platform with longer-term commitments, we plan to invest in capturing our large market opportunity. We have confidence in the durability of our business model, with very high contribution margins after the initial land and proven ability to retain and upsell to our enterprise customer base. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing, but we will continue to prioritize growth which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, employees, and customers. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Andrew, I'll start it last quarter, Q2, our federal was low single digit of new and upsell. And in Q3, it was mid-single digit, so definitely an uptick. Also, on a go-forward basis, we do see federal as being an important contributor to Zscaler. We feel that we're well positioned in the federal market. I'll let Jay speak more to that. There are a lot of questions Yes. Yes. Let me see if I can go through and just kind of give you my view and maybe Jay can tell that also. We -- currently, we're at the Rule-of-80. That's what we're projecting for this year. And the way we define the Rule-of-80 is our revenue growth and also free cash flow margin. Our free cash flow margin this year, we're projecting to be 20%. It was 20% last year. So we're in a unique position to really take advantage of this market opportunity because we've got significant cash flow coming into the company as well as we're in the early stages of this market. So we're going to continue to make investments as we go forward. Those investments are going to be across the board throughout the organization, and we're going to -- and our goal is to get to a $5 billion ARR company. So we're building the infrastructure in place to do that. And related to employees and incentives with the stock options and just cash incentives, the cash incentives that we talked about on the last call related to the frothy environment, last quarter with a lot of start-up companies and companies or PE-backed companies having really big packages. So we adjusted our merit to reflect to get our employees at market levels. So from a cash compensation perspective, we're in pretty good shape. Regarding stock. Stock, all companies basically have decreased stock prices and -- what we're doing is we're taking a look at that. No decisions made at this point regarding what we're going to do from a stock perspective. But what I can say is our stock-based compensation as we go forward, will decrease as a percentage of revenue. What happens is that when you get to a certain scale as a company and a very large company, their stock-based compensation becomes -- goes down. We'll follow the same path as the large companies, you'll see our stock base coming down over a period of time. Regarding the pace of hiring, -- and again, we're seeing all the things that you're seeing related to the global macro environment. We're not seeing it. From our perspective, we are strategic for our customers. As Jay talked about, our deal sizes are getting large. Our strategic nature and our engagement with our customers is increasing. So our plan is to continue the pace of hiring. And if we can increase the pace of hiring, we will.  Now regarding color to -- related to operating profitability and also growth. We'll put growth because, number one, we are mindful. Jay and I are mindful of operating profitability in world school, quite frankly, we look at the bottom line. So we see -- we see a huge market opportunity, huge we feel we're the leader in that market. We will continue to invest, and we'll do it on a prudent basis that we feel is the best interest of our shareholders and our employees. Yes. I'll start it. And Jay, if you'd like to contribute anything. We have a strong pipeline. As we talked about, we're becoming more strategic. Our deal sizes are getting bigger. We review our pipeline with our sales organization. And based on our projections, we did give a strong guide, Patrick, which is basically up 6%, basically guide up. The key thing is that with the world that's changed with in this way for a while with applications in the cloud and users removal and workloads both in the cloud and on-prem and other locations, platform Zscaler created really addresses this market head on. Also, the efficiency that we create for customers at a very attractive ROI. It's really what stands out. And so we're seeing with large customers that adopting more of the platform, as Jay has talked about, we're seeing that. So it is basically a review of the pipeline and review what we feel we're comfortable to guide to. Yes. That's a great question. If you take a look at our RPO and CRPO growth on a year-over-year basis. Those are committed deals. Our RPO growth was 83% and our CRPO growth was 75%. Related to duration, the duration was comparable on a year-over-year basis. There's no headwinds. We expect duration to be in that 10 to 14 months range. So I mean, the key things from billings. Billings is calculated billings, which is calculated off of deferred revenue. So that's what we actually build. But we look at the RPO and CRPO growth rates, RPO is 83% and CRPO at 75% growth rate on a year-over-year basis. Now having said that, even though those metrics are outstanding, we still feel that billings is the best measure for Zscaler because we found that duration period from 10 to 14 months. That's -- so I hope that answers your question. I believe that answers your question. But the actual commitment that customers are making to Zscaler is quite impressive. Yes. I mean not much business currently going through cloud new marketplace. There is business going through, but we see that as a very important channel for us. And related to margin, we expect good margins through a flat marketplace. Jay, if you want to? I'll start with that. We absolutely do have leverage in the model. In a SaaS model with 80% gross margin, growing at the scale that we're growing we absolutely have no leverage. What we talked about is that with this large market opportunity, it would be a disservice to our shareholders and our employees if we try to drive top line operating profitability at this stage. Having said that, when you take a look at our free cash flow margin, last year, it was around 20% or over 20%. And we're projecting free cash flow margin this year at 20%. So when you have that kind of free cash flow margin at the scale that we are, making the investments that we're making in the position that we are as a company in this very large market, there's no better use of our cash for our resources than investing in the business and really executing and trying to drive our top line growth. Having said that, we will be mindful, we will be mindful. If we wanted to drive operating profitability, it doesn't take much. But with our free cash flow margin where it is, we're very, very comfortable. Now from an economic slowdown perspective, Security is important. Companies basically are knocking out the attacks are going to keep coming, and they're probably going to increase. Also, companies going through this downturn have to find areas to save money. We are efficient. Our ROI is absolutely outstanding. It is significant ROI with the highest level of security down to the deepest level. And so from an economic slowdown perspective, we are not seeing it currently. Now can that change? It can. But right now, based on our pipeline, based on what we're seeing, and what we talked about, we're going to continue to hire at pace. Jay and I, as I mentioned before, have a lot of experience. We've been -- we've seen the 3 downturns -- 3 or 4 downturns actually in our lifetime, our careers. Zscaler is different and we feel we're in a great position. We will take things into account all things but -- and driving operating profitability at this stage, it's really -- we will increase operating profitability as we go. But we're going to be also trying to drive that top line growth. Jay?"

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. We are pleased to report another strong quarter. In Q3, we delivered 63% year-over-year revenue growth, 54% billings growth and 15% free cash flow margins, all while investing for high growth. While most public SaaS companies are happy to get to Rule-of-40, we again exceeded the Rule-of-70 based on revenue growth and free cash flow margins. With our increased guidance today, we expect to achieve the Rule-of-80 for the full year. We are not only delivering excellent growth. We are also delivering strong profitability. We are disciplined in making investments for innovation and go-to-market scale. With the breadth and depth of our ever-expanding Zero Trust platform, we can efficiently sell to our growing base of enterprise customers. We believe our clear focus on securing large enterprises makes us the partner of choice for our customers' Zero Trust security journey. While there are broader macro challenges and economic uncertainties, we have seen an increase in large, multi-year commitments for multiple product pillars of Zscaler platform as periods of uncertainty can act as a catalyst for change. This, coupled with growing cyber threats such as ransomware, are driving IT leaders to transform security from castle-and-moat security to zero-trust architecture. In this environment, customers cannot risk transformational and mission-critical projects with immature offerings from unproven vendors. As the pioneer and category leader in Security Service Edge or SSE with the widest and deepest offerings, Zscaler is the trusted partner for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity and better cyber protection. We are adding new Global 2000 customers at a record pace. In the last two quarters, we added close to 80 G2K customers. Now 40% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of Global 2000 companies trust Zscaler to secure their digital transformation. Approximately half of our Global 2000 customers have both ZIA and ZPA, and I am excited to report that ZPA has surpassed over $200 million in annualized revenue. In Q3, we had significant growth in new $1-million plus ACV deals across major geographies and customer verticals. We are seeing an acceleration in multi-year, multi-product pillar deals as enterprises are racing to transform their business. We provide a path for large strategic customers to ramp into larger and longer commitments for our entire transformational platform, not just for elements of it. This is driving a strong growth in bookings, with the total value of our committed future revenue reaching a key milestone. It has surpassed $2 billion. Now, let me highlight some customer deal wins during the quarter. As I mentioned before, I believe all customers will ultimately purchase ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all users. This quarter, we have seen ample evidence that customers are buying ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together, providing Zero Trust security for users with fast user experience. In a new logo win, a global 500 food services conglomerate headquartered in Europe, purchased ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all 100,000 users. Leveraging our globally distributed SSE platform, this customer is consolidating dozens of different vendors point products across hundreds of locations in 45 countries. The customer was most excited about having a single Zero Trust security policy framework for in-line inspection across its business units in every location. Given the significant cost savings, upleveled security and improved user experience across the company, the CEO and CFO signed off on this non-budgeted, 4-year commitment. In addition, they started a paid pilot for our Zero Trust for Workloads offering for their sizable AWS footprint, which we are very excited about. Next, in an upsell deal, a Global 10 oil and gas customer headquartered in Europe, after deploying ZIA and ZPA for 100,000 users, purchased ZDX for all 100,000 employees. ZDX is delivering immediate value by reducing the customer's time to troubleshoot performance issues by 50% to 80%, while consolidating 40 legacy performance point products. In addition, the customer upgraded to our newly introduced ZPA Transformation bundle that includes browser isolation, application protection, and deception services. This is a 4-year deal that increased the customer's annual spend by over 70%. This customer's journey with Zscaler is remarkable: I remember sitting with the chief architect in their office, finalizing the purchase of our ZIA Professional bundle six years ago. Since then, their annual spend has increased over 14x to well over $10 million. Next, we look forward to working with them on Zero Trust for Workloads. In an upsell win, a Fortune 500 Bank in Asia that has deployed ZIA for over 50,000 users purchased ZPA and ZDX for all 50,000 employees. This is another example of a large customer buying ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for all users. While the immediate objective for this deal was to replace a legacy multi-vendor VPN infrastructure, ZPA was selected to implement zero trust access by establishing an application-level policy, where users connect to specific applications, not to a network, hence achieving app segmentation without having to do legacy network segmentation. ZPA did not just replace VPN, it's eliminating the need for the entire inbound DMZ including DDoS protection, app delivery controllers, and firewalls, generating a payback on their Zscaler purchase within 6 months. Because of this substantial ROI, even in a tougher macro, Zscaler can help reduce cost while driving transformation. Our integration with Microsoft's E5 suite across ZIA and ZPA was also an important decision factor for them. This latest purchase more than doubled the customer's annual spend. ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together form a complete solution to implement Zero Trust for users. Our next immediate big opportunity is Zero Trust for workloads, powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. Let me highlight a few exciting wins in this area: An existing Fortune 100 financial services customer with ZIA deployed for 60,000 users, purchased Zero Trust for Workloads to protect 50,000 workloads spanning across multiple data centers and public clouds. This eliminates the need for virtual firewalls and site-to-site VPNs. This multi-million-dollar ACV deal is our largest workload deal to-date and more than doubles the customer's annual spend. The customer now protects both users and workloads under a single policy framework, enhancing their cyber protection, providing visibility and simplifying operations. Lastly, let me discuss a new customer purchasing all four product pillars together. An elite research university purchased our comprehensive ZIA, ZPA and ZDX offerings for 35,000 users and Zero Trust for Workloads for over 3,000 workloads for their multi-cloud environment. Their CIO's top priority is to eliminate the risk of legacy VPNs and lateral threat movement as universities are increasingly becoming a target for ransomware and intellectual property theft. Also, a critical requirement for this win was our Zero Trust platform meeting the criteria of Zero Trust framework as recommended by NIST. We closed this 3-year, 8-figure deal through AWS marketplace. I'm very happy with our continued success in expanding our routes to market via cloud marketplaces. Next, I am excited to highlight U.S. Federal government where we're having considerable momentum. Driven in part by the President's Executive Order, we are seeing increased interest in our Zero Trust Exchange across all levels of the government. We are excited to help our country dramatically improve our security posture while significantly reducing legacy IT costs. We have the highest level of FedRAMP certifications for ZIA and ZPA. In addition, ZPA is the only Zero Trust solution with DoD IL5 certification. There are only a select few cloud companies that have this level of certification, and there is no other cybersecurity company at this level. IL5 certification is an important differentiator for us.  Let me highlight 2 new customer wins this quarter where this was an important factor: First, a defense contractor that purchased ZIA and ZPA in a 6-year seven-figure ACV deal. Second, a DOD unit also purchased ZPA for secure access to SAP instances in AWS Gov cloud. Two important considerations for our ongoing success in the Federal market are: First, ZPA is the only cloud security service with FedRAMP High authorization for Zero Trust Remote Access. We connect users to applications and not to the network, eliminating lateral threat movement, a core principle of zero trust architecture that can't be achieved by next gen firewalls or cloud VPNs. Second, ZIA's proxy architecture, which inspects TLS-encrypted traffic at scale delivering superior security. Our proven track record running the world's largest inline security cloud makes Zscaler the obvious and trusted partner of choice for governments and enterprises. We now have 288 customers exceeding $1 million in ARR, an increase of 77% year-over-year. We deliver a mission-critical service that requires unmatched reliability and availability for an in-line cloud. There is no compression algorithm for over 10 years of operational experience running such a cloud. An example of our proven scale is that Zscaler processes over 240 billion transactions inline per day, which is more than 20x the number of Google searches per day. Now, let me share a few observations about our high net retention rates, which has exceeded 125% for the last 6 quarters. We made a number of investments in customer success services, technical account managers, partner services, and certification of partners, which together are driving a faster and greater adoption across our broad portfolio. We have a solid blueprint for accelerating value delivery, which is driving upsells. All of these investments result in happy customers, demonstrated by our Net Promoter Score or NPS of more than 70, which is more than 2x that of an average SaaS company. Next let me now highlight our rapid pace of innovation. After having built the most comprehensive platform to provide Zero Trust for Users, we are now expanding it for Zero Trust for Workloads. Unlike scores of vendors who offer point-products for cloud native apps, Zscaler has developed a fully integrated CSPM, CIEM and Infrastructure-as-Code Scanning with a common backend and fully correlated, actionable dashboard. Gartner calls this functionality CNAPP, but we have moved beyond CNAPP by integrating the threat and data awareness from ZIA and ZPA. We will be highlighting it and other innovations at Zenith Live, our annual cloud summit next month. We enhanced our AI/ML engine for ZDX, our fastest growing new service, to leverage billions of telemetry points from millions of users to improve digital user experience. It can not only automatically figure out what and where performance issues are but can also provide information about the quality of voice, video and screen sharing due to our integration with Microsoft Teams and Zoom. We have also integrated ZDX with ServiceNow making customer end-user support far more efficient. ZDX also got certified and became available on our Federal cloud. Our ThreatLabZ security research team is tracking over a dozen APT groups and getting better reconnaissance about their tools and behavioral patterns resulting in higher order threat intelligence. This specific threat intel coupled with our massive cloud effect from 240 billion transactions and 300 trillion signals per day enables Zscaler to deliver better threat protection than other vendors. Moving beyond users and workloads, we are now bringing Zero Trust to IoT/OT systems, a large emerging opportunity. Today, Siemens and Zscaler announced the availability of an integrated all-in-one solution to accelerate secure access to OT systems. Our joint development with Siemens brings the benefits of Zscaler to factory and industrial control systems. We are thrilled to have Siemens, a long-standing customer, as a development and go-to-market partner. In closing, in spite of uncertain macro conditions, we continue to see strong demand for our services. We are in a strong financial position, and we will continue to aggressively invest in our business. We are focused on hiring and developing talent and creating a culture that rewards innovation at all levels. We have grown our global organization to approximately 4,500 employees who are energized by our shared mission to secure the hyperconnected world of cloud and mobility. We grew our total sales and marketing headcount by 54% year-over-year, and we remain focused on investing in our go-to-market machine. In today's competitive hiring market, Zscaler is a destination for top talent. To drive continued growth in hiring and to build on Zscaler's high-performing hybrid-work culture, this month, we welcomed Brendan Castle, Google's former global head of talent acquisition, as our new Chief People Officer. Brendan has proven experience in building highly motivated and productive teams at scale. With app transformation already mainstream, network and security transformation is also becoming mainstream, which we pioneered with our Zero Trust Exchange. We believe customers trust Zscaler more than any other provider for securing their cloud journey. Recent uncertainty in the macro environment is driving customers to accelerate their network and security transformation with our integrated platform, resulting in reductions in cost, complexity and business risk. We are adding a record number of Global 2000 customers, now with 30% of Global 2000 and 40% of Fortune 500 customers trusting Zscaler. These demanding customers are making large multi-year commitments to our platform. We are not just growing rapidly at any cost, we are also profitable and delivering efficient growth. We will continue our disciplined investment in innovation and growth to capture the large and growing opportunity ahead of us Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Yes. Andrew, as you know, President's executive order is to implement Zero Trust architecture, and it's well aligned it actually aligns with what we have done. To be success in federal, you need 2 things. One, you need the right architecture, Zero Trust, which we have. Two, unique FedRAMP certifications. And we have the highest FedRAMP certifications. And now there's a timing issue as well. White House issued a memo setting a timeline for agencies to achieve Zero Trust architecture within 2 years. These plans are being submitted and more budgets are becoming available. All of this is positive long-term development from our point of view. However, Fed opportunities always save time. Yes, thank you, Alex. So first of all, Zero Trust implementation. People sometimes build a little VPN replacement they call it Zero Trust. What we built with Zscaler Private Access is a platform that replaces the entire inbound D&C. Literally, you need nothing between Zscaler and the workload and application running. And in fact, on top of that, we further expanded to a browser isolation, app protection, interior deception and EIM based policy that can help you do segmentation. It's because of that you're winning ZPA deals a big time. So that's 1 part. The second part was attacks. So first of all, for someone to attack, they need to find you. With our Zero Trust architecture, your applications hind behind Zscaler, they can't even find. And the next part of attacks is -- and this is impacted attacks. For that, you need a proper proxy architecture that actually terminate connection, look at the package and everything, decrypt them, find them and take care of them. For that, we have built a very, very highly scalable architecture that sets us apart, that scales like nothing else out there. So it's a combination of these things. With 10-plus years of experience running a massive in-line cloud is what sets us apart from others. Now regarding some of the competitors coming from CDN market are DDoS or DNS market, right, those guys generally have been focused on servers. We start focusing on users to start with. It takes a lot of time and experience to build our richness and breadth of functionality we have built with ZIA, ZPA and associated functionality. I think it will take a long, long time for someone to try to catch us. And we are setting. We are innovating at a very fast pace. If I may add 2 quick comments to what Remo said, with very high gross margins and unit economics, it becomes easier for us to invest in businesses. Secondly, the hiring environment has -- is actually getting easier. We are hearing of high-flying companies that raise funding and multibillion-dollar valuations last year, they're starting to lay off people or freeze hiring, and companies that are spending to grow at any cost are now starting to slow down. So we will keep on accelerating our plan because our customers want to leverage Zscaler, to accelerate their transformation because they want to be competitive NHI. Yes. So the partner momentum comes from 2 sides. One is partners like Microsoft, who have been helping us even without fulfilling through marketplace. That momentum has been leveraged for the last several years. Now it has extended over AWS quite a bit. So that's 1 area. The second area is being able to deliver orders through cloud marketplace. It is 1 more channel for us to revenue. Our business through both AWS and Azure has been steadily growing, and these current viewed as a part of a clone transformation solution. So when it's focal through a marketplace channel, it often comes out of an annual cloud spend that's already committed by the customer with a hyperscaler. So that makes it actually easier in many ways. In Q3, with 1 of our largest deals through AWS marketplace. And if you recall, we did a very large deal last quarter through Azure Marketplace, and we are training AWS and Microsoft sales teams. And I think there's a good opportunity to create more leverage. And these are generally larger deals. So you've seen our momentum in larger deals in the last 2 quarters, we have added almost 80 Global 2000 companies to our portfolio. I mean that's pretty remarkable, and we don't see any slowdown. Yes. So I think what Remo said, our projections always take into account our pipeline, our customer engagements. But at a qualitative level, as I talked to lots and lots of CIOs and CSOs, I mean there is a sense of uncertainty out there. And they're beginning to think about how do I do my cost and complexity reduction by consolidation. And that's where we start becoming pretty important. And for that, customers are driving transformation. We help them with it. On top of that cyber is a big issue. So when you bring all these things together, we become more important for them, and they start a discussion with, Jay, what all security products and networking products can I replace with you? And now, we are able to actually talk about a bigger set of products that need to be removed, which actually leads to a bigger part of platform to be bought. Now on top of that, it's interesting to see certainly on the high-flying private start-up companies, which would talk about all kinds of different hiring, how many employees, all that stuff is getting tempered down. That means the unnecessary noise in the market, it's expected to slow down. And it's fascinating to see people calling us from those start-ups already. So we are bullish about the business. Very good question. In Q2, we talked about how a number of our large customers are beginning to buy Workloads, our Zero Trust of Workloads, but at a small scale. This last quarter, we start to see them actually buying some very large orders in this area. So that's very encouraging now. In terms of the buyer and the products, the Cloud Protection products can be put in 2 broad buckets. One, what Gartner now called CNAPP is a collection of CSPM, CI and type of stuff. It's API-based security. It's a new area for everyone. It's a simple to build, and we have a very good offering in that space. We revamped our CNAPP offering, which we'll be launching at Zenith Live next month. And parallel with that is Zero Trust workload, which is taking ZIA and ZPA technology and making it available for workloads because at flows need to talk to Internet that goes through ZIA engine. They need to talk to each other, which goes to ZPA engine. This is bringing Zero Trust to workloads. Bringing the 2 together, in-line piece of it and API piece of it sets us apart from any other vendor in the market out there.  Regarding buying centers, if you really look at it, if we were selling at a lower level, buying will be very different. No matter what -- who buys the product, when it comes to security part, CSO is definitely involved. So our good relationship CSO are helping us with Zero Trust, with Workload and Cloud Protection. Our relationship with Head of Networking are helping us because in the old world, you are extending your data center to cloud with all these dedicated links out there. The area we are developing and building more relationship is the DevOps side of it. But since CSO relations are strong, it is helping us. We are not creating an overlay team, but we do have product specialist. You need overlay teams when you're selling point products at low level. When we have been selling platform at a high level, I don't need overlay teams. I do need product specialists, which we are hiring to work with our broad sales team. Did that help? And Remo, if I may add one thing. This is an outstanding quarter from lots of customers doing multi-product pillar deals for multi-years, which is very exciting. Yes. But one thing that business through cloud marketplaces has been steadily growing over time. So that is very good. For us, I don't think the driver is what's the fulfillment channel for us. I personally care about partners who actually helped me with strategic sales to the customer. When Microsoft accounting cancer able to sit together with the CIO and talk through a large deal. It is extremely useful. But it does help to get cloud hyperscaler sales team more engaged because they actually do compensate it for the business that flows through the channel part -- through cloud marketplace. So we actually are putting more focus on training AWS and Microsoft sales team, so which helps them and helps us. Yes. Two quick comments. First of all, I do believe there's uncertainties helping us because we are going to help customers with cost reduction and complexity reduction. And on the other side, our flagship CIC products, they have reached significant scale and are generating good margins. But we are reinvesting that to drive the growth of new products. We have proven that when we brought ZPA on, we made it successful. We've seen -- we brought ZDX on. We're making it successful. It's growing even faster than ZPA did, and we have high expectations from Workload Protection as well. So I think with such a large platform, we expect that we'll keep on growing fairly efficiently. Yes. Before COVID came in, Zscaler used to start with, let's do network transformation. When COVID started 2.5 years ago, SD-WAN went out the door, there's nobody working in the branch offices and customers start to roll out Zscaler by downloading a lightweight agent and here it goes. So with that, the role of any network or SD-WAN became really insignificant. Today, most of our customers roll it out or lapped our mobile with a lightweight agent they can work from home, they can work from office with SD-WAN, without SD-WAN. So we'll stay neutral to supporting SD-WAN vendors. Our sales processes are no longer led by SD-WAN. If a customer sales on rolling on SD-WAN, we are generally the preferred choice, and that's how we see it. So we don't really see any changes in the SD-WAN marketplace impacting us. Yes. Russia, Ukraine. It was a bigger thing a quarter ago. I decided years ago not to sell in Russia. Hence, we do not have any revenue exposure in Russia or Ukraine, but cybersecurity is a global threat. It's not a regional at -- our threat research team is tracking heightened cyber cat environment, which is making every CIO and CSO more nervous in this area. So this is driving the adoption of Zero Trust architecture and it is increasing our engagement with customers. More so in Europe, actually European customers are more worried about it, while Americans are, too. So we have some very large deals in Europe this quarter, including a couple of them I highlighted. We don't really see any negative impact of this conflict and we remain engaged with our customers to drive the transformation. They want to become agile, competitive, play a role there and then cyber on top of that. So I don't see any negative impact. OT plants and factories have been slow in changing typically plans take their own time, but all these critical infrastructure attacks and some threats have made it a priority. Vendors like Sims are big providers of 4P systems out there. They see this as an opportunity for really providing or should I say, taking fiber and VPN based security of OT systems to zero trust-based security, where you no longer connect these OT networks and IT networks where you no longer need remote VPN to access the systems. So Siemens has worked with us over the last year or so. They essentially chose us as a partner, we did joint development where we made our technology available on their hardened OT systems, and this combined solution of Siemens and ours is now available through our customers' office. I think it's a good opportunity for us. I think it's a matter of time when all IoT OT systems will embrace Zero Trust, and we are positioned well for that opportunity. Thank you. I want to thank you all for your continued interest in Zscaler. I also want to thank Zscaler employees, customers and partners for delivering a strong quarter. We look forward to seeing many of you at Zenith Live, our annual cloud summit. Thank you."

I would also like to inform you that, we'll be attending the following upcoming events in March: Berenberg Thematics Software Conference on March 2; JMP Securities Technology Conference on March 7; and Wolf Research Virtual Software Conference on March 23. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay. \nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. I'm pleased to share our strong results for fiscal Q2. We continue to see strong demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform, as our customers embrace the cloud. We delivered 63% year-over-year revenue growth and 59% billings growth, while also generating over 50% growth in operating profits and free cash flow. Public SaaS companies are happy to get to rule of 40, while we have been exceeding the rule of 70 for the last 12 months, validating our strong execution in pursuing our large market opportunity. Our continued investment in scaling, our engineering and go-to-market machines is yielding the best revenue growth we have had in three years even as we surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue. We plan to keep on making substantial investments across the company to continue our rapid pace of innovation and growth. What we deliver with our platform is critical to our customers' highest priorities. This is reflected in our deal sizes, which are increasing due to our success with large enterprises who are buying more of our expanding platform with a significant growth in the number of new logo and upsell customers for orders with over $1 million in annual value. We now have over 250 customers exceeding $1 million in ARR an increase of 85% year-over-year. Business momentum for a zero plus exchange is strong due to the market need for a modern security architecture in the world of cloud and mobility. Our flagship ZIA offering has been growing very well as we continue to expand our cyber and data protection services. ZPA has emerged as our second flagship offering, supporting millions of users and the majority of our Global 2000 customers. We are the clear market leader in zero trust application access with proven maturity and scalability. With ZIA and ZPA, we had demonstrated our success implementing zero trust for users. Our next immediate big opportunity is to bring zero trust to workloads in our ZCP pillar powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. In addition, our ZDX pillar is enabling a highly productive workforce and it is seeing strong demand. In a single integrated cloud platform, our zero trust exchange provides secure any-to-any connectivity for users, applications, workloads, and IoT and OT systems regardless of their location. While many vendors claim to offer a platform because they bought a bunch of point products that are very hard to integrate, no one comes close to the capabilities of our cloud native extensible platform. We will continue to invest in engineering, customer support, marketing, and sales to accelerate the growth offer new products, while keeping the strong momentum on our flagship products. We believe we are in a sustained high demand environment. We have a large and expanding market opportunity powered by our customers' digital transformation journeys, which continue at a place never seen before. According to IDG's recent state of the CIO report, the top CEO mandate for IT in 2022 is to upgrade cybersecurity to reduce business risk. Whether it is supporting remote work, all enabling new digital customer and employee experiences, IT leaders must ensure that business operations are agile, resilient, and secure. Given the explosion in ransomware and high-profile data breaches, IT leaders are looking to phase out castle and moat security to adopt zero trust architecture to unlock the full points of digital transformation. It is clear from our growth in our large enterprise wins that architecture matters. Despite legacy vendors marketing claims, true zero trust security can be built on legacy network security architecture. As I have highlighted before, there are two reasons why enterprises are selecting Zscaler. One, we are the only proven cloud security provider with a proxy architecture that inspects TLS encrypted traffic at scale to deliver superior security. We connect users to applications and not to the network, eliminating laterals at moment. This is a core principle of zero trust architecture that can't be achieved by next-gen firewalls or cloud VPNs. Let me discuss some of our Q2 deal wins that highlight the advantages of our Zero Trust Exchange. I will start with a big ZIA event. A Fortune 100 professional searches customer initially purchased our ZIA transmission bundle plus CASB and DLP and ZDX for 125,000 employees working from anywhere. This quarter, they added 175,000 ZIA seats to secure all 300,000 employees. With a cloud-first strategy and mission-critical client-facing data at stake, they selected our proven scalable platform with a global footprint needed to support their business in over 150 countries, with 93% of their Internet traffic encrypted, TLS inspection was a major requirement and the customer only considered a proxy architecture. Next is a new logo customer and started with ZPA as part of a strategic initiative to transform their IT infrastructure. This global 50 manufacturer, headquartered in Europe purchased ZPA for 200,000 users to implement zero trust secure. ZPA will eliminate their attack surface, protecting thousands of private applications behind our Zero Plus Exchange. Hence their apps can't be discovered Exploited or DDoS. We are replacing their firewall-based VPN that allow lateral type movement. A global systems integrator partner, who is implementing the overall transformation project, played a major role in driving the Zscaler win, an example of the channel leverage we are creating with our investments in our SI partners. As the shift to the cloud accelerates, customers are buying ZIA and ZPA together, enabling a true transformation with direct and seamless access to SaaS and private applications whether on-prem or in the public cloud. Let me highlight several such deals. In a new logo win a Fortune 50 insurance customer signed a full year commitment for ZIA, ZPA and ZDX to securely enable 65,000 employees working from anywhere or comprehensive cyber and data protection, they purchased the high-end transformation bundle plus CASB, advanced DLP and SSBM or SaaS security portal management which is like CSPM for SaaS. Fast user experience and superior cybersecurity were the key factors are our win. In another new customer win a, Fortune 500 Fintech Company that has grown through acquisitions signed a nearly five-year commitment to up-level security and simplify IT. They purchased ZIA transformation plus CASB and DLP as well as DPA and ZDX for 60,000 employees. This consolidated seven different security point products and accelerates the closure of the 24 data centers. Moreover, ZPA also shortens new employee onboarding to a few days from 2.5 months. It also eliminates the need many of the employees had for two laptops to access two separate networks. I'm also excited about our success selling security transformation in new countries, a global 500 manufacturer headquartered in Mexico purchased ZIA and ZDX for over 18,000 users and ZPA for 14000 users. This is our first seven-figure annual deal in Latin America, a region where we recently started making investments. Next M&A is an elegant use case for the Zscaler platform. In an upsell deal diversified industrial conglomerate with over 20 operating companies that previously purchased ZIA Transformation Bundle added ZPA for 16000 users to accelerate M&A integration and reduce business risk without having to connect two corporate networks with legacy firewalls, which could have taken 14 months or more our Zero Trust Exchange provided secure access to applications across both companies in weeks saving time and money. This customer purchased a high-end ZPA bundle with integrated browser isolation to enhance data protection. They also bought our deception technology to intercept bad actors, who may have infiltrated the network. This latest purchase more than doubled their annual spend with us. Next let me highlight customers purchasing all four pillars of our platform. In a new logo win a Global 2000 leader in technology products purchased ZIA transformation with DLP and CASB, ZPA and ZDX for 11000 employees and ZCP workload posture for 6000 workloads in multi-cloud environment. As we accelerate the digital transformation the CIO's core priority was to eliminate the risk of legacy VPNs and natural tech movement while ensuring the best user experience. They put ZDX to the test by asking us to troubleshoot poor Microsoft 365 experience of an executive traveling in Europe. ZDX mapped the entire network path over the Internet in real time isolating specific issues and allowing the customer to quickly resolve the issue and improve the user experience. This proof of value led to the quick ZDX purchase. I believe that over time every ZIA and ZPA customer will embrace ZDX as workforce productivity is one of the highest priorities for a CIO. Lastly, I'm happy with our early success in expanding our routes to market via cloud marketplaces. First with AWS and now with Azure. Let me highlight two Azure marketplace deals. First, an existing global 200 pharma customer with headquarters in Europe purchased ZPA for all 87000 employees enabling Zero Trust access to the private apps posted in hybrid cloud environments. This purchase was done with just a couple of mouse clicks and it doubled the annual spend with us. Second, a new Fortune 500 customer in the energy industry made a three-year eight-figure commitment for ZIA ZPA and ZDX for all 23,000 employees. We will continue to invest in cloud marketplaces as a new channel to revenue. Enterprises trust Zscaler over cold imitators and new entrants because we have a true Zero Trust architecture and have over 10 years of operational experience, running the largest security cloud in the world. Our Zero Trust Exchange processes over 210 billion transactions in line and prevents more than seven billion security and policy violations per day, providing our customers an unmatched network effect for superior security to flawlessly run the world's largest security cloud with five 9s [ph] of availability requires more than security expertise. It requires networking expertise and the ability to control the traffic pass. As Zscaler was born as a cloud company and has been operating an in-line cloud since 2008. We have gained this expertise over time. There's no compression algorithm for years of experience. This expertise will become even more important, as we address hundreds of millions of workloads and billions of OT IoT devices. Let me share an example of our cloud operations differentiation. Microsoft extended direct fiber connectivity from the major data centers to ours because of the volume of traffic that flows between Zscaler and Microsoft. This direct connectivity enables us to deliver higher reliability and performance and the traditional Internet exchange peering approach. This is a validation of our scale and the criticality of our services to our mutual customers. Another example of delivering great availability and high performance is our integrations with Microsoft and Zoom. With API-based integration for Teams and Zoom, we proactively identify and resolve performance issues for these latency-sensitive apps. Without which user collaboration is disrupted and business productivity is lost. Our proven track record running the world's largest in-line security cloud makes Zscaler the obvious and trusted partner of choice, but enterprises need to securely access mission-critical applications. Let me also talk about our recognized market and innovation leadership. Zscaler pioneered the zero trust architecture. And over time, our platform subsume functionality of multiple point products into our secure Web gateway foundation as the market evolves and customers migrated towards a platform approach such as Zscaler. Gartner expanded the scope of the Secure Web Gateway NQ to include functionalities such as CASB, ZTNA, Digital Experience Monitoring and Browser Isolation and renamed it SSE or Security Service Edge. After 10 consecutive years of being named a leader in Gartner's MQ for secure web gateway, we were again named a market leader for SSE. Many of you are aware of SASE. So how are SASE and SSE related? SASE framework is the combination of SSE and WAN Edge. SSE has all the security capabilities built on zero trust architecture and is independent of the type of network. WAN Edge which is generally SD-WAN provides connectivity to an SSE cloud. Importantly Zero Trust security is implemented in the SSE cloud, not in the WAN Edge. As the category leader in SSE with the widest and deepest offerings Zscaler is the go-to platform for vendor consolidation cost savings increased user productivity and better cyber protection. As our market opportunities expand we are promoting two strong leaders to continue scaling Zscaler. We're expanding Amit Sinha's role to President of the company. Amit will continue to lead our engineering and cloud operations teams, while also assuming broad responsibilities for expansion of our platform into new areas. We are also promoting Dali Rajic to Chief Operating Officer. Dali will continue to lead our global sales organization while also assuming broader responsibilities for interlocking among sales, marketing, business development and transformation teams to further enhance the customers' life cycle journey. In their new roles, Amit and Dali will be responsive to driving further growth operational excellence and collaboration across the scale, as we continue the path towards our next milestone of $5 billion in ARR. To enable our customers' ever-growing digital transformation aspirations and extend our market leadership, our entire organization is focused on attracting and developing talent and creating a culture that rewards innovation at all levels. We added approximately 1000 employees globally in the last six months and have over 4000 employees who are energized by our shared mission to create a hyperconnected digital world in which the exchange of information is always secure and seamless. In today's competitive hiring market Zscaler is a destination for top talent. We are proud of our Glassdoor rating which is among the highest in the industry. Zscaler has never been stronger and I believe we have a large and growing opportunity in front of us. Now I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. \nRemo Canessa: Thank you Jay. As Jay mentioned we are pleased with the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue for the quarter was $256 million up 11% sequentially and 63% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis revenue growth accelerated in the quarter driven by strong business activity. ZPA product revenue was 17% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 35% and APJ was 14%. APJ continues to be our fastest-growing region with revenue growth of 16%. Our total calculated billings grew 59% year-over-year to $368 million with billings duration near the midpoint of our 10 months to 14 months range. We are also pleased to report 61% year-over-year growth in short-term billings. Remaining performance obligations or RPO were $1.95 billion as of January 31 growing 90% from one year ago. The current RPO is 50% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate which was again above 125%. We had 251 customers paying us more than $1 million annually up 85% from 136 in the prior year. The continued strength in this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added over 560 customers in the past 12 months paying us more than $100,000 annually ending the quarter at 1751 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q2 financial performance total gross margin of 80.4% was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter and down 90 basis points year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 13% sequentially and 62% year-over-year to $183 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue up 72% were similar to a year ago even as we made ongoing investments in smokescreen and trust-owned businesses we acquired in the second half of last year and was a partial return of T&E. Operating margin was 9% and free cash flow margin was 12%. We continue to expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be in the high single-digits for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.61 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Now moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount and amortization of intangible assets. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $270 million to $272 million reflecting a year-over-year growth of 53% to 54% gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products including ZDX, workload segmentation and CSPM will initially have lower gross margins within our core products because we are more focused on time to market and growth rather than optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $19 million to $20 million. As noted before we have more interest events starting this quarter including customer events, conferences, our internal midyear sales events, net loss and other income of $100,000, income taxes of $4 million earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.11 assuming 149 million to 150 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2022, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $1.045 billion to $1.05 billion or year-over-year growth of 55% to 56% increasing calculated billings to a range of $1.365 billion to $1.37 billion or year-over-year growth of 46% to 47%, increasing our operating profit to a range of $95 million to $98 million, increasing our earnings per share to a range of $0.54 to $0.56 assuming approximately 149 million to 150 million fully diluted shares. Please note that our share count guidance includes dilution from our convertible debentures based on the existing treasury method of accounting. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we're committed to investing aggressively in our company. We see a window of opportunity to extend our first-mover advantages in this fast-growing market, which will have positive long-term impacts. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing, but we'll continue to prioritize growth, which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We also ask that you please limit yourself to one question at a time. Now, stand-by as we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Congrats on a nice quarter, this afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like to start off with a question on the impact from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. So at the start of the COVID pandemic, you clearly saw some new momentum with ZPA, as more employees were forced to work remotely. I'm wondering if the Russia-Ukraine conflict has had a similar effect, creating any new demand for your solutions. And whether it's from companies in the region or even outside of Ukraine that might be concerned with the ensuing cyberattacks that could be launched?\nJay Chaudhry: Andrew, it's a little bit early to tell the impact, but our customers are concerned. There's higher cyber sensitivity. I was talking to a CXO from Germany earlier today and he actually opened the call I had with him with this topic. And customers want to make sure they're secure. And one of the things we think is going to help us directly is ZPA, which can hide our attack surface. If you can't see something, you can't attack it. And ZIA becomes more important for all the in-line protection. Our research team is seeing signals of increased reconnaissance activity, that's increasing for the past few weeks. We have a 100% research team and we're making them available as a resource to our customers.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you. This is Matt Swanson on for Matt Hedberg. Jay, first of all, incredibly impressive to be able to find and hire 1,000 people over the last six months in this environment. But when you kind of think about one of every four Zscaler employees being new to the company, could you just talk about how you're managing that growth? And also, given the expanded draft of the products and the more multi-polar sales, how we should think about the ramp time for adding new sales headcount?\nJay Chaudhry: Well, thank you, multi-part question. So first of all, let me start by saying that we are very pleased that we have been able to do good hiring in this though hiring environment, because we are a top destination for top talent. So hiring is obviously the starting point. Two, I think, beyond doing a number of things that need to be done to make sure these people can be easily incorporated in the company. And in the past, we talked about a very strong enablement team, a number of boot camps for training we do and buddy systems realign. So a number of things are doing to make sure these people are becoming part of it. And the zones we have shown over the past two years show that in this COVID environment, we have been able to do a good job in making them productive. Remo, next part.\nRemo Canessa: From a headcount perspective, we called out last quarter, so we had an outstanding quarter for few quota pass. We had an equally great quarter also in Q2. So our plans are to really push growth. We see this as a huge market opportunity. We're going to continue to do that and we're going to continue to hire across the company. \nJay Chaudhry: The only comment I'll add next to it is it's not just ASMs that matter for us. Our top-down strategic sales process requires solution architects we have transmission team of CIOs, CSOs and CTOs. They all play an important role and we're doing well across the board in hiring.\nMatt Swanson: Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thanks. And let me also extend my compliments to an outstanding quarter. You guys really against a very tough comp really delivered superb results. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more in the terms of hiring around the capacity expansion within your sales organization to what extent you've delivered on the prior hiring, say, a year ago getting to quota and where we are on the current hiring getting to when you think they'll get to quota and what your expectations are for CY 2022 for staffing increases in sales capacity. Is it reasonable to think that it could be another year of 50% capacity growth? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll take it. So from a quota perspective, we are seeing people getting ramped quicker, but they're on full quota after one year. So that hasn't changed at all. Regarding sales capacity, I don't want to give percentages out. What I'd like to say is that that's a huge market opportunity and we see it. So we will continue to build sales capacity in our model. The one thing that we did call out in the last quarter or the quarter before, if we're growing over 30% on the top line revenue, you can expect less than 300 basis points operating margin expansion. Our view is that this is a huge market opportunity. And you're right, Alex. These results for accompanied our scale are outstanding. They're absolutely outstanding. But you've got billings growth at 59%, you've got short-term billings growth at 61%, and you look at a model that's got tremendous leverage in a market that's in my opinion huge. We're going to continue to really focus in on that top line and invest in our business. And we're very confident that we have the best product and a huge market opportunity. \nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Remo, if I could direct my question to you first. I mean, Jay mentioned a lot of great things about the demand environment about some of the secular tailwinds that you guys are seeing larger deal sizes. If I look at the billings growth and 59% growth at this scale is obviously very impressive. It was a little bit below sort of the usual seasonality and the 70% type billings growth that you guys were doing over the last four quarters. So I'm just curious, when we think about billings at this scale, is there anything that we should be mindful of in terms of seasonality going forward, or anything that was perhaps one-timey a year ago, or last quarter when we think about billings growth in relation to revenue growth over the next four quarters?\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. I mean a lot of questions there.\nHamza Fodderwala: Yeah.\nRemo Canessa: Let me try to answer it. So 59% billings growth, as you mentioned, is absolutely outstanding. If I take a look at Q2, if there's one area that didn't perform at the level that we bought it with, it was federal. Federal was low single-digit of our new and upsell business Now why is that? It's just the budget constraints basically. So our feeling is that, federal will be a big portion, or a substantial portion of our business. We got the FedRAMP certification. Also, we've built up a strong team with the relationships. So \u2013 but to call out one thing in the quarter that I would say, was didn't comment as we expected would be federal. It was low single digits. Regarding billings and revenue, as we go forward hard to say. It all depends on our really top level growth. Like I mentioned before, with Alex, it's a huge market opportunity. absolutely huge. We feel we're well positioned. We're seeing the traction with our customers. I believe we had 251 customers greater than the $1 million ARR, which is growth rate 85% over the prior year. Our customers appear than $100,000 ARR was like $1,750. So substantial growth also year-over-year, I think like 500 customers or something like that or 550. The market is there and we feel we have the solution. And again, from my perspective, the results that we put up were outstanding results. And again, the key thing for investors is that we're going to continue to invest in top line growth in the business. We see no reason to slow it down. We'll be cognizant related to operating profitability. But you're all aware base, the SaaS model with 80% gross margin, getting to operating profitability high operating profitability, it's not a difficult thing. Really trying to take advantage of this market is what we're after. \nHamza Fodderwala: Got it. Really helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have Joel Fishbein of Truist. Your line is open.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you, and congrats on the great execution. I guess, this is for Jay and Remo. You've been pretty successful in terms of cross-selling a lot of the different products and obviously, deal sizes are going up pretty dramatically. I'd love to get your take on how ARPU per seat has been trending. And then the second part of that is, how is it being able to sell into different parts of an organization since the products affect obviously different parts of an organization? That would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry : Let me start. In my prepared remarks, I covered so many deals where ZIA, ZPA, ZDX worked together and a number of deals with all four product fillers were bought. So we're actually very happy with the traction we're seeing. You've seen over the past couple of years that ZIA, ZPA common together has become a fairly common thing. And on ZDX for the last one year has becoming more and more common, we've seen lots and lots of customers buying ZDX because without this you can't troubleshoot if something goes on somebody. And ZCP is becoming an interesting seating opportunity for us because that's an early market for the workloads. And we are position ourselves well to grow it. So we feel very good about the cross side. Remo, can give further color to it?\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. I mean the ARPU is definitely increasing and we'll be giving information on that on an annual basis. New versus upsell in the quarter was 45% new and 55% upsell. So a good quarter balance between new and upsell for us.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have Gray Powell of BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And yeah, congratulations on a strong quarter. So I know a lot of people are focused on billings as the primary metric. But if I'm doing my math correctly, it looks like current RPO grew about 80% this quarter. Pretty close to 83% last quarter and well above your 63% revenue growth rate. So just curious what do you think we should be looking at as the best leading indicator for future revenue growth? And should it converge to RPO trends over time?\nRemo Canessa: Yeah, that's a great question. And if you take a look at our RPO growth year-over-year, it was about 90% and CRPO growth was 79%. What we've always called out when the RPO growth rates and CRPO growth rates are going just triple digit, we brought back investors and said billings is the best way to look at our business. And when you take a look at RPO and CRPO, they're more sensitive to the timing of large deals, the timing of renewals, contract durations and other specific terms. It's for these reasons that we want -- we feel the people should be looking at billings versus RPO or CRPO. Also our -- especially when we're in the range of 10 to 14 months. So -- and both in the quarter, our duration was right in the middle of the range of 10 to 14 months. One thing I'll also call out that investors probably look at is short-term billings growth. Our short-term billings growth was 61%. So I would look at everything as an investor but from a Zscaler perspective it's really billings. And if we're in that range 12 to 14 months it kind of bounces and then also short-term billings growth. Those are the key metrics. That takes all the noise level all the things going on with RPO and CRPO out of the equation. \nGray Powell: Understood. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver of Baird. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes, hey guys. So, you announced last quarter general availability of workload communication. So, just kind of curious to hear commentary on adoption trends expectations around that ramp. And how would you view long-term adoption over time? Will it be somewhat limited to larger organizations similar to what you've commented on workload segmentation or is it a bigger opportunity?\nJay Chaudhry: It's a very good question. Workload segmentation is only one peace offering. And the core, the basic offering is what we call zero trust for workloads. Workloads are a mirror image of users. Like users they talk to Internet. And like users talk to workloads, workloads also talk to other workloads. So, we've taken our disruptive zero trust users the ZIA, ZPA and apply to workloads. So, today what's done to really secure workloads in the cloud? It's largely VM version of firewalls. There's a firewall before you got the internet. There's a firewall before you go to another region and so on and so forth. We believe we will disrupt the workload-based security the same way we did it for users with the ZIA, ZPA. So, it's an asset opportunity. I highlighted a number of deals where actually multiple products got bought together including ZCP. Some of these deals included a Fortune 500 semiconductor company, a Fortune 500 financial service company, a global logistics company. Now, I would say that customers do start small in the cloud workload area and then they grow with us. \nJonathan Ruykhaver: Helpful. Thanks. Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Hey good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Remo this a question for you on cash flow, we saw the relationship between operating margins and the cash flow margins diverged pretty materially over the course of the pandemic and we are starting to see that consolidate a little bit. So, I'm curious if you can shed some light on how we should think about the free cash flow trajectory from here, particularly in the context of the multiyear commits and large deals that Jay alluded to in his prepared remarks and as you start to do a lot more enterprise and large deal in seven, eight-figure business?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. Let me first say we would like to be prudent with our projections. So, keep that in mind. If you take a look at our free cash flow margins in Q1, it was like in the 35% 36% range of revenue. In fiscal -- in Q2, our free cash flow margins were 12% with operating profitability at 9%. From my perspective, I just think it's just prudent to think about free cash flow being slightly higher three, four, five percentage points higher than operating profitability. It is going to fluctuate on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Our Q1 to Q3 are typically our highest quarter for free cash flow. The reason for that is that our Q2 to Q4 is our biggest billing quarters. So, you're collecting the cash in Q1 on Q3. As we get bigger, we build typically annually. So and that's -- when we talk about billings being a good metric in between that 10 and 14 months that's what we talk about. Certainly, we could increase free cash flow by doing multiyear billings but that's not our model. What we try to do is get a multiyear commitment contracts, which we have seen increase. But for free cash flow or billings, we typically say it on one year.\nFatima Boolani: Very helpful. Thank you \nOperator: Thank you. And next we have Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open. \nTal Liani: Hi. I want to ask about billing growth because the stock is going down on lower billing growth than buy-side expectations. So you grew billing around 71% pretty stable the previous four quarters. This quarter it was much better than guidance, but it was lower than what we've seen in the previous four quarters. So that's 59%. And then the guidance for the year is 46% more or less. So the question is, how should we think about billing growth? What can you say about this quarter? Why is it lower than previous four quarters? And then what's the explanation, or what are the puts and takes for the following few quarters? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean great question. Well four quarters in a row at this scale that 70% plus is outstanding is that sustainable? It's very hard to sustain that when you get to the size that we are. 59% billings growth is outstanding. If you take a look at some of our prior quarters, duration plays into that top line billing growth. If you look at short-term billings growth, it was 61%. And so if you go back in prior quarters, you'll see that's a 61% short-term billings growth it's a pretty good number a very good number. Going forward you've got our projections. We like being prudent with our projections. The key thing is that we see this as a huge market. And we're going to continue to invest and we're going to keep on driving that top line numbers. Those numbers for revenue and billing and short-term billings. And then because the value that you get in driving that top line number, the leverage you get is huge. Because in a SaaS model with the contribution margin in that 60% range for years two and three, it doesn't take long to get to the operating profitability. So building up your ARR is really, really important in getting that market share and being the dominant player. That's our focus. \nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Walkley of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. \nDaniel Park: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. It's Daniel on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. So over the over recent periods you've been working on really improving your sales motion within the enterprise segment. Could you give us some color on, how this part of your business trended this quarter? And I guess, if you're recognizing some additional wins given the investments you've made so far? \nJay Chaudhry: Hi, this is Jay. Enterprise segment which we define as 2,000 to 6,000 employees per company is progressing very well and we continue to make significant investments in growing the team. Moving to small enterprises is a natural step for us. It's an attractive market. And it's also a market where channel can play a bigger role and some in channel program has been helping us quite a bit. So we plan to continue to invest and grow the same. Remo, do you want to add anything too?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean in the quarter all segments grew well. But given our strength in large deals during the quarter the large enterprise did better.\nDaniel Park: Okay. Great. Thank you so much for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Hey, thank you so much for taking my question. Can I just double click on the point you made earlier in the call around federal. You called out that federal was only low single-digits of new and upsell. Can you just give us a framework to just compare what that was like last quarter or last year? So we can get a frame of reference. And can I also just ask were there any deals that were pushed out that have subsequently closed after January 31 that you hope that we should be aware of?\nRemo Canessa: I'll answer the first part and Jay can answer the part about the deals. But typically federal has been mid-single-digit. Sometimes even high single-digits. But I don't recall Patrick what it was last year. But you can think of federal being mid-single-digit on average contribution of our quarterly new and upsell business and this quarter to a low single-digits.\nJay Chaudhry: And in terms of pipeline and deals is growing. Pipeline is going. We are well engaged. We're seeing more momentum coming from some of the new memos and initiatives being put in place. We got the architecture. We got certain certifications. I think one thing remains a little unpredictable is some of the federal budgets and the timings.\nPatrick Colville: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, thank you. Just clarification on the question, Remo. You mentioned duration. And if you look at short-term billing you grew at 61%. It's a little bit of a degradation call it seven points from the previous quarter but the compare was six points higher. So your short-term billings have been pretty steady. If I look at the January through July quarters of last year you grew 70-plus percent. But can you just remind me how much that was enhanced by duration so we can normalize for the compare. And then if I'm allowed to sneak one in I just wanted to see if you could just talk about NRR trends as you see going through the year. Does it stay steady, or do you think as you're rolling out new products like ZCP that those trends actually may improve to facilitate growth. Thanks very much.\nRemo Canessa: I'll just call out one quarter that I'm aware of which is Q3 of last year. Q3 of last year in that 10- to 14-month range, it was close to that 14-month range in Q3. So that's the duration impact Q3 of last year which I can recall. Regarding NRR, new products. The comment that we made last quarter is that if it's over 125%, we're not going to give out specifically what the NRR is. It was over 125% in the quarter, but our new products are doing well. I mean our new products are doing well as well as ZPA. And those are very big contributors related to that NRR. If I may add we expect NRR to do well. But having said that, it's one of those things we see the bigger bundles we sell upfront, the lower NRR. Or if we do the first deal today and in two quarters we do the second upsell deal, that doesn't really get picked up in NRR. So, happy with NRR. But in the past we kind of said that, we don't really try to focus too much on NRR. That's why we gave you 125% of higher as a good indicator.\nKeith Bachman: Great. Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: And next we have Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question and congrats on the results. I guess Jay, maybe if you could address this one. I know when Dali came on board, focus of his was increasing deal velocity and also hiring. Well, now you've got -- you're kind of getting larger deals, you have a more mature sales force. So there's some puts and takes there. Maybe any commentary you can provide on sales cycles? And now that you're larger growing over large numbers with bigger deals but now with a more mature sales force how you're managing that dynamic and what those sales cycles look like? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So, it's a good question. So first of all, it is the sales force with all the processes and enablement we put in place has helped us grow exceptionally well over these -- over the past 2.5, three years since we put this new motion in place. That's number one. Number two. I think at that time, we are merely focused on the higher end of the market largely major in our lease. Now we expanded further down to enterprise as well, which is doing quite well. As you would expect some cycle is lower towards the lower end of the market. It remains fairly on the high end of the market. It is a transformation sale. It involves CIO, CISO, CTO multiple parties. But as we go in be engaged, we end up winning back. And not only that we start, wherever we're going in these accounts, we are so sticky that we keep on upselling and growing. So I'm very confident very comfortable. Obviously, as numbers are growing bigger, we need to do -- keep on doing the same thing. The market is there. Product portfolio is there. We have no competitive pressure, and it really needs to keep on executing. I think we're doing a good job and we'll keep on driving and we have good margins at the gross margin level to keep an investment.\nBrian Essex: Great. Any way to quantify what sales cycles are, and how they've trended.\nJay Chaudhry: I would say, we haven't come and said they are reduced by x percent but I would say, it's a range we have always said the lower smaller deals was three to six months and bigger are from six to 12 months. It\u2019s getting bigger, probably there's a movement for the lower side of it. But deals come in many shapes and sizes. So they are all of it, but we are -- we have a very rapidly growing pipeline and our close rates are pretty good as well. So, I feel very bullish and comfortable.\nBrian Essex: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Roger Boyd of UBS. Please, your line is open.\nRoger Boyd: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could talk about -- so first of all really strong performance out of the $1 million plus ARR cohort. I wonder if you could talk about what you're seeing in that smaller enterprise cohort in terms of competition and then also what's the recognition of Gartner on their new secure service edge Magic Quadrant means as you go to market with that smaller 6000 to 2000 cohort? \nJay Chaudhry: Right. It's a good question. So first of all the MQ is not just the lower market, MQ across the board probably more relevant in the larger markets to some degree because larger companies tend to be Gartner customers. But I would say frankly I was surprised to see that the twin CASB vendors listed in the leaders quadrant because we don't see them in the real world out there. So, if I were to quibble with a criteria that Gartner use I believe it was overweight on CASB which is much easier to build it's out of band and it was underway from secure web gateway which is foundation of zero trust and much harder to build because it is in line. In our customer base we are replacing lots of CASB point products that have been sold over the years. And you look at our platform, it has expanded significantly ZIA, ZPA, ZDX, ZCP and all. Now second question related to smaller enterprises, right? There we do see more vendors in low end of the enterprise than we saw -- when we see on the high end higher are very savvy. They rule out actually some of the vendors who don't have the right architecture and they also look for operational excellence. Yesterday I had a call with the CIO of a large financial services company. He wanted to start the discussion by saying this, I see so many vendors that keep on coming and talking about all kind of feature and functionality. And when I talked to their operational experience running the cloud, they don't want to have much to talk about. Well, they don't because they haven't really done it before. So operational experience is becoming more and more important as some of these -- you have seen issues with AWS to Azure AD and some of those stuff out there. But on the lower end we do see firewall vendors is cost of the world some of the other new entrants. But once we engage and we win almost every time. Typically, in the past we had less presence in enterprise but now we are actually engaged in putting more resources in the lower end of the market and winning. It's a growth area for us. \nRoger Boyd: Great. Helpful. Thanks Jay.\nOperator: And next we have Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nJoshua Tilton: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. I kind of just wanted to follow up on the previous competition question, but just a little bit more broadly. Could you possibly kind of just comment on how have your number that's been trending? And how would you characterize your overall win rates across the entire market relative to maybe previous quarters? \nJay Chaudhry: Sorry the first one was how our numbers? \nJoshua Tilton: How are the number of your facts trending? Are you getting more opportunities less opportunities? How has that been trending over the last couple of months in previous quarters?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So first of all, driven by transformation deals there aren't too many cases where we do have active back off in the security space people are used to back off and all. We do less of that, because typically we go in we help drive transformation working with the CIO and going down from there. And in case we do have back off, you almost always went to a degree you don't really track how many wins we expect us to engage and win. The main reason -- if we don't win a deal, it's because we couldn't really get the thing can closed in the quarter. It moved down to the next quarter and the like. So probably getting delayed as part of the reason, it's not generally that competitive pressure is kind of hurting our business. We -- and as we grow more and more platforms -- and the market is shifting fast, it's no longer the days of '90s and early 2000, when it's the same place. And we look at it two years ago three years ago or when we did IPO, ZIA small piece was no different. Now ZIA is transformation bundle became a big thing now. ZIA, ZPA together. So every user could work from wherever. Then we move the game to have digital experience being part of the requirements and know workload and whatnot. So it's we think on the competitive stuff, we are good. We just need to make sure we keep on hiring and training people, to do this, top-down strategic sales.\nJoshua Tilton: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will hand the conference back over to Jay Chaudhry, for final comments.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you everybody for joining us and your continued interest in Zscaler. I also want to thank our customers, partners and employees who are helping us deliver strong fourth. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor events or to updating you next quarter on our continued progress. Thank you, again.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.\nBill Choi: Good bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. And have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you Jay. As Jay mentioned we are pleased with the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue for the quarter was $256 million up 11% sequentially and 63% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis revenue growth accelerated in the quarter driven by strong business activity. ZPA product revenue was 17% of total revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 35% and APJ was 14%. APJ continues to be our fastest-growing region with revenue growth of 16%. Our total calculated billings grew 59% year-over-year to $368 million with billings duration near the midpoint of our 10 months to 14 months range. We are also pleased to report 61% year-over-year growth in short-term billings. Remaining performance obligations or RPO were $1.95 billion as of January 31 growing 90% from one year ago. The current RPO is 50% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate which was again above 125%. We had 251 customers paying us more than $1 million annually up 85% from 136 in the prior year. The continued strength in this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added over 560 customers in the past 12 months paying us more than $100,000 annually ending the quarter at 1751 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q2 financial performance total gross margin of 80.4% was approximately flat quarter-over-quarter and down 90 basis points year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 13% sequentially and 62% year-over-year to $183 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue up 72% were similar to a year ago even as we made ongoing investments in smokescreen and trust-owned businesses we acquired in the second half of last year and was a partial return of T&E. Operating margin was 9% and free cash flow margin was 12%. We continue to expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be in the high single-digits for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.61 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Now moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount and amortization of intangible assets. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $270 million to $272 million reflecting a year-over-year growth of 53% to 54% gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products including ZDX, workload segmentation and CSPM will initially have lower gross margins within our core products because we are more focused on time to market and growth rather than optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $19 million to $20 million. As noted before we have more interest events starting this quarter including customer events, conferences, our internal midyear sales events, net loss and other income of $100,000, income taxes of $4 million earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.11 assuming 149 million to 150 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2022, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $1.045 billion to $1.05 billion or year-over-year growth of 55% to 56% increasing calculated billings to a range of $1.365 billion to $1.37 billion or year-over-year growth of 46% to 47%, increasing our operating profit to a range of $95 million to $98 million, increasing our earnings per share to a range of $0.54 to $0.56 assuming approximately 149 million to 150 million fully diluted shares. Please note that our share count guidance includes dilution from our convertible debentures based on the existing treasury method of accounting. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we're committed to investing aggressively in our company. We see a window of opportunity to extend our first-mover advantages in this fast-growing market, which will have positive long-term impacts. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing, but we'll continue to prioritize growth, which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. From a headcount perspective, we called out last quarter, so we had an outstanding quarter for few quota pass. We had an equally great quarter also in Q2. So our plans are to really push growth. We see this as a huge market opportunity. We're going to continue to do that and we're going to continue to hire across the company. Yes. I'll take it. So from a quota perspective, we are seeing people getting ramped quicker, but they're on full quota after one year. So that hasn't changed at all. Regarding sales capacity, I don't want to give percentages out. What I'd like to say is that that's a huge market opportunity and we see it. So we will continue to build sales capacity in our model. The one thing that we did call out in the last quarter or the quarter before, if we're growing over 30% on the top line revenue, you can expect less than 300 basis points operating margin expansion. Our view is that this is a huge market opportunity. And you're right, Alex. These results for accompanied our scale are outstanding. They're absolutely outstanding. But you've got billings growth at 59%, you've got short-term billings growth at 61%, and you look at a model that's got tremendous leverage in a market that's in my opinion huge. We're going to continue to really focus in on that top line and invest in our business. And we're very confident that we have the best product and a huge market opportunity. Yeah. I mean a lot of questions there. Let me try to answer it. So 59% billings growth, as you mentioned, is absolutely outstanding. If I take a look at Q2, if there's one area that didn't perform at the level that we bought it with, it was federal. Federal was low single-digit of our new and upsell business Now why is that? It's just the budget constraints basically. So our feeling is that, federal will be a big portion, or a substantial portion of our business. We got the FedRAMP certification. Also, we've built up a strong team with the relationships. So \u2013 but to call out one thing in the quarter that I would say, was didn't comment as we expected would be federal. It was low single digits. Regarding billings and revenue, as we go forward hard to say. It all depends on our really top level growth. Like I mentioned before, with Alex, it's a huge market opportunity. absolutely huge. We feel we're well positioned. We're seeing the traction with our customers. I believe we had 251 customers greater than the $1 million ARR, which is growth rate 85% over the prior year. Our customers appear than $100,000 ARR was like $1,750. So substantial growth also year-over-year, I think like 500 customers or something like that or 550. The market is there and we feel we have the solution. And again, from my perspective, the results that we put up were outstanding results. And again, the key thing for investors is that we're going to continue to invest in top line growth in the business. We see no reason to slow it down. We'll be cognizant related to operating profitability. But you're all aware base, the SaaS model with 80% gross margin, getting to operating profitability high operating profitability, it's not a difficult thing. Really trying to take advantage of this market is what we're after. Yeah. I mean the ARPU is definitely increasing and we'll be giving information on that on an annual basis. New versus upsell in the quarter was 45% new and 55% upsell. So a good quarter balance between new and upsell for us. Yeah, that's a great question. And if you take a look at our RPO growth year-over-year, it was about 90% and CRPO growth was 79%. What we've always called out when the RPO growth rates and CRPO growth rates are going just triple digit, we brought back investors and said billings is the best way to look at our business. And when you take a look at RPO and CRPO, they're more sensitive to the timing of large deals, the timing of renewals, contract durations and other specific terms. It's for these reasons that we want -- we feel the people should be looking at billings versus RPO or CRPO. Also our -- especially when we're in the range of 10 to 14 months. So -- and both in the quarter, our duration was right in the middle of the range of 10 to 14 months. One thing I'll also call out that investors probably look at is short-term billings growth. Our short-term billings growth was 61%. So I would look at everything as an investor but from a Zscaler perspective it's really billings. And if we're in that range 12 to 14 months it kind of bounces and then also short-term billings growth. Those are the key metrics. That takes all the noise level all the things going on with RPO and CRPO out of the equation. Yes. Let me first say we would like to be prudent with our projections. So, keep that in mind. If you take a look at our free cash flow margins in Q1, it was like in the 35% 36% range of revenue. In fiscal -- in Q2, our free cash flow margins were 12% with operating profitability at 9%. From my perspective, I just think it's just prudent to think about free cash flow being slightly higher three, four, five percentage points higher than operating profitability. It is going to fluctuate on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Our Q1 to Q3 are typically our highest quarter for free cash flow. The reason for that is that our Q2 to Q4 is our biggest billing quarters. So, you're collecting the cash in Q1 on Q3. As we get bigger, we build typically annually. So and that's -- when we talk about billings being a good metric in between that 10 and 14 months that's what we talk about. Certainly, we could increase free cash flow by doing multiyear billings but that's not our model. What we try to do is get a multiyear commitment contracts, which we have seen increase. But for free cash flow or billings, we typically say it on one year. Yes. I mean great question. Well four quarters in a row at this scale that 70% plus is outstanding is that sustainable? It's very hard to sustain that when you get to the size that we are. 59% billings growth is outstanding. If you take a look at some of our prior quarters, duration plays into that top line billing growth. If you look at short-term billings growth, it was 61%. And so if you go back in prior quarters, you'll see that's a 61% short-term billings growth it's a pretty good number a very good number. Going forward you've got our projections. We like being prudent with our projections. The key thing is that we see this as a huge market. And we're going to continue to invest and we're going to keep on driving that top line numbers. Those numbers for revenue and billing and short-term billings. And then because the value that you get in driving that top line number, the leverage you get is huge. Because in a SaaS model with the contribution margin in that 60% range for years two and three, it doesn't take long to get to the operating profitability. So building up your ARR is really, really important in getting that market share and being the dominant player. That's our focus. Yes. I mean in the quarter all segments grew well. But given our strength in large deals during the quarter the large enterprise did better. I'll answer the first part and Jay can answer the part about the deals. But typically federal has been mid-single-digit. Sometimes even high single-digits. But I don't recall Patrick what it was last year. But you can think of federal being mid-single-digit on average contribution of our quarterly new and upsell business and this quarter to a low single-digits. I'll just call out one quarter that I'm aware of which is Q3 of last year. Q3 of last year in that 10- to 14-month range, it was close to that 14-month range in Q3. So that's the duration impact Q3 of last year which I can recall. Regarding NRR, new products. The comment that we made last quarter is that if it's over 125%, we're not going to give out specifically what the NRR is. It was over 125% in the quarter, but our new products are doing well. I mean our new products are doing well as well as ZPA. And those are very big contributors related to that NRR. If I may add we expect NRR to do well. But having said that, it's one of those things we see the bigger bundles we sell upfront, the lower NRR. Or if we do the first deal today and in two quarters we do the second upsell deal, that doesn't really get picked up in NRR. So, happy with NRR. But in the past we kind of said that, we don't really try to focus too much on NRR. That's why we gave you 125% of higher as a good indicator."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. I'm pleased to share our strong results for fiscal Q2. We continue to see strong demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform, as our customers embrace the cloud. We delivered 63% year-over-year revenue growth and 59% billings growth, while also generating over 50% growth in operating profits and free cash flow. Public SaaS companies are happy to get to rule of 40, while we have been exceeding the rule of 70 for the last 12 months, validating our strong execution in pursuing our large market opportunity. Our continued investment in scaling, our engineering and go-to-market machines is yielding the best revenue growth we have had in three years even as we surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue. We plan to keep on making substantial investments across the company to continue our rapid pace of innovation and growth. What we deliver with our platform is critical to our customers' highest priorities. This is reflected in our deal sizes, which are increasing due to our success with large enterprises who are buying more of our expanding platform with a significant growth in the number of new logo and upsell customers for orders with over $1 million in annual value. We now have over 250 customers exceeding $1 million in ARR an increase of 85% year-over-year. Business momentum for a zero plus exchange is strong due to the market need for a modern security architecture in the world of cloud and mobility. Our flagship ZIA offering has been growing very well as we continue to expand our cyber and data protection services. ZPA has emerged as our second flagship offering, supporting millions of users and the majority of our Global 2000 customers. We are the clear market leader in zero trust application access with proven maturity and scalability. With ZIA and ZPA, we had demonstrated our success implementing zero trust for users. Our next immediate big opportunity is to bring zero trust to workloads in our ZCP pillar powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. In addition, our ZDX pillar is enabling a highly productive workforce and it is seeing strong demand. In a single integrated cloud platform, our zero trust exchange provides secure any-to-any connectivity for users, applications, workloads, and IoT and OT systems regardless of their location. While many vendors claim to offer a platform because they bought a bunch of point products that are very hard to integrate, no one comes close to the capabilities of our cloud native extensible platform. We will continue to invest in engineering, customer support, marketing, and sales to accelerate the growth offer new products, while keeping the strong momentum on our flagship products. We believe we are in a sustained high demand environment. We have a large and expanding market opportunity powered by our customers' digital transformation journeys, which continue at a place never seen before. According to IDG's recent state of the CIO report, the top CEO mandate for IT in 2022 is to upgrade cybersecurity to reduce business risk. Whether it is supporting remote work, all enabling new digital customer and employee experiences, IT leaders must ensure that business operations are agile, resilient, and secure. Given the explosion in ransomware and high-profile data breaches, IT leaders are looking to phase out castle and moat security to adopt zero trust architecture to unlock the full points of digital transformation. It is clear from our growth in our large enterprise wins that architecture matters. Despite legacy vendors marketing claims, true zero trust security can be built on legacy network security architecture. As I have highlighted before, there are two reasons why enterprises are selecting Zscaler. One, we are the only proven cloud security provider with a proxy architecture that inspects TLS encrypted traffic at scale to deliver superior security. We connect users to applications and not to the network, eliminating laterals at moment. This is a core principle of zero trust architecture that can't be achieved by next-gen firewalls or cloud VPNs. Let me discuss some of our Q2 deal wins that highlight the advantages of our Zero Trust Exchange. I will start with a big ZIA event. A Fortune 100 professional searches customer initially purchased our ZIA transmission bundle plus CASB and DLP and ZDX for 125,000 employees working from anywhere. This quarter, they added 175,000 ZIA seats to secure all 300,000 employees. With a cloud-first strategy and mission-critical client-facing data at stake, they selected our proven scalable platform with a global footprint needed to support their business in over 150 countries, with 93% of their Internet traffic encrypted, TLS inspection was a major requirement and the customer only considered a proxy architecture. Next is a new logo customer and started with ZPA as part of a strategic initiative to transform their IT infrastructure. This global 50 manufacturer, headquartered in Europe purchased ZPA for 200,000 users to implement zero trust secure. ZPA will eliminate their attack surface, protecting thousands of private applications behind our Zero Plus Exchange. Hence their apps can't be discovered Exploited or DDoS. We are replacing their firewall-based VPN that allow lateral type movement. A global systems integrator partner, who is implementing the overall transformation project, played a major role in driving the Zscaler win, an example of the channel leverage we are creating with our investments in our SI partners. As the shift to the cloud accelerates, customers are buying ZIA and ZPA together, enabling a true transformation with direct and seamless access to SaaS and private applications whether on-prem or in the public cloud. Let me highlight several such deals. In a new logo win a Fortune 50 insurance customer signed a full year commitment for ZIA, ZPA and ZDX to securely enable 65,000 employees working from anywhere or comprehensive cyber and data protection, they purchased the high-end transformation bundle plus CASB, advanced DLP and SSBM or SaaS security portal management which is like CSPM for SaaS. Fast user experience and superior cybersecurity were the key factors are our win. In another new customer win a, Fortune 500 Fintech Company that has grown through acquisitions signed a nearly five-year commitment to up-level security and simplify IT. They purchased ZIA transformation plus CASB and DLP as well as DPA and ZDX for 60,000 employees. This consolidated seven different security point products and accelerates the closure of the 24 data centers. Moreover, ZPA also shortens new employee onboarding to a few days from 2.5 months. It also eliminates the need many of the employees had for two laptops to access two separate networks. I'm also excited about our success selling security transformation in new countries, a global 500 manufacturer headquartered in Mexico purchased ZIA and ZDX for over 18,000 users and ZPA for 14000 users. This is our first seven-figure annual deal in Latin America, a region where we recently started making investments. Next M&A is an elegant use case for the Zscaler platform. In an upsell deal diversified industrial conglomerate with over 20 operating companies that previously purchased ZIA Transformation Bundle added ZPA for 16000 users to accelerate M&A integration and reduce business risk without having to connect two corporate networks with legacy firewalls, which could have taken 14 months or more our Zero Trust Exchange provided secure access to applications across both companies in weeks saving time and money. This customer purchased a high-end ZPA bundle with integrated browser isolation to enhance data protection. They also bought our deception technology to intercept bad actors, who may have infiltrated the network. This latest purchase more than doubled their annual spend with us. Next let me highlight customers purchasing all four pillars of our platform. In a new logo win a Global 2000 leader in technology products purchased ZIA transformation with DLP and CASB, ZPA and ZDX for 11000 employees and ZCP workload posture for 6000 workloads in multi-cloud environment. As we accelerate the digital transformation the CIO's core priority was to eliminate the risk of legacy VPNs and natural tech movement while ensuring the best user experience. They put ZDX to the test by asking us to troubleshoot poor Microsoft 365 experience of an executive traveling in Europe. ZDX mapped the entire network path over the Internet in real time isolating specific issues and allowing the customer to quickly resolve the issue and improve the user experience. This proof of value led to the quick ZDX purchase. I believe that over time every ZIA and ZPA customer will embrace ZDX as workforce productivity is one of the highest priorities for a CIO. Lastly, I'm happy with our early success in expanding our routes to market via cloud marketplaces. First with AWS and now with Azure. Let me highlight two Azure marketplace deals. First, an existing global 200 pharma customer with headquarters in Europe purchased ZPA for all 87000 employees enabling Zero Trust access to the private apps posted in hybrid cloud environments. This purchase was done with just a couple of mouse clicks and it doubled the annual spend with us. Second, a new Fortune 500 customer in the energy industry made a three-year eight-figure commitment for ZIA ZPA and ZDX for all 23,000 employees. We will continue to invest in cloud marketplaces as a new channel to revenue. Enterprises trust Zscaler over cold imitators and new entrants because we have a true Zero Trust architecture and have over 10 years of operational experience, running the largest security cloud in the world. Our Zero Trust Exchange processes over 210 billion transactions in line and prevents more than seven billion security and policy violations per day, providing our customers an unmatched network effect for superior security to flawlessly run the world's largest security cloud with five 9s [ph] of availability requires more than security expertise. It requires networking expertise and the ability to control the traffic pass. As Zscaler was born as a cloud company and has been operating an in-line cloud since 2008. We have gained this expertise over time. There's no compression algorithm for years of experience. This expertise will become even more important, as we address hundreds of millions of workloads and billions of OT IoT devices. Let me share an example of our cloud operations differentiation. Microsoft extended direct fiber connectivity from the major data centers to ours because of the volume of traffic that flows between Zscaler and Microsoft. This direct connectivity enables us to deliver higher reliability and performance and the traditional Internet exchange peering approach. This is a validation of our scale and the criticality of our services to our mutual customers. Another example of delivering great availability and high performance is our integrations with Microsoft and Zoom. With API-based integration for Teams and Zoom, we proactively identify and resolve performance issues for these latency-sensitive apps. Without which user collaboration is disrupted and business productivity is lost. Our proven track record running the world's largest in-line security cloud makes Zscaler the obvious and trusted partner of choice, but enterprises need to securely access mission-critical applications. Let me also talk about our recognized market and innovation leadership. Zscaler pioneered the zero trust architecture. And over time, our platform subsume functionality of multiple point products into our secure Web gateway foundation as the market evolves and customers migrated towards a platform approach such as Zscaler. Gartner expanded the scope of the Secure Web Gateway NQ to include functionalities such as CASB, ZTNA, Digital Experience Monitoring and Browser Isolation and renamed it SSE or Security Service Edge. After 10 consecutive years of being named a leader in Gartner's MQ for secure web gateway, we were again named a market leader for SSE. Many of you are aware of SASE. So how are SASE and SSE related? SASE framework is the combination of SSE and WAN Edge. SSE has all the security capabilities built on zero trust architecture and is independent of the type of network. WAN Edge which is generally SD-WAN provides connectivity to an SSE cloud. Importantly Zero Trust security is implemented in the SSE cloud, not in the WAN Edge. As the category leader in SSE with the widest and deepest offerings Zscaler is the go-to platform for vendor consolidation cost savings increased user productivity and better cyber protection. As our market opportunities expand we are promoting two strong leaders to continue scaling Zscaler. We're expanding Amit Sinha's role to President of the company. Amit will continue to lead our engineering and cloud operations teams, while also assuming broad responsibilities for expansion of our platform into new areas. We are also promoting Dali Rajic to Chief Operating Officer. Dali will continue to lead our global sales organization while also assuming broader responsibilities for interlocking among sales, marketing, business development and transformation teams to further enhance the customers' life cycle journey. In their new roles, Amit and Dali will be responsive to driving further growth operational excellence and collaboration across the scale, as we continue the path towards our next milestone of $5 billion in ARR. To enable our customers' ever-growing digital transformation aspirations and extend our market leadership, our entire organization is focused on attracting and developing talent and creating a culture that rewards innovation at all levels. We added approximately 1000 employees globally in the last six months and have over 4000 employees who are energized by our shared mission to create a hyperconnected digital world in which the exchange of information is always secure and seamless. In today's competitive hiring market Zscaler is a destination for top talent. We are proud of our Glassdoor rating which is among the highest in the industry. Zscaler has never been stronger and I believe we have a large and growing opportunity in front of us. Now I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Andrew, it's a little bit early to tell the impact, but our customers are concerned. There's higher cyber sensitivity. I was talking to a CXO from Germany earlier today and he actually opened the call I had with him with this topic. And customers want to make sure they're secure. And one of the things we think is going to help us directly is ZPA, which can hide our attack surface. If you can't see something, you can't attack it. And ZIA becomes more important for all the in-line protection. Our research team is seeing signals of increased reconnaissance activity, that's increasing for the past few weeks. We have a 100% research team and we're making them available as a resource to our customers. Well, thank you, multi-part question. So first of all, let me start by saying that we are very pleased that we have been able to do good hiring in this though hiring environment, because we are a top destination for top talent. So hiring is obviously the starting point. Two, I think, beyond doing a number of things that need to be done to make sure these people can be easily incorporated in the company. And in the past, we talked about a very strong enablement team, a number of boot camps for training we do and buddy systems realign. So a number of things are doing to make sure these people are becoming part of it. And the zones we have shown over the past two years show that in this COVID environment, we have been able to do a good job in making them productive. Remo, next part. The only comment I'll add next to it is it's not just ASMs that matter for us. Our top-down strategic sales process requires solution architects we have transmission team of CIOs, CSOs and CTOs. They all play an important role and we're doing well across the board in hiring. Thank you. Let me start. In my prepared remarks, I covered so many deals where ZIA, ZPA, ZDX worked together and a number of deals with all four product fillers were bought. So we're actually very happy with the traction we're seeing. You've seen over the past couple of years that ZIA, ZPA common together has become a fairly common thing. And on ZDX for the last one year has becoming more and more common, we've seen lots and lots of customers buying ZDX because without this you can't troubleshoot if something goes on somebody. And ZCP is becoming an interesting seating opportunity for us because that's an early market for the workloads. And we are position ourselves well to grow it. So we feel very good about the cross side. Remo, can give further color to it? It's a very good question. Workload segmentation is only one peace offering. And the core, the basic offering is what we call zero trust for workloads. Workloads are a mirror image of users. Like users they talk to Internet. And like users talk to workloads, workloads also talk to other workloads. So, we've taken our disruptive zero trust users the ZIA, ZPA and apply to workloads. So, today what's done to really secure workloads in the cloud? It's largely VM version of firewalls. There's a firewall before you got the internet. There's a firewall before you go to another region and so on and so forth. We believe we will disrupt the workload-based security the same way we did it for users with the ZIA, ZPA. So, it's an asset opportunity. I highlighted a number of deals where actually multiple products got bought together including ZCP. Some of these deals included a Fortune 500 semiconductor company, a Fortune 500 financial service company, a global logistics company. Now, I would say that customers do start small in the cloud workload area and then they grow with us. Hi, this is Jay. Enterprise segment which we define as 2,000 to 6,000 employees per company is progressing very well and we continue to make significant investments in growing the team. Moving to small enterprises is a natural step for us. It's an attractive market. And it's also a market where channel can play a bigger role and some in channel program has been helping us quite a bit. So we plan to continue to invest and grow the same. Remo, do you want to add anything too? And in terms of pipeline and deals is growing. Pipeline is going. We are well engaged. We're seeing more momentum coming from some of the new memos and initiatives being put in place. We got the architecture. We got certain certifications. I think one thing remains a little unpredictable is some of the federal budgets and the timings. Yes. So, it's a good question. So first of all, it is the sales force with all the processes and enablement we put in place has helped us grow exceptionally well over these -- over the past 2.5, three years since we put this new motion in place. That's number one. Number two. I think at that time, we are merely focused on the higher end of the market largely major in our lease. Now we expanded further down to enterprise as well, which is doing quite well. As you would expect some cycle is lower towards the lower end of the market. It remains fairly on the high end of the market. It is a transformation sale. It involves CIO, CISO, CTO multiple parties. But as we go in be engaged, we end up winning back. And not only that we start, wherever we're going in these accounts, we are so sticky that we keep on upselling and growing. So I'm very confident very comfortable. Obviously, as numbers are growing bigger, we need to do -- keep on doing the same thing. The market is there. Product portfolio is there. We have no competitive pressure, and it really needs to keep on executing. I think we're doing a good job and we'll keep on driving and we have good margins at the gross margin level to keep an investment. I would say, we haven't come and said they are reduced by x percent but I would say, it's a range we have always said the lower smaller deals was three to six months and bigger are from six to 12 months. It's getting bigger, probably there's a movement for the lower side of it. But deals come in many shapes and sizes. So they are all of it, but we are -- we have a very rapidly growing pipeline and our close rates are pretty good as well. So, I feel very bullish and comfortable. Right. It's a good question. So first of all the MQ is not just the lower market, MQ across the board probably more relevant in the larger markets to some degree because larger companies tend to be Gartner customers. But I would say frankly I was surprised to see that the twin CASB vendors listed in the leaders quadrant because we don't see them in the real world out there. So, if I were to quibble with a criteria that Gartner use I believe it was overweight on CASB which is much easier to build it's out of band and it was underway from secure web gateway which is foundation of zero trust and much harder to build because it is in line. In our customer base we are replacing lots of CASB point products that have been sold over the years. And you look at our platform, it has expanded significantly ZIA, ZPA, ZDX, ZCP and all. Now second question related to smaller enterprises, right? There we do see more vendors in low end of the enterprise than we saw -- when we see on the high end higher are very savvy. They rule out actually some of the vendors who don't have the right architecture and they also look for operational excellence. Yesterday I had a call with the CIO of a large financial services company. He wanted to start the discussion by saying this, I see so many vendors that keep on coming and talking about all kind of feature and functionality. And when I talked to their operational experience running the cloud, they don't want to have much to talk about. Well, they don't because they haven't really done it before. So operational experience is becoming more and more important as some of these -- you have seen issues with AWS to Azure AD and some of those stuff out there. But on the lower end we do see firewall vendors is cost of the world some of the other new entrants. But once we engage and we win almost every time. Typically, in the past we had less presence in enterprise but now we are actually engaged in putting more resources in the lower end of the market and winning. It's a growth area for us. Sorry the first one was how our numbers? Yes. So first of all, driven by transformation deals there aren't too many cases where we do have active back off in the security space people are used to back off and all. We do less of that, because typically we go in we help drive transformation working with the CIO and going down from there. And in case we do have back off, you almost always went to a degree you don't really track how many wins we expect us to engage and win. The main reason -- if we don't win a deal, it's because we couldn't really get the thing can closed in the quarter. It moved down to the next quarter and the like. So probably getting delayed as part of the reason, it's not generally that competitive pressure is kind of hurting our business. We -- and as we grow more and more platforms -- and the market is shifting fast, it's no longer the days of '90s and early 2000, when it's the same place. And we look at it two years ago three years ago or when we did IPO, ZIA small piece was no different. Now ZIA is transformation bundle became a big thing now. ZIA, ZPA together. So every user could work from wherever. Then we move the game to have digital experience being part of the requirements and know workload and whatnot. So it's we think on the competitive stuff, we are good. We just need to make sure we keep on hiring and training people, to do this, top-down strategic sales. Thank you. Thank you everybody for joining us and your continued interest in Zscaler. I also want to thank our customers, partners and employees who are helping us deliver strong fourth. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor events or to updating you next quarter on our continued progress. Thank you, again."

Now I will turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. Building on our incredible momentum from last year, we had an exceptionally strong start to fiscal \u201822. In Q1, we delivered 62% revenue growth and 71% billings growth, while generating record operating profits and free cash flow. We are again seeing strong revenue growth across all verticals, customer segments and geographies, with over half of our revenue coming from outside the U.S. We recently achieved a significant milestone of surpassing $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, while continuing rapid growth. In my recent dialogues with hundreds of CISOs and CIOs, eight out of 10 are looking to phase out legacy network security in favor of zero trust architecture, due to increasing cyber security risks and accelerating digital transformation initiatives.  I will highlight two main reasons why enterprises are selecting Zscaler over legacy solutions: One, we saw a more than 300% year-over-year increase in sophisticated threats hidden in SSL-encrypted traffic. A large number of them are ransomware attacks and most would bypass next-gen firewalls, which aren\u2019t designed to inspect encrypted traffic at scale. We are the only cloud provider with a proxy architecture designed to inspect SSL-encrypted traffic at scale to deliver better security. This year, our cloud has blocked more than 20 billion threats hidden in encrypted traffic. Two, by connecting users only to applications and not to the network, a core principle of zero trust architecture. We eliminate lateral threat movement, hence reducing ransomware attacks such as the Colonial Pipeline breach. In contrast, firewalls and VPNs connect users to the network, enabling lateral threat movement. It is clear from our growth and enterprise wins that architecture matters and Zero Trust security can\u2019t be built on legacy network security architecture. This gives us long-term advantage. Turning to the quarter, let me discuss two factors that drove our performance: One, we saw continued strength in new and upsell bookings of over $1 million in annual value. We drove 87% year-over-year growth in customers exceeding $1 million in ARR, ending with over 220 of these customers.  Two, the expansion down-market to Enterprise segment, organizations with 2,000 to 6,000 employees, is scaling and it remains our fastest-growing segment. With increasing contribution from the Enterprise segment, the total number of customers who pay us more than $100,000 per year is up 53% year-over-year to over 1,600. Our 71% billings growth this quarter speaks to the commitment that customers are making to our Zero Trust Exchange platform. As we have noted before, the purchase of ZIA is often the first step to adopting our platform. Let me share a couple of ZIA-driven deals. A Fortune 50 insurance company purchased ZIA transformation bundle with cloud firewall and sandbox plus DLP and CASB for data protection to secure 170,000 employees and affiliated agents working from anywhere. This customer wanted secure and fast access to Internet and SaaS applications, particularly Microsoft 365 and Teams. Connecting to Zscaler\u2019s nearest edge cloud where we have direct peering with hundreds of application providers, the users are seeing a 75% improvement in response time. Next, a leading defense industry integrator purchased ZIA for 200,000 users, plus workload protection for Internet traffic. Our ZIA platform, which recently achieved FedRAMP High Ready status will help them meet many requirements for CMMC, a cybersecurity standard for defense contractors.  Zscaler is consolidating the several point products, simplifying the network, enforcing consistent cyber policy across multiple business units while reducing operational costs. We believe these large deals show that we are the only multi-tenant, zero trust platform meeting the needs of major enterprises to transform the legacy hub-and-spoke network and castle-and-moat security. With customers shifting to the cloud, more are buying ZIA and ZPA together, enabling a true transformation with direct and seamless access through SaaS and private applications, whether on-prem or in public cloud. Here are a few examples.  A Fortune 500 banking customer signed a four-year commitment for three key pillars of our platform. Their existing ZIA contract was upgraded to include cloud firewall, sandbox, DLP, CASB and browser isolation. They also purchased ZPA for all 100,000 employees to implement app segmentation without having to implement legacy network segmentation.  In addition, ZDX was purchased to identify and help remediate application, network or end-point issues to ensure great user experience and employee productivity regardless of their location. This deal more than tripled the customer\u2019s annual spend with us, having adopted our full portfolio for user protection. We are now discussing zero trust security for workloads with this customer. Next, in a new logo win, a Fortune 100 insurance customer purchased ZIA Transformation bundle and ZPA for all 30,000 employees to pursue their cloud-first strategy. With cyber protection as a major requirement, this customer only considered a proxy architecture to perform SSL inspection at scale and rejected firewall-based architectures.  ZPA will eliminate their attack surface, hiding their thousands of private applications behind our Zero Trust Exchange, hence they can\u2019t be discovered, exploited or DDoS\u2019d. We are consolidating at least three vendor point products, materially reducing complexity and operating cost. Our integration with CrowdStrike and Microsoft was also an important consideration for them. Next, one of the powerful use cases for ZIA and ZPA is to accelerate M&A integration with significant ROI. An existing European based Global 500 manufacturing customer purchased ZIA Transformation bundle for 30,000 employees of a newly acquired business, and ZPA for 50,000 users to accelerate the M&A integration. The legacy approach to providing access to private applications post acquisition requires integrating two complex corporate networks, which they expected to take 18 months or more, without having to connect two corporate networks. Zscaler\u2019s approach provided secure access to SaaS or private applications across both companies in weeks, saving time and money. After having disrupted perimeter-based security for users with our Zero Trust Exchange, we are bringing zero trust to workloads with Zscaler Cloud Protection. Let me highlight a few ZCP wins: An existing ZIA and ZPA State government customer purchased Workload Segmentation for over 4,500 workloads, along with ZDX and CASB for their 28,000 employees. This was a seven-figure annual contract value, driven by our Emerging Products. Implementing Zero Trust for workloads will reduce their cyber risk by achieving micro-segmentation without doing legacy network segmentation. Moving on to our Workload Posture offering. We are seeing increased interest from customers in CSPM for configurations and CIEM for entitlements. During the quarter, a tech company bought CSPM for over 9,000 workloads and a software enterprise bought CIEM for 5,000 workloads.  Our Workload Communication offerings, powered by ZIA and ZPA technology, is building momentum with additional customer wins in the quarter. For example, a healthcare customer purchased workload communication for 3,500 workloads and a Financial Services customer purchased it for 1,000 workloads. When you look at these wins, our success starts with true zero trust architecture which is the opposite of firewalls and VPNs. Our Zero Trust Exchange is the largest in-line cloud security platform in the world, processing over 200 billion transactions per day, which doubled in the last 18 months, and is preventing more than 7 billion security and policy violations per day. This massive amount of traffic provides us 300 trillion signals per day to feed our machine learning and AI engines, resulting in superior threat protection and better detection of user and application traffic anomalies.  This network effect is a big competitive advantage for us. Each of our 150-plus data centers receives a continuous stream of more than 200,000 unique security updates every day. This can\u2019t be done with a single-tenant VM-based architecture that legacy security vendors are running on public clouds and calling SASE. This is only possible with the purpose-built, highly scalable cloud that Zscaler built from day one. I am very proud of our pace of innovation that delivers value to our customers. Let me share a few stats for the quarter: ZIA delivered 29 agile releases and ZPA delivered 44 agile releases. Each product pillar delivered scores of new features and enhancements. Our ThreatLabz security research team discovered and delivered over 495,000 new advanced threat indicators and signatures to our global cloud. In addition, our cutting-edge security research scientists discovered and reported 18 new zero-day vulnerabilities. These are testimonials of the sophistication and scale of our research team. A great platform combined with a great research team, enables us to deliver great cyber protection to our customers. Let me highlight some of the significant features we delivered in Q1. We enhanced our out-of-band CASB to support additional SaaS applications. We see more customers buying our CASB along with ZIA and replacing their existing CASB point product. We added optical character recognition technology to our DLP offering, addressing data loss problem for images in files like PDFs. This feature combined with previously released Exact Data Match and Indexed Data Match technology, makes us the leading data protection platform. We integrated our recently acquired Smokescreen active defense technology with ZPA, making it easier for customers to deploy and manage it from a single console. The pace of innovation for our newer pillars like ZDX and ZCP is accelerating. For example, one of the most demanded ZDX features is real-time performance monitoring for Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which we delivered by working closely with Zoom and Microsoft through API-integration. We added over 150 features to ZDX in the past 12 months, delighting our customers. One customer said, and I quote, \u201cWe now have unprecedented visibility into the environment. We can respond faster and forecast where we may have issues and address those areas before they become a problem.\u201d I want to highlight another increasingly important area, helping our customers achieve their ESG goals. Our highly efficient cloud replaces hundreds of thousands of on-prem appliances and eliminates the need to buy more in the future, resulting in the significant decrease in the energy resources and carbon emissions associated with building, transporting, powering and cooling them. As you may have seen from a recent press release, our cloud platform now uses 100% renewable energy. As part of this effort, we have a cross-functional team with oversight from the Board to drive our sustainability strategy. Zscaler has never been stronger, and I believe we have an incredible opportunity in front of us. We have our sight set on the next milestone, growing our ARR to $5 billion.  I believe the key to sustained growth in our next stage is to accelerate the broader adoption of our platform. Our Zero Trust Exchange platform, with four major pillars, provides a comprehensive foundation for securing and improving application access in the world of cloud and mobility. With ZIA and ZPA, we have proven our success implementing zero trust for users. Our next immediate opportunity is to bring zero trust to workloads, powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology.  As we shared in our DU highlights, we are seeing solid traction with ZDX and ZCP, the newest growth vectors for the company. We are seeing increasing average revenue per customer, and we estimate a 6x growth opportunity on upsell with our current customers. From presales to deployment and customer success, we have a sophisticated sales machine to sell value and deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level. Over the next several years, our innovation engine will further build out the breadth and depth of our platform, extending our already substantial technology lead. We are also pursuing some very exciting opportunities to extend zero trust to operational technology or OT systems, with manufacturing leaders like Siemens. In summary, we are very excited about our future and we believe we are still in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to accelerate secure digital transformation. Now, I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. \nRemo Canessa : Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue for the quarter was $231 million, up 17% sequentially and 62% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, revenue growth accelerated in the quarter driven by strong business activity. ZPA product revenue was 16% of total revenue.  From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 35% and APJ was 14%. Our investments in APJ are bearing fruit with greater than 100% revenue growth in that region. Our total calculated billings grew 71% year-over-year to $248 million, with billings duration at the high end of our 10 to14 months range. We had several customers choosing to pay upfront for their multi-year contracts. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we do not offer any special incentives for upfront payments.  We are also pleased to report 68% year-over-year growth in short-term billings. I would note that both billings and revenue benefited from a $1.5 million one-off deal in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, were $1.71 billion as of October 31, up 97% from one year ago. The current RPO is 50% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which was above 125% in the quarter and higher than the 128% we reported last quarter. As we have discussed before, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter and is not a metric we manage our business towards.  We focus on growing our net new business without incentivizing differently between new or upsell. We have a strong base of large and growing enterprise customers, which provides us with significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. Considering these factors, we believe NRR above 125% is truly outstanding for us. We had 224 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 87% from 120 in the prior year. The continued strength in this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers\u2019 digital transformation initiatives. We also added over 550 customers paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the quarter at 1,616 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.6% was approximately flat quarter-to-quarter and down 50 basis points year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 17% sequentially and 69% year-over-year to $162 million.  Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by approximately 3 percentage points from 67% a year ago to 70% in the quarter, primarily due to increased hiring, higher compensation expenses, investments in SmokeScreen and Trustdome businesses we acquired in the second half of last year, and a partial return of T&E.  Operating margin was 10% and free cash flow margin was 36%, which benefited from the timing of CapEx spend. We continue to expect CapEx as percentage revenue to be high-single digits for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Please note that net other income includes an $800,000 loss primarily related to the change in value of our assets denominated in Euro and British Pound as the U.S. dollar strengthened.  To minimize such impact going forward, we recently implemented a hedging program for our balance sheet. As a reminder, we primarily transact sales globally in U.S. dollars, and several quarters ago we put in place a hedging program for our international operating expenses. For income taxes, our tax expenses primarily represent international taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions we do business in. For several APJ countries, there is a withholding tax on sales made to customers in those countries. As our APJ business has grown significantly in recent quarters, the withholding taxes were $1.5 million in Q1. Now moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount and amortization of intangible assets. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $240 million to $242 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 53% to 54%, gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products, because we are more focused on time-to-market and growth rather than optimizing for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $20 million to $21 million, net loss on other income of $100,000, income taxes of $4 million, earnings per share of approximately $0.11, assuming 150 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2022 we are increasing our revenue to a range of $1 billion to $1.01 billion or year-over-year growth of 49% to 50%, increasing calculated billings to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.305 billion or year-over-year growth of 39% to 40%. We now expect our first half mix to be approximately 43% to 44% of our full year billings. Increasing our operating profit to a range of $90 million to $93 million, based on the return of the in- person conferences and events, we expect operating margin to decline sequentially in Q3 before improving in Q4. Updating our earnings per share to a range of $0.50 to $0.52 assuming approximately 150 million to 151 million fully diluted shares. Please note that our share count guidance now includes dilution from our convertible debentures. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we are committed to investing aggressively in our company. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing, but we will continue to prioritize growth which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. Operator you may now open the call for questions. \nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. \nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats on a really strong quarter. Jay, I wanted to start with you. You\u2019ve had a lot of success here recently, and you talked on the call about the path from $1 billion ARR to 5 billion in ARR. You talked about some of the building blocks, but I wonder if you could put a finder point on how you get there and do you have - currently have the products in place to get to that very large goal?\nJay Chaudhry: The short answer is yes. And let me expand upon it. If you look at our current main products, ZIA, ZPA, which have been our flagship products, there is a fair amount of upsell opportunity to our current base. We are going to share that. With upsell, we could actually take up ARR 6x. Of course, the norms just wait for upsell. We are focused on adding new customers as well.  We have decent penetration on the high end, Fortune 500 companies, 35%, Global 2000 were 25%. That means there is a big market still for us to deploy and these, especially high end customers look for a proxy-based architecture and zero trust architecture.  And then on top of that are our two other solutions, Zero Trust for workloads that has been just coming out early stage, and we\u2019re also moving into Zero Trust for IOT and OT leveraging the core technology we have in place. And then on top of that is the newly emerging markets for workloads, security posture, entitlement, commissions and the like, and we did a couple of small acquisitions in that area. We are building upon it and growing it.  So I do see security market rapidly changing. We believe all segments that we know today will no longer be there, they will disappear over time and we have a lead, significant lead over others to keep on building more. So I feel pretty comfortable and confident to be able to get to our $5 billion ARR target and beyond. \nRemo Canessa: Yes. Just to add, Jay, just a little bit \u2013 yes, just to add a little bit there. Our SAM is $72 billion. And as we talked about it in our Analyst Day, it does not include other areas which we are making investments, I mean areas such as 5G or OT, IoT, B2B, B2C. So it\u2019s \u2013 and what\u2019s interesting is that this market has really changed over the years from what it was even 10 years ago and certainly 20 years ago where lot of legacy basically technology exists still today.  There's a huge market opportunity. And one of the things we've done within the company and we\u2019ve talked about, is that we're going to prioritize growth over operating profitability. And one of the areas that we're making significant investment is in our go-to-market.  So we've made significant investments in the past. We'll continue to make significant investments and in that go-to-market, it's really three-pronged; you\u2019ve got sales, you've got marketing, you got channel.  Sales organization we've been making significant investments the last few years and you can see the fruits of what our sales organization has done. We hired recently about a year ago, or a little less than a year ago, CMO, and he\u2019s doing absolutely outstanding. We are making significant investment in channel.  With that also as we\u2019ve talked about trying to get to or getting to a much larger company, we are going to be making investments throughout the company to build the foundation and the strength and efficiencies. So we are in a unique provision and that really created in my opinion a revolutionary technology with a platform that was created 12 years ago that addresses this market pretty much head on. \nMatt Hedberg: And thanks for that last bid. That's actually a dovetail into the second question. I mean, it looks like you guys had a lot of hiring this quarter. Obviously Q1, I can imagine you won a front-end loads on your hiring. Can you talk about the rev capacity coming out of Q1 and how you kind of think about adds throughout the balance of the fiscal year?\nRemo Canessa: We're going to continue to add aggressively throughout the year. Our net ads that we had in Q1 was over 450 employees, about half of those ads were in sales and marketing. From a field quota sales rep perspective, the comments we made before was that we\u2019d hire more field sales reps this year in fiscal \u201822 versus fiscal \u201921. We're certainly on pace to do that, and also in Q1, we had a near record quarter for RSM or filed quota sales rep ads. We see Zscaler\u2019s destination. And so, related to your question, how we're going to do going forward, like I said before, we are going to privatize growth and we are going to hire aggressively and we're going to try to really go after this market. \nMatt Hedberg: Congrats, guys.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is now open. \nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, and yeah, and congratulations on the strong results. So I know you hit like a kind of high level drivers. I\u2019d just be curious on the product level, what surprised you most of the upside this quarter? Was it more on the core ZIA and ZPA side? Or was it more on the emerging product slide of the portfolio?\nJay Chaudhry: All products actually did well. I mean this was a stellar quarter, whether you look at the product side or you look at the geo side or you look at market segment side. There are a couple of deals we highlighted in my earnings call. Actually, there\u2019s big ZIA in that deal are actually still coming up really strong. Sometimes people think that ZIA kind of started early, it may be kind of slowing down, but we aren\u2019t seeing slowdown in ZIA, ZPA is ramping pretty rapidly, growing pretty fast. And ZDX is actually, is probably the most sought after product in the market, especially with Zoom and Teams kind of issues that are almost impossible to decipher and figure out the big integration we did at a very rapid pace in the past few months, and we announced that publicly a couple of weeks ago, that with the help of Microsoft and Zoom both, we did API-based integration. So across the board, I think it's a wonderful, hard to kind of pin point one product area.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah, from a geographic perspective, what I'd like to do is call out APJ, they did absolutely outstanding. And what we've talked about before also is one of your areas that we are going to invest more in, is in APJ, in particular, Japan. And so, if you look at our performance, APJ was very, very strong for us. But as Jay mentioned, across the board, it was an outstanding quarter. \nGray Powell: Got it. Okay, that's really helpful. I'll leave it there. \nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is now open. \nAlex Henderson: Thanks guys. Thank you very much, outstanding quarter. I didn't catch a growth rate or percentage of revenues come from ZDX or ZCP if you have one of those, that would be great.  My question is predominantly the commentary about your conversations with these CIOs, CTOs, CISOs. Clearly, the move to Cloud Direct for users is taking root aggressively, but at the other side of that coin, it seems pretty clear that applications are simply going to become points in the cloud and under that scenario, you're the connectivity between both the user to the application and the application to the other applications, domain to domain. But in that world, I don't see any reason for there to be an enterprise network. And so I guess my question is, have you had conversations with people in the enterprise to actually start talking about decommissioning the enterprise network, where the branch, home office and data center simply become islands in the clouds the same way that the rest was. Can you talk to whether that vision is penetrating into top management? \nJay Chaudhry: Yes, it is actually happening. It\u2019s real. I mean I can tell you, because I talked to so many customers. I have many customers who don\u2019t have any data, sense or have any customers who don\u2019t have any fiber network so to speak; it\u2019s all broadband connection coming from the headquarters, the branch office and alike.  Now I would say that most of that I\u2019ve seen in pretty decent size enterprises ranging from about 5,000 to probably 10,000 or 15,000 users. I haven't kind of gone there yet where you looking at 20,000, 30,000 person company decommissioning everything, but that's happened. We are seeing clearly the trend moving in that direction. \nRemo Canessa: And your other question Alex related to the breakout of CDX and ZCP, we did not give that. What we talked about on the last call is that the CDX and ZCP as a percent of our total new and upsell business for the European low teens, we don't give that. \nJay Chaudhry: You know if I may add one more common since you talk about network free enterprise so to speak, thought of it before that we talked about datacenter free enterprise. I had a customer advisory board meeting today from the nine CIOs of large enterprises, was meeting with us, and one of them said I have no data sense, I have no private network, now I want to get to a level where I am Firewall free as well, okay.  Now you see more the more of that. In the world of cloud there is no room for any firewall. In the data center, they will be there for a while and its okay, because there is more effort needed to displace and then phasing out the data center and its applications. \nAlex Henderson: Outstanding. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. \nPatrick Colville: Thank you so much for taking my questions. I think it would be correct to echo everyone\u2019s congratulations on a relatively very stellar quarter. Can I just ask about the headcount? I think that was really interesting commentary and I guess we\u2019d like to better understand that. So you mentioned 450 net ads in fiscal first quarter. Just can you help us think about the kind of trajectory though the rest of the year I mean, and kind of what you got basis to guidance. I mean, should we expect that kind of number again in the 2Q, 3Q, 4Q or would the kind of glide path be slightly different. Thank you. \nRemo Canessa: Yeah, that's a great question. It depends on our performance, quite frankly. If we continue to perform at the levels that we are, as we\u2019ve talked about, we see this as a huge market opportunity, we're going to invest in this market and really the major investment that we have our people, getting outstanding employees to work for Zscaler.  So it was a good quarter for us. I mean net as I mentioned was 450. I don't want to give a projection of what we are going to add for the year, but really the takeaway is, if we continue to grow as we are growing, we\u2019ll continue add at phase. \nPatrick Colville: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nSterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi guys! So along the lines of the last question, help us understand the trends in customer acquisition costs. So when you look at the net new logos that you added in the quarter, are you actually seeing the cost to acquire those customers going down, going up or staying about the same as what you've seen over the last, let's say three or four quarters. \nRemo Canessa: That\u2019s a great question, you know based on our performance that we have and based on our operating profitability, I would say customer acquisition costs are staying relatively same, because we are putting a lot of investment into marketing, as well our sales organization.  On the short term basis, as I\u2019ve talked about, again the contribution margin that we have in years two or three is above 60%. So we're still in that position that we're trying to acquire or bring up more new customers and we\u2019re making that investment. As we go forward and as the company matures, that should come down, but right now that's not our focus. Our focus is to build our top line growth. \nSterling Auty: Understood! Thank you. \nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Ruykhaver from Baird. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yeah, thank you and congrats guys! It\u2019s really impressive. So Jay, I think you've commented in the past, the workload segmentation is something that you really only see the most advanced companies talking about, so obviously very early stage. But you seem to highlight the story where it is of that capability in terms of their own trying to find its applications in machines. So I'm just kind of curious how you see that and what other adoption this year? Anything to call out in terms of what you see relative to what you were thinking about that, maybe six months ago?\nJay Chaudhry: Yeah, I mean your question seems to imply micro segmentation or advanced segmentation, which is actually only done by advanced companies.  I look at segmentation in three buckets. First of all zero to application \u2013 sorry, user-to-apps segmentation. Zscaler is designed to naturally do that. So more and more of these kind of customers are doing it, because user is the weakest link, that's one. Two, actually workload to workload segmentation at the workflow level or VPC to VP level, VPC level, VPC say in AWF East to AWF West. We actually do that with our Zero Trust workloads, which is found by ZPA. Then comes a third, the most advanced one you started out with, is being able to do micro segmentation and actually done only by more sophisticated companies, but we are nearly driving all three levels of fragmentation, which is wonderful for customers and good for our business. \nJonathan Ruykhaver: Thank you.\nA - Jay Chaudhry: Did I answer your question?\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Well, have you seen any change in that use case, just these thoughts of that use case or is it pretty steady state?\nJay Chaudhry: The advanced micro segment \u2013 sorry, the micro segmentation, I think is growing at a decent rate, but where the customer had no option literally was user-to-app segmentation and our app-to-app or VPC-to-VPC. Those are the two new areas of pushing and seeing our lockdown [ph]. Great interest, literally coming from having no options to Zscaler, you can do it so out, so easily. So we will see much faster growth in that segment. \nJonathan Ruykhaver: Okay, that's helpful context. Thank you. \nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great! Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. Jay, maybe for you, you know with just the success of multiple new emerging products, can you just talk about any thoughts you have on new bundling strategies and how those could look? I mean the bundles that you've done with ZIA and ZPA have been so successful in the past. Has that bundling strategy changed if at all, as you know ZDX and ZCP become bigger parts of the business. Does that make sense? \nA - Remo Canessa: It does. So overall as you know we have a deep and broad platform and we also see CIO, CISO looking for consolidation. They want solution rather than have to buy many products and put them together. Then also you know things like ZIA, ZPA, ZDX with a single agent, literally all three products can get turned on pretty easily. So you will see more and more bundling over time.  You\u2019ve seen ZIA, then first of all you see bundling in for an in-ZIA family, from this business bundles to transformation bundle. Then you saw ZIA and ZPA coming together. Then you see ZIA, ZPA and ZDX coming together. The trend will continue I think based on different products. Probably the timing may be different based on what we learned from the customers.\nSaket Kalia: Got it, thank you.\nA - Jay Chaudhry: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey guys! Thanks for taking my question. Jay, a question for you. Just more broadly on you know security architecture and the market moving more towards SASE and Zero Trust Network Access, you know I would think that in today's environment where there's obviously supply chain constraints on things like on-premise firewalls, that you should be seeing more adoption towards your type of platform, but we're still seeing customers buy on-premise firewall, right, and I think that it\u2019s a pretty strong demand environment.  So I'm wondering when that tipping point occurs or if that tipping point occurs and maybe if you can give us some color of around the pace of adoption towards SASE and Zero Trust Network Access and where we are in that adoption curve? \nA - Jay Chaudhry: Yeah, it's a good question. You know your question reminds me of the questions I was asked a few times several years ago. Zscaler is growing so well. Why is Bluecore still growing so well and selling so well, right?  You know there\u2019s a shout [ph] there. There\u2019s a lot of traffic that goes through the data center and as that traffic grows, whether you got a proxy appliance sitting there on the firewall since it takes the traffic, is you really need to upgrade it and grow it over time. And we saw blooper kind of grew and science then suddenly fell off a cliff. And also I think it gets very hard in figuring out the numbers, our actual appliance the VM here, VM there. It gets very hard to figure out, but I can tell you this. Our customers don't want any firewalls in the cloud. Now today they have some, those are VMs out there. But as we are taught new solutions, our customers want our firewall fee, closed wall. Now for the data center, its lots of complexity. It\u2019s kind of being phased out, so we have zero focus in trying to remove any firewalls in the data center. Leave them alone and they'll become like mainframe over time. Now what is that time, I'm not sure. I can guess into it, but I have 200% conviction that firewall appliances or VMs will go away. Regarding SASE, you know I would like to clarify. The SASE has become a buzzword for everyone. Networking guys have hijacked the term, because that\u2019s where they cannot tag themselves to SASE and Gartner had to further clarify. Gartner said, I can do an MQ for a SASE, because it is a collection of things, it\u2019s like in the kitchen sink. But now they have a new magic quadrant coming out, Secure Service Edge, another acronym SSE, but it is only about security. It is about the functionality of ZIA and ZPA kind of to put together, and for the networking side, there\u2019ll be a separate stock. I think there are more customers who want to eliminate the network, because it is the network that creates lateral moment and enables [inaudible] type over text. I mean all this stuff is driving our growth. Its helping, but there is a big market out there. There\u2019s inertia out there that\u2019s still buying a bunch of these fire wall appliances and the like.  Take VPN. We all know that VPN is probably the biggest security rollout there. There\u2019s still unabated placing lots in there, that\u2019s assuming ZPA growth. But there is a big market that is still buying VPNs and we are making progress pretty aggressively and Gartner now thinks that in the next \u2013 for 2.5 years most of the VPNs will be gone and we think whether a vendor is calling VPN in the cloud by a different name or you know VPN. They\u2019ll eventually go away and that's where we will have the Zero Trust Architecture. \nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: For a long answer, I hope it helps. \nHamza Fodderwala: No, it helps. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nBrian Essex : Hi! Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Jay, I was wondering if I can maybe just follow up on a few of the questions that we've had previously. Considering the investment that you've made in sales reps and sales and marketing over the past few years, and particularly you're focus on cross sell and up sell. I mean I\u2019ve noticed that billing are growing over \u2013 it looks like they are growing over twice what customer growth is. So maybe if you could put a finer point on how you're investing in particularly your direct sales force to \u2013 or whether you're leveraging your channel to some greater extent to drive yourself towards that success growth opportunity from cross sell / upsell. \nJay Chaudhry: So, first of all if you look at our growth, we had 85% -- 87% year-over-year growth for our customers with over $1 million in ARR, that\u2019s our customer growth number. Now if you look at customers with over 100 K ARR, that year-over-year growth was about 53%. I think when you look at, lets take customer number, there is some lower small customer in the low end and what not, those numbers end up being kind of misleading, so it's good to look at categories. So we are pleased with the growth of customers, still our bigger focus is just overall ARR growth, or overall bookings growth and alike.  Now for that as we look at cross selling, up selling or new logo, we actually do not do any special incentive for one or the other, we have internally debated it quite a bit, but when you've got so many products to sell on your portfolio, for me to motivate sales people to go for new business and not focus on upsell won't be right.  So we have essentially the same compensation, now our channel is beginning to play more and more role especially in the enterprise segment. You know the bigger the deal the more you have to engage with them like the Fortune 500, but it when you come to 2000 to 5000 or even up to 10,000 users, channel is beginning to add more and more value and channel actually is helping us get new logos, because that's one of the big values they add.  Did I cover the points you asked for? \nBrian Essex : Yeah you did that was very helpful. So thank you very much, I appreciate it, and congrats again? \nJay Chaudhry: Thanks Brian. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is now open. \nGregg Moskowitz: Thank you, and I\u2019ll add my congrats on a truly remarkable quarter. Jay, I was wondering, have you begun to see uptake for ZPA private service edge, and I'm just kind of curious if that\u2019s begin perhaps to help you in hybrid enterprise environments, such that it might be contributing to the robust overall growth that you are showing. \nRemo Canessa: ZPA Private Service Edge.\nJay Chaudhry: Oh yeah, Private Service. Okay good, yeah ZPA Private Service Edge is getting more and more deployed. But just to let you know, we are not trying to make a lot of money for Private Service Edge per say. Most of the money comes from actually subscription fee of users.  But what private service does is it allows you to implement Zero Trust for On-Prem on the network users and since people when they come back to the office, they need to make sure that users and applications are not on the same network, that\u2019s where Private Service Edge comes in. We charge a reasonable amount for it, but the biggest amount comes from making sure every user, whether they are in the office or at home, they actually use ZPA. That's actually really how we look at this growth and we are very pleased with it.  And also the second factor to drive that would be, as more and more applications are in a public cloud like Azure and AWS, they all need to go through ZPA for that. That\u2019s where I made the statement in the past that I expect, it\u2019s a matter of time when every user for our customers will have ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. Three together gives them fast, secure and alive experience. \nGregg Moskowitz: Alright, that\u2019s great. And certainly works through different hybrid work environments. Thanks Jay. \nJay Chaudhry: Yeah, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Shaul Eyal from Cowen. Your line is now open. \nShaul Eyal : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the on-going strong performance. A quick one on my end, Jay. Can you talk about the progress you've seeing on the Federal front? \nJay Chaudhry: Yes, on the Federal side, we actually are doing quite well. It's growing much faster than our total overall drive. We expect to benefit from infrastructure plan or during this fiscal year, and the EO directive that came from the Biden administration early on, it\u2019s actually helping. We are seeing that Federal bodies aren\u2019t actually, should I say speeding up some of the projects that are stick out there. It needed two things; it needed the right Zero Trust architecture which we have. Then it needed FedRAMP certification and we have both of those things. We are the only security vendor with two highest FedRAMP certification and we have a sizeable team.  Remo, can you give a color on where we are on\u2026? \nRemo Canessa: And so for Federal, in the quarter we are mid-single digits of total new upsell business. As Jay mentioned, we've made significant investments in the federal sector. The certifications are pretty significant, and as Jay mentioned, we are the only security vendor with the two highest FedRAMP certifications.  In addition, we've got a strong team in federal and good partners. So Federal takes time, but we feel that we are well positioned. In federal our pipeline is increasing, and our engagements are very good. \nShaul Eyal : Got it. Thank you. Great color. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO. Your line is now open. \nKeith Bachman : Hi! Thank you very much. Jay, I wanted to ask you about competition. I wanted to come out in a little bit different way and break it in a few parts. In terms of Greenfield activities, how often are you seeing \u2013 because of your different architecture, you know especially doing one to one negotiations or Part B, how much are you seeing the same or different participants. And what I mean by that is, I think most investors assume Palo Alto, but there's also cloud player NASCO, [inaudible] iboss. Is the field when you're negotiating on particularly new work, is it getting more crowded or less crowded? And then finally, does pricing enter into discussion, particularly for new work. Thank you. \nJay Chaudhry: It\u2019s a good question. So first of all, as we have driven top-down with CIOs for transformation. It's not typically we go in and say, I will replace this box, I\u2019ll replace this box. This is really a one-on-one replacement at the start. So we end up driving the agenda from that point of view and it used to be that for ZIA we would show them how we can help and secure web gateway and a social products and Bluecoat will the starting point for replacement or another web proxy. Then ZPA became an important piece. Now more and more customers are buying ZIA and ZPA together.  Now that's a different kind of players out there. So by having an expanded portfolio, when we go in and say I can provide all access to all the applications, no matter where they are, from anywhere with ZIA, ZPA, it just fundamentally changes I guess. Now ZDX being part of the same thing, because ZIO, clear is about user performance. So it\u2019s not common for us to get into what you call it, bake-off kind of stuff, because it\u2019s really not a one-on-one type of place.  Now, on the lower end of the market, we do see a smattering of players from fiscal, from time to time, firewall guys from time-to-time what not. And once we engage, we win, that\u2019s why we are seeing our enterprise segment 2K to 5K users actually growing pretty significantly. Regarding pricing, we haven\u2019t really seen much pricing pressure, by the time we show the cost, all these products we can display is the operational costs and the like. Price becomes the least important issue for us. \nKeith Bachman : Right. Okay, it makes a lot of sense Jay. Thank you. \nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. \nOperator: And thank you. And or next question comes from Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. \nJoshua Tilton: Yeah, hi guys! Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong result. As we just think about the remainder of the year, should we expect any unusual changes to the quarterly calculated billings seasonality, maybe compared to prior years as we continue to lap a very, very strong FY \u201821. \nRemo Canessa: You know basically Q2 and Q4 is our largest quarters and we talked about the billings being in the first half 43% to 44%. And one thing to keep in mind, I mean the numbers are getting big. So as numbers get bigger, just keep that in mind really going forward really to your expectation. \nJoshua Tilton: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities. Your line is now open. \nErik Suppiger : Yeah, thanks and congratulations. On the $5 billion commitment, I understand that you just see within your installed base opportunity to get there. But can you talk a little bit about how you view the timing, if you don't want to set the time frame, can you give us some context in terms of kind of aspirations for how you can build towards that? \nRemo Canessa: Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. Clearly we're going to try to get through as quickly as we can, in a responsible manner. It really comes down to execution, and it\u2019s really hard to give a time frame. We do have internal, you know long range plan, models and I can tell you that from my perspective related to what I see, related to our opportunity, really the opportunities there.  You know, the key thing Erik is that if we continue to have significant growth, which we have this quarter, 62% revenue growth, we will \u2013 again, we are going to forward lien and we will be mindful of our operating profitability, but that\u2019s really secondary from our perspective. The comment about contribution margin and the amount that we're spending for the first year getting new customers, that's critical for us and to continue to get those customers out.  The contribution margins in years two and three are 60%-plus. I don't want to give a time frame on the call. We are driving aggressively, and we are putting growth in the profitability. We will be mindful of profitability and the benefit that you just got with Jay and myself, we\u2019ve seen a lot of things in our carriers and we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of how things are going to work out for us. When things come up, that we need to make decisions, make those decisions but all our decisions will be made to increase value for our shareholders. \nJay Chaudhry: Yeah if I may add, I see no external factors today that I\u2019m overly concerned about. I think it's largely on execution that we need to do right, and to make sure our team doesn't become complacent and arrogant because of its success. So hiring and hiring the right people, right leadership in place the way we had done in the past two years, that\u2019s our focus to continue. \nErik Suppiger : Very good. Thank you.\n[End of Q&A]:\nOperator: And thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jay Chaudhry for closing. \nJay Chaudhry: Well, thank you all for your continued support and interest in Zscaler. We hope to see you at some of the Investment Conference. Thank you again. \nRemo Canessa: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Did I answer your question? Thank you. Yeah, it's a good question. You know your question reminds me of the questions I was asked a few times several years ago. Zscaler is growing so well. Why is Bluecore still growing so well and selling so well, right?  You know there's a shout [ph] there. There's a lot of traffic that goes through the data center and as that traffic grows, whether you got a proxy appliance sitting there on the firewall since it takes the traffic, is you really need to upgrade it and grow it over time. And we saw blooper kind of grew and science then suddenly fell off a cliff. And also I think it gets very hard in figuring out the numbers, our actual appliance the VM here, VM there. It gets very hard to figure out, but I can tell you this. Our customers don't want any firewalls in the cloud. Now today they have some, those are VMs out there. But as we are taught new solutions, our customers want our firewall fee, closed wall. Now for the data center, its lots of complexity. It's kind of being phased out, so we have zero focus in trying to remove any firewalls in the data center. Leave them alone and they'll become like mainframe over time. Now what is that time, I'm not sure. I can guess into it, but I have 200% conviction that firewall appliances or VMs will go away. Regarding SASE, you know I would like to clarify. The SASE has become a buzzword for everyone. Networking guys have hijacked the term, because that's where they cannot tag themselves to SASE and Gartner had to further clarify. Gartner said, I can do an MQ for a SASE, because it is a collection of things, it's like in the kitchen sink. But now they have a new magic quadrant coming out, Secure Service Edge, another acronym SSE, but it is only about security. It is about the functionality of ZIA and ZPA kind of to put together, and for the networking side, there'll be a separate stock. I think there are more customers who want to eliminate the network, because it is the network that creates lateral moment and enables [inaudible] type over text. I mean all this stuff is driving our growth. Its helping, but there is a big market out there. There's inertia out there that's still buying a bunch of these fire wall appliances and the like.  Take VPN. We all know that VPN is probably the biggest security rollout there. There's still unabated placing lots in there, that's assuming ZPA growth. But there is a big market that is still buying VPNs and we are making progress pretty aggressively and Gartner now thinks that in the next \u2013 for 2.5 years most of the VPNs will be gone and we think whether a vendor is calling VPN in the cloud by a different name or you know VPN. They'll eventually go away and that's where we will have the Zero Trust Architecture."

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. As Jay mentioned, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue for the quarter was $231 million, up 17% sequentially and 62% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, revenue growth accelerated in the quarter driven by strong business activity. ZPA product revenue was 16% of total revenue.  From a geographic perspective, we had broad strength across our three major regions. Americas represented 51% of revenue, EMEA was 35% and APJ was 14%. Our investments in APJ are bearing fruit with greater than 100% revenue growth in that region. Our total calculated billings grew 71% year-over-year to $248 million, with billings duration at the high end of our 10 to14 months range. We had several customers choosing to pay upfront for their multi-year contracts. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years and we do not offer any special incentives for upfront payments.  We are also pleased to report 68% year-over-year growth in short-term billings. I would note that both billings and revenue benefited from a $1.5 million one-off deal in the quarter. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, were $1.71 billion as of October 31, up 97% from one year ago. The current RPO is 50% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention and ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which was above 125% in the quarter and higher than the 128% we reported last quarter. As we have discussed before, this metric will vary quarter-to-quarter and is not a metric we manage our business towards.  We focus on growing our net new business without incentivizing differently between new or upsell. We have a strong base of large and growing enterprise customers, which provides us with significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. Considering these factors, we believe NRR above 125% is truly outstanding for us. We had 224 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 87% from 120 in the prior year. The continued strength in this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We also added over 550 customers paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the quarter at 1,616 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.6% was approximately flat quarter-to-quarter and down 50 basis points year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 17% sequentially and 69% year-over-year to $162 million.  Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by approximately 3 percentage points from 67% a year ago to 70% in the quarter, primarily due to increased hiring, higher compensation expenses, investments in SmokeScreen and Trustdome businesses we acquired in the second half of last year, and a partial return of T&E.  Operating margin was 10% and free cash flow margin was 36%, which benefited from the timing of CapEx spend. We continue to expect CapEx as percentage revenue to be high-single digits for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Please note that net other income includes an $800,000 loss primarily related to the change in value of our assets denominated in Euro and British Pound as the U.S. dollar strengthened.  To minimize such impact going forward, we recently implemented a hedging program for our balance sheet. As a reminder, we primarily transact sales globally in U.S. dollars, and several quarters ago we put in place a hedging program for our international operating expenses. For income taxes, our tax expenses primarily represent international taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions we do business in. For several APJ countries, there is a withholding tax on sales made to customers in those countries. As our APJ business has grown significantly in recent quarters, the withholding taxes were $1.5 million in Q1. Now moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, amortization of debt discount and amortization of intangible assets. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $240 million to $242 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 53% to 54%, gross margins of 79%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including ZDX, Workload Segmentation and CSPM, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products, because we are more focused on time-to-market and growth rather than optimizing for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $20 million to $21 million, net loss on other income of $100,000, income taxes of $4 million, earnings per share of approximately $0.11, assuming 150 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2022 we are increasing our revenue to a range of $1 billion to $1.01 billion or year-over-year growth of 49% to 50%, increasing calculated billings to a range of $1.3 billion to $1.305 billion or year-over-year growth of 39% to 40%. We now expect our first half mix to be approximately 43% to 44% of our full year billings. Increasing our operating profit to a range of $90 million to $93 million, based on the return of the in- person conferences and events, we expect operating margin to decline sequentially in Q3 before improving in Q4. Updating our earnings per share to a range of $0.50 to $0.52 assuming approximately 150 million to 151 million fully diluted shares. Please note that our share count guidance now includes dilution from our convertible debentures. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we are committed to investing aggressively in our company. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing, but we will continue to prioritize growth which we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. Operator you may now open the call for questions. Yes. Just to add, Jay, just a little bit \u2013 yes, just to add a little bit there. Our SAM is $72 billion. And as we talked about it in our Analyst Day, it does not include other areas which we are making investments, I mean areas such as 5G or OT, IoT, B2B, B2C. So it's \u2013 and what's interesting is that this market has really changed over the years from what it was even 10 years ago and certainly 20 years ago where lot of legacy basically technology exists still today.  There's a huge market opportunity. And one of the things we've done within the company and we've talked about, is that we're going to prioritize growth over operating profitability. And one of the areas that we're making significant investment is in our go-to-market.  So we've made significant investments in the past. We'll continue to make significant investments and in that go-to-market, it's really three-pronged; you've got sales, you've got marketing, you got channel.  Sales organization we've been making significant investments the last few years and you can see the fruits of what our sales organization has done. We hired recently about a year ago, or a little less than a year ago, CMO, and he's doing absolutely outstanding. We are making significant investment in channel.  With that also as we've talked about trying to get to or getting to a much larger company, we are going to be making investments throughout the company to build the foundation and the strength and efficiencies. So we are in a unique provision and that really created in my opinion a revolutionary technology with a platform that was created 12 years ago that addresses this market pretty much head on. We're going to continue to add aggressively throughout the year. Our net ads that we had in Q1 was over 450 employees, about half of those ads were in sales and marketing. From a field quota sales rep perspective, the comments we made before was that we'd hire more field sales reps this year in fiscal \u201822 versus fiscal '21. We're certainly on pace to do that, and also in Q1, we had a near record quarter for RSM or filed quota sales rep ads. We see Zscaler's destination. And so, related to your question, how we're going to do going forward, like I said before, we are going to privatize growth and we are going to hire aggressively and we're going to try to really go after this market. Yeah, from a geographic perspective, what I'd like to do is call out APJ, they did absolutely outstanding. And what we've talked about before also is one of your areas that we are going to invest more in, is in APJ, in particular, Japan. And so, if you look at our performance, APJ was very, very strong for us. But as Jay mentioned, across the board, it was an outstanding quarter. And your other question Alex related to the breakout of CDX and ZCP, we did not give that. What we talked about on the last call is that the CDX and ZCP as a percent of our total new and upsell business for the European low teens, we don't give that. Yeah, that's a great question. It depends on our performance, quite frankly. If we continue to perform at the levels that we are, as we've talked about, we see this as a huge market opportunity, we're going to invest in this market and really the major investment that we have our people, getting outstanding employees to work for Zscaler.  So it was a good quarter for us. I mean net as I mentioned was 450. I don't want to give a projection of what we are going to add for the year, but really the takeaway is, if we continue to grow as we are growing, we'll continue add at phase. That's a great question, you know based on our performance that we have and based on our operating profitability, I would say customer acquisition costs are staying relatively same, because we are putting a lot of investment into marketing, as well our sales organization.  On the short term basis, as I've talked about, again the contribution margin that we have in years two or three is above 60%. So we're still in that position that we're trying to acquire or bring up more new customers and we're making that investment. As we go forward and as the company matures, that should come down, but right now that's not our focus. Our focus is to build our top line growth. ZPA Private Service Edge. And so for Federal, in the quarter we are mid-single digits of total new upsell business. As Jay mentioned, we've made significant investments in the federal sector. The certifications are pretty significant, and as Jay mentioned, we are the only security vendor with the two highest FedRAMP certifications.  In addition, we've got a strong team in federal and good partners. So Federal takes time, but we feel that we are well positioned. In federal our pipeline is increasing, and our engagements are very good. You know basically Q2 and Q4 is our largest quarters and we talked about the billings being in the first half 43% to 44%. And one thing to keep in mind, I mean the numbers are getting big. So as numbers get bigger, just keep that in mind really going forward really to your expectation. Yeah, it's a great question. Clearly we're going to try to get through as quickly as we can, in a responsible manner. It really comes down to execution, and it's really hard to give a time frame. We do have internal, you know long range plan, models and I can tell you that from my perspective related to what I see, related to our opportunity, really the opportunities there.  You know, the key thing Erik is that if we continue to have significant growth, which we have this quarter, 62% revenue growth, we will \u2013 again, we are going to forward lien and we will be mindful of our operating profitability, but that's really secondary from our perspective. The comment about contribution margin and the amount that we're spending for the first year getting new customers, that's critical for us and to continue to get those customers out.  The contribution margins in years two and three are 60%-plus. I don't want to give a time frame on the call. We are driving aggressively, and we are putting growth in the profitability. We will be mindful of profitability and the benefit that you just got with Jay and myself, we've seen a lot of things in our carriers and we've got a pretty good idea of how things are going to work out for us. When things come up, that we need to make decisions, make those decisions but all our decisions will be made to increase value for our shareholders. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Building on our incredible momentum from last year, we had an exceptionally strong start to fiscal \u201822. In Q1, we delivered 62% revenue growth and 71% billings growth, while generating record operating profits and free cash flow. We are again seeing strong revenue growth across all verticals, customer segments and geographies, with over half of our revenue coming from outside the U.S. We recently achieved a significant milestone of surpassing $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, while continuing rapid growth. In my recent dialogues with hundreds of CISOs and CIOs, eight out of 10 are looking to phase out legacy network security in favor of zero trust architecture, due to increasing cyber security risks and accelerating digital transformation initiatives.  I will highlight two main reasons why enterprises are selecting Zscaler over legacy solutions: One, we saw a more than 300% year-over-year increase in sophisticated threats hidden in SSL-encrypted traffic. A large number of them are ransomware attacks and most would bypass next-gen firewalls, which aren't designed to inspect encrypted traffic at scale. We are the only cloud provider with a proxy architecture designed to inspect SSL-encrypted traffic at scale to deliver better security. This year, our cloud has blocked more than 20 billion threats hidden in encrypted traffic. Two, by connecting users only to applications and not to the network, a core principle of zero trust architecture. We eliminate lateral threat movement, hence reducing ransomware attacks such as the Colonial Pipeline breach. In contrast, firewalls and VPNs connect users to the network, enabling lateral threat movement. It is clear from our growth and enterprise wins that architecture matters and Zero Trust security can't be built on legacy network security architecture. This gives us long-term advantage. Turning to the quarter, let me discuss two factors that drove our performance: One, we saw continued strength in new and upsell bookings of over $1 million in annual value. We drove 87% year-over-year growth in customers exceeding $1 million in ARR, ending with over 220 of these customers.  Two, the expansion down-market to Enterprise segment, organizations with 2,000 to 6,000 employees, is scaling and it remains our fastest-growing segment. With increasing contribution from the Enterprise segment, the total number of customers who pay us more than $100,000 per year is up 53% year-over-year to over 1,600. Our 71% billings growth this quarter speaks to the commitment that customers are making to our Zero Trust Exchange platform. As we have noted before, the purchase of ZIA is often the first step to adopting our platform. Let me share a couple of ZIA-driven deals. A Fortune 50 insurance company purchased ZIA transformation bundle with cloud firewall and sandbox plus DLP and CASB for data protection to secure 170,000 employees and affiliated agents working from anywhere. This customer wanted secure and fast access to Internet and SaaS applications, particularly Microsoft 365 and Teams. Connecting to Zscaler's nearest edge cloud where we have direct peering with hundreds of application providers, the users are seeing a 75% improvement in response time. Next, a leading defense industry integrator purchased ZIA for 200,000 users, plus workload protection for Internet traffic. Our ZIA platform, which recently achieved FedRAMP High Ready status will help them meet many requirements for CMMC, a cybersecurity standard for defense contractors.  Zscaler is consolidating the several point products, simplifying the network, enforcing consistent cyber policy across multiple business units while reducing operational costs. We believe these large deals show that we are the only multi-tenant, zero trust platform meeting the needs of major enterprises to transform the legacy hub-and-spoke network and castle-and-moat security. With customers shifting to the cloud, more are buying ZIA and ZPA together, enabling a true transformation with direct and seamless access through SaaS and private applications, whether on-prem or in public cloud. Here are a few examples.  A Fortune 500 banking customer signed a four-year commitment for three key pillars of our platform. Their existing ZIA contract was upgraded to include cloud firewall, sandbox, DLP, CASB and browser isolation. They also purchased ZPA for all 100,000 employees to implement app segmentation without having to implement legacy network segmentation.  In addition, ZDX was purchased to identify and help remediate application, network or end-point issues to ensure great user experience and employee productivity regardless of their location. This deal more than tripled the customer's annual spend with us, having adopted our full portfolio for user protection. We are now discussing zero trust security for workloads with this customer. Next, in a new logo win, a Fortune 100 insurance customer purchased ZIA Transformation bundle and ZPA for all 30,000 employees to pursue their cloud-first strategy. With cyber protection as a major requirement, this customer only considered a proxy architecture to perform SSL inspection at scale and rejected firewall-based architectures.  ZPA will eliminate their attack surface, hiding their thousands of private applications behind our Zero Trust Exchange, hence they can't be discovered, exploited or DDoS'd. We are consolidating at least three vendor point products, materially reducing complexity and operating cost. Our integration with CrowdStrike and Microsoft was also an important consideration for them. Next, one of the powerful use cases for ZIA and ZPA is to accelerate M&A integration with significant ROI. An existing European based Global 500 manufacturing customer purchased ZIA Transformation bundle for 30,000 employees of a newly acquired business, and ZPA for 50,000 users to accelerate the M&A integration. The legacy approach to providing access to private applications post acquisition requires integrating two complex corporate networks, which they expected to take 18 months or more, without having to connect two corporate networks. Zscaler's approach provided secure access to SaaS or private applications across both companies in weeks, saving time and money. After having disrupted perimeter-based security for users with our Zero Trust Exchange, we are bringing zero trust to workloads with Zscaler Cloud Protection. Let me highlight a few ZCP wins: An existing ZIA and ZPA State government customer purchased Workload Segmentation for over 4,500 workloads, along with ZDX and CASB for their 28,000 employees. This was a seven-figure annual contract value, driven by our Emerging Products. Implementing Zero Trust for workloads will reduce their cyber risk by achieving micro-segmentation without doing legacy network segmentation. Moving on to our Workload Posture offering. We are seeing increased interest from customers in CSPM for configurations and CIEM for entitlements. During the quarter, a tech company bought CSPM for over 9,000 workloads and a software enterprise bought CIEM for 5,000 workloads.  Our Workload Communication offerings, powered by ZIA and ZPA technology, is building momentum with additional customer wins in the quarter. For example, a healthcare customer purchased workload communication for 3,500 workloads and a Financial Services customer purchased it for 1,000 workloads. When you look at these wins, our success starts with true zero trust architecture which is the opposite of firewalls and VPNs. Our Zero Trust Exchange is the largest in-line cloud security platform in the world, processing over 200 billion transactions per day, which doubled in the last 18 months, and is preventing more than 7 billion security and policy violations per day. This massive amount of traffic provides us 300 trillion signals per day to feed our machine learning and AI engines, resulting in superior threat protection and better detection of user and application traffic anomalies.  This network effect is a big competitive advantage for us. Each of our 150-plus data centers receives a continuous stream of more than 200,000 unique security updates every day. This can't be done with a single-tenant VM-based architecture that legacy security vendors are running on public clouds and calling SASE. This is only possible with the purpose-built, highly scalable cloud that Zscaler built from day one. I am very proud of our pace of innovation that delivers value to our customers. Let me share a few stats for the quarter: ZIA delivered 29 agile releases and ZPA delivered 44 agile releases. Each product pillar delivered scores of new features and enhancements. Our ThreatLabz security research team discovered and delivered over 495,000 new advanced threat indicators and signatures to our global cloud. In addition, our cutting-edge security research scientists discovered and reported 18 new zero-day vulnerabilities. These are testimonials of the sophistication and scale of our research team. A great platform combined with a great research team, enables us to deliver great cyber protection to our customers. Let me highlight some of the significant features we delivered in Q1. We enhanced our out-of-band CASB to support additional SaaS applications. We see more customers buying our CASB along with ZIA and replacing their existing CASB point product. We added optical character recognition technology to our DLP offering, addressing data loss problem for images in files like PDFs. This feature combined with previously released Exact Data Match and Indexed Data Match technology, makes us the leading data protection platform. We integrated our recently acquired Smokescreen active defense technology with ZPA, making it easier for customers to deploy and manage it from a single console. The pace of innovation for our newer pillars like ZDX and ZCP is accelerating. For example, one of the most demanded ZDX features is real-time performance monitoring for Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which we delivered by working closely with Zoom and Microsoft through API-integration. We added over 150 features to ZDX in the past 12 months, delighting our customers. One customer said, and I quote, \u201cWe now have unprecedented visibility into the environment. We can respond faster and forecast where we may have issues and address those areas before they become a problem.\u201d I want to highlight another increasingly important area, helping our customers achieve their ESG goals. Our highly efficient cloud replaces hundreds of thousands of on-prem appliances and eliminates the need to buy more in the future, resulting in the significant decrease in the energy resources and carbon emissions associated with building, transporting, powering and cooling them. As you may have seen from a recent press release, our cloud platform now uses 100% renewable energy. As part of this effort, we have a cross-functional team with oversight from the Board to drive our sustainability strategy. Zscaler has never been stronger, and I believe we have an incredible opportunity in front of us. We have our sight set on the next milestone, growing our ARR to $5 billion.  I believe the key to sustained growth in our next stage is to accelerate the broader adoption of our platform. Our Zero Trust Exchange platform, with four major pillars, provides a comprehensive foundation for securing and improving application access in the world of cloud and mobility. With ZIA and ZPA, we have proven our success implementing zero trust for users. Our next immediate opportunity is to bring zero trust to workloads, powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology.  As we shared in our DU highlights, we are seeing solid traction with ZDX and ZCP, the newest growth vectors for the company. We are seeing increasing average revenue per customer, and we estimate a 6x growth opportunity on upsell with our current customers. From presales to deployment and customer success, we have a sophisticated sales machine to sell value and deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level. Over the next several years, our innovation engine will further build out the breadth and depth of our platform, extending our already substantial technology lead. We are also pursuing some very exciting opportunities to extend zero trust to operational technology or OT systems, with manufacturing leaders like Siemens. In summary, we are very excited about our future and we believe we are still in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to accelerate secure digital transformation. Now, I would like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. The short answer is yes. And let me expand upon it. If you look at our current main products, ZIA, ZPA, which have been our flagship products, there is a fair amount of upsell opportunity to our current base. We are going to share that. With upsell, we could actually take up ARR 6x. Of course, the norms just wait for upsell. We are focused on adding new customers as well.  We have decent penetration on the high end, Fortune 500 companies, 35%, Global 2000 were 25%. That means there is a big market still for us to deploy and these, especially high end customers look for a proxy-based architecture and zero trust architecture.  And then on top of that are our two other solutions, Zero Trust for workloads that has been just coming out early stage, and we're also moving into Zero Trust for IOT and OT leveraging the core technology we have in place. And then on top of that is the newly emerging markets for workloads, security posture, entitlement, commissions and the like, and we did a couple of small acquisitions in that area. We are building upon it and growing it.  So I do see security market rapidly changing. We believe all segments that we know today will no longer be there, they will disappear over time and we have a lead, significant lead over others to keep on building more. So I feel pretty comfortable and confident to be able to get to our $5 billion ARR target and beyond. Thank you. All products actually did well. I mean this was a stellar quarter, whether you look at the product side or you look at the geo side or you look at market segment side. There are a couple of deals we highlighted in my earnings call. Actually, there's big ZIA in that deal are actually still coming up really strong. Sometimes people think that ZIA kind of started early, it may be kind of slowing down, but we aren't seeing slowdown in ZIA, ZPA is ramping pretty rapidly, growing pretty fast. And ZDX is actually, is probably the most sought after product in the market, especially with Zoom and Teams kind of issues that are almost impossible to decipher and figure out the big integration we did at a very rapid pace in the past few months, and we announced that publicly a couple of weeks ago, that with the help of Microsoft and Zoom both, we did API-based integration. So across the board, I think it's a wonderful, hard to kind of pin point one product area. Yes, it is actually happening. It's real. I mean I can tell you, because I talked to so many customers. I have many customers who don't have any data, sense or have any customers who don't have any fiber network so to speak; it's all broadband connection coming from the headquarters, the branch office and alike.  Now I would say that most of that I've seen in pretty decent size enterprises ranging from about 5,000 to probably 10,000 or 15,000 users. I haven't kind of gone there yet where you looking at 20,000, 30,000 person company decommissioning everything, but that's happened. We are seeing clearly the trend moving in that direction. You know if I may add one more common since you talk about network free enterprise so to speak, thought of it before that we talked about datacenter free enterprise. I had a customer advisory board meeting today from the nine CIOs of large enterprises, was meeting with us, and one of them said I have no data sense, I have no private network, now I want to get to a level where I am Firewall free as well, okay.  Now you see more the more of that. In the world of cloud there is no room for any firewall. In the data center, they will be there for a while and its okay, because there is more effort needed to displace and then phasing out the data center and its applications. Thank you. Yeah, I mean your question seems to imply micro segmentation or advanced segmentation, which is actually only done by advanced companies.  I look at segmentation in three buckets. First of all zero to application \u2013 sorry, user-to-apps segmentation. Zscaler is designed to naturally do that. So more and more of these kind of customers are doing it, because user is the weakest link, that's one. Two, actually workload to workload segmentation at the workflow level or VPC to VP level, VPC level, VPC say in AWF East to AWF West. We actually do that with our Zero Trust workloads, which is found by ZPA. Then comes a third, the most advanced one you started out with, is being able to do micro segmentation and actually done only by more sophisticated companies, but we are nearly driving all three levels of fragmentation, which is wonderful for customers and good for our business. The advanced micro segment \u2013 sorry, the micro segmentation, I think is growing at a decent rate, but where the customer had no option literally was user-to-app segmentation and our app-to-app or VPC-to-VPC. Those are the two new areas of pushing and seeing our lockdown [ph]. Great interest, literally coming from having no options to Zscaler, you can do it so out, so easily. So we will see much faster growth in that segment. Thank you. For a long answer, I hope it helps. So, first of all if you look at our growth, we had 85% -- 87% year-over-year growth for our customers with over $1 million in ARR, that's our customer growth number. Now if you look at customers with over 100 K ARR, that year-over-year growth was about 53%. I think when you look at, lets take customer number, there is some lower small customer in the low end and what not, those numbers end up being kind of misleading, so it's good to look at categories. So we are pleased with the growth of customers, still our bigger focus is just overall ARR growth, or overall bookings growth and alike.  Now for that as we look at cross selling, up selling or new logo, we actually do not do any special incentive for one or the other, we have internally debated it quite a bit, but when you've got so many products to sell on your portfolio, for me to motivate sales people to go for new business and not focus on upsell won't be right.  So we have essentially the same compensation, now our channel is beginning to play more and more role especially in the enterprise segment. You know the bigger the deal the more you have to engage with them like the Fortune 500, but it when you come to 2000 to 5000 or even up to 10,000 users, channel is beginning to add more and more value and channel actually is helping us get new logos, because that's one of the big values they add.  Did I cover the points you asked for? Thanks Brian. Oh yeah, Private Service. Okay good, yeah ZPA Private Service Edge is getting more and more deployed. But just to let you know, we are not trying to make a lot of money for Private Service Edge per say. Most of the money comes from actually subscription fee of users.  But what private service does is it allows you to implement Zero Trust for On-Prem on the network users and since people when they come back to the office, they need to make sure that users and applications are not on the same network, that's where Private Service Edge comes in. We charge a reasonable amount for it, but the biggest amount comes from making sure every user, whether they are in the office or at home, they actually use ZPA. That's actually really how we look at this growth and we are very pleased with it.  And also the second factor to drive that would be, as more and more applications are in a public cloud like Azure and AWS, they all need to go through ZPA for that. That's where I made the statement in the past that I expect, it's a matter of time when every user for our customers will have ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. Three together gives them fast, secure and alive experience. Yeah, thanks. Yes, on the Federal side, we actually are doing quite well. It's growing much faster than our total overall drive. We expect to benefit from infrastructure plan or during this fiscal year, and the EO directive that came from the Biden administration early on, it's actually helping. We are seeing that Federal bodies aren't actually, should I say speeding up some of the projects that are stick out there. It needed two things; it needed the right Zero Trust architecture which we have. Then it needed FedRAMP certification and we have both of those things. We are the only security vendor with two highest FedRAMP certification and we have a sizeable team.  Remo, can you give a color on where we are on...? It's a good question. So first of all, as we have driven top-down with CIOs for transformation. It's not typically we go in and say, I will replace this box, I'll replace this box. This is really a one-on-one replacement at the start. So we end up driving the agenda from that point of view and it used to be that for ZIA we would show them how we can help and secure web gateway and a social products and Bluecoat will the starting point for replacement or another web proxy. Then ZPA became an important piece. Now more and more customers are buying ZIA and ZPA together.  Now that's a different kind of players out there. So by having an expanded portfolio, when we go in and say I can provide all access to all the applications, no matter where they are, from anywhere with ZIA, ZPA, it just fundamentally changes I guess. Now ZDX being part of the same thing, because ZIO, clear is about user performance. So it's not common for us to get into what you call it, bake-off kind of stuff, because it's really not a one-on-one type of place.  Now, on the lower end of the market, we do see a smattering of players from fiscal, from time to time, firewall guys from time-to-time what not. And once we engage, we win, that's why we are seeing our enterprise segment 2K to 5K users actually growing pretty significantly. Regarding pricing, we haven't really seen much pricing pressure, by the time we show the cost, all these products we can display is the operational costs and the like. Price becomes the least important issue for us. Thank you. Yeah if I may add, I see no external factors today that I'm overly concerned about. I think it's largely on execution that we need to do right, and to make sure our team doesn't become complacent and arrogant because of its success. So hiring and hiring the right people, right leadership in place the way we had done in the past two years, that's our focus to continue. Well, thank you all for your continued support and interest in Zscaler. We hope to see you at some of the Investment Conference. Thank you again."

            "content": "It does. So overall as you know we have a deep and broad platform and we also see CIO, CISO looking for consolidation. They want solution rather than have to buy many products and put them together. Then also you know things like ZIA, ZPA, ZDX with a single agent, literally all three products can get turned on pretty easily. So you will see more and more bundling over time.  You've seen ZIA, then first of all you see bundling in for an in-ZIA family, from this business bundles to transformation bundle. Then you saw ZIA and ZPA coming together. Then you see ZIA, ZPA and ZDX coming together. The trend will continue I think based on different products. Probably the timing may be different based on what we learned from the customers."

Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. We had a strong close to our fiscal year. In Q4, we delivered 43% revenue growth and 38% billings growth with balanced growth across all verticals, customer segments, and geographies. For the full year, our revenue grew 48% to $1.6 billion and billings grew 37% to over $2 billion. In addition to achieving record billings in the quarter, we also set records across several other measures. We added the highest number of $1 million ARR customers, generated record new pipeline for a Q4 and attained record operating profit margin. I'm proud of our team's achievements and humbled by the trust our customers are placing in our platform. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are executing well. With cybersecurity as a high priority, IT executives are moving forward with zero trust initiatives driving our business. As I mentioned before, we are partnering earlier with CXOs to create compelling CFO-ready business cases with clear ROI and payback periods. As our results demonstrate, refining our high-touch sales process is helping get large deals across the finish line. We have a blueprint for delivering immediate value, which drives faster upsells, often within 12 months of initial purchase. We closed a record number of deals over $1 million ACV in Q4, driven by broad based strength across our key industry verticals. In addition to our industry-leading top-line growth, we are generating record profitability. Due to our spending discipline, we achieved a record 19% operating margin as we more than doubled our operating income on a year-over-year basis. These outstanding results reflect the strong unit economics of our business with best in class 80% gross margins. Our innovation and customer obsession drove our Net Promoter Score to exceed 80, which is more than two times the average for SaaS companies and contributed to our high 90% gross retention rate. I am very pleased to announce that we doubled our annual recurring revenue from $1 billion to over $2 billion in seven quarters. reaching a milestone only a select handful of SaaS companies have achieved. We secure over 7,700 customers and protect over 41 million users. With every customer looking to adopt zero trust architecture in today's world of cloud, AI, and mobility, we believe we are in the early stages of capturing a large share of our $72 billion market opportunity. We have our sights set on achieving our next goal of $5 billion in ARR. We are on a mission to take zero trust everywhere to users, workloads and OT systems and become the go-to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased business agility and better cyber and data protection. To fully realize the business value enabled by our platform, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for users, our complete zero trust solution for user protection, which includes ZIA, ZPA, ZDX, and data protection. In addition, we are gaining traction with workload protection powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. These broader platform purchases drove 37% year-over-year growth in customers with greater than $1 million in ARR. We ended the quarter with nearly 450 such customers, including 43 customers exceeding $5 million. Let me highlight one deal where the customer purchased all product pillars. A large global system integrator partner headquarter in Asia became a customer and adopted our platform to enable their work from anywhere strategy. They purchased ZIA, ZDX and advanced data protection for 300,000 users and ZPA for 270,000 users. They also purchased workload protection and deception technology to improve application security for their hybrid environment. This customer can now open new offices and offshore development centers much faster and more securely. They are also seeing a 50% in the time to onboard employees. As a highly distributed organization with data everywhere, data protection was a major consideration for them and accounted for 20% of the deal value. Data protection is an important new pillar of growth for us, approaching a $0.25 billion in ARR. and growing 60% per year. We are increasingly replacing incumbent legacy DLP in the largest of enterprises with data protection representing a $10 billion plus opportunity for us. Due to targeted investments and rapid innovation, we believe our data protection solution is now at the widest and the deepest in the market, and we are taking data protection beyond users to workloads and devices. Let me highlight a new logo win led by data protection. A large telecom operator purchased Zscaler for users for 80,000 employees. Data protection was a key driver for the win as this customer became increasingly uncomfortable with gaps left by their firewall and VPN based security, which struggles with data protection for TLS encrypted traffic that comprises over 85% of their internet traffic. With Zscaler, this customer is consolidating multiple point products and expects a payback on the purchase within nine months. Our emerging products, including ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads continued to see increased adoption and contributed 18% of our new business in fiscal 2023. We expect emerging products contribution to increase to over 20% in fiscal \u201824. I'd like to highlight two deals that are driven by our emerging products. In a seven figure ACV upsell deal, a Fortune 50 insurance company purchased ZDX Advanced for all 170,000 users after realizing value from their initial ZIA deployment. With the Zscaler platform already in place, ZDX gets deployed quickly, reduces troubleshooting time and improves field agent productivity. We directly impact the customer's revenue and their agents' ability to earn commissions. ZDX exemplifies the platform benefits of our zero trust exchange and expands our share of customer spending beyond security. In another seven figure ACV upsell win, a Fortune 10 healthcare company purchased Zscaler for Workloads just one quarter after making their initial purchase of Zscaler for users for all 150,000 employees. With workload protection, this customer is accelerating the plans to move most of their on-prem workloads to the cloud as well as protect workload traffic from over 9,000 locations. Lastly, let me highlight our success in the federal vertical. 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies are our customers, and we are starting to see larger awards from these agencies. Let me highlight one such agency wide deal. We were awarded a multiyear contract from an agency with more than 100,000 users. The value of this contract will be realized over time based on deployment with the field units. Against this award, we received a mid seven figure ACV task order for ZIA and ZPA. This customer chose Zscaler over firewall vendors because our cloud native architecture delivers better security and user experience, all while meeting FedRAMP requirements. We remain the only cloud security service to have two key products at the highest level of FedRAMP certification. These certifications and the executive order for zero trust security are driving a significant opportunity for us in the federal market. Next, let me discuss some key industry trends. Cybersecurity remains the number one IT priority and having the right security architecture is fundamental to reducing cyber risk. According to our latest Zscaler ThreatLabZ VPN Risk Report, nearly half of enterprises reported they were targeted by cyber attackers who exploited a VPN vulnerability, and a third of enterprises fell victim to ransomware attacks within the past year. Growing cyber threats, including ransomware, are driving IT leaders to transform security from legacy network security to zero trust architecture. True zero trust security can't be built by spinning up a bunch of virtual firewalls and VPNs in a public cloud. Do you know any VPN vendor whose products have not been compromised? Our architectural differentiation gives us long term advantage. As you may have seen, investors and regulators are increasing pressure on companies to improve cyber security. With the new SEC requirement to report a material security incident in four business days, there will be increased executive and Board level focus on cybersecurity. Zscaler zero trust exchange platform delivers comprehensive security controls for visibility and fast reporting, each of which is now a must have for meeting corporate governance requirements. In this environment, customers cannot risk transformational and mission critical projects with immature offerings from unproven vendors. Both legacy vendors and newcomers in the security industry have tried to mimic our messaging. The reality is that no vendor comes close to providing a depth of functionality and level of performance at our scale. Good enough in cybersecurity is never good enough. Next, let me discuss AI, which is top of mind for customers and investors. Generative AI has tremendous potential to unlock insights, improve employee productivity and solve complex problems. However, the risk of data loss and issue of data sovereignty are limiting the potential of this new technology. To address these concerns, we already delivered data protection capabilities that prevent the leakage of sensitive data through AI prompts and appropriated into public training models. For example, our browser isolation session would not let employees paste or type any sensitive information into GenAI prompts. This not only enables employees to use AI, but also do so in a secure manner for enterprises. Our engineering teams have innovated rapidly on new AI driven functionality that's available in our premium price bundles. such as auto classification of unstructured data for advanced data protection and auto segmentation of applications for zero trust access. Second, we will have new products based on AI that will provide significant upsell opportunities with our customers. We recently launched Risk360, which enables executive teams and boards to better understand the risk posture of their organizations and provides unparalleled visibility with up-to-date security status and corrective actions they can implement in a timely fashion. Using AI, I believe we will be able to use our unique dataset to also predict and prevent most of today's ransomware and other sophisticated attacks on our customers. AI driven cyber insights and prevention has the potential to add tremendous customer value. And we believe we can monetize that opportunity. Zscaler has AI experts and data scientists and valuable, anonymized private data to customize and train LLM models for the security domain. Based on a proxy architecture, our Zero Trust Exchange plus exchange like a private switchboard that captures all communication logs. we have the largest inline security cloud, inspecting over 320 billion transactions daily with transactions doubling every 18 months. These logs provide more than 500 trillion signals per day that feed our AI models for better detection of user and application traffic anomalies, resulting in a positive network effect of superior threat protection for our customers. We have been investing in AI for quite a while including our first AI acquisition in 2018, and we will continue to invest in fiscal \u201824 for rapid AI innovations, cloud enhancements, and go-to-market to take our AI solutions to the market. All investments will be made within the envelope of margin guidance that Remo will discuss. In closing, we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We have a track record of building and growing new innovations like ZDX, data protection and Zero Trust of Workloads, and we are now turning our attention to AI. We believe these new products will contribute increasingly to our future growth. Our business value message is resonating in this challenging macro environment, and more customers are adopting our broader platform to consolidate multiple point products. We believe customers trust Zscaler more than any other provider for securing the zero trust journey. We have grown our global team to nearly 6,000 employees with a mission to secure the hyper connected world of cloud AI and mobility. I'm extremely proud of the strong growth and profitability we delivered in fiscal \u201823. I want to thank our employees and our partners for their tireless efforts and commitment to our customer success. We will invest aggressively to delight our customers and capture the large opportunity ahead of us while continuing to deliver operational excellence. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. We are pleased with our strong performance in Q4 and solid execution, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals, Revenue was $455 million, up 43% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. ZPA product revenue grew 57% year-over-year. This will be the last quarter that we break out ZPA revenue separately as we're increasingly selling solution bundles that involve multiple product pillars. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 53% of revenue, EMEA was 32% and APJ was 15%. For the full year, revenue was $1.62 billion, up 48% year-over-year. Our total calculated billings in Q4 grew 38% year-over-year to $719 million. On a sequential basis, total billings grew 49% quarter-over-quarter. Total billings benefited from a $20 million upfront billing on a multiyear deal. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years. We primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Our calculated current billings grew 33% year-over-year and 42% quarter-over-quarter. From a vertical perspective, we saw strong growth across our key verticals. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 35% from a year ago to $3.51 billion. The current RPO is approximately 49% of the total RPO. We ended the year with 449 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding a record 49 $1 million ARR customers in the quarter. The continued strength of this large customer metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customer's digital transformation initiatives. We also ended the quarter with 2,609 customers with greater than a $100,000 in ARR. Our 12-month trailing dollar based net retention rate was 121% in Q4. Turning to the rest of our financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.7% compares to 80.2% in the prior quarter and 81.6% in the year ago quarter. Higher public cloud usage for emerging products drove the year-over-year change in gross margin. As Jay mentioned, emerging products are growing as a percentage of our new business and contributed 18% of new ACV in fiscal 2023 compared to 14% in fiscal 2022. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 27% year-over-year to $281 million. Due to our focus on spending discipline this year, we generated significant operating leverage in our model, with operating margin reaching 19%, an increase of approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 22%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue. For the full year, our operating margin was 15% and free cash flow margin was 21%. We ended the quarter with over $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In August, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment. With advances in technology and efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment starting in fiscal 2024, we're extending the depreciable useful life for these assets in our cloud infrastructure for four to five years. We expect the impact of this change to be approximately a 50 basis point benefit to our gross margin for the fully year. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance. From our perspective, the global macro environment remains uncertain, and customers continue to scrutinize large deals. In addition, in select instances, we will continue to enable new strategic customers to ramp into larger subscription commitments. Typically, these ramp deals reduce our first year billings but will grow into a higher annual run rate level in the second year. In Q4, for example, the net impact of ramp deals was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point to billings growth. We expect the net impact of ramps will be neutral to billings in fiscal 2024. In our outlook for fiscal \u201824, we're balancing our business optimism and confidence in our improved execution with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. We are entering Q1 with a record pipeline, and our customer engagements remain strong. However, we are mindful that in this environment, predicting close rates and ramps in any 90 day period remains challenging. With a large market opportunity, and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we will invest aggressively to position us for long term growth and profitability. With that in mind, let me provide our guidance for Q1 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $472 million to $474 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 33%. Gross margins of 80%, including the change in accounting for useful life of server equipment. I would also like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We're currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. In addition, we'll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure to scale with the growing demand. Operating profit in the range of $70 million to $72 million, net other income of $14 million, income taxes of $8 million, earnings per share in the range of $0.48 to $0.49, assuming a 159 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.065 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 27% to 28%. Calculated billings in the range of $2.52 billion to $2.56 billion or year-over-year growth of 24% to 26%. We expect Q1 billings to grow approximately 30% on a year-over-year basis. We also expect our first half mix to be approximately 42% of our full year billings guide. Operating profit in the range of $330 million to $340 million, which reflects approximately 100 basis points to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year. Income taxes of $35 million, earnings per share in the range of $2.20 to $2.25, assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be slightly above 20%. Finally, we expect our data center CapEx to be high single digit percentage of revenue for the full year. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much and congrats on such a strong finish to the year. Jay, can you address why Zscaler wasn't included in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE? And if that's slowing you down at all because it certainly doesn't seem to be in. And maybe just a quick one for Remo. Remo guiding 25% billings growth off of a year where you're clearly outperforming peers is quite impressive. What should we be mindful of beyond what you've already told us in terms of your inputs and degrees of upside and downside risk versus what you've delivered historically? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Right. So, Brad, this MQ is not slowing us down at all. SASE is a broad genetic [indiscernible]. When Gartner started it a few years ago, it was an integration of SD-WAN and SSE, the gateway products we have. And we've done integration with every FD vendor that matters out there. So but that MQ that got started this time was for single vendor SASE with SD-WAN offering in it. We have often said that SD-WAN is offering zero trust [in space] (ph). We do offer zero trust SASE. But we don't offer SD-WAN SASE. So we're [indiscernible]. We are about changing the world, not really propagating the old world, and we are very successful in doing so.\nRemo Canessa: And Brad, related to guidance, you know, the positives are, our pipeline is record pipeline. Our execution was very good in Q4, which gives us confidence. The potential downside is the global macro environment. We've taken that into account. From our view, for fiscal 2024, we're seeing a similar environment as we did in '23. The guidance that we have, as you called out, 24% to 26%, we feel is very strong guidance, which supported by our optimism that we're seeing in our business related to also what we see at the global macro situation.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Congrats on the quarter. Jay, I was particularly impressed, comments on emerging product success. Seems to be really kicking in here this year and even more so next year. Now I was curious on workload protection. It seems to be resonating a lot of partner conversations that you mentioned on call. Maybe just a little bit more details on why that's resonating, because I think if some of these add on products continue to do what they're doing, it certainly opens up much larger TAM than kind of the core ZIA and ZPA?\nJay Chaudhry: So when we started ZIA, ZPA, we started for users. A user can securely communicate with applications. It's natural to extend ZIA for workflows, ZPA who workflows because workflows need to talk to each other in zero trust fashion. So our customers understand it and appreciate it. It's a great upsell opportunity for us to expand our ARPU as well as, customer spend with us. So we are seeing good success. The deal size is still smaller because the number of workloads in various stages, various customers. But we literally have no competition when it comes to this area because we're the only provider that's actually offering zero trust communication among workloads or workloads through Internet. We are upbeat about it for fiscal \u201824 as well.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks, Jay. Congrats.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd of UBS. Again, Roger Boyd of UBS. Your line is open.\nRoger Boyd: Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. Jay, a lot has been made about Microsoft\u2019s entry into this market. Very high level, but Microsoft pretty specifically is targeting the SSE security edge space and not SASE space. Just maybe a follow-up to Brad's question, do you see that distinction as maybe further legitimizing the SSE approach relative to single vendor SASE? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. So SSE is widely understood and accepted. It's essentially the combination know, ZIA and ZPA rebuilt. But the time for SSE is large, and it's getting larger, then the market appreciates today. From Microsoft, it was natural to be in the market for identity and endpoint security as they have traditionally owned active directory and Windows operating system. But inline security is a totally new area for them. This area of SSE that we pioneered has a very high bar, high performance, great security, no slowing down and supporting a range of destinations. In fact, it's like being the [indiscernible]. We have to connect to applications that are on Microsoft and AWS and GCP and a thousand SaaS applications out there. So customers like the positioning of a provider like Zscaler that's not tied to applications itself. And Zscaler has earned trust of large enterprises. They'll take time for any new entrant. Yes, Microsoft entries further validation, but we don't believe it'll impact us because of a positioning the large enterprise market and there may be some impact on the lower end of the market.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks, and hi, gentlemen. Congrats, a great finish for the year. I guess I want to talk about the competitive landscape of the more traditional firewall guys, Palo Alto and Fortinet more recently, and I guess, Check Point [referring and] (ph) acquisition recently as well are clearly trying to make big efforts here. Maybe you could talk about the competitive environment. I mean, what way is it today different than what it was a year ago? And what -- what are you seeing from your competitors more kind of near term here?\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. On the high end of the market, we -- where we do extremely well, we really haven't seen a change. If there's any change, I would say, art position has further solidified, and I would even say it has gotten somewhat easier on the higher end of the market. When it comes to the firewall market, we are replacing firewalls in the branches. When Zscaler gets deployed with zero trust architecture, there's no room for any firewall on the branch office. Now there are still firewalls in the data center and the light because we don't play inside the data center for east-west traffic and alike. But as customers are doing local breakout of traffic from every location, the amount of traffic going through the data center is slowing down, which is bound to impact the sales and demand for firewalls out there. So we do believe that the shift we have been talking about to truly zero trust away from traditional firewalls and VPN is happening and it'll continue.\nIttai Kidron: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter, particularly on the billings. I mean, it looks like you solidly exceeded that even if you pull out that $20 million deal upfront. So I wanted to ask about the data protection products that you call out. You spent a lot of time talking about it on the call, and based on the info on your slide deck, it looks like there's a lot of components to that beyond just data protection. So maybe, could you just talk about some of the vendors that you're competing against there? I think you said one customer, you replaced two of their -- two different vendors. Maybe you can just expand on what you're seeing there from a competitive perspective? And maybe how competitive is it relative to like the markets for ZIA and ZPA? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yeah. So data protection becomes a natural thing for us when traffic starts flowing through Zscaler. So, literally, it's hard to have any other data protection vendor when Zscaler is actually sitting in the traffic path. So what are some of the pieces of success here? First of all, DLP, data loss prevention, which essentially is done on the traffic that's in line. We are replacing the number one vendor, we're replacing there is Symantec 12, which is widely deployed. So first, we deployed Symantec, Blue Coat boxes, and no, the DLP is the secondary piece. The third big area we're replacing is some of the CASB vendors. CASB early on got sold as a point product as a module. For us, it's a feature. So any customer who has pure play SaaS be deployed essentially gets kind of replaced by our data protection platform. So those are two big areas. But in addition, now we are seeing some of the newer areas coming up. For example, our endpoint DLP, which we recently launched, is getting tremendous attraction out there, the email DLP module we added is wonderful as well. Through acquisition of Canonic, we have added the SaaS, the ecosystem, sorry, supply chain via data protection. So all this has made Zscaler the most comprehensive platform, and it's sitting traffic line. That's why we kind of called it out because the growth is great, over 60% year-over-year. And we are close to $0.25 billion in ARR.\nAndrew Nowinski: That's great. Thanks, Jay. Keep up the good work.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question and congrats on the results. Jay, I was wondering if you maybe or even Remo as well, give us a little bit more color in terms of the ramp deals that you saw this quarter. Is there a way to quantify what percentage of deals were ramp versus prior quarters and how does that typically, how do the dynamics of those deals work in terms of the amounts of commitments, the pricing, and the flexibility around ramping? And does it give you more flexibility? Or does it give you more visibility around what you see in the pipeline in terms of coverage over future periods? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: I mean, I'll start and maybe Jay could contribute also. Ramp was a headwind about 1% for us. Four larger deals that we're doing, as we talked about in the past, is that we use ramp with our customers to basically ramp into the full suite of products that we have. What we're seeing is we're seeing customers buy more of our platform upfront. We're seeing also existing customers expanding their platform with ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and data protection. So when they're buying the full suite of our products, basically, we use it as a vehicle to allow our customers to ramp into our products and we get that type of pricing. I would expect ramps just to kind of follow into fiscal \u201824. I'd expect the same level of ramps in fiscal 2024 at this point. The ramps do give us better visibility into billings because basically they'll start off with lower billings and then ramp up their billings in future periods. But, it is a vehicle that we use. It's been very effective. And so we'll continue to use it. And, Jay?\nJay Chaudhry: Yeah, if I may add. The bigger the platform we sell, the more likely you need to provide ramp because the more pieces to be done. Number two, there's some of the tighter macro environment bigger deals scrutiny. Ramp did pick up in the past year or so as compared to two years ago. We factor that in as a part of doing business, and it's not a bad thing. We just have to manage it right way.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell of BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Okay. Great. Yeah, Gray Powell from BTIG. Thanks for taking the question and, congrats on the good results. So, a couple of related questions on my side. Can you talk about the visibility you have on late stage pipeline today relative to this time last year? And I guess I'm just trying to get your confidence in billings. Does the higher percentage of brand deals today, does that help give you better visibility on the growth outlook?\nJay Chaudhry: Our visibility is good. So, as we talked about, we've had, a record pipeline and our execution also in Q4. So I would say, visibility for us is good and supports our guidance. Certainly the billings, with the ramps, give us also a good visibility too. So, our guidance, I feel, 24% to 26% is very good guidance, and takes into account our visibility and all factors. And also, if I may add, we have a record pipeline, and we're seeing pretty good momentum on our business. We were in Vegas doing our sales kickoff a couple of weeks ago. The energy and excitement in the room could be felt. Actually, it was very good because our sales team have a lot of confidence. We talked about the record pipeline, the record deals out there. We talked about the new momentum the channel is adding to us. So we feel very good about our fiscal \u201824 business.\nGray Powell: That's perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver of Cantor. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes, thank you. So I have a question on the emerging product portfolio. You highlighted how it represented 18% new business in fiscal '23, you expect that to get to plus 20% in fiscal '24. It just seems to me like plus 20%. I'm not sure what that plus could be, but it seems like a low bar just given your comments on data security, ZDX, and cloud, including, the tailwind that you talked about from AI that is going to benefit some of those products. So can you just help us understand demand dynamics within that portfolio, the puts and takes of specific products where you expect to see the strongest demand?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. If I may start, it is all coming out of 100% only. Okay. That's the most important point when the overall growth is pretty strong. Okay. And for the new product, even if it grows 70%, 80% percent a year, it has to work very hard to even take away 1% or 2% from the total new ACV. That's pretty significant. So the growth of these new products is much faster than the growth of the overall new ACV, but they are fairly small and they're growing into good business. We called out data protection as it became a significant part of the business. And I think here too, you're seeing our combination of workload protection and ZDX both are growing at a much faster rate. So I think we are actually happy with the growth rate, but the point I was trying to make is they are trying to steal away the market share on the rest of the overall portfolio, which has a much bigger base. That's why the math looks small, but it is pretty impressive.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yeah. understood. Good point, Jay. Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and I echo my congrats on a good quarter. I kind of want to go back to the first question. And, if you look at the guidance, the implied new billings kind of looks like a little bit more aggressive, I would say, than the last two years. So maybe just, level set for us or set some guardrails or expectations around kind of the puts and takes on what it would take for you guys to kind of outperform what you laid out for the next 12 months for us, please?\nJay Chaudhry: Let me start to give you a big picture and Remo, you can add your color to it. So our guidance is starting with first of all, a record pipeline and the momentum we have in the business. And we have plenty of product to sell. We have a growing market opportunity and many business drivers. We have a lot of new customers who are really buying zero trust for better security. Lots of market that's not covered. We are still in about 30% of global 2000 market. And we're seeing public sector coming strong, federal market coming strong. And that's really, further pushed by some of the mandates that are happening out there. And you saw in some of the deals that are announced, customers are increasingly buying more of these kind of platform leading to bigger deals. CI ZPA, our flagship products are still doing strong. We have factored into good growth for data protection, which complements. It actually needs to go on every Zscaler,customer. Emerging products are contributing nicely, and they are contributing. So when you look at all this, that's what we took into factor to give you our guidance. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. I mean, our guidance basically balances our business optimism that we see with our company, also with the macro environment. We feel in this market, this is very solid guidance.\nJoshua Tilton: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. I want to echo my congrats on the result. Remo, maybe for you, just to switch it up a little bit. Great to see the free cash flow margin expansion thus far. Maybe looking forward, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on free cash flow margin with I think the 20% plus guide for next year, how are you thinking about things like billings duration or CapEx or anything that's maybe influencing that number? Because it's great to see operating margin expand. Why isn't free cash flow margin maybe expanding in the same way? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah, Saket, that's a great question. The billing duration, I would assume the similar type billing duration as we had in fiscal '23, so no change. CapEx, we do expect CapEx to be a higher percentage. If you take a look at the last two years, our CapEx has been in the 6% range of our revenue. We expect our CapEx to be in the high single digit type range. We're seeing the expansion of our business. We're going to be making investments in cloud. And again, it's -- that's the main reason.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you for taking the question and I'll echo my congrats. Jay, getting back to data protection, so your multimodal DLP that combines video and audio formats, that's interesting to me. Curious if you had any early customer feedback on that feature. And then secondly, what has been the early uptake around your new Risk360 offering just in terms of visualizing risk, etcetera? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: So multimodal DLP is still in development. it's not shipping, but there's a bunch of engagement with customers and interest is high because there's nothing like this out there in the market. You don't [indiscernible] pioneer new things that no one has done out there. Risk360, on the other hand, is actually a shipping. We have taken a bunch of orders. This product has more interest up front than any of the other products I can think of because our engagement with CISOs are strong. When a CISO looks at SC60 and say, wow, I have actually a single point to really tell me the holistic view of my business and actually where my risk factors are and what tangible prioritize actions I could take through my wrist. So there is a significant velocity going on, very, very good feedback and the product is growing very rapidly in terms of functionality as well.\nGregg Moskowitz: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Again, Mr. DiFucci, your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. So guys, it as everybody has said, the numbers look good. It was a nice quarter. But when we try to look at, like, the new business signings, it looks like it saw a tick down against a similar comp versus what I think was sort of a monster quarter, the third quarter. And Remo, you mentioned the continued macro pressure. And of course, everybody sees that. But is this quarter how we should expect Zscaler to sort of be going forward in regards to business momentum and new business signings. Or was the third quarter a better gauged on what we should expect going forward against this macro backdrop?\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. I mean, our new and upsell bookings were up year over year. So, for Q4, so it was a good quarter. From my perspective, John, I mean, it's a huge market opportunity, on the part of Zscaler. I don't want to make any projections related to our doing upsell billings because we don't get that guidance. But let me just say that our pipeline for new and upsell is very strong. and we had really strong and good execution in our Q4 which gives us confidence. So I feel that we're well positioned to go forward, and really do well. As I mentioned, and it's come up a few times, the wild card really is the global macro backdrop. And so we're expecting the global macro environment to stay similar year-over-year. And so we'll see how that plays through. But from a company perspective, for what we did in Q4 and how our business tracked, we had a very strong quarter which gives us optimism going into fiscal \u201824. The point I'll also add is since Zscaler can actually reduce cost while reducing business [risk, there is added attractions] (ph). We're able to engage with customers and close deals even when the macro is tight. We also kind of felt very good about the record number of $1 million deals we closed in Q4. So I see strength across all major areas, major vertical arrangements, and that's why we feel good about it.\nJohn DiFucci: That all that all makes sense. And thanks for taking my question. I mean, what you guys are doing is better than most everybody out there. But, I guess just quick follow-up, Remo, you said your bookings were up year-over-year. If you look at current billings, and I don't know if you look at it that way, I guess I do, but I'm looking, I'm trying to [back into] (ph) new ACV, new ARR depending upon the company. For you, it's new ACV. Was that up year-over-year? For most companies, it's not. And we calculate it being down a little bit, but still better than most.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. We're not commenting on new ACV, but our bookings were up year-over-year. And I think that's a good way to look at the business.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. And thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just for Remo, a couple of related housekeeping follow ups. So NRR, I think, was at 121%, below 125% for the first time after a number of quarters. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about that and patients to next year. And I apologize if I missed it as a follow-up, but billings duration in the quarter, just what did that turn out to be and without a headwind or tailwind? Thanks so much.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. So NRR at 121%, we feel is outstanding. What we're seeing is that we're seeing more customers buying more of our platform upfront. So when customers are buying more of your platform upfront, that'll impact what they're going to purchase in the future. Also, we called out on the call a Fortune 10 company bought basically within one quarter So if you're buying within the year based on the calculation for NRR, that impacts it. From my perspective, and we've been saying this since our public offering is billings is really the best measure to really look at Zscaler. Like, we still feel that The only time we look at NRR, is really at the end of the quarter. It is a metric that we look at, but really what I look at is basically our total billings, whether it comes from new or upsell. Related to billing duration, it was a tailwind in Q4.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Levine of Evercore. Your line is open.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here guys. So I mean want to just follow-up on the GenAI opportunity, you know, at your Analyst Day -- not your Analyst Day but your customer conference a couple of weeks ago, you announced the security autopilot, maybe, Remo, for one. Can you just put a final point in terms of how your plan on monetizing that as usage base? Is it just an upsell to kind of the normal contract subscription? And then second to Jay is your competitors are all saying same thing in terms of your data's proprietary. Maybe the same question to you is, what do you think makes Zscaler's data proprietary what's your competitive advantage when you go into an RFP versus call it like a, you know, Apollo, whoever it might be that your data is proprietary there is a mode around your business. What would your answer to that be?\nRemo Canessa: So let's start with, data. Larger companies have larger data. What's exciting about Zscaler is we are designed as a switchboard for all communication between different parties. A firewall, it's not a switchboard. Firewall is a door. It's a gate. It says you are inside, your outside. That's number one. Number two, fiber often what's going to short logs. Still a small number of firewall transaction, whether they're on prem or in the cloud as we are SSL decrypted. If the if record\u2019s on, if the transaction non-decrypted, your logs aren\u2019t of much use at all, or if you take DNS logs, they're not very useful at all. It says with DNS which domain are you going to? We have full logs after decryption about all information, including the full URL. The URL has a lot of useful information that we have. Before any reconnaissance -- before any breach happens, reconnaissance starts, it could be trying to exploit software vulnerabilities. It could be client officials, employees, all of that traffic was to us and we collect those logs. And that's why we can actually do some of the things like being able to predict potential breach and the like. So that's one big part on the log side of it. The second question of how do we monetize AI driven products? Don't think of Zscaler having only AI driven products assembly charge. It is going to influence all of our product lines. Today, some of our premium bundles include AI powered products. So we are actually monetizing it as a part of the premium bundles. and they are actually, clearly, highly priced as [computing] (ph) other bundles. Products like Risk360, Leveraging AIML big time is Charge SKU. Some of the new products we're building, they will have upsell, they'll have their own SKUs. So we think there's plenty of opportunities to charge because customers are seeing values from the products we built in.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville. Your line is open. One moment.\nPatrick Colville: All right, thank you so much for putting me in.\nJay Chaudhry: Hey, Patrick. Are you on? Patrick? Hey, Valerie, can we take our last question?\nOperator: Our last -- Patrick's line was open. I don't know if he disconnected. One moment. [Operator Instructions]\nJay Chaudhry: Let me try the next call.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. One moment. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin, Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm interested in how you feel about your progress throughout the broader channel, traditional two tier cloud marketplace GSI. Any thoughts you have around kind of what you've learned over the last six, 12 months and how that's playing into your strategy over the next couple of years? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: As you know, traditionally channel has played a limited role for us. We have been working on it. We are seeing more and more progress being made. Just to clarify, I mean, we do take all these through channel with some exceptions, but customers insist on us. So that's one part. We are seeing yesar after year or in the past several quarters channel providing more leverage to us. That means doing more work for us. We recently hired our channel chief Karl Soderlund. He comes from extensive experience and strong relations in the channel, and he's done a lot of work in three areas of channels, system integrators, [bars] (ph), and service providers. In that system integration space, we have actually most of the large SI. They have selected and deployed C Scalar for wound transformation and zero source architecture. So they are not embedding our solution into the SI advisory service switches, very good because then it becomes a lot better. We also, so we're counting on more leverage on broad channel, even the bar channel itself. They're going through some focused training program, enabling program, which will help them do more transformation with us. In fact, we had nearly 200 channel partners come to our sales kickoff and join hands and conduct session with our sales teams. We think that's bringing our team is a lot more closer to work together with common account planning and the like. So we please do progress, and we think we're moving in the right direction.\nBen Bollin: Thanks, guys. Have a great night.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nBill Choi: Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry : Well, thank you all for your interest in Zscaler. I'm looking forward to seeing you at some of our investor conferences. Thank you, again.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. We are pleased with our strong performance in Q4 and solid execution, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals, Revenue was $455 million, up 43% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. ZPA product revenue grew 57% year-over-year. This will be the last quarter that we break out ZPA revenue separately as we're increasingly selling solution bundles that involve multiple product pillars. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 53% of revenue, EMEA was 32% and APJ was 15%. For the full year, revenue was $1.62 billion, up 48% year-over-year. Our total calculated billings in Q4 grew 38% year-over-year to $719 million. On a sequential basis, total billings grew 49% quarter-over-quarter. Total billings benefited from a $20 million upfront billing on a multiyear deal. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years. We primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Our calculated current billings grew 33% year-over-year and 42% quarter-over-quarter. From a vertical perspective, we saw strong growth across our key verticals. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 35% from a year ago to $3.51 billion. The current RPO is approximately 49% of the total RPO. We ended the year with 449 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding a record 49 $1 million ARR customers in the quarter. The continued strength of this large customer metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customer's digital transformation initiatives. We also ended the quarter with 2,609 customers with greater than a $100,000 in ARR. Our 12-month trailing dollar based net retention rate was 121% in Q4. Turning to the rest of our financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.7% compares to 80.2% in the prior quarter and 81.6% in the year ago quarter. Higher public cloud usage for emerging products drove the year-over-year change in gross margin. As Jay mentioned, emerging products are growing as a percentage of our new business and contributed 18% of new ACV in fiscal 2023 compared to 14% in fiscal 2022. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 27% year-over-year to $281 million. Due to our focus on spending discipline this year, we generated significant operating leverage in our model, with operating margin reaching 19%, an increase of approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 22%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue. For the full year, our operating margin was 15% and free cash flow margin was 21%. We ended the quarter with over $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In August, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment. With advances in technology and efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment starting in fiscal 2024, we're extending the depreciable useful life for these assets in our cloud infrastructure for four to five years. We expect the impact of this change to be approximately a 50 basis point benefit to our gross margin for the fully year. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance. From our perspective, the global macro environment remains uncertain, and customers continue to scrutinize large deals. In addition, in select instances, we will continue to enable new strategic customers to ramp into larger subscription commitments. Typically, these ramp deals reduce our first year billings but will grow into a higher annual run rate level in the second year. In Q4, for example, the net impact of ramp deals was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point to billings growth. We expect the net impact of ramps will be neutral to billings in fiscal 2024. In our outlook for fiscal \u201824, we're balancing our business optimism and confidence in our improved execution with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. We are entering Q1 with a record pipeline, and our customer engagements remain strong. However, we are mindful that in this environment, predicting close rates and ramps in any 90 day period remains challenging. With a large market opportunity, and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we will invest aggressively to position us for long term growth and profitability. With that in mind, let me provide our guidance for Q1 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $472 million to $474 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 33%. Gross margins of 80%, including the change in accounting for useful life of server equipment. I would also like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We're currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. In addition, we'll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure to scale with the growing demand. Operating profit in the range of $70 million to $72 million, net other income of $14 million, income taxes of $8 million, earnings per share in the range of $0.48 to $0.49, assuming a 159 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.065 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 27% to 28%. Calculated billings in the range of $2.52 billion to $2.56 billion or year-over-year growth of 24% to 26%. We expect Q1 billings to grow approximately 30% on a year-over-year basis. We also expect our first half mix to be approximately 42% of our full year billings guide. Operating profit in the range of $330 million to $340 million, which reflects approximately 100 basis points to 150 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year. Income taxes of $35 million, earnings per share in the range of $2.20 to $2.25, assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be slightly above 20%. Finally, we expect our data center CapEx to be high single digit percentage of revenue for the full year. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. And Brad, related to guidance, you know, the positives are, our pipeline is record pipeline. Our execution was very good in Q4, which gives us confidence. The potential downside is the global macro environment. We've taken that into account. From our view, for fiscal 2024, we're seeing a similar environment as we did in '23. The guidance that we have, as you called out, 24% to 26%, we feel is very strong guidance, which supported by our optimism that we're seeing in our business related to also what we see at the global macro situation. I mean, I'll start and maybe Jay could contribute also. Ramp was a headwind about 1% for us. Four larger deals that we're doing, as we talked about in the past, is that we use ramp with our customers to basically ramp into the full suite of products that we have. What we're seeing is we're seeing customers buy more of our platform upfront. We're seeing also existing customers expanding their platform with ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and data protection. So when they're buying the full suite of our products, basically, we use it as a vehicle to allow our customers to ramp into our products and we get that type of pricing. I would expect ramps just to kind of follow into fiscal \u201824. I'd expect the same level of ramps in fiscal 2024 at this point. The ramps do give us better visibility into billings because basically they'll start off with lower billings and then ramp up their billings in future periods. But, it is a vehicle that we use. It's been very effective. And so we'll continue to use it. And, Jay? Yeah. I mean, our guidance basically balances our business optimism that we see with our company, also with the macro environment. We feel in this market, this is very solid guidance. Yeah, Saket, that's a great question. The billing duration, I would assume the similar type billing duration as we had in fiscal '23, so no change. CapEx, we do expect CapEx to be a higher percentage. If you take a look at the last two years, our CapEx has been in the 6% range of our revenue. We expect our CapEx to be in the high single digit type range. We're seeing the expansion of our business. We're going to be making investments in cloud. And again, it's -- that's the main reason. Yeah. I mean, our new and upsell bookings were up year over year. So, for Q4, so it was a good quarter. From my perspective, John, I mean, it's a huge market opportunity, on the part of Zscaler. I don't want to make any projections related to our doing upsell billings because we don't get that guidance. But let me just say that our pipeline for new and upsell is very strong. and we had really strong and good execution in our Q4 which gives us confidence. So I feel that we're well positioned to go forward, and really do well. As I mentioned, and it's come up a few times, the wild card really is the global macro backdrop. And so we're expecting the global macro environment to stay similar year-over-year. And so we'll see how that plays through. But from a company perspective, for what we did in Q4 and how our business tracked, we had a very strong quarter which gives us optimism going into fiscal \u201824. The point I'll also add is since Zscaler can actually reduce cost while reducing business [risk, there is added attractions] (ph). We're able to engage with customers and close deals even when the macro is tight. We also kind of felt very good about the record number of $1 million deals we closed in Q4. So I see strength across all major areas, major vertical arrangements, and that's why we feel good about it. Yeah. We're not commenting on new ACV, but our bookings were up year-over-year. And I think that's a good way to look at the business. Thank you. Yeah. So NRR at 121%, we feel is outstanding. What we're seeing is that we're seeing more customers buying more of our platform upfront. So when customers are buying more of your platform upfront, that'll impact what they're going to purchase in the future. Also, we called out on the call a Fortune 10 company bought basically within one quarter So if you're buying within the year based on the calculation for NRR, that impacts it. From my perspective, and we've been saying this since our public offering is billings is really the best measure to really look at Zscaler. Like, we still feel that The only time we look at NRR, is really at the end of the quarter. It is a metric that we look at, but really what I look at is basically our total billings, whether it comes from new or upsell. Related to billing duration, it was a tailwind in Q4. So let's start with, data. Larger companies have larger data. What's exciting about Zscaler is we are designed as a switchboard for all communication between different parties. A firewall, it's not a switchboard. Firewall is a door. It's a gate. It says you are inside, your outside. That's number one. Number two, fiber often what's going to short logs. Still a small number of firewall transaction, whether they're on prem or in the cloud as we are SSL decrypted. If the if record's on, if the transaction non-decrypted, your logs aren't of much use at all, or if you take DNS logs, they're not very useful at all. It says with DNS which domain are you going to? We have full logs after decryption about all information, including the full URL. The URL has a lot of useful information that we have. Before any reconnaissance -- before any breach happens, reconnaissance starts, it could be trying to exploit software vulnerabilities. It could be client officials, employees, all of that traffic was to us and we collect those logs. And that's why we can actually do some of the things like being able to predict potential breach and the like. So that's one big part on the log side of it. The second question of how do we monetize AI driven products? Don't think of Zscaler having only AI driven products assembly charge. It is going to influence all of our product lines. Today, some of our premium bundles include AI powered products. So we are actually monetizing it as a part of the premium bundles. and they are actually, clearly, highly priced as [computing] (ph) other bundles. Products like Risk360, Leveraging AIML big time is Charge SKU. Some of the new products we're building, they will have upsell, they'll have their own SKUs. So we think there's plenty of opportunities to charge because customers are seeing values from the products we built in. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. We had a strong close to our fiscal year. In Q4, we delivered 43% revenue growth and 38% billings growth with balanced growth across all verticals, customer segments, and geographies. For the full year, our revenue grew 48% to $1.6 billion and billings grew 37% to over $2 billion. In addition to achieving record billings in the quarter, we also set records across several other measures. We added the highest number of $1 million ARR customers, generated record new pipeline for a Q4 and attained record operating profit margin. I'm proud of our team's achievements and humbled by the trust our customers are placing in our platform. While the macro environment remains challenging, we are executing well. With cybersecurity as a high priority, IT executives are moving forward with zero trust initiatives driving our business. As I mentioned before, we are partnering earlier with CXOs to create compelling CFO-ready business cases with clear ROI and payback periods. As our results demonstrate, refining our high-touch sales process is helping get large deals across the finish line. We have a blueprint for delivering immediate value, which drives faster upsells, often within 12 months of initial purchase. We closed a record number of deals over $1 million ACV in Q4, driven by broad based strength across our key industry verticals. In addition to our industry-leading top-line growth, we are generating record profitability. Due to our spending discipline, we achieved a record 19% operating margin as we more than doubled our operating income on a year-over-year basis. These outstanding results reflect the strong unit economics of our business with best in class 80% gross margins. Our innovation and customer obsession drove our Net Promoter Score to exceed 80, which is more than two times the average for SaaS companies and contributed to our high 90% gross retention rate. I am very pleased to announce that we doubled our annual recurring revenue from $1 billion to over $2 billion in seven quarters. reaching a milestone only a select handful of SaaS companies have achieved. We secure over 7,700 customers and protect over 41 million users. With every customer looking to adopt zero trust architecture in today's world of cloud, AI, and mobility, we believe we are in the early stages of capturing a large share of our $72 billion market opportunity. We have our sights set on achieving our next goal of $5 billion in ARR. We are on a mission to take zero trust everywhere to users, workloads and OT systems and become the go-to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased business agility and better cyber and data protection. To fully realize the business value enabled by our platform, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for users, our complete zero trust solution for user protection, which includes ZIA, ZPA, ZDX, and data protection. In addition, we are gaining traction with workload protection powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. These broader platform purchases drove 37% year-over-year growth in customers with greater than $1 million in ARR. We ended the quarter with nearly 450 such customers, including 43 customers exceeding $5 million. Let me highlight one deal where the customer purchased all product pillars. A large global system integrator partner headquarter in Asia became a customer and adopted our platform to enable their work from anywhere strategy. They purchased ZIA, ZDX and advanced data protection for 300,000 users and ZPA for 270,000 users. They also purchased workload protection and deception technology to improve application security for their hybrid environment. This customer can now open new offices and offshore development centers much faster and more securely. They are also seeing a 50% in the time to onboard employees. As a highly distributed organization with data everywhere, data protection was a major consideration for them and accounted for 20% of the deal value. Data protection is an important new pillar of growth for us, approaching a $0.25 billion in ARR. and growing 60% per year. We are increasingly replacing incumbent legacy DLP in the largest of enterprises with data protection representing a $10 billion plus opportunity for us. Due to targeted investments and rapid innovation, we believe our data protection solution is now at the widest and the deepest in the market, and we are taking data protection beyond users to workloads and devices. Let me highlight a new logo win led by data protection. A large telecom operator purchased Zscaler for users for 80,000 employees. Data protection was a key driver for the win as this customer became increasingly uncomfortable with gaps left by their firewall and VPN based security, which struggles with data protection for TLS encrypted traffic that comprises over 85% of their internet traffic. With Zscaler, this customer is consolidating multiple point products and expects a payback on the purchase within nine months. Our emerging products, including ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads continued to see increased adoption and contributed 18% of our new business in fiscal 2023. We expect emerging products contribution to increase to over 20% in fiscal \u201824. I'd like to highlight two deals that are driven by our emerging products. In a seven figure ACV upsell deal, a Fortune 50 insurance company purchased ZDX Advanced for all 170,000 users after realizing value from their initial ZIA deployment. With the Zscaler platform already in place, ZDX gets deployed quickly, reduces troubleshooting time and improves field agent productivity. We directly impact the customer's revenue and their agents' ability to earn commissions. ZDX exemplifies the platform benefits of our zero trust exchange and expands our share of customer spending beyond security. In another seven figure ACV upsell win, a Fortune 10 healthcare company purchased Zscaler for Workloads just one quarter after making their initial purchase of Zscaler for users for all 150,000 employees. With workload protection, this customer is accelerating the plans to move most of their on-prem workloads to the cloud as well as protect workload traffic from over 9,000 locations. Lastly, let me highlight our success in the federal vertical. 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies are our customers, and we are starting to see larger awards from these agencies. Let me highlight one such agency wide deal. We were awarded a multiyear contract from an agency with more than 100,000 users. The value of this contract will be realized over time based on deployment with the field units. Against this award, we received a mid seven figure ACV task order for ZIA and ZPA. This customer chose Zscaler over firewall vendors because our cloud native architecture delivers better security and user experience, all while meeting FedRAMP requirements. We remain the only cloud security service to have two key products at the highest level of FedRAMP certification. These certifications and the executive order for zero trust security are driving a significant opportunity for us in the federal market. Next, let me discuss some key industry trends. Cybersecurity remains the number one IT priority and having the right security architecture is fundamental to reducing cyber risk. According to our latest Zscaler ThreatLabZ VPN Risk Report, nearly half of enterprises reported they were targeted by cyber attackers who exploited a VPN vulnerability, and a third of enterprises fell victim to ransomware attacks within the past year. Growing cyber threats, including ransomware, are driving IT leaders to transform security from legacy network security to zero trust architecture. True zero trust security can't be built by spinning up a bunch of virtual firewalls and VPNs in a public cloud. Do you know any VPN vendor whose products have not been compromised? Our architectural differentiation gives us long term advantage. As you may have seen, investors and regulators are increasing pressure on companies to improve cyber security. With the new SEC requirement to report a material security incident in four business days, there will be increased executive and Board level focus on cybersecurity. Zscaler zero trust exchange platform delivers comprehensive security controls for visibility and fast reporting, each of which is now a must have for meeting corporate governance requirements. In this environment, customers cannot risk transformational and mission critical projects with immature offerings from unproven vendors. Both legacy vendors and newcomers in the security industry have tried to mimic our messaging. The reality is that no vendor comes close to providing a depth of functionality and level of performance at our scale. Good enough in cybersecurity is never good enough. Next, let me discuss AI, which is top of mind for customers and investors. Generative AI has tremendous potential to unlock insights, improve employee productivity and solve complex problems. However, the risk of data loss and issue of data sovereignty are limiting the potential of this new technology. To address these concerns, we already delivered data protection capabilities that prevent the leakage of sensitive data through AI prompts and appropriated into public training models. For example, our browser isolation session would not let employees paste or type any sensitive information into GenAI prompts. This not only enables employees to use AI, but also do so in a secure manner for enterprises. Our engineering teams have innovated rapidly on new AI driven functionality that's available in our premium price bundles. such as auto classification of unstructured data for advanced data protection and auto segmentation of applications for zero trust access. Second, we will have new products based on AI that will provide significant upsell opportunities with our customers. We recently launched Risk360, which enables executive teams and boards to better understand the risk posture of their organizations and provides unparalleled visibility with up-to-date security status and corrective actions they can implement in a timely fashion. Using AI, I believe we will be able to use our unique dataset to also predict and prevent most of today's ransomware and other sophisticated attacks on our customers. AI driven cyber insights and prevention has the potential to add tremendous customer value. And we believe we can monetize that opportunity. Zscaler has AI experts and data scientists and valuable, anonymized private data to customize and train LLM models for the security domain. Based on a proxy architecture, our Zero Trust Exchange plus exchange like a private switchboard that captures all communication logs. we have the largest inline security cloud, inspecting over 320 billion transactions daily with transactions doubling every 18 months. These logs provide more than 500 trillion signals per day that feed our AI models for better detection of user and application traffic anomalies, resulting in a positive network effect of superior threat protection for our customers. We have been investing in AI for quite a while including our first AI acquisition in 2018, and we will continue to invest in fiscal \u201824 for rapid AI innovations, cloud enhancements, and go-to-market to take our AI solutions to the market. All investments will be made within the envelope of margin guidance that Remo will discuss. In closing, we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We have a track record of building and growing new innovations like ZDX, data protection and Zero Trust of Workloads, and we are now turning our attention to AI. We believe these new products will contribute increasingly to our future growth. Our business value message is resonating in this challenging macro environment, and more customers are adopting our broader platform to consolidate multiple point products. We believe customers trust Zscaler more than any other provider for securing the zero trust journey. We have grown our global team to nearly 6,000 employees with a mission to secure the hyper connected world of cloud AI and mobility. I'm extremely proud of the strong growth and profitability we delivered in fiscal \u201823. I want to thank our employees and our partners for their tireless efforts and commitment to our customer success. We will invest aggressively to delight our customers and capture the large opportunity ahead of us while continuing to deliver operational excellence. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Right. So, Brad, this MQ is not slowing us down at all. SASE is a broad genetic [indiscernible]. When Gartner started it a few years ago, it was an integration of SD-WAN and SSE, the gateway products we have. And we've done integration with every FD vendor that matters out there. So but that MQ that got started this time was for single vendor SASE with SD-WAN offering in it. We have often said that SD-WAN is offering zero trust [in space] (ph). We do offer zero trust SASE. But we don't offer SD-WAN SASE. So we're [indiscernible]. We are about changing the world, not really propagating the old world, and we are very successful in doing so. So when we started ZIA, ZPA, we started for users. A user can securely communicate with applications. It's natural to extend ZIA for workflows, ZPA who workflows because workflows need to talk to each other in zero trust fashion. So our customers understand it and appreciate it. It's a great upsell opportunity for us to expand our ARPU as well as, customer spend with us. So we are seeing good success. The deal size is still smaller because the number of workloads in various stages, various customers. But we literally have no competition when it comes to this area because we're the only provider that's actually offering zero trust communication among workloads or workloads through Internet. We are upbeat about it for fiscal \u201824 as well. Thank you. Thank you. So SSE is widely understood and accepted. It's essentially the combination know, ZIA and ZPA rebuilt. But the time for SSE is large, and it's getting larger, then the market appreciates today. From Microsoft, it was natural to be in the market for identity and endpoint security as they have traditionally owned active directory and Windows operating system. But inline security is a totally new area for them. This area of SSE that we pioneered has a very high bar, high performance, great security, no slowing down and supporting a range of destinations. In fact, it's like being the [indiscernible]. We have to connect to applications that are on Microsoft and AWS and GCP and a thousand SaaS applications out there. So customers like the positioning of a provider like Zscaler that's not tied to applications itself. And Zscaler has earned trust of large enterprises. They'll take time for any new entrant. Yes, Microsoft entries further validation, but we don't believe it'll impact us because of a positioning the large enterprise market and there may be some impact on the lower end of the market. Thank you. On the high end of the market, we -- where we do extremely well, we really haven't seen a change. If there's any change, I would say, art position has further solidified, and I would even say it has gotten somewhat easier on the higher end of the market. When it comes to the firewall market, we are replacing firewalls in the branches. When Zscaler gets deployed with zero trust architecture, there's no room for any firewall on the branch office. Now there are still firewalls in the data center and the light because we don't play inside the data center for east-west traffic and alike. But as customers are doing local breakout of traffic from every location, the amount of traffic going through the data center is slowing down, which is bound to impact the sales and demand for firewalls out there. So we do believe that the shift we have been talking about to truly zero trust away from traditional firewalls and VPN is happening and it'll continue. Thank you. Yeah. So data protection becomes a natural thing for us when traffic starts flowing through Zscaler. So, literally, it's hard to have any other data protection vendor when Zscaler is actually sitting in the traffic path. So what are some of the pieces of success here? First of all, DLP, data loss prevention, which essentially is done on the traffic that's in line. We are replacing the number one vendor, we're replacing there is Symantec 12, which is widely deployed. So first, we deployed Symantec, Blue Coat boxes, and no, the DLP is the secondary piece. The third big area we're replacing is some of the CASB vendors. CASB early on got sold as a point product as a module. For us, it's a feature. So any customer who has pure play SaaS be deployed essentially gets kind of replaced by our data protection platform. So those are two big areas. But in addition, now we are seeing some of the newer areas coming up. For example, our endpoint DLP, which we recently launched, is getting tremendous attraction out there, the email DLP module we added is wonderful as well. Through acquisition of Canonic, we have added the SaaS, the ecosystem, sorry, supply chain via data protection. So all this has made Zscaler the most comprehensive platform, and it's sitting traffic line. That's why we kind of called it out because the growth is great, over 60% year-over-year. And we are close to $0.25 billion in ARR. Thank you. Yeah, if I may add. The bigger the platform we sell, the more likely you need to provide ramp because the more pieces to be done. Number two, there's some of the tighter macro environment bigger deals scrutiny. Ramp did pick up in the past year or so as compared to two years ago. We factor that in as a part of doing business, and it's not a bad thing. We just have to manage it right way. Our visibility is good. So, as we talked about, we've had, a record pipeline and our execution also in Q4. So I would say, visibility for us is good and supports our guidance. Certainly the billings, with the ramps, give us also a good visibility too. So, our guidance, I feel, 24% to 26% is very good guidance, and takes into account our visibility and all factors. And also, if I may add, we have a record pipeline, and we're seeing pretty good momentum on our business. We were in Vegas doing our sales kickoff a couple of weeks ago. The energy and excitement in the room could be felt. Actually, it was very good because our sales team have a lot of confidence. We talked about the record pipeline, the record deals out there. We talked about the new momentum the channel is adding to us. So we feel very good about our fiscal \u201824 business. Yes. If I may start, it is all coming out of 100% only. Okay. That's the most important point when the overall growth is pretty strong. Okay. And for the new product, even if it grows 70%, 80% percent a year, it has to work very hard to even take away 1% or 2% from the total new ACV. That's pretty significant. So the growth of these new products is much faster than the growth of the overall new ACV, but they are fairly small and they're growing into good business. We called out data protection as it became a significant part of the business. And I think here too, you're seeing our combination of workload protection and ZDX both are growing at a much faster rate. So I think we are actually happy with the growth rate, but the point I was trying to make is they are trying to steal away the market share on the rest of the overall portfolio, which has a much bigger base. That's why the math looks small, but it is pretty impressive. Let me start to give you a big picture and Remo, you can add your color to it. So our guidance is starting with first of all, a record pipeline and the momentum we have in the business. And we have plenty of product to sell. We have a growing market opportunity and many business drivers. We have a lot of new customers who are really buying zero trust for better security. Lots of market that's not covered. We are still in about 30% of global 2000 market. And we're seeing public sector coming strong, federal market coming strong. And that's really, further pushed by some of the mandates that are happening out there. And you saw in some of the deals that are announced, customers are increasingly buying more of these kind of platform leading to bigger deals. CI ZPA, our flagship products are still doing strong. We have factored into good growth for data protection, which complements. It actually needs to go on every Zscaler,customer. Emerging products are contributing nicely, and they are contributing. So when you look at all this, that's what we took into factor to give you our guidance. Remo? So multimodal DLP is still in development. it's not shipping, but there's a bunch of engagement with customers and interest is high because there's nothing like this out there in the market. You don't [indiscernible] pioneer new things that no one has done out there. Risk360, on the other hand, is actually a shipping. We have taken a bunch of orders. This product has more interest up front than any of the other products I can think of because our engagement with CISOs are strong. When a CISO looks at SC60 and say, wow, I have actually a single point to really tell me the holistic view of my business and actually where my risk factors are and what tangible prioritize actions I could take through my wrist. So there is a significant velocity going on, very, very good feedback and the product is growing very rapidly in terms of functionality as well. Hey, Patrick. Are you on? Patrick? Hey, Valerie, can we take our last question? Let me try the next call. As you know, traditionally channel has played a limited role for us. We have been working on it. We are seeing more and more progress being made. Just to clarify, I mean, we do take all these through channel with some exceptions, but customers insist on us. So that's one part. We are seeing yesar after year or in the past several quarters channel providing more leverage to us. That means doing more work for us. We recently hired our channel chief Karl Soderlund. He comes from extensive experience and strong relations in the channel, and he's done a lot of work in three areas of channels, system integrators, [bars] (ph), and service providers. In that system integration space, we have actually most of the large SI. They have selected and deployed C Scalar for wound transformation and zero source architecture. So they are not embedding our solution into the SI advisory service switches, very good because then it becomes a lot better. We also, so we're counting on more leverage on broad channel, even the bar channel itself. They're going through some focused training program, enabling program, which will help them do more transformation with us. In fact, we had nearly 200 channel partners come to our sales kickoff and join hands and conduct session with our sales teams. We think that's bringing our team is a lot more closer to work together with common account planning and the like. So we please do progress, and we think we're moving in the right direction. Well, thank you all for your interest in Zscaler. I'm looking forward to seeing you at some of our investor conferences. Thank you, again."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Bill Choi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance.\nBill Choi: Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to the Zscaler third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Jay Chaudhry, Chairman and CEO, and Remo Canessa, CFO. Please note that we have posted our earnings release and a supplemental financial schedule to our Investor Relations website.

I would like to inform you that we'll be attending the following upcoming events in June. Bank of America Global Tech Conference in San Francisco on June 7, Cantor's Security and Infrastructure Conference on June 9, and we will also host an investor briefing focused on our latest innovations at our Zenith Live Conference on June 15. Now, I will turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. We delivered strong third quarter results with all financial metrics above the high-end of the guidance we provided last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew by 46%, billings grew by 40%, and current billings grew by 44%. Our new business grew significantly across various industry verticals and we had approximately half of our revenue come from outside the U.S. We have a strong and loyal base of customers with gross retention rates in the high 90s. We have a disciplined approach to growth, and once again on operating income more than doubled on a year-over-year basis, with operating margins now exceeding 15%. While we continue to operate under tighter economic conditions, I believe the comprehensive functionality of our Zero Trust Exchange platform, our strong execution and our customer first approach, will enable us to navigate this macro backdrop and deliver on our guidance. Our consultative sales process enables our account teams to adapt to the changing business environment and stay close to our customers, especially at the C-Level. We are partnering earlier with CXOs to jointly create compelling CFO ready business cases, that have clear ROI and payback periods. As our Q3 results demonstrate, this high-touch engagement is helping get deals across the finish line. Our go-to-market engine enables us to close many large multi-year, multi-product deals. We are providing increased guidance for the full year, which we believe balances our business optimism and macro-economic uncertainties. A few quarters ago, we noted that customers were increasingly scrutinizing their projects and budgets, due to macro conditions. We are seeing this elevated level of scrutiny continue in Q3. Nevertheless, we see high-priority initiatives still moving forward. In my conversation with hundreds of IT executives, cybersecurity remains their number-one IT priority. Traditional network security-based on firewalls and VPNs cannot handle the complexity of safeguarding enterprises, in what has become a work from anywhere world. Given the explosion in ransomware and high-profile data breaches, IT leaders are looking to phase-out castle and moat security, to adopt Zero Trust architecture. Moreover, C-level leaders from around the globe are telling me that the technical debt of the legacy network and security point products impedes progress and slows down business operations. Our business value message is resonating with customers. Our Zero Trust Exchange offers better security and user experience, while substantially reducing cost and IT complexity, compared to legacy networking and security. By consolidating point products and embracing Zero Trust with Zscaler, our customers are modernizing their security and increasing productivity, which gives them the competitive edge they need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving business environment. We also partner with many tech leaders to deliver easy, jointly integrated solutions for customers, which increases our business value and creates go-to-market leverage for us. Our current marketing campaign called Beyond the Perimeter, is a great example of the successful field collaboration with our tech partner CrowdStrike, that is increasing our pipeline. In today's environment, our strategy is to double down on customer success. From pre-sales to deployment and customer success management, we have built our organization to deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level. We've made a number of investments in customer success services, technical account managers, partner services and certification of partners, which together will help our customers move faster towards realizing business value. We now have, 400 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, including over 35 customers, exceeding $5 million in ARR. In Q3, our new logo business grew approximately 20% year-over-year. Our proven experience at-scale, makes us a partner of choice for customers pursuing their Zero Trust security journey. We have a blueprint for delivering greater value, which drives strong upsell. Approximately 60% of our new business came from existing customers, and our net retention rate has again exceeded 125%. Happy customers buy more and our Net Promoter Score of over 70 is a testament to our strong relationship with our customers. As we have indicated before, we have a 6x upsell opportunity with our existing customers for protecting their users. Our engineering team is innovating at a rapid pace and has expanded our comprehensive platform from securing users, to securing workloads, as well as securing IoT and OT. As I mentioned before, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for users, which bundles ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together. Let me highlight one SaaS platform deal in the quarter. In an exciting upsell win, a fast-growing global bank in APJ upgraded to Zscaler for Users bundle, for 150,000 users, after deploying ZIA last year. With this upgrade this customer is significantly reducing time to open new branches by 50%, and eliminating the need for firewalls and MPLS network services. We are now a strategic partner to them as they continue to expand their footprint and transform into a cloud centric organization. This customer said, it is the first time they have seen a security vendor that understands the business needs and aligns its solution to address them. With this latest purchase this customer's ARR surpassed $10 million, this is also an example of the geographic diversity of our business outside the U.S. Today, we serve eight out-of-the-10 largest financial services and diversified insurance companies in the world, outside of China. Over the past few quarters, I observed that analysts and investors often equates ZPA with VPN replacement. This is simply not true. ZPA replaces the entire inbound DMC, and ZPA is often purchased for all employees. In fact over half off our ZPA customers have purchased ZPA services for all employees. Hence, delivering Zero Trust, whether they work in the office or at home. In Q3, ZPA was an area of strong growth and we saw large new logo deals that landed with ZPA. Let me highlight two such deals. A Fortune 100 logistics company made a four year multi-million dollar ACV purchase of ZPA and ZDX for 100,000 users ZPA provide to Zero Trust application access architecture for their employees, partners and suppliers as it consolidates multiple point products, including multiple VPNs, load balancers, VDIs and dedicated private network services. As a result, ZPA is expected to generate are 300% ROI for this customer. In another ZPA landed deal, a global 300 tech manufacturing company made a three year seven-figure ACV commitment for ZPA and ZDX for all 30,000 employees. Cyber security was their top priority as their IP in software development and manufacturing was being actively targeted by nation state actors and hackers. Another aspect of our market not well understood by investors, is that scale and performance are paramount considerations to customers in the real-world. When you are providing in-line inspection, you cannot have a trade-off between performance and security. Given our large opportunity and our success in the market, it is not surprising to see a number of vendors claiming that they have the same capabilities as we do, they built their products using something known as service function chaining, in order to reduce their time-to-market. The reality is, service chaining for in-line traffic inspection using microservices results in poor performance. They are effectively trying to scale lower performance. Our unique architecture, with our patented single-stand, multi-action technology enables us to deliver comprehensive security at high performance and scale. We secured over 40 million users from some of the largest global brands, and we surpassed $300 billion transactions daily. We are the largest inline, security cloud, and no one comes close to us, customers cannot afford to risk the mission-critical operations with immature offerings from unproven vendors. Let me highlight a deal which showcases the scale of our platform. In a large SSE win, a global 30 healthcare insurance company purchased ZPA and ZDX for 450,000 users and ZIA for 430,000 users. Their incumbent CASB provider could not scale to even 5% of the employees when TLS inspection was turned on. At this customer, we are consolidating dozens of point products from a handful of vendors, including DLP, CASB, web proxies, firewalls and VPNs. Our integration with Microsoft E5 suite across ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, was also an important decision factor for them. In addition, the customer will use Zscaler to rapidly integrate new acquisitions in the weeks, rather than months, that are required by legacy network security architecture. Next, let me highlight a deal that was led by data protection. In our largest win in the transportation vertical, a global 50 company purchased the ZIA transformation bundle plus ZDX and advanced data protection suite for 165,000 users. Zscaler was chosen over CASB vendor, because of our best-in class capabilities in DLP, CASB, browser isolation, SSPM and SaaS supply chain security. And of course our proven cloud scale and resilience was a big factor. This deal started with data protection and quickly expanded to include web proxy, firewall and sandbox, and to implement direct to cloud architecture at across their 6,500 locations. We see more customers buying our data protection along with ZIA and replacing their existing CASB point products. As these deals show customers are embracing our expanded platform, including our two emerging product pillars ZDX for digital user experience and Zscaler for workloads. These emerging products are on track to meet our full year target of high-teens percentage of new business. This quarter we had an upsell deal with a global 200 bank headquartered in APJ, that purchased Zscaler for workloads for 70,000 workloads, in a multi-cloud environment. As an existing ZIA customer, it was easy and seamless for them to rollout workload protection which increased their annual spend with us by 35%. We are also starting to close larger deals with our federal government customers, as the Zero Trust deployments move beyond the initial land deals. A cabinet level agency purchased ZIA and ZPA for 110,000 users to cover all of its sub-agencies. After a thorough evaluation their standardizing on Zscaler to consolidate multiple point products across the agency and to comply with the president's executive order, which mandates federal agencies to adapt Zero Trust principles. Our highly scalable and reliable platform and on highest FedRAMP authorization for both ZIA and ZPA have been key differentiators in this win, having landed 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies, we have plenty of opportunity to expand further with these very large organizations. To take our customer-centric innovation to the next level, we welcome Syam Nair, as our new CTO who will lead our R&D teams. Syam has extensive experience in leading and scaling engineering and product development teams that accelerated innovation cycles at Salesforce and Microsoft. He was the driving force in scaling the AI-powered customer engagement platform at Salesforce, which is critical to the next phase of our AI journey. Let me highlight a few examples of how we are leveraging AI/ML to deliver better cyber protection today. Our first acquisition in 2018 was an AI/ML company. We leveraged their technology together with Zscaler data , to deliver far better detection for zero day attacks. This resulted in reducing the number of files being sent to our sandboxing engine by 80%, reducing time to detection and improving user experience. ZDX, our digital experience service was launched three years ago, it was built from the ground-up to leverage AI/ML, to not just show where performance is degraded, but what caused the issue. The data protection advancements we launched in October 2022, leveraged AI/ML to classify unstructured documents for policy enforcement. And after the launch of ChatGPT, Zscaler delivered policy-based access controls to ensure that customers can use AI applications safely. If the employees submit sensitive data to ChatGPT like applications, our DLP technology detects it and blocks it. While plenty of AI apps like ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard and Bedrock use public data, AI-powered cyber security for enterprises requires their own private data. Based on a proxy architecture, Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange is like a private switchboard for all communication for users, workloads and devices, that captures all communication logs, a whopping 300 billion logs per day. These are not DNS logs that have little information beyond the domain, these are not firewall logs that cannot often see SSL traffic. These are complete logs that have structured and unstructured data, including the full URL providing trillions of signals per day. Zscaler has AI experts and data scientists, and the most valuable anonymized private data to customize and effectively train LLM models for the security domain. Imagine a world where our customers will know that they about to be breached, before they are breached, so they can proactively prevent the attack. Using AI, I believe, Zscaler has the opportunity to predict most of today's ransomware and other sophisticated attacks on our customers. We plan to launch a number of innovations, including many from AI/ML at Zenith Live, our Annual Cloud Summit in mid-June, in Las Vegas. I invite you to join us. In closing, we believe that we are still in the early stages of a significant market opportunity to disrupt 30 years of traditional network security, and capture a large share of our $72 billion addressable market. Our Zero Trust Exchange is built on a unique architecture that securely connect users, devices and applications, using business policies regardless of their location. We believe our 10 plus year track-record of running a massive inline cloud, that has to be highly reliable and available, makes Zscaler the go to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity and better cyber protection. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by driving customer-centric innovation, new business growth and increased profitability. Now, I'd like to turn-over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Revenue in Q3 was $419 million, up 46% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 20% of total revenue, growing 66% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue, EMEA was 31%, and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q3 grew 40% year-over-year to $482 million. Until we get more certainty around the macroenvironment, we believe looking at total billings on a sequential basis, can be a relevant measure of our billings performance in the near-term. On a sequential basis, billings declined 2% quarter-over-quarter, which is better than our normal seasonality. Our calculated current billings grew 44% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 36% from a year-ago to $3.023 billion, the current RPO is approximately 50% of the total RPO. Our dollar-based net retention rate was once again above 125%, while good for our business, our increased success selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. This is not a metric we try to optimize quarter-to-quarter, which could lead to variability on a quarterly basis. At the end of Q3, we had 400 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, up 39% from a year-ago. The continued strength of this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customer's digital transformation initiatives. We also ended the quarter with 2,432 customers with greater than $100,000 in ARR. Turning to the rest of our Q3 financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.2% compares to 80.4% in the prior quarter, and 80.6% in the year-ago quarter. Higher public-cloud usage for emerging products drove the year-over-year change in gross margins. Our total operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $272 million, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. Operating margin of 15.3% increased approximately 600 basis-points year-over-year. Following our optimization efforts in Q2, we're seeing higher efficiency in supporting roles across the departments. Our free cash flow margin was 18%. We continue to expect our datacenter CapEx to be around the high-single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.97 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macroenvironment and our framework for guidance. From our perspective, the global macroenvironment remains uncertain and customers continue to scrutinize large deals. We're seeing deals getting larger as customers are trying to consolidate more, and accelerate their security transformation around our Zero Trust Exchange. Customers are expanding their commitments with us, from a targeted use-case to a much broader platform centric approach. While good for our business, larger deals take longer to close as customers introduce more checks and reviews. In addition, in select instances we enabled new strategic customers to ramp into larger subscription commitments. Typically, these ramp deals reduce our first year billings, but will grow into a higher annual run-rate level in the second year. We are entering Q4 with a record pipeline and our customer engagements remains strong. However, predicting close rates in any 90 day period has become more challenging in this environment. Our guidance assumes that new business will take longer to close over the remainder of the fiscal year in view of the macro. As a result, we are assuming a slightly lower close rate in Q4 compared to Q3. We will continue to balance growth and profitability. In our outlook for Q4, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of more than 400 basis-points year-over-year. With that in mind, let me provide our guidance for Q4 and fiscal '23. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $429 million to $431 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 35% to 36%. Gross margins of approximately 80%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products including ZDX and Zscaler for workloads, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. In addition, we will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, as we scale with the growing demand. Operating profit in the range of $69 million to $70 million, net other income of $13 million, income taxes of $6 million. Earnings per share of approximately $0.49, assuming $157 million fully diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard, which requires the use of the if converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes , you will need to add-back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.591 billion to $1.593 billion, or year-over-year growth of approximately 46%. Calculated billings in the range of $1.974 billion to $1.978 billion, or year-over-year growth of 33% to 34%. Operating profit in the range of $224 million to $225 million. Our guidance reflects approximately 400 basis-points of operating margin improvement compared to last year. Income taxes of $21 million, earnings per share in the range of $1.63 to $1.64 assuming approximately $156 million fully diluted share. As noted earlier, to account for convertible notes and EPS, you will need to add-back $1.4 million in annual interest expense. We remain confident in our ability to capture our large market opportunity, while increasing profitability. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing. The recurring nature of our business model gives us good visibility on topline revenue and allows us to adapt quickly to changes in market conditions to deliver on our operating profit and margin goals. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll continue to make disciplined investments to position us for long-term growth. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent, thank you so much guys for taking the question and congrats on a strong Q3, especially in light of all the craziness going on in this world. Jay, I wanted to ask you about the U.S. federal opportunity, really seems like you've got a number of good things happening there, you're now in 12 to 15 cabinet level agencies. Can you double-click on the opportunity and pipeline ahead? And maybe talk just more about your strategy in public sector more generally, not just Fed but SLED and maybe international government as well, thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Brad. As we have been saying for the last several years, we made early investments in federal certification in FedRAMP, got some of the highest-level of certifications. In fact, they use the same certification, you get what's known as StateRAMP certification, that states require. So we have very strong presence in a number of states, at state-wide level, we've done well there. On the federal front, as we said we got early lands and got 12 to 15 agencies, but now they are beginning to do full rollout, and that's what we are beginning to see. It's being also helped by White House guidelines, Zero Trust implementation, and of course certifications are helping. We created a public sector vertical some time ago that covers U.S. Federal, as well as state part of it. So very happy to see the performance of both. We have a strong pipeline for federal sector -- sorry, for public sector for Q4 and we have -- we feel good about it. It was natural for us to expand beyond U.S. And what we've done is, looked at the West friendly nations, NATO friendly nations, who depend upon FedRAMP certifications for protecting their federal governments. And we have a pretty good degree of engagement with those countries, and we expect to share more success with you in next year and beyond.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent Jay. Thank you so much for the color.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC. Your question please.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats on the strong results. Jay, for you, you spent some time talking about generative AI, and the ability to monetize it with large datasets. I'm just curious how do you think about a couple of years from now? Are we going to be able to see that generative AI was actually a tailwind to growth and perhaps, could there be additional pricing perhaps consumption element that could support LLM's extended usage in the future?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, Matt, all of the above. First of all, AI is being kind of used in some of the current products to do better threat detection, better data protection and the like, that's number-one. Number two, as AI/ML gets picked up, there'll be bigger cyber risks. It's a race with the bad guy, they'll be able to do some of the more sophisticated attacks, a lot more easily than they can do today. That means companies like Zscaler will need to step-up to provide protection against such threats. And these are protection with clients, so to do good stuff with AI/ML, you need three things. Good data scientists, you need large language models and you need high-quality, large volumes of data. While many companies can hire data scientists and large language models are becoming open-source and will probably be available, more easily the data will become the new IP, the new barrier-to-entry. Zscaler with 300 billion logs per day and trillions of signals, we have probably the most precious private data. And that we anonymize and feed it to our large language model, to give us an advantage that I believe other competitors would not have. Now these things, while being enhanced for functionality, but I expect us to have new SKUs, new products that will give us plenty of upsell opportunity. So I expect AI/ML to expand our TAM.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great, thank you and congrats on another amazing quarter. I wanted to ask about I guess I mean number of questions here. I guess I'll go with the one question on the ramp deals. It's something you started talking about at the start of the year and it seems if I'm understanding this correctly that, right now what we're seeing is, is the headwind piece of those ramp deals, and so you're not getting any benefit really from those. And, and I guess when we'll start the anniversary after year one, that's when you start to see a tailwind from the ramp deals, when those customers move to more of a full price for their subscription, if you could just walk us through sort of the timing of when you're seeing -- when you're seeing that shift from headwind to tailwind from these ramp deals, thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes I mean, it's a great question Andy, I'll take it. You may take a look at the ramp deals in Q3 of last year and Q3 of this year, the percentage amounts are the same. So there's really no headwind or tailwind related to the ramp deals. Ramp deals started coming in a few years ago, and now it's basically pretty much the same on a year-over-year basis. I do expect ramp deals to go-forward, you know as we go-forward. If you take a look at basically the duration, the billings duration, our growth rate was 44% short-term, that basically was related to duration. The duration that we had in Q3 of last year, was at the high end of our 10 to 14 month range and this year, the duration, basically was slightly above the midpoint. So ramps did not create basically the positive impact to our short-term billings, it was really duration.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it thanks, Remo. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein from Truist Securities. Your question please.\nJoel Fishbein: Hi, thanks for taking the question and again, congrats on the margin outperformance here and expense discipline. So, I guess a question for Remo and I know you addressed it a little bit on the call, but I'd love to take a little bit step further about the methodology considering -- and in making sure that you're not sacrificing growth as you continue expand margins at this pretty impressive level, it's got to be a balancing act, and. I know you have some levers there that you're pulling but it looks like it's got to be pretty difficult. So I'd love to just understand that to peel the onion back on that, so.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, from our perspective, when you take a look at-the-market size that we talked about at our Analyst Day, a few years ago. It's a $72 billion market for our addressable market, it's much bigger than that you take a look at where is sales -- we're in the $1.5 billion or so, basically revenue. So the penetration into this market, our ability to upsell also 6x that still remains. We will balance profitability and top-line growth, our focus is still top-line growth, but if you take a look at, as you called out the margin expansion, 600 basis-points margin expansion in Q3, 400 basis-points, margin expansion for the full year, that's outstanding. But that's the model that we talked about. When your topline slows down, you're going to get that natural leverage. I want to make sure that our investors recognize, we feel that we're in a great position to move forward, we're going to continue to invest. And we're going to you know balance basically topline growth and operating profitability. Having said that, to give you more clarity related to fiscal '24, the current street consensus is about 15.5% operating profitability. I think a good place for the street to be in fiscal 2024, just to give you kind of a framework is that 15.5% to 16% range. I do believe that gives us plenty of room to invest and really to continue to capture this market.\nJoel Fishbein: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your question please.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, hi guys, thanks for taking my question here. Jay, maybe this question is for you. First of all, the numbers speak for themselves. I wondered if you could just address the competitive backdrop a little bit, certainly, it doesn't appear in the numbers again, but I know that there were some noise out there with competitive quadrant stuff, wanted to see if you just had any views on that and more importantly whether you've seen that make its way into customer conversations at all?\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you Saket. So regarding the magic quadrant. I believe that customers are the real judge. And I'll give you three points why I believe they view Zscaler as the real leader. Number one, as you said they are rewarding us by spending on Zscaler, right? In fact in Gartner's peer insight rating, which is a customer survey done by Gartner, Zscaler is the only MQ leader who is in number one in eight Gartner's category. So they've eight categories, we are number one in eight of them, that's wonderful. And also, we have expanded our vision far beyond just SSE for users, we do SSE for workloads, IoT, OT, B2B and all the like. There have been a number of conversations that I've had with customers, as you know, I talked to hundreds and hundreds of customers. I can tell you more than a dozen at least have asked me, hey, what is this MQ? How could this show up? I said, I don't know, you are the judge. So, is it impacting our performance? No. Is it impacting our engagement? No. I think we are focused on building, delivering, keeping our customers happy. Our NPS goal sits north of 80. So very happy with what we're doing and we'll keep on executing.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful, thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from MoffettNathanson. Your question please.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Jay, you talked about the success and kind of the go-to-market function and customer success teams. Wondering if you could just highlight for us or remind us the timing of when you did your big hires? Where you are in the capacity of your sales force and what the hiring might look like going-forward to extend the durability of the growth that you're seeing currently.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Hit a broad go-to-market level. Our goal is to make sure we keep on hiring at the right pace, a broad go-to-market team, as well as some of the takeoff teams that help us push forward some of the newer products. We did moderate some of the hiring, as we saw the market come down quite a -- in the past couple of quarters. Remo do you want to lose -- give some more color to it.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, from a capacity perspective, we're in good shape. You know when we did the -- we reduced our workforce at the end of Q2, one of the things we've talked about is, we're still going to prioritize basically quota-carrying heads and R&D that's still the case. We are in a hiring mode and we will continue to hire. One of the things I mentioned Sterling is that, you know, not lost on us, is that this is a huge market opportunity. We're going to invest and we'll continue to invest in hiring and R&D and throughout the company, for that matter. But really what we did in Q2 was to better position ourselves to make the proper hires going-forward, and that's what we're doing.\nSterling Auty: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Guggenheim Securities. Your question please.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. So this quarter was people have said and you said pre-announced it, it was really a strong quarter, and looking at the numbers, it looks like real clean results, it's nice to see that, but it's also odd to see that in this environment. And you guys have talked about that, you know the things are, the difficult environment has continued. So I'm just trying to figure out like what changed for you guys this quarter, relative to the past two quarters. Not that they were -- they were -- you struggled with more in the last two quarters, at least from our measures of new ACV signings, and this quarter was really strong. I mean, was it I mean, you did talk about larger deals were there any like sort of anomalous large deals out there or is it just really just you guys now buckled up and are executing better. What would happened, what changed?\nJay Chaudhry: So this quarter was strong across all areas. Americas and APJ were particularly strong on a year-over-year basis. And last quarter we said some of the large new logo deals Americas we're taking longer to close. We also said, those deals were not lost, but just delayed. And we did close a good number of those deals. From vertical perspective it was very well-diversified. Strong verticals for federal, for financial services, healthcare and transportation. Our large and major segment did well, we highlighted a number of $100,000 plus user deals. So the fundamentals of our business are very strong, customers are not going to delay cyber as a priority, it is a priority. Cost saving is a big priority as well and we do well in both areas. Cyber, as well our cost-savings. I can tell you when it comes to cyber companies we're probably the only company that delivers significant ROI, because we are actually eliminated, a bunch of point products. So it is fitting well, it's a tougher market, there's more scrutiny, but our foundation is strong, our pipeline is strong. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes I'll like go with -- Jay mentioned. Pipeline, maturity of pipeline, execution, strong across-the-board, Americas was strong, APJ was strong, you know, federal was strong. Again, I think the key thing it was really good execution, from our sales organization on a worldwide basis. Related to large deals, mega-deal, we talk about mega deals when we first went public if deals were greater than $10 million. We've upped that now, mega deals are deals that are greater than $20 million. There were no deals of greater than $20 million. We did have one deal of $10 million in the quarter.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd from UBS. Your question please.\nRoger Boyd: Great, thanks for taking the question And again, congrats on the very strong results. As you think about fiscal 4Q in fiscal '24, it sounds like you're broadly being pretty conservative around close rates, but Jay, you talked a little bit about some of the efforts you've made internally to get in front of budget scrutiny with some of these CFO ready business cases. I guess I'm wondering, relative to a few quarters ago, are you feeling incrementally better about controlling your own destiny, your ability to influence sales cycles and just curious how material these internal efforts have been in practice? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, so this tougher market has made it us a lot more sophisticated than we were before. For example, for new logos, what have we done? We are now doing early engagement, our sales team is getting good at engaging at C-level early on in the cycle. Number two, we had to refine our business value case, CFO ready case studies, a lot more. No longer annual numbers are good enough, now they want to go into quarterly level to see when the ROI can be done. Our engagement of cloud market-based have gotten much better, because we are leveraging the annual commit that's only spent annual spend that's already committed to the hyper scalers, now we had to do ramp deals more frequently, which is kind of to meet their timing of budgets and the like. For upsell, we had done a number of things in the past few quarters, we are ensuring that customers are realizing the value more-and-more. Our customer success teams, our TAMs are doing a great job. And then the product specialists team we put in-place for emerging products, that's working well. It's working very closely with our field sales team. So having a great, highly-differentiated platform which we built on Zero Trust as a key platform, we are not a firewall company that's trying to pivot to Zero Trust, we're not a CASB company that's building. This is our core business and nonstop from day-one and our sales execution is good and we'll keep on improving it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity. Your question please.\nMike Walkley: All right, thanks. Remo you talked a little bit about future lumpiness in dollar-based net retention. I guess given some large deals that you'll grandfather in. But can you share with us kind of that mix, you expect to maybe fiscal 2024 of new logo sales versus upsell, is it still around 60%, 40%, ratio given that 6x times upsell opportunity?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, I mean net retention rate is something we don't write to or look at. Our mix this year, we're expecting 40% to 60%, new versus upsell. We look at, really if we look at new and upsell, as those are the drivers in total, and we've talked about before is, we believe the best measure for Zscaler is really billings at 125% is outstanding.\nMike Walkley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Patrick on for Josh. First-off, just wanted to congratulate you on the great results in what's been a tough environment. Clearly the mix checks in the quarter, were not exactly correct. So, I was wondering, what do you think is sort of driving that disconnect between the strong numbers put up in the quarter and then the general feedback from the channel. We've heard recently.\nJay Chaudhry: So I think this is not new. We have said many-many times that we are not a typical security companies selling boxes through people VARs. We are a transformation play, it's a high-tech sale and working closely with customers and sometimes large-sized, that's how we do business. These channel checks will always be misguided, I mean, that's how I personally look at it. When you are driving transformational C-level and whatnot, it is different. So, I would say, let's be more refined and channel checks. Look our business is strong, our customer engagements are very strong, our differentiation is very strong. Yes, our competitors are trying to create a fund, they are trying to mislead the market, it's our job to make sure we educate them, we communicate them, but the best results we do is when customers deploy our technology than they say, Jay, we're able to turn-on 20,000 users in 7 days and the results are amazing. And then there is a -- if you really contrast I've only seen a couple of cases, that say yes we got a competitive solution, this thing is still struggling out there, we are trying to extend our network from our office to the cloud, it's old-school architecture. So, I do believe that in spite of all that noise and [indiscernible] that comes from out there, our engagement, our differentiation, the way we are executing in the market, the way we are innovating and now in the new area of AI/ML, where we have unique advantage of better data, better private logs, with structured and unstructured data. We will do better than any of the vendors out there Maybe a comment on unstructured data, every vendor has logs. Logs are simply structured data, where are you coming from? Where are you going. The most intelligent information that generative AI can use comes from the URL, which could be hundreds of bytes long. And that's where you figure out what all is going on. Most of the firewalls, don't have any you URL they generally slip the domain level stuff. As we do some of this stuff. I believe will further increase our lead and any that will give us actual TAM and further growth that we are striving for.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it, thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg from Stifel. Your question please.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. And thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe for Jay you talked in the script about increasing traction with Zscaler for Users. And I'd love to get a sense. When a new customer comes in -- any way to think about the mix of new customers that are taking Zscaler for Users from the start and how should I think about the overall mix of Zscaler for users within the installed-base, thanks so much.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, so thank you. Zscaler for Users, this bundle was created about a little over a year ago. And we have seen very, very good growth of this combined bundle. And we and we have some customers who will go with ZIA, ZPA, we actually have some customer it's interesting, but large customers who actually started the ZPA and ZDX at the same time. But overall the bigger bundle to eliminate a bunch of point products, is the trend we are seeing and as I had said even two or three years ago, it's a matter of time. When every customer buys ZIA, ZPS ZDX for every employee and that trend is happening more-and-more. And as we said before, if we do so on current customers their spend with us could go to 5x or 6x kind of stuff, and I think we are tracking well and we are tracking well for two reasons, one customer who is seeing value, they're realizing the value format. Number two, we're actually able to remove a bunch of point products and show ROI and that actually gives them more incentive to buy more from us, Remo.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. And customers that have bought ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, it's more than 25% of our total customers. So it's definitely getting traction.\nAdam Borg: Awesome, thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari from Baird. Your question please.\nShrenik Kothari: Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats on the strong execution despite the macro. So, for Jay and Reno, feel free to chime in, you mentioned on a sequential basis. You saw a better than normal seasonality and then of course you guys touched upon factors starting to close larger deals with federal, you of course are seeing benefit from kind of strategic customers ramping into larger commitments. And then of course the execution, the high-touch engagement is helping to get to finish line, international. Can you help us unpack some of these drivers in terms of kind of maybe relative impact on this better than normal seasonality, and then I have a quick follow-up.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes I think. Everything you mentioned is 100% correct. You know, I'm a traditional I'll go back to what I feel, I think it's better execution on our sales organization. Yes, I mean, all the factors are aligned, but we are still in a tougher environment with a lot more scrutiny and it's doing better execution. But if you've got good product offering that highly-differentiated and there is a need for it, because customers do want to save money and better cybersecurity that's really what's positioned us well.\nRemo Canessa: I mean, just you follow-on, customers recognize the ROI, it is significant, the ability to simplify your network is significant also. Architecture, related to inline cloud, multi-tenant architecture, not only for users but workloads and IoT, OT and B2B. You know that that's the vision, basically Zscaler. The pioneer with all this Zscaler, so the leader. If you take a look at our penetration into the Fortune 500 which is 40% in Global 2000, 30%. I mean CIOs, CISOs they talk to each other. We do I mean customer advisory board meetings, Jay, we do one like on average, like one a week, I believe I mean companies typically do this once a year, we do it once a week. And so what is the strength, it's all things I mentioned and your comments, it's pretty much across-the-board, all those things. One point I'll make, which hasn't come across so far in this discussion. What we do being the switchboard is probably the most critical, mission-critical business service, and it must work and so customers basically want to go with a proven vendor who knows how to operate and run and manage such a massive cloud. It is becoming a differentiator when a new vendor it comes and say, I got the cloud too, and then the customers saying, what's your track-record, what's your experience that's helping us. One of other area that's helping us with some of the new private companies and all, customers aren't going to vary off trying to go with someone who may be losing a lot of cash, and who may not be around tomorrow, and that's helping us as well, because customers are looking at vendors who will be around and will be the leaders in this area.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Levine from Evercore. Your question please.\nPeter Levine: Great, thanks guys for squeezing me in. We've seen one of your competitors come out this quarter with a very specific campaign kind of targeting you guys are somewhat kind of right reverse engineering your tax? So, Jay, is there any validity behind kind of what they're building, you explain to us the complexity, the lift and shift customers overnight. And if you you've been seeing any attrition on that front and then just one quick one, Remo yes, thanks for the color on the fiscal 2024 margins, but to the extent you can any color or high-level discussions you can share with us now on how you're thinking about the growth outlook and to what extent macro playing into that thought process, thank you guys.\nJay Chaudhry: So every vendor or has a core competence and they do very well in that competency. A firewall company will be a grade firewall company, the company will be great CASB company and someone who does CDN and DNS should be a good CDN DNS company. You can try to pivot for that competency, you build and create over years and years. It's very hard. If I came and told you that in one year, I'm going to build the best firewall. While it would be hard for me to say that because I can say it may make statements like that, but when companies trying to pivot, it takes a while, and especially pivoting do something that's inline, multi-tenancy, figuring out all the cyber threats without slowing things down it's hard, it's an architectural change. We believe the intellectual property, the IP needed to do so is very hard, that's number one, number two, the amount of passive one has to handle to really deliver the service, your gross margins are likely to be selling some of the 50s and 60s and not like 80% where we sit at. It's because we purpose-built stuff. So it is not unnatural for us to see, the competition trying to comments, maybe I can get into this space I have many times describe Zscaler, being in-line business almost like an ERP application. Thousands of SaaS applications on view at that point products that can be built, how many ERP vendors, do you see out there doing SaaS, very few it's hard sitting in-line as far we think that gives us a big, big, barrier-to-entry for others to compete and we are not offsetting. We are expanding our platform at a larger pace. So do I kind of tried to focus too much on some of the competitive campaigns that cannot find to spread lies zone. I don't be focus on innovation, we focus on our customers and we are doing well and top-line growth, we'll talk about that on the next call for year end.\nPeter Levine: Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question our final question for today comes from the line of Joseph Gallo from Jefferies. Your question please.\nJoseph Gallo: Hi, guys, really appreciate the question and great job on the billings performance in a tough environment. I appreciate the commentary regarding the year-over-year mix of ramp deals in F3Q, is F4Q the same expected year-over-year mix based on the pipe, you guys are seeing today? And then just any other color or commentary on how to think about F4Q billings, which appears seasonally conservative. I know you mentioned lower close rates, but is there anything else timing renewals or anything else we should think about, thanks guys.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, ramps. I would consider the same, quarter-over quarter, just remember it is a tough compare last year, our billings growth was approximately, basically I think it was close to 60% billings growth.\nJay Chaudhry: In Q4, also, we had a strong Q3, so basically a tough compare.\nJoseph Gallo: Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: All right.\nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to hand the program back to CEO, Jay Chaudhry for any further remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you for your interest in Zscaler, I hope to see you at Zenith Live in Vegas in a couple of weeks. I would also like to thank our shareholders, our customers and our partners. Talk to you next quarter, great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Revenue in Q3 was $419 million, up 46% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 20% of total revenue, growing 66% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue, EMEA was 31%, and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q3 grew 40% year-over-year to $482 million. Until we get more certainty around the macroenvironment, we believe looking at total billings on a sequential basis, can be a relevant measure of our billings performance in the near-term. On a sequential basis, billings declined 2% quarter-over-quarter, which is better than our normal seasonality. Our calculated current billings grew 44% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 36% from a year-ago to $3.023 billion, the current RPO is approximately 50% of the total RPO. Our dollar-based net retention rate was once again above 125%, while good for our business, our increased success selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. This is not a metric we try to optimize quarter-to-quarter, which could lead to variability on a quarterly basis. At the end of Q3, we had 400 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, up 39% from a year-ago. The continued strength of this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customer's digital transformation initiatives. We also ended the quarter with 2,432 customers with greater than $100,000 in ARR. Turning to the rest of our Q3 financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.2% compares to 80.4% in the prior quarter, and 80.6% in the year-ago quarter. Higher public-cloud usage for emerging products drove the year-over-year change in gross margins. Our total operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 33% year-over-year to $272 million, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. Operating margin of 15.3% increased approximately 600 basis-points year-over-year. Following our optimization efforts in Q2, we're seeing higher efficiency in supporting roles across the departments. Our free cash flow margin was 18%. We continue to expect our datacenter CapEx to be around the high-single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.97 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macroenvironment and our framework for guidance. From our perspective, the global macroenvironment remains uncertain and customers continue to scrutinize large deals. We're seeing deals getting larger as customers are trying to consolidate more, and accelerate their security transformation around our Zero Trust Exchange. Customers are expanding their commitments with us, from a targeted use-case to a much broader platform centric approach. While good for our business, larger deals take longer to close as customers introduce more checks and reviews. In addition, in select instances we enabled new strategic customers to ramp into larger subscription commitments. Typically, these ramp deals reduce our first year billings, but will grow into a higher annual run-rate level in the second year. We are entering Q4 with a record pipeline and our customer engagements remains strong. However, predicting close rates in any 90 day period has become more challenging in this environment. Our guidance assumes that new business will take longer to close over the remainder of the fiscal year in view of the macro. As a result, we are assuming a slightly lower close rate in Q4 compared to Q3. We will continue to balance growth and profitability. In our outlook for Q4, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of more than 400 basis-points year-over-year. With that in mind, let me provide our guidance for Q4 and fiscal '23. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $429 million to $431 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 35% to 36%. Gross margins of approximately 80%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products including ZDX and Zscaler for workloads, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. In addition, we will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, as we scale with the growing demand. Operating profit in the range of $69 million to $70 million, net other income of $13 million, income taxes of $6 million. Earnings per share of approximately $0.49, assuming $157 million fully diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard, which requires the use of the if converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes , you will need to add-back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.591 billion to $1.593 billion, or year-over-year growth of approximately 46%. Calculated billings in the range of $1.974 billion to $1.978 billion, or year-over-year growth of 33% to 34%. Operating profit in the range of $224 million to $225 million. Our guidance reflects approximately 400 basis-points of operating margin improvement compared to last year. Income taxes of $21 million, earnings per share in the range of $1.63 to $1.64 assuming approximately $156 million fully diluted share. As noted earlier, to account for convertible notes and EPS, you will need to add-back $1.4 million in annual interest expense. We remain confident in our ability to capture our large market opportunity, while increasing profitability. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing. The recurring nature of our business model gives us good visibility on topline revenue and allows us to adapt quickly to changes in market conditions to deliver on our operating profit and margin goals. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll continue to make disciplined investments to position us for long-term growth. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes I mean, it's a great question Andy, I'll take it. You may take a look at the ramp deals in Q3 of last year and Q3 of this year, the percentage amounts are the same. So there's really no headwind or tailwind related to the ramp deals. Ramp deals started coming in a few years ago, and now it's basically pretty much the same on a year-over-year basis. I do expect ramp deals to go-forward, you know as we go-forward. If you take a look at basically the duration, the billings duration, our growth rate was 44% short-term, that basically was related to duration. The duration that we had in Q3 of last year, was at the high end of our 10 to 14 month range and this year, the duration, basically was slightly above the midpoint. So ramps did not create basically the positive impact to our short-term billings, it was really duration. Yes, from our perspective, when you take a look at-the-market size that we talked about at our Analyst Day, a few years ago. It's a $72 billion market for our addressable market, it's much bigger than that you take a look at where is sales -- we're in the $1.5 billion or so, basically revenue. So the penetration into this market, our ability to upsell also 6x that still remains. We will balance profitability and top-line growth, our focus is still top-line growth, but if you take a look at, as you called out the margin expansion, 600 basis-points margin expansion in Q3, 400 basis-points, margin expansion for the full year, that's outstanding. But that's the model that we talked about. When your topline slows down, you're going to get that natural leverage. I want to make sure that our investors recognize, we feel that we're in a great position to move forward, we're going to continue to invest. And we're going to you know balance basically topline growth and operating profitability. Having said that, to give you more clarity related to fiscal '24, the current street consensus is about 15.5% operating profitability. I think a good place for the street to be in fiscal 2024, just to give you kind of a framework is that 15.5% to 16% range. I do believe that gives us plenty of room to invest and really to continue to capture this market. Yes, from a capacity perspective, we're in good shape. You know when we did the -- we reduced our workforce at the end of Q2, one of the things we've talked about is, we're still going to prioritize basically quota-carrying heads and R&D that's still the case. We are in a hiring mode and we will continue to hire. One of the things I mentioned Sterling is that, you know, not lost on us, is that this is a huge market opportunity. We're going to invest and we'll continue to invest in hiring and R&D and throughout the company, for that matter. But really what we did in Q2 was to better position ourselves to make the proper hires going-forward, and that's what we're doing. Yes I'll like go with -- Jay mentioned. Pipeline, maturity of pipeline, execution, strong across-the-board, Americas was strong, APJ was strong, you know, federal was strong. Again, I think the key thing it was really good execution, from our sales organization on a worldwide basis. Related to large deals, mega-deal, we talk about mega deals when we first went public if deals were greater than $10 million. We've upped that now, mega deals are deals that are greater than $20 million. There were no deals of greater than $20 million. We did have one deal of $10 million in the quarter. Yes. And customers that have bought ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, it's more than 25% of our total customers. So it's definitely getting traction. I mean, just you follow-on, customers recognize the ROI, it is significant, the ability to simplify your network is significant also. Architecture, related to inline cloud, multi-tenant architecture, not only for users but workloads and IoT, OT and B2B. You know that that's the vision, basically Zscaler. The pioneer with all this Zscaler, so the leader. If you take a look at our penetration into the Fortune 500 which is 40% in Global 2000, 30%. I mean CIOs, CISOs they talk to each other. We do I mean customer advisory board meetings, Jay, we do one like on average, like one a week, I believe I mean companies typically do this once a year, we do it once a week. And so what is the strength, it's all things I mentioned and your comments, it's pretty much across-the-board, all those things. One point I'll make, which hasn't come across so far in this discussion. What we do being the switchboard is probably the most critical, mission-critical business service, and it must work and so customers basically want to go with a proven vendor who knows how to operate and run and manage such a massive cloud. It is becoming a differentiator when a new vendor it comes and say, I got the cloud too, and then the customers saying, what's your track-record, what's your experience that's helping us.

Yes, ramps. I would consider the same, quarter-over quarter, just remember it is a tough compare last year, our billings growth was approximately, basically I think it was close to 60% billings growth. All right."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. We delivered strong third quarter results with all financial metrics above the high-end of the guidance we provided last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew by 46%, billings grew by 40%, and current billings grew by 44%. Our new business grew significantly across various industry verticals and we had approximately half of our revenue come from outside the U.S. We have a strong and loyal base of customers with gross retention rates in the high 90s. We have a disciplined approach to growth, and once again on operating income more than doubled on a year-over-year basis, with operating margins now exceeding 15%. While we continue to operate under tighter economic conditions, I believe the comprehensive functionality of our Zero Trust Exchange platform, our strong execution and our customer first approach, will enable us to navigate this macro backdrop and deliver on our guidance. Our consultative sales process enables our account teams to adapt to the changing business environment and stay close to our customers, especially at the C-Level. We are partnering earlier with CXOs to jointly create compelling CFO ready business cases, that have clear ROI and payback periods. As our Q3 results demonstrate, this high-touch engagement is helping get deals across the finish line. Our go-to-market engine enables us to close many large multi-year, multi-product deals. We are providing increased guidance for the full year, which we believe balances our business optimism and macro-economic uncertainties. A few quarters ago, we noted that customers were increasingly scrutinizing their projects and budgets, due to macro conditions. We are seeing this elevated level of scrutiny continue in Q3. Nevertheless, we see high-priority initiatives still moving forward. In my conversation with hundreds of IT executives, cybersecurity remains their number-one IT priority. Traditional network security-based on firewalls and VPNs cannot handle the complexity of safeguarding enterprises, in what has become a work from anywhere world. Given the explosion in ransomware and high-profile data breaches, IT leaders are looking to phase-out castle and moat security, to adopt Zero Trust architecture. Moreover, C-level leaders from around the globe are telling me that the technical debt of the legacy network and security point products impedes progress and slows down business operations. Our business value message is resonating with customers. Our Zero Trust Exchange offers better security and user experience, while substantially reducing cost and IT complexity, compared to legacy networking and security. By consolidating point products and embracing Zero Trust with Zscaler, our customers are modernizing their security and increasing productivity, which gives them the competitive edge they need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving business environment. We also partner with many tech leaders to deliver easy, jointly integrated solutions for customers, which increases our business value and creates go-to-market leverage for us. Our current marketing campaign called Beyond the Perimeter, is a great example of the successful field collaboration with our tech partner CrowdStrike, that is increasing our pipeline. In today's environment, our strategy is to double down on customer success. From pre-sales to deployment and customer success management, we have built our organization to deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level. We've made a number of investments in customer success services, technical account managers, partner services and certification of partners, which together will help our customers move faster towards realizing business value. We now have, 400 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, including over 35 customers, exceeding $5 million in ARR. In Q3, our new logo business grew approximately 20% year-over-year. Our proven experience at-scale, makes us a partner of choice for customers pursuing their Zero Trust security journey. We have a blueprint for delivering greater value, which drives strong upsell. Approximately 60% of our new business came from existing customers, and our net retention rate has again exceeded 125%. Happy customers buy more and our Net Promoter Score of over 70 is a testament to our strong relationship with our customers. As we have indicated before, we have a 6x upsell opportunity with our existing customers for protecting their users. Our engineering team is innovating at a rapid pace and has expanded our comprehensive platform from securing users, to securing workloads, as well as securing IoT and OT. As I mentioned before, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for users, which bundles ZIA, ZPA and ZDX together. Let me highlight one SaaS platform deal in the quarter. In an exciting upsell win, a fast-growing global bank in APJ upgraded to Zscaler for Users bundle, for 150,000 users, after deploying ZIA last year. With this upgrade this customer is significantly reducing time to open new branches by 50%, and eliminating the need for firewalls and MPLS network services. We are now a strategic partner to them as they continue to expand their footprint and transform into a cloud centric organization. This customer said, it is the first time they have seen a security vendor that understands the business needs and aligns its solution to address them. With this latest purchase this customer's ARR surpassed $10 million, this is also an example of the geographic diversity of our business outside the U.S. Today, we serve eight out-of-the-10 largest financial services and diversified insurance companies in the world, outside of China. Over the past few quarters, I observed that analysts and investors often equates ZPA with VPN replacement. This is simply not true. ZPA replaces the entire inbound DMC, and ZPA is often purchased for all employees. In fact over half off our ZPA customers have purchased ZPA services for all employees. Hence, delivering Zero Trust, whether they work in the office or at home. In Q3, ZPA was an area of strong growth and we saw large new logo deals that landed with ZPA. Let me highlight two such deals. A Fortune 100 logistics company made a four year multi-million dollar ACV purchase of ZPA and ZDX for 100,000 users ZPA provide to Zero Trust application access architecture for their employees, partners and suppliers as it consolidates multiple point products, including multiple VPNs, load balancers, VDIs and dedicated private network services. As a result, ZPA is expected to generate are 300% ROI for this customer. In another ZPA landed deal, a global 300 tech manufacturing company made a three year seven-figure ACV commitment for ZPA and ZDX for all 30,000 employees. Cyber security was their top priority as their IP in software development and manufacturing was being actively targeted by nation state actors and hackers. Another aspect of our market not well understood by investors, is that scale and performance are paramount considerations to customers in the real-world. When you are providing in-line inspection, you cannot have a trade-off between performance and security. Given our large opportunity and our success in the market, it is not surprising to see a number of vendors claiming that they have the same capabilities as we do, they built their products using something known as service function chaining, in order to reduce their time-to-market. The reality is, service chaining for in-line traffic inspection using microservices results in poor performance. They are effectively trying to scale lower performance. Our unique architecture, with our patented single-stand, multi-action technology enables us to deliver comprehensive security at high performance and scale. We secured over 40 million users from some of the largest global brands, and we surpassed $300 billion transactions daily. We are the largest inline, security cloud, and no one comes close to us, customers cannot afford to risk the mission-critical operations with immature offerings from unproven vendors. Let me highlight a deal which showcases the scale of our platform. In a large SSE win, a global 30 healthcare insurance company purchased ZPA and ZDX for 450,000 users and ZIA for 430,000 users. Their incumbent CASB provider could not scale to even 5% of the employees when TLS inspection was turned on. At this customer, we are consolidating dozens of point products from a handful of vendors, including DLP, CASB, web proxies, firewalls and VPNs. Our integration with Microsoft E5 suite across ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, was also an important decision factor for them. In addition, the customer will use Zscaler to rapidly integrate new acquisitions in the weeks, rather than months, that are required by legacy network security architecture. Next, let me highlight a deal that was led by data protection. In our largest win in the transportation vertical, a global 50 company purchased the ZIA transformation bundle plus ZDX and advanced data protection suite for 165,000 users. Zscaler was chosen over CASB vendor, because of our best-in class capabilities in DLP, CASB, browser isolation, SSPM and SaaS supply chain security. And of course our proven cloud scale and resilience was a big factor. This deal started with data protection and quickly expanded to include web proxy, firewall and sandbox, and to implement direct to cloud architecture at across their 6,500 locations. We see more customers buying our data protection along with ZIA and replacing their existing CASB point products. As these deals show customers are embracing our expanded platform, including our two emerging product pillars ZDX for digital user experience and Zscaler for workloads. These emerging products are on track to meet our full year target of high-teens percentage of new business. This quarter we had an upsell deal with a global 200 bank headquartered in APJ, that purchased Zscaler for workloads for 70,000 workloads, in a multi-cloud environment. As an existing ZIA customer, it was easy and seamless for them to rollout workload protection which increased their annual spend with us by 35%. We are also starting to close larger deals with our federal government customers, as the Zero Trust deployments move beyond the initial land deals. A cabinet level agency purchased ZIA and ZPA for 110,000 users to cover all of its sub-agencies. After a thorough evaluation their standardizing on Zscaler to consolidate multiple point products across the agency and to comply with the president's executive order, which mandates federal agencies to adapt Zero Trust principles. Our highly scalable and reliable platform and on highest FedRAMP authorization for both ZIA and ZPA have been key differentiators in this win, having landed 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies, we have plenty of opportunity to expand further with these very large organizations. To take our customer-centric innovation to the next level, we welcome Syam Nair, as our new CTO who will lead our R&D teams. Syam has extensive experience in leading and scaling engineering and product development teams that accelerated innovation cycles at Salesforce and Microsoft. He was the driving force in scaling the AI-powered customer engagement platform at Salesforce, which is critical to the next phase of our AI journey. Let me highlight a few examples of how we are leveraging AI/ML to deliver better cyber protection today. Our first acquisition in 2018 was an AI/ML company. We leveraged their technology together with Zscaler data , to deliver far better detection for zero day attacks. This resulted in reducing the number of files being sent to our sandboxing engine by 80%, reducing time to detection and improving user experience. ZDX, our digital experience service was launched three years ago, it was built from the ground-up to leverage AI/ML, to not just show where performance is degraded, but what caused the issue. The data protection advancements we launched in October 2022, leveraged AI/ML to classify unstructured documents for policy enforcement. And after the launch of ChatGPT, Zscaler delivered policy-based access controls to ensure that customers can use AI applications safely. If the employees submit sensitive data to ChatGPT like applications, our DLP technology detects it and blocks it. While plenty of AI apps like ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard and Bedrock use public data, AI-powered cyber security for enterprises requires their own private data. Based on a proxy architecture, Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange is like a private switchboard for all communication for users, workloads and devices, that captures all communication logs, a whopping 300 billion logs per day. These are not DNS logs that have little information beyond the domain, these are not firewall logs that cannot often see SSL traffic. These are complete logs that have structured and unstructured data, including the full URL providing trillions of signals per day. Zscaler has AI experts and data scientists, and the most valuable anonymized private data to customize and effectively train LLM models for the security domain. Imagine a world where our customers will know that they about to be breached, before they are breached, so they can proactively prevent the attack. Using AI, I believe, Zscaler has the opportunity to predict most of today's ransomware and other sophisticated attacks on our customers. We plan to launch a number of innovations, including many from AI/ML at Zenith Live, our Annual Cloud Summit in mid-June, in Las Vegas. I invite you to join us. In closing, we believe that we are still in the early stages of a significant market opportunity to disrupt 30 years of traditional network security, and capture a large share of our $72 billion addressable market. Our Zero Trust Exchange is built on a unique architecture that securely connect users, devices and applications, using business policies regardless of their location. We believe our 10 plus year track-record of running a massive inline cloud, that has to be highly reliable and available, makes Zscaler the go to platform for vendor consolidation, cost savings, increased user productivity and better cyber protection. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by driving customer-centric innovation, new business growth and increased profitability. Now, I'd like to turn-over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you, Brad. As we have been saying for the last several years, we made early investments in federal certification in FedRAMP, got some of the highest-level of certifications. In fact, they use the same certification, you get what's known as StateRAMP certification, that states require. So we have very strong presence in a number of states, at state-wide level, we've done well there. On the federal front, as we said we got early lands and got 12 to 15 agencies, but now they are beginning to do full rollout, and that's what we are beginning to see. It's being also helped by White House guidelines, Zero Trust implementation, and of course certifications are helping. We created a public sector vertical some time ago that covers U.S. Federal, as well as state part of it. So very happy to see the performance of both. We have a strong pipeline for federal sector -- sorry, for public sector for Q4 and we have -- we feel good about it. It was natural for us to expand beyond U.S. And what we've done is, looked at the West friendly nations, NATO friendly nations, who depend upon FedRAMP certifications for protecting their federal governments. And we have a pretty good degree of engagement with those countries, and we expect to share more success with you in next year and beyond. Thank you. Yes, Matt, all of the above. First of all, AI is being kind of used in some of the current products to do better threat detection, better data protection and the like, that's number-one. Number two, as AI/ML gets picked up, there'll be bigger cyber risks. It's a race with the bad guy, they'll be able to do some of the more sophisticated attacks, a lot more easily than they can do today. That means companies like Zscaler will need to step-up to provide protection against such threats. And these are protection with clients, so to do good stuff with AI/ML, you need three things. Good data scientists, you need large language models and you need high-quality, large volumes of data. While many companies can hire data scientists and large language models are becoming open-source and will probably be available, more easily the data will become the new IP, the new barrier-to-entry. Zscaler with 300 billion logs per day and trillions of signals, we have probably the most precious private data. And that we anonymize and feed it to our large language model, to give us an advantage that I believe other competitors would not have. Now these things, while being enhanced for functionality, but I expect us to have new SKUs, new products that will give us plenty of upsell opportunity. So I expect AI/ML to expand our TAM. Thank you Saket. So regarding the magic quadrant. I believe that customers are the real judge. And I'll give you three points why I believe they view Zscaler as the real leader. Number one, as you said they are rewarding us by spending on Zscaler, right? In fact in Gartner's peer insight rating, which is a customer survey done by Gartner, Zscaler is the only MQ leader who is in number one in eight Gartner's category. So they've eight categories, we are number one in eight of them, that's wonderful. And also, we have expanded our vision far beyond just SSE for users, we do SSE for workloads, IoT, OT, B2B and all the like. There have been a number of conversations that I've had with customers, as you know, I talked to hundreds and hundreds of customers. I can tell you more than a dozen at least have asked me, hey, what is this MQ? How could this show up? I said, I don't know, you are the judge. So, is it impacting our performance? No. Is it impacting our engagement? No. I think we are focused on building, delivering, keeping our customers happy. Our NPS goal sits north of 80. So very happy with what we're doing and we'll keep on executing. Yes. Hit a broad go-to-market level. Our goal is to make sure we keep on hiring at the right pace, a broad go-to-market team, as well as some of the takeoff teams that help us push forward some of the newer products. We did moderate some of the hiring, as we saw the market come down quite a -- in the past couple of quarters. Remo do you want to lose -- give some more color to it. So this quarter was strong across all areas. Americas and APJ were particularly strong on a year-over-year basis. And last quarter we said some of the large new logo deals Americas we're taking longer to close. We also said, those deals were not lost, but just delayed. And we did close a good number of those deals. From vertical perspective it was very well-diversified. Strong verticals for federal, for financial services, healthcare and transportation. Our large and major segment did well, we highlighted a number of $100,000 plus user deals. So the fundamentals of our business are very strong, customers are not going to delay cyber as a priority, it is a priority. Cost saving is a big priority as well and we do well in both areas. Cyber, as well our cost-savings. I can tell you when it comes to cyber companies we're probably the only company that delivers significant ROI, because we are actually eliminated, a bunch of point products. So it is fitting well, it's a tougher market, there's more scrutiny, but our foundation is strong, our pipeline is strong. Remo? Yes, so this tougher market has made it us a lot more sophisticated than we were before. For example, for new logos, what have we done? We are now doing early engagement, our sales team is getting good at engaging at C-level early on in the cycle. Number two, we had to refine our business value case, CFO ready case studies, a lot more. No longer annual numbers are good enough, now they want to go into quarterly level to see when the ROI can be done. Our engagement of cloud market-based have gotten much better, because we are leveraging the annual commit that's only spent annual spend that's already committed to the hyper scalers, now we had to do ramp deals more frequently, which is kind of to meet their timing of budgets and the like. For upsell, we had done a number of things in the past few quarters, we are ensuring that customers are realizing the value more-and-more. Our customer success teams, our TAMs are doing a great job. And then the product specialists team we put in-place for emerging products, that's working well. It's working very closely with our field sales team. So having a great, highly-differentiated platform which we built on Zero Trust as a key platform, we are not a firewall company that's trying to pivot to Zero Trust, we're not a CASB company that's building. This is our core business and nonstop from day-one and our sales execution is good and we'll keep on improving it. Yes, I mean net retention rate is something we don't write to or look at. Our mix this year, we're expecting 40% to 60%, new versus upsell. We look at, really if we look at new and upsell, as those are the drivers in total, and we've talked about before is, we believe the best measure for Zscaler is really billings at 125% is outstanding. So I think this is not new. We have said many-many times that we are not a typical security companies selling boxes through people VARs. We are a transformation play, it's a high-tech sale and working closely with customers and sometimes large-sized, that's how we do business. These channel checks will always be misguided, I mean, that's how I personally look at it. When you are driving transformational C-level and whatnot, it is different. So, I would say, let's be more refined and channel checks. Look our business is strong, our customer engagements are very strong, our differentiation is very strong. Yes, our competitors are trying to create a fund, they are trying to mislead the market, it's our job to make sure we educate them, we communicate them, but the best results we do is when customers deploy our technology than they say, Jay, we're able to turn-on 20,000 users in 7 days and the results are amazing. And then there is a -- if you really contrast I've only seen a couple of cases, that say yes we got a competitive solution, this thing is still struggling out there, we are trying to extend our network from our office to the cloud, it's old-school architecture. So, I do believe that in spite of all that noise and [indiscernible] that comes from out there, our engagement, our differentiation, the way we are executing in the market, the way we are innovating and now in the new area of AI/ML, where we have unique advantage of better data, better private logs, with structured and unstructured data. We will do better than any of the vendors out there Maybe a comment on unstructured data, every vendor has logs. Logs are simply structured data, where are you coming from? Where are you going. The most intelligent information that generative AI can use comes from the URL, which could be hundreds of bytes long. And that's where you figure out what all is going on. Most of the firewalls, don't have any you URL they generally slip the domain level stuff. As we do some of this stuff. I believe will further increase our lead and any that will give us actual TAM and further growth that we are striving for. Thank you. Yes, so thank you. Zscaler for Users, this bundle was created about a little over a year ago. And we have seen very, very good growth of this combined bundle. And we and we have some customers who will go with ZIA, ZPA, we actually have some customer it's interesting, but large customers who actually started the ZPA and ZDX at the same time. But overall the bigger bundle to eliminate a bunch of point products, is the trend we are seeing and as I had said even two or three years ago, it's a matter of time. When every customer buys ZIA, ZPS ZDX for every employee and that trend is happening more-and-more. And as we said before, if we do so on current customers their spend with us could go to 5x or 6x kind of stuff, and I think we are tracking well and we are tracking well for two reasons, one customer who is seeing value, they're realizing the value format. Number two, we're actually able to remove a bunch of point products and show ROI and that actually gives them more incentive to buy more from us, Remo. Yes I think. Everything you mentioned is 100% correct. You know, I'm a traditional I'll go back to what I feel, I think it's better execution on our sales organization. Yes, I mean, all the factors are aligned, but we are still in a tougher environment with a lot more scrutiny and it's doing better execution. But if you've got good product offering that highly-differentiated and there is a need for it, because customers do want to save money and better cybersecurity that's really what's positioned us well. So every vendor or has a core competence and they do very well in that competency. A firewall company will be a grade firewall company, the company will be great CASB company and someone who does CDN and DNS should be a good CDN DNS company. You can try to pivot for that competency, you build and create over years and years. It's very hard. If I came and told you that in one year, I'm going to build the best firewall. While it would be hard for me to say that because I can say it may make statements like that, but when companies trying to pivot, it takes a while, and especially pivoting do something that's inline, multi-tenancy, figuring out all the cyber threats without slowing things down it's hard, it's an architectural change. We believe the intellectual property, the IP needed to do so is very hard, that's number one, number two, the amount of passive one has to handle to really deliver the service, your gross margins are likely to be selling some of the 50s and 60s and not like 80% where we sit at. It's because we purpose-built stuff. So it is not unnatural for us to see, the competition trying to comments, maybe I can get into this space I have many times describe Zscaler, being in-line business almost like an ERP application. Thousands of SaaS applications on view at that point products that can be built, how many ERP vendors, do you see out there doing SaaS, very few it's hard sitting in-line as far we think that gives us a big, big, barrier-to-entry for others to compete and we are not offsetting. We are expanding our platform at a larger pace. So do I kind of tried to focus too much on some of the competitive campaigns that cannot find to spread lies zone. I don't be focus on innovation, we focus on our customers and we are doing well and top-line growth, we'll talk about that on the next call for year end. In Q4, also, we had a strong Q3, so basically a tough compare. Thank you for your interest in Zscaler, I hope to see you at Zenith Live in Vegas in a couple of weeks. I would also like to thank our shareholders, our customers and our partners. Talk to you next quarter, great, thank you."

After the speakers\u2019 presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Bill Choi, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Sir, you may begin.\nBill Choi: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Zscaler second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call.

I would also like to inform you that we'll be attending the following upcoming events in March, Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco on March 6th, JMP Technology Conference in San Francisco on March 7th. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. We delivered a solid Q2 despite economic challenges that have impacted the broader tech industry. For the quarter, our revenue grew 52% year-over-year and billings grew 34%. Billings were impacted by new customers being more deliberate about their large purchasing decisions at the start of the calendar year. These deals have not gone away, and we have closed a few already in February. On the other hand, we had strong growth in our expansion business with existing customers increasing their deployments and adopting our broader platform. Once again, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 125%. We continue to delight our customers by accelerating their path to better security, business agility and cost elimination, helping them solve some of their highest priorities. This drove our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, to a new high. Our NPS now exceeds 80, which is more than 2 times the average for SaaS companies. And, today, more enterprises than ever before recognize Zscaler as the best choice to secure their digital transformation, strengthening my confidence in our $72 billion serviceable market opportunity. Our disciplined approach to growth is reflected in our strong operating profit and free cash flow, both of which doubled on a year-over-year basis. Our operating margin expanded by approximately 4 percentage points, while our revenue also continued to grow at a very high rate. As the world\u2019s largest security cloud, we have outstanding unit economics, with a stable high-90% gross retention rate and 80% gross margins. These best-in-class metrics are the result of our differentiated services, market leadership, and highly scalable multitenant cloud platform. Let me share with you some of my observations about the environment and how we plan to manage our business for the remainder of 2023. With macro concerns weighing on business leaders, more organizations are being cautious and measured about their spending. In January, we saw a higher scrutiny on budgets compared to December, resulting in additional delays in large deals. These deals haven't gone away, and customers are taking longer to make decisions and requiring additional approvals. In select instances where timing of budgets was a hurdle for new customers, we enabled them to ramp into larger subscription commitments. These strategic deals lowered our first-year billings, but will grow into a higher annual run-rate level in the second year. We typically have some ramped deals each quarter, but in Q2, the impact of ramped deals on our billings was higher. These ramped deals position us to expand the customer relationship over time to create long-term value. As we enter the second half of fiscal 23, we are expecting customer cautiousness to continue. We have accounted for further lengthening of sale cycles and the uncertain timing of large deals in our outlook. Even though our current pipeline has grown and has more mature deals, we are assuming a slight deterioration in close rates. While not immune to economic slowdowns, cybersecurity is relatively more resilient. In my conversations with hundreds of IT executives, cybersecurity remains their organization\u2019s number one IT priority. Two weeks ago, we hosted a CISO summit with 80 CISOs from Global 2000 companies. They talked about the business need to innovate, become agile and gain competitive advantage, with security as the enabling foundation. They talked about their plans to shift to Zero Trust security, to reduce attack surface and to adopt the direct-to-cloud architecture that Zscaler pioneered. Customers are excited by the new innovations being added to our platform, and their engagement with us remains very strong. Given the large opportunity we see in front of us, we will keep on building and innovating while also increasing profitability. After significantly growing our teams in recent years, we took a fresh look at our organization and found opportunities to streamline operations and to align people, roles and projects to our strategic priorities. As a result of that review, we initiated a targeted cost optimization plan to drive additional operational efficiency that best positions us to deliver profitable growth. Remo will cover this in more detail. As I mentioned before, I believe that periods of uncertainty can accelerate the adoption of disruptive technologies like ours. C-level leaders are telling me that technical debt of legacy network and security point products impedes progress and slows down business operations. By consolidating point products and embracing Zero Trust architecture with Zscaler, our customers are modernizing their security while reducing costs, giving them the competitive edge they need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving business environment. We have expanded our business value team to collaborate with customers to create CFO-ready business cases with clear ROI and payback periods that facilitate necessary deal approvals. In today\u2019s environment, customers can\u2019t afford to risk their mission-critical projects with immature offerings from unproven vendors. We\u2019re starting to see deal wins from customers who initially purchased a single tenant SASE solution from their incumbent firewall vendor that failed to deliver in the real world. These customers were misguided by their flawed message: Keep on buying my boxes and use my so-called cloud service when your users are on the road or in a branch office. A single-tenant architecture, whether deployed as appliances or as virtual machines spun up in a public cloud, will not allow enterprises to fully realize the benefits of secure digital transformation. Every customer we\u2019ve won has lots of firewalls in their data centers; but when it comes to Zero Trust security and digital transformation, they are choosing Zscaler because of our multi-tenant cloud architecture that scales and delivers business agility. Our Zero Trust Exchange is the largest in-line security cloud in the world, processing over 280 billion transactions and preventing 9 billion security and policy violations per day. This massive amount of traffic provides us with more than 300 trillion signals per day to feed our machine learning and AI engines for better detection of user and application traffic anomalies, resulting in superior threat protection. Our AI/ML capabilities are driving customer success at scale in the real world today. Let me share an example with you. In December, we helped a Global 500 conglomerate experiencing a targeted cyberattack on one of its divisions. Our ThreatLabZ team worked closely with the customer to identify the root cause of the attack and act quickly to prevent any potential damage. Subsequently, this customer upgraded to our ZIA transformation bundle to prevent zero-day attacks and secure the entire ecosystem. This win highlights the value of our high-end product bundles and the benefits that our ThreatLabZ research brings to our customers. I'm delighted to share that an increasing number of customers are purchasing our comprehensive platform capabilities, which not only accelerates their business value realization but also establishes us as a critical partner for their success. As I mentioned before, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for Users, our complete platform for user protection which includes ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, bundled together. In addition, we are gaining traction with workload protection, powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. Thanks to new and existing customers purchasing these expanded bundles, we drove a 51% year-over-year growth in the number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, ending with nearly 380 of these customers. And, over 30 of these customers have ARR greater than $5 million. Let me highlight three deals this quarter where the customers purchased all four product pillars. In a new logo win, a Top 10 global IT software and services company purchased Zscaler for Users bundle for 400,000 users including our advanced data protection suite, and our Zero Trust for Workloads for 3,000 workloads. This customer pursued a Zero Trust strategy due to their business growth resulting in a complex application and network environment and heightened risk from data sprawl. They selected Zscaler as the only scalable Zero Trust platform that reduces their attack surface and protects their sensitive data while bringing agility to their business. With our integrated platform, they will simplify their security operations by consolidating dozens of point-products, including firewalls, VPNs, VDIs, DLP and CASB. By purchasing all four product pillars, the customer is making a platform bet on Zscaler to secure their users, workloads, and devices regardless of their location. Next, in an exciting upsell win, a major auto manufacturer upgraded to Zscaler for Users bundle for 35,000 users and purchased Zero Trust for Workloads for 8,000 workloads. This platform purchase was driven by the customer's strategy to digitally transform their business operations including management of their vast supply chain. In fact, we are helping them accelerate time-to-market for new EVs. Before purchasing ZPA, this customer experienced significant delays in commissioning new vehicles as third parties did not have fast and secure remote access for collaboration. By using ZPA and ZDX, they can now provision secure access to new third parties within a few days, compared to over a month it used to take with legacy remote access technology. In addition, Zscaler for Users significantly reduces the risk of ransomware that their firewalls and VPNs allow. Finally, a Global 500 pharmaceutical company upgraded from ZIA for 45,000 users to Zscaler for Users bundle for 85,000 users and purchased Zero Trust for Workloads for 2,000 workloads. They purchased all four product pillars to pursue a Cloud-First strategy with Zero Trust security for all users and workloads. With this upsell, the annual spend of this existing million-dollar customer increased by 6x with additional opportunity for workload protection as their public cloud usage grows. Earlier, I mentioned that in some instances, we enable new customers to ramp to larger commitments. In one such new logo win, we're excited to partner with an innovative retail leader that\u2019s using facial recognition technology and cashless checkouts to redefine their future store experience. This is a significant win for us as retail was a smaller vertical for us historically, where we are now enabling new digital transformation possibilities. This retail company committed to an 8-figure total contract value for a multi-phase ramp to secure over 90,000 ZIA users, 20,000 ZPA users and 400 petabytes per month of data from their 20,000 retail store operations. This customer had bought a firewall-based SASE solution which failed to scale as well as expanded their attack surface. Leveraging our highly scalable and reliable Zero Trust Exchange platform, they will use ZIA to create direct internet access for employee tablets and terminals, while using ZPA to secure private access for store managers. Additionally, Zero Trust for Workloads will secure all traffic from cameras and terminals in the retail stores to the cloud. Workload protection accounts for approximately 40% of the total deal value. As these deals show, customers are embracing our expanded platform including our two emerging product pillars: ZDX for digital user experience management and Zscaler for Workloads for securing servers and workloads. These emerging products are on track to meet or exceed our full-year target of contributing high-teens percentage of new business. Our Zero Trust for Workloads solution is roughly doubling year-over-year. In addition, our new CNAPP solution is generating significant customer interest. You may recall at Zenith Live in June, we launched our CNAPP solution called Zscaler Posture Control, which is an integrated solution that correlates vulnerabilities and risks across CSPM, CIEM, and Infrastructure-as-Code scanning. This quarter, we had a Posture Control upsell win with a Global 1000 Engineering company for $0.5 million ACV to secure 5,000 workloads. Posture Control provided visibility across multi-cloud assets, remediated compliance violations, and revealed previously undetected high-risk vulnerabilities. We are proud that our Posture Control solution was recently recognized by research firm G2 in the \u201cLeader\u201d quadrant based on independent peer reviews. We are bringing more innovations to our customers than ever before. In our latest major cloud software release, we brought over 150 new features to market, including product innovations such as AI-powered phishing detection and dynamic, risk-based access policy. We continue to drive both internal innovation and highly targeted acquisitions to expand our leadership in the SASE and Zero Trust security markets. As announced a few weeks ago, we acquired Canonic Security, an innovative startup in SaaS supply chain security, which protects customer data in SaaS applications. For example, Google suite could be sharing data with 30 other third-party connected SaaS apps that are posing significant risk of data breaches and data loss. Together with our inline DLP, browser isolation, out-of-band CASB and SSPM for SaaS posture management, Zscaler now provides unprecedented visibility and most comprehensive data protection for SaaS applications and customer data. As we look ahead to the next few years, we are committed to driving broader adoption of our Zero Trust platform for users, workloads and IoT and OT to maximize the value of our customers\u2019 secure digital transformation efforts. CIOs are telling me that they are using this challenging environment to drive change. ROI and cost optimization are becoming bigger priorities, as they are being asked to do more with less. With our superior architecture and proven experience, we deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level that are aligned with our customers\u2019 top priorities. Our business value proposition is resonating, and more customers are consolidating multiple point products with our broader platform, which increases our wallet share with them. We believe that we're still in the early stages of a significant market opportunity to enable secure digital transformation, and we're on track to achieve our $5 billion ARR goal. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Our Q2 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even as we managed through continued deal scrutiny and longer reviews. Revenue was $388 million, up 52% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 20% of total revenue, growing 74% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 53% of revenue, EMEA was 32% and APJ was 15%. From a new business perspective, EMEA grew strongly on a year-over-year basis despite continued macro challenges in the region. Our total calculated billings in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $494 million. Until we get more certainty around the macro environment, we believe looking at total billings on a sequential basis can be a relevant measure of our billings performance in the near-term. On a sequential basis, billings grew 45% quarter-over-quarter. Our current billings grew 32% year-over-year, which includes the impact of strategic deals with phased subscription ramps that Jay talked about earlier. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 44% from a year ago to $2.809 billion. The current RPO is 51% of the total RPO. Our dollar-based net retention rate was once again above 125%. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. At the end of Q2, we had 378 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, up 51% from 251 in the prior year. The continued strength of this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added 120 customers in the quarter with greater than $100,000 in ARR, ending the quarter at 2,337 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q2 financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.4% is unchanged from the prior year. Our total operating expenses increased 6% sequentially and 44% year-over-year to $263 million, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. As we indicated last quarter, after exceeding our hiring plans in Q1, we moderated our pace of hiring in Q2. This contributed to a strong operating margin performance in the quarter with operating margin increasing 380 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%, which exceeded our guidance. We are seeing the leverage in our financial model that is driven by our strong underlying unit economics. Our free cash flow margin was 16%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around the high single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me provide more details about the targeted cost optimization plan that Jay mentioned. In the past 18 months, we doubled the size of our team to approximately 5,900 employees, as we invested aggressively based on strong market momentum. As we watched the macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of fiscal 2023 in the fall, we commented that if the business environment becomes more challenging, our business model allows us to adapt quickly and to deliver expanded operating profitability while we grow. With the announcement today, we are adapting to the changes we saw in Q2. This is a targeted optimization initiative to address inefficiencies in certain job functions and projects. As a result, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 3%. Most of the impact from these changes will be seen in Q3, and we will take a charge of $8 million to $10 million, including non-cash expenses. We will continue to hire the best candidates in high-priority areas. Now moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $396 million to $398 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 38% to 39%; gross margins of approximately 80%; operating profit in the range of $55 million to $56 million; net other income of $10 million; income taxes of $4.5 million; earnings per share of approximately $0.39, assuming 156 million fully diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard which requires the use of the if converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes, you will need to add back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.558 billion to $1.563 billion or a year-over-year growth of approximately 43%; calculated billings in the range of $1.935 billion to $1.945 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 31%. For Q3, we are assuming billings to decline by approximately 9% sequentially, compared to the mid-single digit percentage declines we have seen in the last few years. This guidance incorporates the macro related uncertainties that Jay mentioned in his comments. Operating profit in the range of $213 million to $215 million. Our guidance reflects approximately 350 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year, which is an increase from our prior guidance, while growing revenue at above 40%. Income taxes of $18 million. Earnings per share in the range of $1.52 to $1.53, assuming approximately 156 million fully diluted shares. As noted earlier, to account for our convertible notes in EPS, you will need to add back $1.4 million in annual interest expense. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our growth opportunity while increasing profitability. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing. The recurring nature of our business model gives us good visibility on top line revenue and allows us to adapt quickly to changes in market conditions to deliver on our operating profit and margin goals. If the environment becomes more challenging, we will continue to prioritize profitability, leveraging our strong unit economics and driving efficiencies in our cost structure. In fiscal \u201823, as a result of our focus on operational efficiency, we are increasing our profitability in the second half to achieve a full-year operating margin of 13.7%, reflecting a 350 basis points expansion while revenue is still growing over 40%. If the environment improves, we\u2019ll prioritize growth. Our long-term investment framework still applies. If we are growing revenue faster than 30%, you can expect less than 300 basis points of margin expansion in the year. We remain confident of reaching 20% to 22% operating margins in the long term. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll continue our disciplined approach to managing our business to maximize value for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jay, I appreciate the backdrop is tough. We hear it from every company. But can you frame for us your outlook in terms of things within your control and things that aren't? And maybe also if you could, comment on the integrity of the data that you look at that underpins your confidence in Zscaler's competitive position in the market? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. If you look at the quarter, we found that our upsell was quite strong. Customers loyal to us, they like our solution, upselling becomes easier for us. In terms of challenging, new logos with large deals are more challenging as there was additional scrutiny and additional approvals needed. The other thing that worked well was that customers like the fact that we are able to do consolidation of lots of point products, the clean architecture, and give them strong ROI. That thing has worked well for us. In terms of competitive positioning, we haven't really seen any change. In fact, I would say that on the higher end of the market, we actually feel like we are stronger than even before because we have established that. We actually have the right architecture, right solution with thousands of customers well deployed and very happy customers. In fact, the other thing we are beginning to see that some of the solutions that are sold by firewall vendors and SASE solutions, and when customers can deploy them, they\u2019re falling apart. I have been asked many times in the past two years, hey, are you replacing some of our firewall-based solutions? Answer I used to give is, I haven't seen very many out there, now beginning to see some of them. The large retailer I mentioned on my call with 20,000 stores tried for over 18 months to deploy a firewall-based SASE solution, so to speak, and eventually gave up, and we are really taking care of it. The other thing I would mention is Remo has often said we can adjust our business model as needed. As environment is getting tighter, we are adjusting the model by slowing down hiring. Our unit economic cost is very high. So you're seeing expansion of gross margins and operating margins -- sorry, operating margins, which our investors do like to see. Lastly, my confidence is coming from tons and tons of customer calls I made. We had 80 CISOs with us for two days doing an exchange. All of these guys I have deployed have done a great job. They understand the architecture, the more the world spreads out there, a better understanding of the architecture, the more they're able to fend off the fluff being spent by competitors. So, I'm very content and comfortable in our ability to stay far ahead of the competition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with MoffettNathanson.\nSterling Auty: I'm just kind of curious, Jay, when you look at the business, can you give us a high-level sense of how much of the business in the quarter is replacement of legacy security solutions where cost savings is a driving factor? And how much of the business is actually brand-new implementations to enable some sort of project where maybe it's a little bit riskier in these tighter budgetary times?\nJay Chaudhry: As you know, every company has some kind of legacy solution for internet gateway or even VPN access. Those are the two starting points for us. ZIA starts with replacing some kind of secure web gateway and ZPA starts replacing some kind of VPN, then expands from there. So almost all of business we do starts by replacing something, except -- well, upsell too. Actually, if you look at our upsell, that means we may have ZIA some pieces deployed. We may be upselling to replace [ZLT] of some vendor or we may be replacing VPN some vendor or some of other stuff. So almost all business is replacement for us. You can call some of the stuff expansion. For example, when customers want to have direct access to applications sitting in Azure and AWS without going through the data center, we're still replacing some of the upselling in the data center and some of the direct connects they may have bought. So, it's replacement of a bunch of point products into a fewer interior offerings. That's really where the savings come from, that's where the simplicity and operational ease comes from.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: So I just wanted to ask about those ramps, deals that you talked about. Just wondering if you could quantify how much those deals would have added to billings in Q2 if they were normal deals versus ramping over time. And also, are customers contracted to spend a certain amount that was deferred, or can they still back out of that ramp piece of it? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So, they're contractually obligated to the ramps and the ramps are strategic. As Jay talked about, with large deployments, we are seeing more ramps. The impact on billings, probably a couple of percentage points is what you can think. But again, with large customers, large deployments buying more of our fillers, ramps were more in Q2.\nJay Chaudhry: If I may add, I mean, we look at this as a strategic investment on our part to help customers get started and actually manage your cash for investments in year one by deferring some of that stuff to future years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham & Company.\nAlex Henderson: So, I was actually interested in asking about the ramps as well. But I also wanted to put it in context to the duration in the calculated billings numbers. Can you give us some sense of the magnitude of each of those? I guess a couple of percent on the ramps. But if I look at the ramps, once you get all of that back in a couple of quarters, once they get past the initial start day, so isn't that actually just a timing issue?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, you're absolutely right, Alex. I mean, the ramps are a timing issue, lower billings upfront and higher billings later based on the ramp. Related to the billing duration, there was a -- it was slightly favorable in Q2. If you look at our billings, calculated billings, they're at 34%, short-term billings were at 32%. That's generally what you can think about the favorableness related to the billing duration.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd with UBS.\nRoger Boyd: I wonder if I could poke at the efficiency versus capacity debate. I know you reiterated the $5 billion long-term goal, and Jay, your confidence in the market opportunity. But if you do see conditions improve, how do you think about sales capacity heading into fiscal '24 and your ability to accelerate growth at an agile base? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. And that's a great question. We are a growth company. We feel that the market opportunity is huge. $5 billion is still what we are shooting for. We saw this as -- based on the comments that I made, we've increased our headcount almost 100% over an 18-month period. And we saw basically inefficiencies in the organization. That's why we're doing this cost optimization. Having said that, our selling capacity remains very strong. And we continue -- we are going to continue to invest in our selling capacity as we go forward into the second half. So, we are going to moderate hiring throughout the company, but our focus is still selling capacity and R&D development.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So we are still selectively going to hire quota-carrying sales reps as well as core engineering leaders -- sorry, core engineering team members. And we expect our year-end headcount to be higher than the headcount today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Hey Remo, just on the billings guidance, if you could, just give us a characterization of how you would give a -- say, is it conservative? Is it based on what you're seeing today? Is it getting worse? The environment thing -- we're getting a lot of questions on that. Be helpful to get any color you have on that. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, thanks for asking the question, Joel. So, there was an elongation of the sales cycle. So, we're basically baking into that to our second half, slightly worse, not a lot but slightly worse than what we saw in Q2. So, a little more conservatism related to our billings guidance than the past.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. And we are assuming that current levels of these scrutinies will continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank.\nPatrick Colville: So, I guess, I'd like to ask about the sales changes that we discussed last quarter on the call. Is the slowdown we're seeing have any bearing on the sales changes that were made earlier in the fiscal year, or has that process been kind of wrapped up and that's in the background now?\nJay Chaudhry: Patrick, as we discussed, we made changes to our enterprise segment, the lower end of commodity segment at the start of the year and where it now reports to geo leaders. Those changes are behind us, they've done Q1, and no bearing on Q2 numbers. Okay? So, the main thing we're seeing at the highest level is some of the macro conditions that are impacting from the higher end larger deals. Our low end of the market segments, enterprise and commercial, they actually had done quite well. They're still impacted.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Remo, maybe for you, can we just dig into the ramp deals just a little bit more? And maybe specifically, are these deals that take multiple years to ramp up to their sort of normal run rate on average, or are these things that maybe come back in the next couple of quarters? And relatedly, are you assuming a similar mix of ramp deals in the second half as you think about the conservatism in that guide?\nRemo Canessa: No, it's not multiple years, it's shorter than that. Also kind of related to what are we thinking of ramps in Q3 and the second half, similar to what we saw in Q2. Again, as we talked about, dealers are getting bigger, buying more of our platform. It is a very -- it's a strategic buy for large companies. Regarding the architectures that are out there today, I mean companies understand. They understand that they've got a problem. And for that, these ramps do help us. I would expect it to continue about the same pace in Q3 and Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC.\nMatt Hedberg: I just wanted to ask about linearity. It sounded like in your prepared remarks that January was worse than December. I'm curious, do those trends continue into February, i.e., was February worse than January? And is there any way to quantify sort of the impact of the deals that pushed out of the quarter?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean, some deals certainly pushed into February. And February -- but again, some of the deals that we thought we'd do in January came through in February. Regarding linearity, overall linearity was actually better in Q2 versus Q1. But that's also a function of the elongation of the deals. So, that's why its linearity is better. Going forward, I would expect back-end loaded linearity as we've seen the last few quarters. I really don't see that changing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord.\nMike Walkley: Remo, I guess, with new customer pipeline taking longer to close, it seems like upsell is going to be maybe even greater mix over the intermediate term. Can you share with us maybe how that mix changes over the implied guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. That's a great question. If you recall in Q1, it was about 50-50.\nJay Chaudhry: That's right.\nRemo Canessa: And we said, we felt on -- for the year, it's going to go more in the 60-40 upsell versus new. In Q2, it was about 35% new and 65% upsell. From my perspective, I think for this year, I think 60-40 is still the right metric to think about, 60% upsell and 40% new.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: I wanted to ask about -- if you look at the phase deals and/or just the general economic backdrop, is there a change in pricing? In other words, are more customers asking for a release in terms of pricing? And related to that, Remo, I know you talked about the billings and you're assuming some more conservative or things can get worse. But if I look at the billings guide, if in fact, billings are down 9% sequentially in the April quarter, in order to make the annual guide the sequential growth in July quarter is 50% or higher, and that's roughly equal to or above the sequential growth for the last three years. So, I'm just struggling a little bit to understand why the billings guide, we should think there's basically some room, if you will, when I look at the Q4. It just seems like you're asking a lot for Q4.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. I would start on the pricing pressure discount, you talked about, and Remo can get the billing part of it. So due to a tighter macro environment, there is increasing scrutiny and pressure on CISOs this year. Our customers are negotiating order over payment and deal terms. But customers do view us as one of the most mission-critical service. And they want to make sure they buy the service that works, the service they can depend upon. But they're not looking for the cheapest solution. So from their point of view, I would say we aren't seeing tremendous pressure on discounting. We're seeing some focus on it. And to help that, that's where some of the ramp deals come in to help lower the first year cost for the customer to manage their spend. But being strategic, being dealing at the right level and actually delivering a lot of ROI value, reduces pressure on us from a pricing point of view. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So, if you look at the average that we've had in the second half sequentially from Q3 to Q4, it's been in the 48%, 49% range. But we've -- our guidance is 46% at the midpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver with Cantor.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: So Jay, I'm wondering if you can talk in more detail on the adoption trends you're seeing around cloud workload protection. And what those initial lands look like from a deal size perspective relative to ZIA and ZPA? And also, just touch on the go-to-market, are all reps equipped to sell that solution today? Is there an initial overlay strategy? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you. Our overall adoption of cloud workflows product is pretty good as planned. And as customers are launching more and more workflows, they have two options. Either they extend their corporate network just like a branch network to every cloud region and put virtual firewalls there or they do Zero Trust architecture with Zscaler. So, these products are primarily sold to our customers. Our customers understand the value of it, and that's why they're embracing it. Now the initial deals are smaller, customers are growing, and there are some large deals. But majority of the deals start small and customers start buying into it. They largely end up doing the same thing, just like ZIA for users, ZPA for users, and this is ZIA for workloads, ZPA for workloads. That's where we believe opportunity for us is significant. In terms of go-to-market, all reps are equipped to sell it, but we also understand that there are a bunch of nuanced discussions in this area. So, we do have product specialists. This is not overlay sales team. These product specialist are experts in this area, and they do help in the sales process. And Remo, overall, we are expecting the emerging products, too.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. Commercial products still tracking to high-teens, both new and upsell.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: I wanted to ask you on the market opportunity for best of breed. With Zscaler now having over 30%of the Global 2000, how do you think about the risk that the enterprises that can move to that best of breed are essentially already Zscaler customers? In other words, where do you think the ceiling is to that G2000 penetration rate? And are you getting feedback from, let's say, the next sort of bake-offs, that's perhaps we don't care as much about best of breed technology. How do you think about that?\nJay Chaudhry: Next bake-offs? I'm sorry. Can you expand on last part again?\nGabriela Borges: Yes. Essentially, do you -- you're competing for today, are you getting any signs of feedback from customers saying, we know you're best of breed, but we're not going to prioritize you?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Our customers are not looking for best-of-breed point products. They're looking for best-of-breed platform with the right architecture. We can tell you if -- when you talk to the low end of the market, they can live with some of the solutions that are kind of half way. But, when you talk about Global 2000, these customers are generally pretty savvy. The requirements are complicated. And we believe the best architecture will win in the long term. I gave you an example this time where a large retailer had gone a different way, thinking that a firewall-based architecture work, tried, failed and came back. I expect to see a lot more customers do the same thing. I think we have ample opportunity in the Global 2000 to take our current penetration to a much, much higher level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Maybe just to piggyback off an earlier question around upsell versus net new. So, it seems like you're able to kind of somewhat toggle your sales force to maybe focus more on those back-to-base opportunities. So one, are you changing incentives, comp plans at all to, I guess, better incentivize your sales force to focus more on those back-to-base opportunities? And then second, the ones that you are seeing a better upsell, like what product is having the highest hit rate?\nJay Chaudhry: So, we aren't really making any special changes to upsell versus new logo. This has been asked to us many times over the years. Do we have a special incentive on new logos? Not really. Our platform is very broad and big. So we really -- we want new logos and we want expansion. And expansion -- we know that expansion means upsell is a little bit easier than new logos. That's why you've seen some of the upsell numbers going up this quarter as compared to new logos down. We keep on making refinements to our go-to-market structure and model from time to time, but there's nothing significant we've done now to make any changes. I think one of the best things is we have a very good sales organization. Our architecture is very good. Our deployments are very good. That's why customers come back and c us. I mean, talking to so many customers, they believe we have the best service, best architecture and best security. That's why we win. And I think we'll keep on driving it. But in today's market, we expect upsell numbers to stay high because it's a bit easier as compared to a new a logo.\nPeter Levine: And then which products are getting the biggest hit rate?\nJay Chaudhry: Oh, sorry. Big product. Yes. So, if you look at almost every Zscaler customer has ZIA. ZPA can be a starting point, but that's not common. But more and more, if customers are starting with ZIA, ZPA, ZDX, but there's still a sizable installed base that has ZIA. Now ZIA, ZPA together in the higher end, they will be close to 60% now. That means so many customers have the ZIA, ZPA both. There's upsell opportunities on ZPA. There's upsell opportunity within bundles. A lot of these customers have bought business, they moved to transformation. From transformation, there's a big opportunity for us to sell data protection. Data protection, especially advanced data protection is very much on the mind of large corporations. And there's a lot of old stuff sitting from Symantec 1, 2 and some of the McAfee stuff. And when you deploy Zscaler, you can't be really sitting with the old school DLP technology. Data protection is a big opportunity for us. If there's one other product I would highlight, it is ZDX. Digital experience is one of the favorite services of CIOs and Head of Networking because when someone is coming from some home, some coffee shop, some hotel, when things are slow, customers struggle to figure out. ZDX has become very sophisticated to help them pinpoint issues and take care of them. User experience is becoming more and more important. And it\u2019s this highly, highly differentiated service that we offer. Did I answer your question?\nPeter Levine: Perfect. Yes. Thank you very much.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: You said that EMEA grew strongly year-over-year. But was it the kind of growth you thought it would be? Because the reason I ask is that our checks in the regions were as -- they were pretty mixed. And your revenue growth decelerated in the region. And given the recurring model of revenue is usually a lagging indicator, I get that. But I guess you answered that question. And how do you expect the region to progress going forward? Is there any reason that region might be more competitive?\nJay Chaudhry: I'll start, and Remo can add things too. This quarter, EMEA had less dependency on large deals, okay? And as you know, large deals are getting more scrutiny. And U.S. was relatively speaking weaker because they had higher dependency on large deals. Remo, do you want to add any more?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean you're right, John. I mean, revenue is a lagging indicator. And for our new and upsell business, it was one of our strongest, if not our strongest geo. So, EMEA did do well.\nJay Chaudhry: And if there's another color I could give you on the market vertical kind of stuff. There are certain verticals that are better than others. As you would expect, the tech vertical was weak in today's market. And some of the retail and on was a little bit slow.\nJohn DiFucci: But that would be more for the U.S., right, Jay, the tech vertical?\nJay Chaudhry: For the U.S., that's correct. That's correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Jay or Remo, one of the topics in recent quarters is cloud-related costs, or in other words, some enterprise customers are indicating that some of the cost benefits they have subscribed to under the big cloud promise in recent years, at times, that is not living up to their expectations. So interested to learn whether your customers have been bringing up that point in recent discussions.\nJay Chaudhry: Kind of hard time hearing you, Shaul. So you might -- I think we caught something about maybe hyperscaler and -- perhaps if you could repeat that?\nShaul Eyal: Yes. So I was asking whether if some customers have been bringing up maybe some disappointment with the overall promise as it relates to cloud-related costs. Is that a topic that has been brought up in recent discussions with your customers?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So, let me share with you lots of conversation I have. Customers are embracing cloud, okay? There's no -- somebody is not saying, I want to come back or not embrace the cloud. That's point number one. Point number two, the speed at which these guys are moving forward is slowing down. You can expect because some of these large software development projects are slowing down for cost reasons. Number three, that's actually creating an interesting phenomenon, whereby customers aren't able to use all the spend that's committed. Okay? That's actually giving us at a unit where we are actually partnering more closely with some of these hyperscalers where our deal can be part of that customer commit because we are -- as an approved partner for some of the cloud spend. So, those are some of the things we are seeing. But overall, we do see -- it's rare to find a CIO that says I don't like cloud anymore. Are there complaints about cost in the cloud? Yes. Do they see an alternate to go back to data center? No.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, due to the interest of time, that concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jay for closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you for your continued interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at some of the upcoming conferences. Thank you again.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Our Q2 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even as we managed through continued deal scrutiny and longer reviews. Revenue was $388 million, up 52% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 20% of total revenue, growing 74% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 53% of revenue, EMEA was 32% and APJ was 15%. From a new business perspective, EMEA grew strongly on a year-over-year basis despite continued macro challenges in the region. Our total calculated billings in Q2 grew 34% year-over-year to $494 million. Until we get more certainty around the macro environment, we believe looking at total billings on a sequential basis can be a relevant measure of our billings performance in the near-term. On a sequential basis, billings grew 45% quarter-over-quarter. Our current billings grew 32% year-over-year, which includes the impact of strategic deals with phased subscription ramps that Jay talked about earlier. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 44% from a year ago to $2.809 billion. The current RPO is 51% of the total RPO. Our dollar-based net retention rate was once again above 125%. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. At the end of Q2, we had 378 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, up 51% from 251 in the prior year. The continued strength of this metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added 120 customers in the quarter with greater than $100,000 in ARR, ending the quarter at 2,337 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q2 financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.4% is unchanged from the prior year. Our total operating expenses increased 6% sequentially and 44% year-over-year to $263 million, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. As we indicated last quarter, after exceeding our hiring plans in Q1, we moderated our pace of hiring in Q2. This contributed to a strong operating margin performance in the quarter with operating margin increasing 380 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%, which exceeded our guidance. We are seeing the leverage in our financial model that is driven by our strong underlying unit economics. Our free cash flow margin was 16%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around the high single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me provide more details about the targeted cost optimization plan that Jay mentioned. In the past 18 months, we doubled the size of our team to approximately 5,900 employees, as we invested aggressively based on strong market momentum. As we watched the macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of fiscal 2023 in the fall, we commented that if the business environment becomes more challenging, our business model allows us to adapt quickly and to deliver expanded operating profitability while we grow. With the announcement today, we are adapting to the changes we saw in Q2. This is a targeted optimization initiative to address inefficiencies in certain job functions and projects. As a result, we are reducing our workforce by approximately 3%. Most of the impact from these changes will be seen in Q3, and we will take a charge of $8 million to $10 million, including non-cash expenses. We will continue to hire the best candidates in high-priority areas. Now moving on to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $396 million to $398 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 38% to 39%; gross margins of approximately 80%; operating profit in the range of $55 million to $56 million; net other income of $10 million; income taxes of $4.5 million; earnings per share of approximately $0.39, assuming 156 million fully diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard which requires the use of the if converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes, you will need to add back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.558 billion to $1.563 billion or a year-over-year growth of approximately 43%; calculated billings in the range of $1.935 billion to $1.945 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 31%. For Q3, we are assuming billings to decline by approximately 9% sequentially, compared to the mid-single digit percentage declines we have seen in the last few years. This guidance incorporates the macro related uncertainties that Jay mentioned in his comments. Operating profit in the range of $213 million to $215 million. Our guidance reflects approximately 350 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year, which is an increase from our prior guidance, while growing revenue at above 40%. Income taxes of $18 million. Earnings per share in the range of $1.52 to $1.53, assuming approximately 156 million fully diluted shares. As noted earlier, to account for our convertible notes in EPS, you will need to add back $1.4 million in annual interest expense. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our growth opportunity while increasing profitability. We will balance growth and profitability based on how our business is growing. The recurring nature of our business model gives us good visibility on top line revenue and allows us to adapt quickly to changes in market conditions to deliver on our operating profit and margin goals. If the environment becomes more challenging, we will continue to prioritize profitability, leveraging our strong unit economics and driving efficiencies in our cost structure. In fiscal \u201823, as a result of our focus on operational efficiency, we are increasing our profitability in the second half to achieve a full-year operating margin of 13.7%, reflecting a 350 basis points expansion while revenue is still growing over 40%. If the environment improves, we'll prioritize growth. Our long-term investment framework still applies. If we are growing revenue faster than 30%, you can expect less than 300 basis points of margin expansion in the year. We remain confident of reaching 20% to 22% operating margins in the long term. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll continue our disciplined approach to managing our business to maximize value for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes. So, they're contractually obligated to the ramps and the ramps are strategic. As Jay talked about, with large deployments, we are seeing more ramps. The impact on billings, probably a couple of percentage points is what you can think. But again, with large customers, large deployments buying more of our fillers, ramps were more in Q2. Yes. I mean, you're absolutely right, Alex. I mean, the ramps are a timing issue, lower billings upfront and higher billings later based on the ramp. Related to the billing duration, there was a -- it was slightly favorable in Q2. If you look at our billings, calculated billings, they're at 34%, short-term billings were at 32%. That's generally what you can think about the favorableness related to the billing duration. Yes. And that's a great question. We are a growth company. We feel that the market opportunity is huge. $5 billion is still what we are shooting for. We saw this as -- based on the comments that I made, we've increased our headcount almost 100% over an 18-month period. And we saw basically inefficiencies in the organization. That's why we're doing this cost optimization. Having said that, our selling capacity remains very strong. And we continue -- we are going to continue to invest in our selling capacity as we go forward into the second half. So, we are going to moderate hiring throughout the company, but our focus is still selling capacity and R&D development. Yes. I mean, thanks for asking the question, Joel. So, there was an elongation of the sales cycle. So, we're basically baking into that to our second half, slightly worse, not a lot but slightly worse than what we saw in Q2. So, a little more conservatism related to our billings guidance than the past. No, it's not multiple years, it's shorter than that. Also kind of related to what are we thinking of ramps in Q3 and the second half, similar to what we saw in Q2. Again, as we talked about, dealers are getting bigger, buying more of our platform. It is a very -- it's a strategic buy for large companies. Regarding the architectures that are out there today, I mean companies understand. They understand that they've got a problem. And for that, these ramps do help us. I would expect it to continue about the same pace in Q3 and Q4. Yes. I mean, some deals certainly pushed into February. And February -- but again, some of the deals that we thought we'd do in January came through in February. Regarding linearity, overall linearity was actually better in Q2 versus Q1. But that's also a function of the elongation of the deals. So, that's why its linearity is better. Going forward, I would expect back-end loaded linearity as we've seen the last few quarters. I really don't see that changing. Yes. That's a great question. If you recall in Q1, it was about 50-50. And we said, we felt on -- for the year, it's going to go more in the 60-40 upsell versus new. In Q2, it was about 35% new and 65% upsell. From my perspective, I think for this year, I think 60-40 is still the right metric to think about, 60% upsell and 40% new. Yes. So, if you look at the average that we've had in the second half sequentially from Q3 to Q4, it's been in the 48%, 49% range. But we've -- our guidance is 46% at the midpoint. Yes. Commercial products still tracking to high-teens, both new and upsell. Yes. I mean you're right, John. I mean, revenue is a lagging indicator. And for our new and upsell business, it was one of our strongest, if not our strongest geo. So, EMEA did do well. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. We delivered a solid Q2 despite economic challenges that have impacted the broader tech industry. For the quarter, our revenue grew 52% year-over-year and billings grew 34%. Billings were impacted by new customers being more deliberate about their large purchasing decisions at the start of the calendar year. These deals have not gone away, and we have closed a few already in February. On the other hand, we had strong growth in our expansion business with existing customers increasing their deployments and adopting our broader platform. Once again, our dollar-based net retention rate was over 125%. We continue to delight our customers by accelerating their path to better security, business agility and cost elimination, helping them solve some of their highest priorities. This drove our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, to a new high. Our NPS now exceeds 80, which is more than 2 times the average for SaaS companies. And, today, more enterprises than ever before recognize Zscaler as the best choice to secure their digital transformation, strengthening my confidence in our $72 billion serviceable market opportunity. Our disciplined approach to growth is reflected in our strong operating profit and free cash flow, both of which doubled on a year-over-year basis. Our operating margin expanded by approximately 4 percentage points, while our revenue also continued to grow at a very high rate. As the world's largest security cloud, we have outstanding unit economics, with a stable high-90% gross retention rate and 80% gross margins. These best-in-class metrics are the result of our differentiated services, market leadership, and highly scalable multitenant cloud platform. Let me share with you some of my observations about the environment and how we plan to manage our business for the remainder of 2023. With macro concerns weighing on business leaders, more organizations are being cautious and measured about their spending. In January, we saw a higher scrutiny on budgets compared to December, resulting in additional delays in large deals. These deals haven't gone away, and customers are taking longer to make decisions and requiring additional approvals. In select instances where timing of budgets was a hurdle for new customers, we enabled them to ramp into larger subscription commitments. These strategic deals lowered our first-year billings, but will grow into a higher annual run-rate level in the second year. We typically have some ramped deals each quarter, but in Q2, the impact of ramped deals on our billings was higher. These ramped deals position us to expand the customer relationship over time to create long-term value. As we enter the second half of fiscal 23, we are expecting customer cautiousness to continue. We have accounted for further lengthening of sale cycles and the uncertain timing of large deals in our outlook. Even though our current pipeline has grown and has more mature deals, we are assuming a slight deterioration in close rates. While not immune to economic slowdowns, cybersecurity is relatively more resilient. In my conversations with hundreds of IT executives, cybersecurity remains their organization's number one IT priority. Two weeks ago, we hosted a CISO summit with 80 CISOs from Global 2000 companies. They talked about the business need to innovate, become agile and gain competitive advantage, with security as the enabling foundation. They talked about their plans to shift to Zero Trust security, to reduce attack surface and to adopt the direct-to-cloud architecture that Zscaler pioneered. Customers are excited by the new innovations being added to our platform, and their engagement with us remains very strong. Given the large opportunity we see in front of us, we will keep on building and innovating while also increasing profitability. After significantly growing our teams in recent years, we took a fresh look at our organization and found opportunities to streamline operations and to align people, roles and projects to our strategic priorities. As a result of that review, we initiated a targeted cost optimization plan to drive additional operational efficiency that best positions us to deliver profitable growth. Remo will cover this in more detail. As I mentioned before, I believe that periods of uncertainty can accelerate the adoption of disruptive technologies like ours. C-level leaders are telling me that technical debt of legacy network and security point products impedes progress and slows down business operations. By consolidating point products and embracing Zero Trust architecture with Zscaler, our customers are modernizing their security while reducing costs, giving them the competitive edge they need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving business environment. We have expanded our business value team to collaborate with customers to create CFO-ready business cases with clear ROI and payback periods that facilitate necessary deal approvals. In today's environment, customers can't afford to risk their mission-critical projects with immature offerings from unproven vendors. We're starting to see deal wins from customers who initially purchased a single tenant SASE solution from their incumbent firewall vendor that failed to deliver in the real world. These customers were misguided by their flawed message: Keep on buying my boxes and use my so-called cloud service when your users are on the road or in a branch office. A single-tenant architecture, whether deployed as appliances or as virtual machines spun up in a public cloud, will not allow enterprises to fully realize the benefits of secure digital transformation. Every customer we've won has lots of firewalls in their data centers; but when it comes to Zero Trust security and digital transformation, they are choosing Zscaler because of our multi-tenant cloud architecture that scales and delivers business agility. Our Zero Trust Exchange is the largest in-line security cloud in the world, processing over 280 billion transactions and preventing 9 billion security and policy violations per day. This massive amount of traffic provides us with more than 300 trillion signals per day to feed our machine learning and AI engines for better detection of user and application traffic anomalies, resulting in superior threat protection. Our AI/ML capabilities are driving customer success at scale in the real world today. Let me share an example with you. In December, we helped a Global 500 conglomerate experiencing a targeted cyberattack on one of its divisions. Our ThreatLabZ team worked closely with the customer to identify the root cause of the attack and act quickly to prevent any potential damage. Subsequently, this customer upgraded to our ZIA transformation bundle to prevent zero-day attacks and secure the entire ecosystem. This win highlights the value of our high-end product bundles and the benefits that our ThreatLabZ research brings to our customers. I'm delighted to share that an increasing number of customers are purchasing our comprehensive platform capabilities, which not only accelerates their business value realization but also establishes us as a critical partner for their success. As I mentioned before, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for Users, our complete platform for user protection which includes ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, bundled together. In addition, we are gaining traction with workload protection, powered by the same core ZIA and ZPA technology. Thanks to new and existing customers purchasing these expanded bundles, we drove a 51% year-over-year growth in the number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, ending with nearly 380 of these customers. And, over 30 of these customers have ARR greater than $5 million. Let me highlight three deals this quarter where the customers purchased all four product pillars. In a new logo win, a Top 10 global IT software and services company purchased Zscaler for Users bundle for 400,000 users including our advanced data protection suite, and our Zero Trust for Workloads for 3,000 workloads. This customer pursued a Zero Trust strategy due to their business growth resulting in a complex application and network environment and heightened risk from data sprawl. They selected Zscaler as the only scalable Zero Trust platform that reduces their attack surface and protects their sensitive data while bringing agility to their business. With our integrated platform, they will simplify their security operations by consolidating dozens of point-products, including firewalls, VPNs, VDIs, DLP and CASB. By purchasing all four product pillars, the customer is making a platform bet on Zscaler to secure their users, workloads, and devices regardless of their location. Next, in an exciting upsell win, a major auto manufacturer upgraded to Zscaler for Users bundle for 35,000 users and purchased Zero Trust for Workloads for 8,000 workloads. This platform purchase was driven by the customer's strategy to digitally transform their business operations including management of their vast supply chain. In fact, we are helping them accelerate time-to-market for new EVs. Before purchasing ZPA, this customer experienced significant delays in commissioning new vehicles as third parties did not have fast and secure remote access for collaboration. By using ZPA and ZDX, they can now provision secure access to new third parties within a few days, compared to over a month it used to take with legacy remote access technology. In addition, Zscaler for Users significantly reduces the risk of ransomware that their firewalls and VPNs allow. Finally, a Global 500 pharmaceutical company upgraded from ZIA for 45,000 users to Zscaler for Users bundle for 85,000 users and purchased Zero Trust for Workloads for 2,000 workloads. They purchased all four product pillars to pursue a Cloud-First strategy with Zero Trust security for all users and workloads. With this upsell, the annual spend of this existing million-dollar customer increased by 6x with additional opportunity for workload protection as their public cloud usage grows. Earlier, I mentioned that in some instances, we enable new customers to ramp to larger commitments. In one such new logo win, we're excited to partner with an innovative retail leader that's using facial recognition technology and cashless checkouts to redefine their future store experience. This is a significant win for us as retail was a smaller vertical for us historically, where we are now enabling new digital transformation possibilities. This retail company committed to an 8-figure total contract value for a multi-phase ramp to secure over 90,000 ZIA users, 20,000 ZPA users and 400 petabytes per month of data from their 20,000 retail store operations. This customer had bought a firewall-based SASE solution which failed to scale as well as expanded their attack surface. Leveraging our highly scalable and reliable Zero Trust Exchange platform, they will use ZIA to create direct internet access for employee tablets and terminals, while using ZPA to secure private access for store managers. Additionally, Zero Trust for Workloads will secure all traffic from cameras and terminals in the retail stores to the cloud. Workload protection accounts for approximately 40% of the total deal value. As these deals show, customers are embracing our expanded platform including our two emerging product pillars: ZDX for digital user experience management and Zscaler for Workloads for securing servers and workloads. These emerging products are on track to meet or exceed our full-year target of contributing high-teens percentage of new business. Our Zero Trust for Workloads solution is roughly doubling year-over-year. In addition, our new CNAPP solution is generating significant customer interest. You may recall at Zenith Live in June, we launched our CNAPP solution called Zscaler Posture Control, which is an integrated solution that correlates vulnerabilities and risks across CSPM, CIEM, and Infrastructure-as-Code scanning. This quarter, we had a Posture Control upsell win with a Global 1000 Engineering company for $0.5 million ACV to secure 5,000 workloads. Posture Control provided visibility across multi-cloud assets, remediated compliance violations, and revealed previously undetected high-risk vulnerabilities. We are proud that our Posture Control solution was recently recognized by research firm G2 in the \u201cLeader\u201d quadrant based on independent peer reviews. We are bringing more innovations to our customers than ever before. In our latest major cloud software release, we brought over 150 new features to market, including product innovations such as AI-powered phishing detection and dynamic, risk-based access policy. We continue to drive both internal innovation and highly targeted acquisitions to expand our leadership in the SASE and Zero Trust security markets. As announced a few weeks ago, we acquired Canonic Security, an innovative startup in SaaS supply chain security, which protects customer data in SaaS applications. For example, Google suite could be sharing data with 30 other third-party connected SaaS apps that are posing significant risk of data breaches and data loss. Together with our inline DLP, browser isolation, out-of-band CASB and SSPM for SaaS posture management, Zscaler now provides unprecedented visibility and most comprehensive data protection for SaaS applications and customer data. As we look ahead to the next few years, we are committed to driving broader adoption of our Zero Trust platform for users, workloads and IoT and OT to maximize the value of our customers' secure digital transformation efforts. CIOs are telling me that they are using this challenging environment to drive change. ROI and cost optimization are becoming bigger priorities, as they are being asked to do more with less. With our superior architecture and proven experience, we deliver measurable outcomes at the CXO level that are aligned with our customers' top priorities. Our business value proposition is resonating, and more customers are consolidating multiple point products with our broader platform, which increases our wallet share with them. We believe that we're still in the early stages of a significant market opportunity to enable secure digital transformation, and we're on track to achieve our $5 billion ARR goal. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Thank you. If you look at the quarter, we found that our upsell was quite strong. Customers loyal to us, they like our solution, upselling becomes easier for us. In terms of challenging, new logos with large deals are more challenging as there was additional scrutiny and additional approvals needed. The other thing that worked well was that customers like the fact that we are able to do consolidation of lots of point products, the clean architecture, and give them strong ROI. That thing has worked well for us. In terms of competitive positioning, we haven't really seen any change. In fact, I would say that on the higher end of the market, we actually feel like we are stronger than even before because we have established that. We actually have the right architecture, right solution with thousands of customers well deployed and very happy customers. In fact, the other thing we are beginning to see that some of the solutions that are sold by firewall vendors and SASE solutions, and when customers can deploy them, they're falling apart. I have been asked many times in the past two years, hey, are you replacing some of our firewall-based solutions? Answer I used to give is, I haven't seen very many out there, now beginning to see some of them. The large retailer I mentioned on my call with 20,000 stores tried for over 18 months to deploy a firewall-based SASE solution, so to speak, and eventually gave up, and we are really taking care of it. The other thing I would mention is Remo has often said we can adjust our business model as needed. As environment is getting tighter, we are adjusting the model by slowing down hiring. Our unit economic cost is very high. So you're seeing expansion of gross margins and operating margins -- sorry, operating margins, which our investors do like to see. Lastly, my confidence is coming from tons and tons of customer calls I made. We had 80 CISOs with us for two days doing an exchange. All of these guys I have deployed have done a great job. They understand the architecture, the more the world spreads out there, a better understanding of the architecture, the more they're able to fend off the fluff being spent by competitors. So, I'm very content and comfortable in our ability to stay far ahead of the competition. As you know, every company has some kind of legacy solution for internet gateway or even VPN access. Those are the two starting points for us. ZIA starts with replacing some kind of secure web gateway and ZPA starts replacing some kind of VPN, then expands from there. So almost all of business we do starts by replacing something, except -- well, upsell too. Actually, if you look at our upsell, that means we may have ZIA some pieces deployed. We may be upselling to replace [ZLT] of some vendor or we may be replacing VPN some vendor or some of other stuff. So almost all business is replacement for us. You can call some of the stuff expansion. For example, when customers want to have direct access to applications sitting in Azure and AWS without going through the data center, we're still replacing some of the upselling in the data center and some of the direct connects they may have bought. So, it's replacement of a bunch of point products into a fewer interior offerings. That's really where the savings come from, that's where the simplicity and operational ease comes from. If I may add, I mean, we look at this as a strategic investment on our part to help customers get started and actually manage your cash for investments in year one by deferring some of that stuff to future years. Yes. So we are still selectively going to hire quota-carrying sales reps as well as core engineering leaders -- sorry, core engineering team members. And we expect our year-end headcount to be higher than the headcount today. Yes. And we are assuming that current levels of these scrutinies will continue. Patrick, as we discussed, we made changes to our enterprise segment, the lower end of commodity segment at the start of the year and where it now reports to geo leaders. Those changes are behind us, they've done Q1, and no bearing on Q2 numbers. Okay? So, the main thing we're seeing at the highest level is some of the macro conditions that are impacting from the higher end larger deals. Our low end of the market segments, enterprise and commercial, they actually had done quite well. They're still impacted. That's right. Yes. I would start on the pricing pressure discount, you talked about, and Remo can get the billing part of it. So due to a tighter macro environment, there is increasing scrutiny and pressure on CISOs this year. Our customers are negotiating order over payment and deal terms. But customers do view us as one of the most mission-critical service. And they want to make sure they buy the service that works, the service they can depend upon. But they're not looking for the cheapest solution. So from their point of view, I would say we aren't seeing tremendous pressure on discounting. We're seeing some focus on it. And to help that, that's where some of the ramp deals come in to help lower the first year cost for the customer to manage their spend. But being strategic, being dealing at the right level and actually delivering a lot of ROI value, reduces pressure on us from a pricing point of view. Remo? Thank you. Our overall adoption of cloud workflows product is pretty good as planned. And as customers are launching more and more workflows, they have two options. Either they extend their corporate network just like a branch network to every cloud region and put virtual firewalls there or they do Zero Trust architecture with Zscaler. So, these products are primarily sold to our customers. Our customers understand the value of it, and that's why they're embracing it. Now the initial deals are smaller, customers are growing, and there are some large deals. But majority of the deals start small and customers start buying into it. They largely end up doing the same thing, just like ZIA for users, ZPA for users, and this is ZIA for workloads, ZPA for workloads. That's where we believe opportunity for us is significant. In terms of go-to-market, all reps are equipped to sell it, but we also understand that there are a bunch of nuanced discussions in this area. So, we do have product specialists. This is not overlay sales team. These product specialist are experts in this area, and they do help in the sales process. And Remo, overall, we are expecting the emerging products, too. Next bake-offs? I'm sorry. Can you expand on last part again? Yes. Our customers are not looking for best-of-breed point products. They're looking for best-of-breed platform with the right architecture. We can tell you if -- when you talk to the low end of the market, they can live with some of the solutions that are kind of half way. But, when you talk about Global 2000, these customers are generally pretty savvy. The requirements are complicated. And we believe the best architecture will win in the long term. I gave you an example this time where a large retailer had gone a different way, thinking that a firewall-based architecture work, tried, failed and came back. I expect to see a lot more customers do the same thing. I think we have ample opportunity in the Global 2000 to take our current penetration to a much, much higher level. So, we aren't really making any special changes to upsell versus new logo. This has been asked to us many times over the years. Do we have a special incentive on new logos? Not really. Our platform is very broad and big. So we really -- we want new logos and we want expansion. And expansion -- we know that expansion means upsell is a little bit easier than new logos. That's why you've seen some of the upsell numbers going up this quarter as compared to new logos down. We keep on making refinements to our go-to-market structure and model from time to time, but there's nothing significant we've done now to make any changes. I think one of the best things is we have a very good sales organization. Our architecture is very good. Our deployments are very good. That's why customers come back and c us. I mean, talking to so many customers, they believe we have the best service, best architecture and best security. That's why we win. And I think we'll keep on driving it. But in today's market, we expect upsell numbers to stay high because it's a bit easier as compared to a new a logo. Oh, sorry. Big product. Yes. So, if you look at almost every Zscaler customer has ZIA. ZPA can be a starting point, but that's not common. But more and more, if customers are starting with ZIA, ZPA, ZDX, but there's still a sizable installed base that has ZIA. Now ZIA, ZPA together in the higher end, they will be close to 60% now. That means so many customers have the ZIA, ZPA both. There's upsell opportunities on ZPA. There's upsell opportunity within bundles. A lot of these customers have bought business, they moved to transformation. From transformation, there's a big opportunity for us to sell data protection. Data protection, especially advanced data protection is very much on the mind of large corporations. And there's a lot of old stuff sitting from Symantec 1, 2 and some of the McAfee stuff. And when you deploy Zscaler, you can't be really sitting with the old school DLP technology. Data protection is a big opportunity for us. If there's one other product I would highlight, it is ZDX. Digital experience is one of the favorite services of CIOs and Head of Networking because when someone is coming from some home, some coffee shop, some hotel, when things are slow, customers struggle to figure out. ZDX has become very sophisticated to help them pinpoint issues and take care of them. User experience is becoming more and more important. And it's this highly, highly differentiated service that we offer. Did I answer your question? Thank you. I'll start, and Remo can add things too. This quarter, EMEA had less dependency on large deals, okay? And as you know, large deals are getting more scrutiny. And U.S. was relatively speaking weaker because they had higher dependency on large deals. Remo, do you want to add any more? And if there's another color I could give you on the market vertical kind of stuff. There are certain verticals that are better than others. As you would expect, the tech vertical was weak in today's market. And some of the retail and on was a little bit slow. For the U.S., that's correct. That's correct. Kind of hard time hearing you, Shaul. So you might -- I think we caught something about maybe hyperscaler and -- perhaps if you could repeat that? Yes. So, let me share with you lots of conversation I have. Customers are embracing cloud, okay? There's no -- somebody is not saying, I want to come back or not embrace the cloud. That's point number one. Point number two, the speed at which these guys are moving forward is slowing down. You can expect because some of these large software development projects are slowing down for cost reasons. Number three, that's actually creating an interesting phenomenon, whereby customers aren't able to use all the spend that's committed. Okay? That's actually giving us at a unit where we are actually partnering more closely with some of these hyperscalers where our deal can be part of that customer commit because we are -- as an approved partner for some of the cloud spend. So, those are some of the things we are seeing. But overall, we do see -- it's rare to find a CIO that says I don't like cloud anymore. Are there complaints about cost in the cloud? Yes. Do they see an alternate to go back to data center? No. Thank you for your continued interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at some of the upcoming conferences. Thank you again."

Nasdaq Investor Conference in London on December 6. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. I am pleased to share our Q1 results. For the quarter, our revenue grew 54% year-over-year and billings grew 37% against a difficult comparison. Normalized for higher billings duration a year ago, billings grew 42% as customers continue to embrace our Zero Trust Exchange platform to secure the digital transformation. Our disciplined approach to growth is enabling our operating profits to grow 76% year-over-year, with operating margins expanding by 150 basis points over the same period. Our free cash flow margin was 27%, which, once again, placed our performance above the Rule-of-80 for the quarter, a combination of growth and profitability that we believe only 1% of the public SaaS companies achieved. As the world's largest security cloud platform, we have outstanding unit economics in our business, reflecting high 90% gross retention rate and over 80% gross margins. These industry-leading retention and margins are possible because of our differentiated service and highly scalable multi-tenant cloud platform. In September, Zscaler celebrated our 15th anniversary. When cloud and mobility were in their infancy, we founded the company with a bold idea to transform security and the corporate network. We started with a clean slate and created the Zscaler multi-tenant in-line cloud platform, establishing modern Zero Trust architecture. This approach is now recommended by NIST, one of the most respected standards bodies in the industry. Our Zero Trust Exchange is built on a unique architecture that securely connects users, devices and applications using business policies, regardless of their location. I could not be more proud of all our accomplishments to date, and I want to thank our employees, customers and partners for being a part of this journey. The vision we started Zscaler with is even more relevant today. Hybrid work and public cloud adoption are now mainstream as organizations. Large and small, are racing to ensure their business operations are agile, resilient and secure. These generational tailwinds are durable and my conviction in our $72 billion serviceable market opportunity is greater than it has ever been. In my conversations with hundreds of IT executives, it is clear that cybersecurity remains their number one priority. Cyber threats, including ransomware and data exfiltration continue to grow exponentially as attackers exploit VPNs and firewalls. This is driving more organizations from firewall and VPN based castle-and-moat security to Zscaler's Zero Trust architecture. To meet this need, we launched a new certification program that provides comprehensive knowledge of Zero Trust architecture and practical guidance for the planning, design and implementation of a Zero Trust architecture, enabling networking and security professionals to lead their organizations secure digital transformation. In today's environment, ROI and cost optimization are becoming bigger priorities as business leaders are being asked to do more with less. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the need for traditional security devices, either as on-prem appliances or virtual machines in the cloud that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost and user experience. Our business value message is resonating in this challenging macro environment and more customers are willing to adopt our broader platform to consolidate multiple point products, increasing our average deal size. As a result, we are actively working on more large, multiyear, multi-pillar opportunities than ever before. To align to the increasing deal sizes in each of our geo theaters, we reorganized our field level customer segmentation and expanded our enterprise segment efforts at the beginning of this fiscal year. When we started in enterprise segment two years ago, it started with one global leader for all geos. As this business has grown, it made sense for us to align this segment under each geo leader for faster decision-making closer to the customer. These changes contributed to a late ramp in the seasonally tougher Q1, but we believe these changes position us to scale to reach our next milestone of $5 billion in ARR and beyond. In Q1, even as we saw additional deal scrutiny and longer reviews on most deals. We grew our base of customers with $1 million or more in ARR by 55% year-over-year, ending the quarter with over 340 of these customers. As I mentioned before, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for users, our complete platform for user protection, which includes ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, bundled together. This accelerates our customers' transformation journey and makes us a critical partner for them. Now let me highlight several such deals. First, pursuing a strategic initiative to modernize the business, our top 10 global banks made a four-year $10 million per year commitment for Zscaler for users driven by cloud adoption, including Microsoft 365 and Zoom. This customer needed a proven and scalable SASE solution to secure thousands of branch offices and hundreds of thousands of employees operating in more than 100 countries. Importantly, we met the requirement to eliminate the risk of legacy VPNs and lateral threat movement, which was a board-level priority. Unlike a VPN in the cloud, Zscaler connect users to specific applications and not to the corporate network, which will significantly improve their security posture, as employees unwittingly bring infected laptops back to the office. Organizations need a true Zero Trust platform to eliminate the risk of lateral threat movement. Next, in an upsell deal, a Global 1000 financial services company in Asia after deploying ZIA for 110,000 users last year, upgraded to Zscaler for users, our entire user protection platform for all 130,000 employees. As a growing company, they are using Zscaler to quickly and cost effectively open new branch offices with secure Internet connectivity, reducing the branch opening costs by 50% compared to legacy firewall-based architecture. Also, ZPA replaces the extensive VDI infrastructure with Zero Trust access. This customer said, and I quote, ZPA provides a far more seamless user experience versus our existing VDI solution. And now we will have visibility to which user is accessing which applications, one of our key security requirements. With this latest seven-figure purchase, this customer's total ARR more than tripled in just over one year. As these two wings illustrate, when these large financial services companies were ready to embrace the cloud, Zscaler was the only platform that met their needs. With security as a major requirement, these financial services companies chose a proxy architecture with ability to inspect TLS traffic at scale and disqualified firewall-based SaaS solutions. We now have eight of the top 10 global banks and seven of the top 10 insurance companies outside of China as our customers. I'm also excited to see more $1 million ACV wins in our Enterprise segment. Let me share a new enterprise customer in the tech sector who bought all four product pillars, ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for 4,000 users and posture control for workloads. Zscaler is enabling this secure digital transformation with direct and seamless access to SaaS and private applications regardless of their location. This supports the remote for strategy, enabling them to close 12 offices and consolidate half a dozen point products. This deal was sourced by a VAR partner and speaks to the progress we are making with the channel. As this win shows, deal sizes in the smaller enterprise segment are growing, as customers adopt our broader platform. Next, we are also executing well on our federal government opportunity, which had a strong quarter. We remain the only cloud security service to have two products at the highest level of FedRAMP certification. These certifications are driving our federal business, as the US government pursues a Zero Trust strategy to enhance the nation's cybersecurity. We had four deals in the Fed vertical that were each over $1 million, all of which included ZIA and ZPA. Our highly differentiated architecture, which connects users to applications and not to the network, eliminating lateral threat movement, was critical to winning these deals. We have now landed 12 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies as customers with plenty of opportunity to upsell at these very large organizations. And as I mentioned, overall demand from customers to consolidate on our platform is growing. Our net retention rate has again exceeded 125%, now for eight consecutive quarters. Happy customers buy more, and our Net Promoter Score continues to exceed 70, which is more than 2 times the average NPS for SaaS companies. We have a 6x upsell opportunity with our existing customers, just for our core ZIA and ZPA product pillars. An important area of continued innovation, I'd like to highlight is data protection. Our comprehensive data protection offering has been gaining traction, as customers are concerned about data leakage with employees working from anywhere. In Q1, we delivered an industry-fast zero configuration data and protection service, leveraging and building on our eight years of innovation in AI and ML. This DLP service provides auto classification of unstructured data to expedite deployments with zero configuration. In addition, we completed the integration of recently acquired ShiftRight workflow automation technology with our data protection solution to enable organizations to manage hundreds of potential risks and incidents in a simple, yet very sophisticated way to significantly reduce case resolution time. Data protection is the first of many areas where we will broadly integrate ShiftRight workflow technology into the Zero Trust Exchange platform. These additional features, combined with previously released Exact Data Match and Indexed Data Match technology makes us the leading data protection platform in the market. Beyond our core products, we are excited about the rapid adoption of our two emerging product pillars; ZDX to manage digital user experience and Zscaler for workloads to secure servers and workloads. New ACV from our workload communication product is growing nearly 100% year-over-year. And our newest deception and C-Net [ph] offerings are seeing strong customer interest. Let me highlight two upsell deals this quarter that were driven by our workload products. A Fortune 500 aerospace customer that is accelerating its AWS and SaaS adoption, purchased the Zscaler for workloads to inspect one petabyte of PLS encrypted workload and IoT traffic per month, resulting in better security. This customer purchased our ZIA Transformation Bundle for 115,000 users two years ago as they've already committed to our Zero Trust architecture. It was seamless for them to add workload protection, which is built on the same core Zero Trust Exchange. This seven-figure ACV workload deal more than doubles the customer's annual spend with us. In another upsell win, a longtime customer upgraded and expanded their purchase to ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for 12,000 users and also added Zscaler for workloads to accelerate the application migration to Azure. Zscaler for workloads now represents one-third of this customers $1 million-plus annual spend with us. As these customer wins illustrate our proven track record, running the world's largest in-line security cloud makes Zscaler the obvious and trusted partner of choice. Our Zero Trust Exchange processes over 270 billion transactions in line and prevents more than seven billion security and policy violations per day, providing our customers an unmatched network effect for superior security. Our demonstrated ability to scale our cloud platform becomes even more important as we address hundreds of millions of workloads and billions of OT and IoT devices. In closing, while there are broader macro challenges and economic uncertainties, we are seeing an increase in large multi-year commitments for multiple product pillars. As I mentioned earlier, as deal sizes have increased, we have adapted our field level customer segmentation to better serve our customers and to deliver more consistent execution. Our consultative sales process enables our account teams to quantify the business value of our platform to remain close to the customers, especially at the C level, and to get deals across the line. I believe periods of uncertainty can act as a catalyst for change. Customers are engaging with us to embrace zero trust architecture, consolidate point products, simplify IT and standardize on the Zscaler platform, all of which delivers better security and lower cost. CIOs are telling me that they are using this challenging environment to drive change and to eliminate the technical debt of legacy point products, which are expensive to buy and operate. Customers are increasingly turning to Zscaler in today's challenging environment, while overall IT budgets are tightening, we believe that security budgets remain more resilient. We are bringing more innovations to customers than ever before, while scaling our customer support and go-to-market organization. We believe we are still in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to enable secure digital transformation and achieve our $5 billion ARR goal. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Our Q1 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability even as we manage through additional deal scrutiny and longer reviews. Revenue was $356 million, up 54% year-over-year, and up 12% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 19% of total revenue, growing 78% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 52% of revenue, EMEA was 33% and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q1 grew 37% year-over-year to $340 million against a difficult comparison. As we expected, billings duration was a headwind to growth this quarter. Our Q1 billings duration was above the midpoint of our normal 10 to 14 months range, but was below last year's higher levels. We estimate that duration negatively impacted our billings growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Normalized for this higher duration, our billings grew 42% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 57% from one year ago to $2.682 billion. The current RPO is 50% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which is once again above 125%. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. At the end of Q1, we had 348 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 55% from 224 in the prior year. The continued strength of this metric speaks to our large enterprise focus and the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added 128 customers in the quarter, paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the quarter at 2,217 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance. Total gross margin of 81.4% was up nearly 85 basis points year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 12% sequentially and 53% year-over-year to $247 million, primarily due to higher compensation expenses from a very successful hiring quarter. Operating margin was 12% and free cash flow margin was 27%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around the high single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.82 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Before providing our guidance, I'd like to share a few observations about the current business environment. Demand for the Zscaler platform remains strong. Across our key customer segments, we're seeing deals getting larger as customers are trying to consolidate more and accelerate their security transformation around our Zero Trust exchange. Customers are expanding their commitments with us, from a targeted use case to a much broader platform-centric approach. In our opportunity pipeline, we're actively working on more multi-year and multi-pillar opportunities than we historically have. While good for our business, larger deals take longer to close, as customers introduce more checks and reviews. In this environment, we think it's prudent to expect a higher level of review and scrutiny by our customers to continue. We'll continue to balance growth and profitability, based on how our business is growing. In our outlook for fiscal 2023, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of more than 150 basis points, which is an increase from our prior guidance. Now moving to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes and amortization of intangible assets. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $364 million to $366 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 42% to 43%. Gross margins of approximately 80%, operating profit in the range of $42 million to $43 million, net other income of $8 million, income taxes of $4.5 million. Earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.30, assuming 156 million fully diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard which requires the use of the if-converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes, you will need to add back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense and includes 7.6 million shares to the fully diluted share count. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.525 billion to $1.53 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 40%, calculated billings in the range of $1.93 billion to $1.94 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 30% to 31%. We expect our first half mix of billings to be approximately 43% of our full year billings guide. Operating profit in the range of $179 million to $183 million. Our guidance reflects 150 to 180 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year, while growing revenue at 40%; income taxes of $19 million, earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.25, assuming approximately 157 million fully diluted shares. As noted earlier, to account for our convertible notes in EPS, you'll need to add back $1.4 million in annual interest expense and include 7. 6 million shares to the fully diluted share count. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our tremendous growth opportunity, while increasing profitability. We continue to see a robust pipeline and are prioritizing our investments in innovation and selling capacity while also being thoughtful and prudent in managing our overall cost structure. The recurring nature of our business model gives us good visibility on top line revenue and allows us to adapt quickly to changes in the market conditions while delivering on our operating profit and margin goals. As we have discussed, if we're growing revenue faster than 30%, you can expect less than 300 basis points of margin expansion in the year. We remain confident of reaching 20% to 22% operating margins in the long-term with a huge market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll continue our disciplined approach to managing our business to maximize value for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks for the taking the question guys. Maybe just a question on the sales segment reorg. It seems like a really good thing to achieve these longer term goals. Maybe just a little bit deeper understanding of what that looks like. And also, I think, Jay, you may have mentioned that there was maybe a slight impact to Q1 billings as a result of that. Wondering if that was the case and if there's any way to quantify that?\nJay Chaudhry: Of course, Matt. As you know, we start to pursue smaller enterprise segment a couple of years ago. At that time, we put the enterprise sales team under a global leader who directly reported to our CRO. As this segment has nicely grown, it was the right time for us to move it in geo teams under geo leaders. So that was one change. The second, we made changes where accounts got redistributed among our four market segments at the field level, as you know, we've got major, we've got large Enterprise and Commercial. And this contributed to a late ramp in a seasonally tougher Q1 but these changes are done, and we're already seeing better results, better pipeline, and we think this is the right thing for us to do to grow to our big target of $5 billion ARR.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you very much. First off, I'd like to complement your outstanding execution in what is obviously a toughening environment. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of context of what's going on in the lower end of the marketplace for you. I know you don't do much in the SMB space, but that's obviously been an area that a lot of other companies have seen challenges. I was wondering if you were seeing any issues in what you call your smaller business segments. Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. Alex, overall, I mean I think all segments were impacted in the quarter. I think the macro environment, as you mentioned is that all companies are basically feeling the macro impact. The enterprise segment change that we made also impacted basically results in the quarter. On the lower end, we're doing okay, but it did impact all segments. I think it's more driven by macro than anything else.\nJay Chaudhry: But Remo, the low end wasn't more impacted than others, so.\nRemo Canessa : Yes. No, low ended a little bit better than the upper end.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you very much for the question and congrats on nice -- another nice quarter. I guess, I just want to ask a question on the billings guidance. Maybe a little bit less of a raise than you've done historically. I'm wondering, number one, did you factor in a change in duration, or what kind of duration assumptions do you make with regard to your billings? And then did you add any extra levels of conservatism into that guide given the macro backdrop? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : Yes. The billing guide for Q2, the duration is similar to last year. It's slightly above the midpoint. One thing to call out for fiscal 2023, Q3 is going to have headwinds, because in Q3 of last year, the duration was longer. Related to the conservatism, related to our billing guide, it's really related to what we saw happening in Q1. So what we saw happening in Q1, we're taking forward into Q2 and for the rest of the year. What we're seeing basically is elongation of sales cycles. As we talked about and Jay mentioned on the prepared remarks, our deal size is getting bigger. Customers are buying more of our platform. It's more of a platform sale, all good. Our pipeline is increasing. Our pipeline is increasing five regions. Each region pipeline is increasing. But whereas before for the larger deals, we talked about, it was nine to 12-month sales cycle. It was trending down into more than nine months, now it's trending up more into the 12-month type range. So, all those things basically were taking into consideration with our guidance.\nJay Chaudhry: Remo, if I may add. The strong pipeline in Q2 is what we feel pretty good about. But we do know that there's a closing time factor we are factoring in.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from Joel Fishbein of Truist. Your line is open.\nJoel Fishbein : Thanks for taking my question. Jay, just wanted to follow-up on your comments about the Fed space. Obviously, being the only one that has FedRAMP high. I'd love to understand how you are positioned there competitively, how long the tail is on some of those deals as the government undergoes some of these security transformation projects. Just a lot more color around that. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: The Fed business was quite good for us. We have been building on it. We are investing on it. That's where it has taken us to all these certifications. The impact of macro is less on the federal business. It has its own budget cycle goes through its own process. We now have landed 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies and we're helping them, and they all start actually at a fairly small level and they have been growing at a pretty decent pace. And so it's an early stage. Though last quarter, we did have sizable $46 million project, which actually gets billed on a periodic basis. So feel very good and strong about the Federal business, but Federal takes its own time in closing some of these deals.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi, guys. Good evening and thank you for taking my question. Maybe for Jay or Remo, feel free to chime in. So, obviously, macro is impacting every company. So that's clear. I think on the other hand, Zscaler did have the chance to, kind of, give a full year guide back in September. And it seemed like at that point, a lot of your outlook seemed derisked for what we're growing macro concerns at that time. So is it really these sales force changes that's driving that perhaps somewhat incremental headwind that you're talking about? And are we talking about a full-on sales reorg, or is it just some tweaks that are being made to help you align better to your long-term growth opportunities. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll start. I think it's both the macro basically things that we're seeing. For the full year guide that we had at beginning of the year, we had $1.2 billion -- $1.92 billion of billings growth up to $1.94 billion. The billings growth that we've revised it to was $1.93 billion up to $1.94 billion. So the midpoint has increased. Macro is playing into it. And what we've talked about is that, if there's uncertainty related to the macro, and that's why we gave the guide that we did and we tried to derisk basically our guide, but it's both, it's really primarily the macro and also somewhat the changes. But as Jay mentioned, the changes are pretty much behind us and things were looking very positive.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So, if I may add, first of all, it was not a full reorganization. As I said, we have four segments. And as our deals are getting bigger, some of these deals that sat in lower segments, they're getting bigger. They need to be handled by the upper segment and so on and so forth. So realigning the segment was good for us to optimize the deal size and who should be working on them. It's that. And the second was, this lower enterprise team, which used to report to the CRO directly, now is linked to geos. So they're not massive changes, but they are more than normal that we typically have done. But none of these deals are going away. We are well positioned. We're winning some already. We are working on more. So -- and as I said, the pipeline, as a result of some of these changes made, is growing. And I feel very good and comfortable about it.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. One other point. Really, when you take a look at the amount of accounts that shifted, it was a pretty substantial amount of accounts that shifted, into the various segments. So, again, as we mentioned, as Jay mentioned before, we feel largely that is taken care of. Could there be some impact going forward, there is. But again, from our perspective, it's largely macro.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please, make sure your phone is on unmute.\nTal Liani: Here you go. Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Loud and clear.\nTal Liani: Perfect. Thank you. I have two related questions. The first one is Prisma -- Palo Alto Prisma had much better-than-expected results on the same kind of like-to-like. And the question is, do you see any changes in the competitive landscape? Do you see any changes in the pricing dynamics and aggressiveness of other players that might drive some of the changes we're seeing? And the second question is, I want to understand the bigger picture. If someone asked me a year ago what could be the impact of economic slowdown, I would say that this particular area where you're acting should not be impacted much because you're replacing CapEx with OpEx, and you're actually enabling the change to customers without putting out tremendous CapEx upfront. So if they are budget issues, they should actually do it. And the question is, why are we seeing this area impacted as well despite the fact that it enables companies to lower their spending if they need to?\nJay Chaudhry: Yeah. So okay, I'll start. Your first question about competition and pricing dynamics, I'll tell you on the higher end of the large enterprise segment, we haven't really seen much competitive changes at all. These large enterprises aren't savvy. They look for the right architecture. They take this thing very seriously. And almost all these large deals, when firewall companies have tried to come in and compete, they're often excluded. I mentioned some of them during the call. So I do wonder where do those deals come from, because if you ask me some of my largest deals, if you took top x-deals, we aren't really competing with the firewall companies out there. Price dynamics will matter if you really are competing. That's number one. But also number two, the service we're selling is very mission critical. In fact, it's probably more mission critical than Office 365. That's what I hear from CIOs, because we are on the switchboard. We are connecting everything to everything. So we have not seen pricing pressure from competitive side of it. We have been told a few times that the customer said, yes, this vendor came and offered us a third, the core price, but we decided we are not serious about it because it doesn't meet the requirements. Your second part of the question was impact of economic slowdown. It is very true that the area we are playing in really does two things for customers. One, it's important cyber area. Number two, with consolidation, simplification and standardization, customers do save money. So those are the two things that are helping us a lot more than many other market segments. But when the broader macro is there's, obviously, some impact but I would say, relatively speaking, it is far less than other areas. As I had talked to many CIOs and CXOs, they don't see securely budget getting reduced much. As compared to IT budgets, we are in a much better shape, but there is impact. And sorry, and one part of the impact is these large deals are going more and more through CFOs and CEOs for approval.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from John DiFucci of Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. So guys, this macro slowdown is much different than the last one we saw due to COVID, where Zscaler benefited from more distributed access. So as we look out into fiscal 2023 and beyond, as we layer in the soft and perhaps softening, further softening macro backdrop, how should we expect the appetite for new customers to undergo a transformation of their security paradigms?\nJay Chaudhry : Yes. That's a good question. You're basically saying, will new customers start transformation projects? It depends upon what kind of projects you're looking at. CIOs are prioritizing projects must do versus projects that can wait. That's one part. But if you look at what we do, where we fit, okay. Cyber is not going away. The risk of cyber is still there. It is a Board-level discussion. It's happening. Number two, there is pressure on cost consolidation and simplification. Yes, while customers won't start big new projects, but projects that can be done without big investments, and they are being done. If you look at the total IT budget of a CIO and the security is a fairly small part of it. By engaging at the CIO level, we are actually able to get a fair share of the budget. So I think we feel pretty good about fiscal 2023. Having said that, will there be a bigger hurdle to cross to close those deals? Absolutely, yes. But to do so, you need two things: one, you need CIO, CXO level engagement, which we have traditionally done; two, you need better business justification to make a strong case CFO that it makes sense. And we have been doing that for quite a while, and now the number of assessments, value assessment we're doing is actually much higher than it used to be.\nRemo Canessa : Yes. A couple of comments, John. So our split with new and upsell in Q1 was approximately 50-50. Now Q1 was driven, Jay talked about on the call, Federal calls. We had large Federal deals. And also we did well in the financial sector with new accounts. So that's on a go-forward basis, I still think for fiscal 2023, as I mentioned before, probably the 40-60 range is probably the right way to think of things 40% new, 60% upsell. But we shouldn't lose track to how big this market is. I mean this market from both user and workload, we estimate that two years ago to be $72 billion, that's clearly bigger now. I mean it's growing. And you look at the penetration that we have in this market as well as others, we're in the very early stages built, so as you go through this global economic macro environment, it's going to work itself -- through and we're in a position now that the macro environment is not favorable, but it will turn, it will turn. The advantage of Zscaler is that from a cost perspective, security perspective and user experience, it is a top platform we feel in the world for networking and security. So again, we need to kind of way through this macro environment, keep on executing, and we feel things will take care of themselves.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd of UBS. Your line is open.\nRoger Boyd : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I think you gave the contribution of emerging products to new business, and forgive me if you did, but it sounded like you did have some nice wins in the quarter there with ZDX and Zscaler for workloads. So I'm wondering if you can just update us on how you're thinking about upselling these solutions in the current environment relative to your guide last quarter for, call it, high teens percent of the new business. Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. Hey, Roger, they're tracking still to the high teens. So they're doing well. ZDX and our cloud protection products are tracking in the high teens for the year.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. If I may add, ZDX has been our fastest-growing service. It has grown faster than ZPA, if you look at a similar time line or similar stages. And the cloud protection has two main areas. One is, what we call, CNAPP, its API-based security, that's a posture control product. And second is, Zero Trust in workloads for in-line security, and we are the only vendor who has done tight integration between the two. And our actually customer interest has been pretty strong. Our new ACV nearly doubled year-over-year for our Zero Trust for workloads. I talked about a couple of deals, large deals during the earnings thing. One was a seven-figure ACV workload deal. It more than doubled customers' annual spend with us. That's significant. Another deal I mentioned, workloads now represent one-third of this customers are $1 million annual cost spend with us. So these things, which used to be fairly small three, four quarters ago, are beginning to get pretty significant.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from\u2026\nUnidentified Speaker: Nice conversation. And if so, is it fair to assume that in the first -- hi, can you hear me guys?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes.\nUnidentified Speaker: Hey. So just a quick question. You talked about the pipeline growing. Just wondering, is the coverage ratio growing at a significant enough level to offset the elongation in sales cycles. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: We take that all into account in our guidance. So it's all been taken into account in our guidance. And -- so, yes, it's been taken into account.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Either for Jay or Remo, please chime in. I appreciate a lot of the commentary you shared around the opportunity that you have with large multi-year, multi-pillar deals, the pipeline composition for those types of transaction is increasing, but against a much, much tougher environment. So there's a little bit of a dichotomy there, and I wanted to peel that back a little bit, because if your business and execution and pipeline is that much more reliant on some of these larger deals and the environment is admittedly harder to execute in. What are some of the things that you are doing and that you have under your control to make sure that we don't see the type of slippage that could cause some more variability into your building performance? And just as a related matter, are you changing incentive to ensure you're driving that type of behavior and successful close rates on those large transactions, which, it seems like you're becoming more dependent on. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Right. Fatima, yes, multi-year, multi-pillar deals, those pipelines are growing. And, yes, tougher environment with more scrutiny and more approval levels, that's what we're seeing. So there are two significant trends that we have been doing that are helping us to make sure we're able to get those deals closed. One is customers look for better business justification. That's what I mentioned on CFO-ready business cases, business value assessment, which we do to help quantify them. If you remove these eight-point security and networking products, this is the ROI you can get. And in fact, we're showing more than 200% ROI in many most majority of our cases. That's very strong. It's -- we've done it. We're doing a better job in that area. The second thing to get deals done in a tougher environment is having strong C-level engagements, because you're going to make a case there to show what needs to be done. And also, if you're part of the CIO's budget rather than just security budget, you actually have a better chance of doing it. Both of those things are helping us, and we are keeping those factors in mind as we are providing you our forecast.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. And from an incentive perspective, I wouldn't say we're doing anything out of the ordinary that we've done in any quarter. So no real changes from an incentive perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley of Canaccord. Your line is open.\nMike Walkley: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe following up on that last answer. As you work with closing these larger deals, are these larger customers may be slowing their pace deployment to help their own OpEx in terms of how they're ramping deals, or once you close them, they're ramping similar to prior experiences?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So it is an interesting dynamic in the market. Market is tougher. But when CIOs look at what needs to be done, they look for consolidation, simplification that's driving our deals to get bigger. Bigger deals mean more scrutiny. Now and -- but we are helping our customers to ramp into larger commitments to deploy our platform. So it is a phased thing we are doing. So we are -- we have been doing that for a few quarters, and it does continue.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. So we're not seeing any increased ramping. It's always been part of our business. We've called it out. I mean, you look at the type of deployments we have with hundreds of thousands of users, you can't do that overnight. So again, we're not seeing any increased ramping, and it's been part of our business for a long time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey, thanks guys for squeezing me in here. I just have two quick ones. First one goes back to Andrew's question. I just want to ask it a little differently. If 2Q has normal duration comps, is there any reason we shouldn't expect that billings growth should return to this 40-plus range that you saw in Q1 after adjusting for the duration? And my second question is, if you look at the deferred revenue, it did decline sequentially from 4Q to 1Q for the first time in a while? So just anything unusual to call out there.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. I mean, you've got our guidance. So we feel comfortable with it and how we're going to come in. We'll see at the end of the quarter. Related to the decline in deferred revenue Q4 to Q1, again, there's seasonality to our business. So the growth rates from Q4 to Q1 have been very small. It declined slightly this quarter. Nothing really to call out other than seasonality and our performance in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Levine of Evercore. Your line is open.\nPeter Levine : Great. Thank you for squeezing me here. So maybe one just to kind of repeat, I think, on an earlier question from John, could you talk about what you're seeing at the top of the funnel meeting? Given we are kind of closer to the tail end of the COVID work-from-home wave of deals that you saw, could we -- is there a risk of a drop off in the pipelines or hit to net new billings, obviously, given the backdrop here, but it sounds like 2Q pipeline seems strong, but any color you can add to that?\nJay Chaudhry : Yes. The Q2 pipeline is strong. It is a record pipeline. We did get some benefit of COVID, but that was starting in March of 2020 and most CIOs had to do something in a quarter or two of that. So most of the effect of COVID actually ended by mid of 2020. So since then, it is kind of growth of our business driven by the need for security, transformation, digital transformation and the like. I think we have been doing good pipe funnel. It is true that some of the changes we made in start of Q1 did kind of cause some slowdown for us. We are past that. It's a good pipeline. And the question is how much -- how well do we overcome the scrutiny and extra level approvals to land the deals we need to land. And that's what we are working on. That's really part of our job, but good strong pipeline. Remo, you want to add anything? Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman : Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask Remo a question, and there's two parts to it. Remo has been talked about the billings beat this quarter was one of the smallest in many years, and you're moving the midpoint up, but the top end of the billings guide is remaining the same. The macro has gotten tougher. Last quarter, I think a lot of us jumped off the call and said, it seems like Zscalers derisk the numbers. But given all that backdrop, it just seems like there's been incremental risk introduced to the billings and just wondered if you'd characterize I'd like to respond to that. And the second part of the question is you're raising op income by about $6 million from the previous guidance. And yet it seems like, how would you respond to -- why not raise it more if in fact, the growth isn't accelerating and you kind of keep the billing range to saying, why not give a little bit more on the op income side? That's it for me. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : Yes. I mean, great questions, Keith. If the macro environment has changed. I mean, we talked about the uncertainty going into calendar 2023. There's a lot of uncertainty in -- mean, you're seeing all the earnings reports coming out or most of the earnings reports. And we're all seeing the same thing. It's the macro backdrop, which is the primary reason. As I mentioned, secondarily, is the enterprise segment change, but that's a lot less. So the macro environment has changed. That's number one. Related to getting more operating profitability, as I mentioned, with our contribution margin as high as it is in years two and three, it's over 60%, getting to operating profitability is the easy thing, but I believe it's short changing, the company and our shareholders. It's -- if you look at our free cash flow margin, you look at our profitability, we are increasing our operating profitability, we're going to be prudent and disciplined related to our approach in how we're going to run the business. The key thing is -- and the size of this market, and its early stage. Our priority is growth. And -- but we will -- as we go forward, as you've seen, a slight increase in operating profitability, we're more focused on operating profitability than we have been in the past. But it's going to be a measured approach from our perspective. It will be measured in what we feel is the right balance and really true on our business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Shrenik Kothari of R.W. Baird. Your line is open.\nShrenik Kothari: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Either for Jay or Remo, just chime in. You spoke about Federal vertical, call our friends in financial services, vertical clearly, our top 10 global banks for your $10 million commitment. So, broadly, we'll be hearing, thinking in some verticals, to tech or CPG retail kind of getting impacted more than others, including public sector to science, utilities, more solid. Is that something that you guys are observing in terms of bifurcation or divergence in sectors there? Is there a guidance now building into itself a potential accelerator of macro into so far less of factored verticals, yes?\nRemo Canessa: I'll speak specifically about the verticals. Jay, if you'd like to add more comments, please do. In Q1, the verticals that we saw do well for us were financial, federal services and healthcare. Those are the strong verticals for us. Have we taken into account the impact of verticals going forward? The answer is yes, not specifically per vertical, but current customer and where that deal is, in the deal cycle. So it is being taken into account. But speaking to other verticals, maybe, Jay would like to comment more on that.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. I think, even though we did well in some of the verticals Remo pointed out, I'm not sure overall vertical is a big, big factor. Macro is impacting broadly, but there are certain verticals that have less, for example, in oil and gas, doing differently than many of others. But I won't say it's a big factor for us. It is a factor, but not a major effect.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open. Please, make sure your phone is unmute. Our next question is from -- okay\nSaket Kalia: Sorry. I'm so sorry. I was on mute there. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. A lot of my questions have been asked. Jay, maybe for you, just a little bit of a broader one. Clearly, the fiscal year for Zscaler is very different, but -- than a calendar year. But a lot of your customers operate on December fiscal years. Maybe the question for you is, what have you heard anecdotally, just on the prospect of budget flush this year from your customers? Is that something that you think is going to be more muted for security this year, or is it more related to timing? Any perspective that you have there would be helpful.\nJay Chaudhry: Look, as you have seen in the past few quarters, deals are getting more and more back-end loaded. We saw that a few quarters ago. We saw it in Q1. We think we will have a linearity thing, similar to Q1, maybe a little bit better than Q1. But I don't think that December will significantly change everything out there. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean from -- could there be a positive impact related to 12/31 December, there could be. From a linearity perspective, low socket, I would be thinking something similar that we've had basically in Q4 and Q1, which is more back-end loaded. But can it happen? It can, but I would be thinking more of a similar type of linearity.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just two quick ones just on the Federal space. Not sure if I missed it, but what was the mix that the Fed business represented in the quarter? And when you think about the opportunity, it's great to hear those wins, is it really just on ZIA and ZPA, or what's the opportunity for ZDX and Zscaler for workloads in the Federal space? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: I'll start at the broad level for a month, and you can get into specifics. Yes. Federal is most of the stuff in place is ZIA and ZPA, but it's building strong interest on ZDX and some of the newer products. But currently, it's a strong mix of ZIA and ZPA.\nRemo Canessa: Yeah. From -- as Jay mentioned, 12 of the 15 cabinet agencies, four deals greater than $1 million, it's clearly a good quarter for us for Federal. We'll beginning how Federal is doing on an annual basis on a new and upsell perspective. So -- but Federal was a strong, good quarter for us in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and one, this does conclude our conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay Chaudhry for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor events. Thank you, and goodbye.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Our Q1 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability even as we manage through additional deal scrutiny and longer reviews. Revenue was $356 million, up 54% year-over-year, and up 12% sequentially. ZPA product revenue was approximately 19% of total revenue, growing 78% year-over-year. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 52% of revenue, EMEA was 33% and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q1 grew 37% year-over-year to $340 million against a difficult comparison. As we expected, billings duration was a headwind to growth this quarter. Our Q1 billings duration was above the midpoint of our normal 10 to 14 months range, but was below last year's higher levels. We estimate that duration negatively impacted our billings growth by approximately 5 percentage points. Normalized for this higher duration, our billings grew 42% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 57% from one year ago to $2.682 billion. The current RPO is 50% of the total RPO. Our strong customer retention rate and our ability to upsell the broader platform have resulted in a high dollar-based net retention rate, which is once again above 125%. We have a strong base of large enterprise customers, which provides us with a significant opportunity to upsell our broader platform. At the end of Q1, we had 348 customers paying us more than $1 million annually, up 55% from 224 in the prior year. The continued strength of this metric speaks to our large enterprise focus and the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We added 128 customers in the quarter, paying us more than $100,000 annually, ending the quarter at 2,217 such customers. Turning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance. Total gross margin of 81.4% was up nearly 85 basis points year-over-year. Our total operating expenses increased 12% sequentially and 53% year-over-year to $247 million, primarily due to higher compensation expenses from a very successful hiring quarter. Operating margin was 12% and free cash flow margin was 27%. We continue to expect data center CapEx to be around the high single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year. We ended the quarter with over $1.82 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Before providing our guidance, I'd like to share a few observations about the current business environment. Demand for the Zscaler platform remains strong. Across our key customer segments, we're seeing deals getting larger as customers are trying to consolidate more and accelerate their security transformation around our Zero Trust exchange. Customers are expanding their commitments with us, from a targeted use case to a much broader platform-centric approach. In our opportunity pipeline, we're actively working on more multi-year and multi-pillar opportunities than we historically have. While good for our business, larger deals take longer to close, as customers introduce more checks and reviews. In this environment, we think it's prudent to expect a higher level of review and scrutiny by our customers to continue. We'll continue to balance growth and profitability, based on how our business is growing. In our outlook for fiscal 2023, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of more than 150 basis points, which is an increase from our prior guidance. Now moving to guidance and modeling points. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes and amortization of intangible assets. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $364 million to $366 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 42% to 43%. Gross margins of approximately 80%, operating profit in the range of $42 million to $43 million, net other income of $8 million, income taxes of $4.5 million. Earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.30, assuming 156 million fully diluted shares. Please note that starting in fiscal 2023, we adopted the new accounting standard which requires the use of the if-converted method for calculating EPS. To account for our convertible notes, you will need to add back $360,000 in quarterly interest expense and includes 7.6 million shares to the fully diluted share count. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.525 billion to $1.53 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 40%, calculated billings in the range of $1.93 billion to $1.94 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 30% to 31%. We expect our first half mix of billings to be approximately 43% of our full year billings guide. Operating profit in the range of $179 million to $183 million. Our guidance reflects 150 to 180 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year, while growing revenue at 40%; income taxes of $19 million, earnings per share in the range of $1.23 to $1.25, assuming approximately 157 million fully diluted shares. As noted earlier, to account for our convertible notes in EPS, you'll need to add back $1.4 million in annual interest expense and include 7. 6 million shares to the fully diluted share count. Let me conclude with comments on our investment framework. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our tremendous growth opportunity, while increasing profitability. We continue to see a robust pipeline and are prioritizing our investments in innovation and selling capacity while also being thoughtful and prudent in managing our overall cost structure. The recurring nature of our business model gives us good visibility on top line revenue and allows us to adapt quickly to changes in the market conditions while delivering on our operating profit and margin goals. As we have discussed, if we're growing revenue faster than 30%, you can expect less than 300 basis points of margin expansion in the year. We remain confident of reaching 20% to 22% operating margins in the long-term with a huge market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we'll continue our disciplined approach to managing our business to maximize value for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes. Alex, overall, I mean I think all segments were impacted in the quarter. I think the macro environment, as you mentioned is that all companies are basically feeling the macro impact. The enterprise segment change that we made also impacted basically results in the quarter. On the lower end, we're doing okay, but it did impact all segments. I think it's more driven by macro than anything else. Yes. No, low ended a little bit better than the upper end. Yes. The billing guide for Q2, the duration is similar to last year. It's slightly above the midpoint. One thing to call out for fiscal 2023, Q3 is going to have headwinds, because in Q3 of last year, the duration was longer. Related to the conservatism, related to our billing guide, it's really related to what we saw happening in Q1. So what we saw happening in Q1, we're taking forward into Q2 and for the rest of the year. What we're seeing basically is elongation of sales cycles. As we talked about and Jay mentioned on the prepared remarks, our deal size is getting bigger. Customers are buying more of our platform. It's more of a platform sale, all good. Our pipeline is increasing. Our pipeline is increasing five regions. Each region pipeline is increasing. But whereas before for the larger deals, we talked about, it was nine to 12-month sales cycle. It was trending down into more than nine months, now it's trending up more into the 12-month type range. So, all those things basically were taking into consideration with our guidance. Yes. I'll start. I think it's both the macro basically things that we're seeing. For the full year guide that we had at beginning of the year, we had $1.2 billion -- $1.92 billion of billings growth up to $1.94 billion. The billings growth that we've revised it to was $1.93 billion up to $1.94 billion. So the midpoint has increased. Macro is playing into it. And what we've talked about is that, if there's uncertainty related to the macro, and that's why we gave the guide that we did and we tried to derisk basically our guide, but it's both, it's really primarily the macro and also somewhat the changes. But as Jay mentioned, the changes are pretty much behind us and things were looking very positive. Yes. One other point. Really, when you take a look at the amount of accounts that shifted, it was a pretty substantial amount of accounts that shifted, into the various segments. So, again, as we mentioned, as Jay mentioned before, we feel largely that is taken care of. Could there be some impact going forward, there is. But again, from our perspective, it's largely macro. Yes. A couple of comments, John. So our split with new and upsell in Q1 was approximately 50-50. Now Q1 was driven, Jay talked about on the call, Federal calls. We had large Federal deals. And also we did well in the financial sector with new accounts. So that's on a go-forward basis, I still think for fiscal 2023, as I mentioned before, probably the 40-60 range is probably the right way to think of things 40% new, 60% upsell. But we shouldn't lose track to how big this market is. I mean this market from both user and workload, we estimate that two years ago to be $72 billion, that's clearly bigger now. I mean it's growing. And you look at the penetration that we have in this market as well as others, we're in the very early stages built, so as you go through this global economic macro environment, it's going to work itself -- through and we're in a position now that the macro environment is not favorable, but it will turn, it will turn. The advantage of Zscaler is that from a cost perspective, security perspective and user experience, it is a top platform we feel in the world for networking and security. So again, we need to kind of way through this macro environment, keep on executing, and we feel things will take care of themselves. Yes. Hey, Roger, they're tracking still to the high teens. So they're doing well. ZDX and our cloud protection products are tracking in the high teens for the year. We take that all into account in our guidance. So it's all been taken into account in our guidance. And -- so, yes, it's been taken into account. Yeah. And from an incentive perspective, I wouldn't say we're doing anything out of the ordinary that we've done in any quarter. So no real changes from an incentive perspective. Yeah. So we're not seeing any increased ramping. It's always been part of our business. We've called it out. I mean, you look at the type of deployments we have with hundreds of thousands of users, you can't do that overnight. So again, we're not seeing any increased ramping, and it's been part of our business for a long time. Yeah. I mean, you've got our guidance. So we feel comfortable with it and how we're going to come in. We'll see at the end of the quarter. Related to the decline in deferred revenue Q4 to Q1, again, there's seasonality to our business. So the growth rates from Q4 to Q1 have been very small. It declined slightly this quarter. Nothing really to call out other than seasonality and our performance in the quarter. Yes. I mean, great questions, Keith. If the macro environment has changed. I mean, we talked about the uncertainty going into calendar 2023. There's a lot of uncertainty in -- mean, you're seeing all the earnings reports coming out or most of the earnings reports. And we're all seeing the same thing. It's the macro backdrop, which is the primary reason. As I mentioned, secondarily, is the enterprise segment change, but that's a lot less. So the macro environment has changed. That's number one. Related to getting more operating profitability, as I mentioned, with our contribution margin as high as it is in years two and three, it's over 60%, getting to operating profitability is the easy thing, but I believe it's short changing, the company and our shareholders. It's -- if you look at our free cash flow margin, you look at our profitability, we are increasing our operating profitability, we're going to be prudent and disciplined related to our approach in how we're going to run the business. The key thing is -- and the size of this market, and its early stage. Our priority is growth. And -- but we will -- as we go forward, as you've seen, a slight increase in operating profitability, we're more focused on operating profitability than we have been in the past. But it's going to be a measured approach from our perspective. It will be measured in what we feel is the right balance and really true on our business. I'll speak specifically about the verticals. Jay, if you'd like to add more comments, please do. In Q1, the verticals that we saw do well for us were financial, federal services and healthcare. Those are the strong verticals for us. Have we taken into account the impact of verticals going forward? The answer is yes, not specifically per vertical, but current customer and where that deal is, in the deal cycle. So it is being taken into account. But speaking to other verticals, maybe, Jay would like to comment more on that. Yes. I mean from -- could there be a positive impact related to 12/31 December, there could be. From a linearity perspective, low socket, I would be thinking something similar that we've had basically in Q4 and Q1, which is more back-end loaded. But can it happen? It can, but I would be thinking more of a similar type of linearity. Yeah. From -- as Jay mentioned, 12 of the 15 cabinet agencies, four deals greater than $1 million, it's clearly a good quarter for us for Federal. We'll beginning how Federal is doing on an annual basis on a new and upsell perspective. So -- but Federal was a strong, good quarter for us in Q1. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. I am pleased to share our Q1 results. For the quarter, our revenue grew 54% year-over-year and billings grew 37% against a difficult comparison. Normalized for higher billings duration a year ago, billings grew 42% as customers continue to embrace our Zero Trust Exchange platform to secure the digital transformation. Our disciplined approach to growth is enabling our operating profits to grow 76% year-over-year, with operating margins expanding by 150 basis points over the same period. Our free cash flow margin was 27%, which, once again, placed our performance above the Rule-of-80 for the quarter, a combination of growth and profitability that we believe only 1% of the public SaaS companies achieved. As the world's largest security cloud platform, we have outstanding unit economics in our business, reflecting high 90% gross retention rate and over 80% gross margins. These industry-leading retention and margins are possible because of our differentiated service and highly scalable multi-tenant cloud platform. In September, Zscaler celebrated our 15th anniversary. When cloud and mobility were in their infancy, we founded the company with a bold idea to transform security and the corporate network. We started with a clean slate and created the Zscaler multi-tenant in-line cloud platform, establishing modern Zero Trust architecture. This approach is now recommended by NIST, one of the most respected standards bodies in the industry. Our Zero Trust Exchange is built on a unique architecture that securely connects users, devices and applications using business policies, regardless of their location. I could not be more proud of all our accomplishments to date, and I want to thank our employees, customers and partners for being a part of this journey. The vision we started Zscaler with is even more relevant today. Hybrid work and public cloud adoption are now mainstream as organizations. Large and small, are racing to ensure their business operations are agile, resilient and secure. These generational tailwinds are durable and my conviction in our $72 billion serviceable market opportunity is greater than it has ever been. In my conversations with hundreds of IT executives, it is clear that cybersecurity remains their number one priority. Cyber threats, including ransomware and data exfiltration continue to grow exponentially as attackers exploit VPNs and firewalls. This is driving more organizations from firewall and VPN based castle-and-moat security to Zscaler's Zero Trust architecture. To meet this need, we launched a new certification program that provides comprehensive knowledge of Zero Trust architecture and practical guidance for the planning, design and implementation of a Zero Trust architecture, enabling networking and security professionals to lead their organizations secure digital transformation. In today's environment, ROI and cost optimization are becoming bigger priorities as business leaders are being asked to do more with less. Our Zero Trust Exchange eliminates the need for traditional security devices, either as on-prem appliances or virtual machines in the cloud that are difficult to maintain and require compromises between security, cost and user experience. Our business value message is resonating in this challenging macro environment and more customers are willing to adopt our broader platform to consolidate multiple point products, increasing our average deal size. As a result, we are actively working on more large, multiyear, multi-pillar opportunities than ever before. To align to the increasing deal sizes in each of our geo theaters, we reorganized our field level customer segmentation and expanded our enterprise segment efforts at the beginning of this fiscal year. When we started in enterprise segment two years ago, it started with one global leader for all geos. As this business has grown, it made sense for us to align this segment under each geo leader for faster decision-making closer to the customer. These changes contributed to a late ramp in the seasonally tougher Q1, but we believe these changes position us to scale to reach our next milestone of $5 billion in ARR and beyond. In Q1, even as we saw additional deal scrutiny and longer reviews on most deals. We grew our base of customers with $1 million or more in ARR by 55% year-over-year, ending the quarter with over 340 of these customers. As I mentioned before, customers are increasingly buying Zscaler for users, our complete platform for user protection, which includes ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, bundled together. This accelerates our customers' transformation journey and makes us a critical partner for them. Now let me highlight several such deals. First, pursuing a strategic initiative to modernize the business, our top 10 global banks made a four-year $10 million per year commitment for Zscaler for users driven by cloud adoption, including Microsoft 365 and Zoom. This customer needed a proven and scalable SASE solution to secure thousands of branch offices and hundreds of thousands of employees operating in more than 100 countries. Importantly, we met the requirement to eliminate the risk of legacy VPNs and lateral threat movement, which was a board-level priority. Unlike a VPN in the cloud, Zscaler connect users to specific applications and not to the corporate network, which will significantly improve their security posture, as employees unwittingly bring infected laptops back to the office. Organizations need a true Zero Trust platform to eliminate the risk of lateral threat movement. Next, in an upsell deal, a Global 1000 financial services company in Asia after deploying ZIA for 110,000 users last year, upgraded to Zscaler for users, our entire user protection platform for all 130,000 employees. As a growing company, they are using Zscaler to quickly and cost effectively open new branch offices with secure Internet connectivity, reducing the branch opening costs by 50% compared to legacy firewall-based architecture. Also, ZPA replaces the extensive VDI infrastructure with Zero Trust access. This customer said, and I quote, ZPA provides a far more seamless user experience versus our existing VDI solution. And now we will have visibility to which user is accessing which applications, one of our key security requirements. With this latest seven-figure purchase, this customer's total ARR more than tripled in just over one year. As these two wings illustrate, when these large financial services companies were ready to embrace the cloud, Zscaler was the only platform that met their needs. With security as a major requirement, these financial services companies chose a proxy architecture with ability to inspect TLS traffic at scale and disqualified firewall-based SaaS solutions. We now have eight of the top 10 global banks and seven of the top 10 insurance companies outside of China as our customers. I'm also excited to see more $1 million ACV wins in our Enterprise segment. Let me share a new enterprise customer in the tech sector who bought all four product pillars, ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for 4,000 users and posture control for workloads. Zscaler is enabling this secure digital transformation with direct and seamless access to SaaS and private applications regardless of their location. This supports the remote for strategy, enabling them to close 12 offices and consolidate half a dozen point products. This deal was sourced by a VAR partner and speaks to the progress we are making with the channel. As this win shows, deal sizes in the smaller enterprise segment are growing, as customers adopt our broader platform. Next, we are also executing well on our federal government opportunity, which had a strong quarter. We remain the only cloud security service to have two products at the highest level of FedRAMP certification. These certifications are driving our federal business, as the US government pursues a Zero Trust strategy to enhance the nation's cybersecurity. We had four deals in the Fed vertical that were each over $1 million, all of which included ZIA and ZPA. Our highly differentiated architecture, which connects users to applications and not to the network, eliminating lateral threat movement, was critical to winning these deals. We have now landed 12 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies as customers with plenty of opportunity to upsell at these very large organizations. And as I mentioned, overall demand from customers to consolidate on our platform is growing. Our net retention rate has again exceeded 125%, now for eight consecutive quarters. Happy customers buy more, and our Net Promoter Score continues to exceed 70, which is more than 2 times the average NPS for SaaS companies. We have a 6x upsell opportunity with our existing customers, just for our core ZIA and ZPA product pillars. An important area of continued innovation, I'd like to highlight is data protection. Our comprehensive data protection offering has been gaining traction, as customers are concerned about data leakage with employees working from anywhere. In Q1, we delivered an industry-fast zero configuration data and protection service, leveraging and building on our eight years of innovation in AI and ML. This DLP service provides auto classification of unstructured data to expedite deployments with zero configuration. In addition, we completed the integration of recently acquired ShiftRight workflow automation technology with our data protection solution to enable organizations to manage hundreds of potential risks and incidents in a simple, yet very sophisticated way to significantly reduce case resolution time. Data protection is the first of many areas where we will broadly integrate ShiftRight workflow technology into the Zero Trust Exchange platform. These additional features, combined with previously released Exact Data Match and Indexed Data Match technology makes us the leading data protection platform in the market. Beyond our core products, we are excited about the rapid adoption of our two emerging product pillars; ZDX to manage digital user experience and Zscaler for workloads to secure servers and workloads. New ACV from our workload communication product is growing nearly 100% year-over-year. And our newest deception and C-Net [ph] offerings are seeing strong customer interest. Let me highlight two upsell deals this quarter that were driven by our workload products. A Fortune 500 aerospace customer that is accelerating its AWS and SaaS adoption, purchased the Zscaler for workloads to inspect one petabyte of PLS encrypted workload and IoT traffic per month, resulting in better security. This customer purchased our ZIA Transformation Bundle for 115,000 users two years ago as they've already committed to our Zero Trust architecture. It was seamless for them to add workload protection, which is built on the same core Zero Trust Exchange. This seven-figure ACV workload deal more than doubles the customer's annual spend with us. In another upsell win, a longtime customer upgraded and expanded their purchase to ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for 12,000 users and also added Zscaler for workloads to accelerate the application migration to Azure. Zscaler for workloads now represents one-third of this customers $1 million-plus annual spend with us. As these customer wins illustrate our proven track record, running the world's largest in-line security cloud makes Zscaler the obvious and trusted partner of choice. Our Zero Trust Exchange processes over 270 billion transactions in line and prevents more than seven billion security and policy violations per day, providing our customers an unmatched network effect for superior security. Our demonstrated ability to scale our cloud platform becomes even more important as we address hundreds of millions of workloads and billions of OT and IoT devices. In closing, while there are broader macro challenges and economic uncertainties, we are seeing an increase in large multi-year commitments for multiple product pillars. As I mentioned earlier, as deal sizes have increased, we have adapted our field level customer segmentation to better serve our customers and to deliver more consistent execution. Our consultative sales process enables our account teams to quantify the business value of our platform to remain close to the customers, especially at the C level, and to get deals across the line. I believe periods of uncertainty can act as a catalyst for change. Customers are engaging with us to embrace zero trust architecture, consolidate point products, simplify IT and standardize on the Zscaler platform, all of which delivers better security and lower cost. CIOs are telling me that they are using this challenging environment to drive change and to eliminate the technical debt of legacy point products, which are expensive to buy and operate. Customers are increasingly turning to Zscaler in today's challenging environment, while overall IT budgets are tightening, we believe that security budgets remain more resilient. We are bringing more innovations to customers than ever before, while scaling our customer support and go-to-market organization. We believe we are still in the early innings of a significant market opportunity to enable secure digital transformation and achieve our $5 billion ARR goal. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Of course, Matt. As you know, we start to pursue smaller enterprise segment a couple of years ago. At that time, we put the enterprise sales team under a global leader who directly reported to our CRO. As this segment has nicely grown, it was the right time for us to move it in geo teams under geo leaders. So that was one change. The second, we made changes where accounts got redistributed among our four market segments at the field level, as you know, we've got major, we've got large Enterprise and Commercial. And this contributed to a late ramp in a seasonally tougher Q1 but these changes are done, and we're already seeing better results, better pipeline, and we think this is the right thing for us to do to grow to our big target of $5 billion ARR. But Remo, the low end wasn't more impacted than others, so. Yes. Remo, if I may add. The strong pipeline in Q2 is what we feel pretty good about. But we do know that there's a closing time factor we are factoring in. The Fed business was quite good for us. We have been building on it. We are investing on it. That's where it has taken us to all these certifications. The impact of macro is less on the federal business. It has its own budget cycle goes through its own process. We now have landed 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies and we're helping them, and they all start actually at a fairly small level and they have been growing at a pretty decent pace. And so it's an early stage. Though last quarter, we did have sizable $46 million project, which actually gets billed on a periodic basis. So feel very good and strong about the Federal business, but Federal takes its own time in closing some of these deals. Yes. So, if I may add, first of all, it was not a full reorganization. As I said, we have four segments. And as our deals are getting bigger, some of these deals that sat in lower segments, they're getting bigger. They need to be handled by the upper segment and so on and so forth. So realigning the segment was good for us to optimize the deal size and who should be working on them. It's that. And the second was, this lower enterprise team, which used to report to the CRO directly, now is linked to geos. So they're not massive changes, but they are more than normal that we typically have done. But none of these deals are going away. We are well positioned. We're winning some already. We are working on more. So -- and as I said, the pipeline, as a result of some of these changes made, is growing. And I feel very good and comfortable about it. Yeah. So okay, I'll start. Your first question about competition and pricing dynamics, I'll tell you on the higher end of the large enterprise segment, we haven't really seen much competitive changes at all. These large enterprises aren't savvy. They look for the right architecture. They take this thing very seriously. And almost all these large deals, when firewall companies have tried to come in and compete, they're often excluded. I mentioned some of them during the call. So I do wonder where do those deals come from, because if you ask me some of my largest deals, if you took top x-deals, we aren't really competing with the firewall companies out there. Price dynamics will matter if you really are competing. That's number one. But also number two, the service we're selling is very mission critical. In fact, it's probably more mission critical than Office 365. That's what I hear from CIOs, because we are on the switchboard. We are connecting everything to everything. So we have not seen pricing pressure from competitive side of it. We have been told a few times that the customer said, yes, this vendor came and offered us a third, the core price, but we decided we are not serious about it because it doesn't meet the requirements. Your second part of the question was impact of economic slowdown. It is very true that the area we are playing in really does two things for customers. One, it's important cyber area. Number two, with consolidation, simplification and standardization, customers do save money. So those are the two things that are helping us a lot more than many other market segments. But when the broader macro is there's, obviously, some impact but I would say, relatively speaking, it is far less than other areas. As I had talked to many CIOs and CXOs, they don't see securely budget getting reduced much. As compared to IT budgets, we are in a much better shape, but there is impact. And sorry, and one part of the impact is these large deals are going more and more through CFOs and CEOs for approval. Yes. That's a good question. You're basically saying, will new customers start transformation projects? It depends upon what kind of projects you're looking at. CIOs are prioritizing projects must do versus projects that can wait. That's one part. But if you look at what we do, where we fit, okay. Cyber is not going away. The risk of cyber is still there. It is a Board-level discussion. It's happening. Number two, there is pressure on cost consolidation and simplification. Yes, while customers won't start big new projects, but projects that can be done without big investments, and they are being done. If you look at the total IT budget of a CIO and the security is a fairly small part of it. By engaging at the CIO level, we are actually able to get a fair share of the budget. So I think we feel pretty good about fiscal 2023. Having said that, will there be a bigger hurdle to cross to close those deals? Absolutely, yes. But to do so, you need two things: one, you need CIO, CXO level engagement, which we have traditionally done; two, you need better business justification to make a strong case CFO that it makes sense. And we have been doing that for quite a while, and now the number of assessments, value assessment we're doing is actually much higher than it used to be. Yes. If I may add, ZDX has been our fastest-growing service. It has grown faster than ZPA, if you look at a similar time line or similar stages. And the cloud protection has two main areas. One is, what we call, CNAPP, its API-based security, that's a posture control product. And second is, Zero Trust in workloads for in-line security, and we are the only vendor who has done tight integration between the two. And our actually customer interest has been pretty strong. Our new ACV nearly doubled year-over-year for our Zero Trust for workloads. I talked about a couple of deals, large deals during the earnings thing. One was a seven-figure ACV workload deal. It more than doubled customers' annual spend with us. That's significant. Another deal I mentioned, workloads now represent one-third of this customers are $1 million annual cost spend with us. So these things, which used to be fairly small three, four quarters ago, are beginning to get pretty significant. Yes. Right. Fatima, yes, multi-year, multi-pillar deals, those pipelines are growing. And, yes, tougher environment with more scrutiny and more approval levels, that's what we're seeing. So there are two significant trends that we have been doing that are helping us to make sure we're able to get those deals closed. One is customers look for better business justification. That's what I mentioned on CFO-ready business cases, business value assessment, which we do to help quantify them. If you remove these eight-point security and networking products, this is the ROI you can get. And in fact, we're showing more than 200% ROI in many most majority of our cases. That's very strong. It's -- we've done it. We're doing a better job in that area. The second thing to get deals done in a tougher environment is having strong C-level engagements, because you're going to make a case there to show what needs to be done. And also, if you're part of the CIO's budget rather than just security budget, you actually have a better chance of doing it. Both of those things are helping us, and we are keeping those factors in mind as we are providing you our forecast. Yes. So it is an interesting dynamic in the market. Market is tougher. But when CIOs look at what needs to be done, they look for consolidation, simplification that's driving our deals to get bigger. Bigger deals mean more scrutiny. Now and -- but we are helping our customers to ramp into larger commitments to deploy our platform. So it is a phased thing we are doing. So we are -- we have been doing that for a few quarters, and it does continue. Yes. The Q2 pipeline is strong. It is a record pipeline. We did get some benefit of COVID, but that was starting in March of 2020 and most CIOs had to do something in a quarter or two of that. So most of the effect of COVID actually ended by mid of 2020. So since then, it is kind of growth of our business driven by the need for security, transformation, digital transformation and the like. I think we have been doing good pipe funnel. It is true that some of the changes we made in start of Q1 did kind of cause some slowdown for us. We are past that. It's a good pipeline. And the question is how much -- how well do we overcome the scrutiny and extra level approvals to land the deals we need to land. And that's what we are working on. That's really part of our job, but good strong pipeline. Remo, you want to add anything? Okay. Yes. I think, even though we did well in some of the verticals Remo pointed out, I'm not sure overall vertical is a big, big factor. Macro is impacting broadly, but there are certain verticals that have less, for example, in oil and gas, doing differently than many of others. But I won't say it's a big factor for us. It is a factor, but not a major effect. Look, as you have seen in the past few quarters, deals are getting more and more back-end loaded. We saw that a few quarters ago. We saw it in Q1. We think we will have a linearity thing, similar to Q1, maybe a little bit better than Q1. But I don't think that December will significantly change everything out there. Remo? I'll start at the broad level for a month, and you can get into specifics. Yes. Federal is most of the stuff in place is ZIA and ZPA, but it's building strong interest on ZDX and some of the newer products. But currently, it's a strong mix of ZIA and ZPA. Thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor events. Thank you, and goodbye."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Ashwin. We delivered a strong Q4 with all metrics exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Revenue grew 30% year-over-year. Billings grew 27% and profitability reached new records with operating margins of approximately 22% and free cash flow margin of 23%. We also achieved a new milestone of $1 billion in quarterly bookings in Q4, driven by an acceleration in new and upsell business in the quarter. For the full-year, revenue grew 34% and free cash flow grew 75%, resulting in free cash flow margin of 27%, a new record for the company. With another year of strong top and bottom-line performance, we exceeded the Rule of 60 for the fourth consecutive year. Despite the recent changes in our go-to-market organization, we delivered these outstanding results, driven by strong customer demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in go-to-market execution, the pace of innovation and customer adoption of our expanded platform. I'm also pleased to share we crossed $2.5 billion in ARR in Q4, and we expect to achieve a new milestone of $3 billion or more in ARR in fiscal '25. Before getting into further details of the quarter, let me share a few observations on the demand environment. First, customer adoption Zero Trust Platforms is stronger than ever, with Q4 setting a record for new and upsell business. Our platform secures 47 million users across nearly 8,700 customers. While other vendors are still struggling to deliver cloud security for users, we expanded our platform beyond users to deliver Zero Trust security for applications, workloads and, IoT/OT devices. Customers are consolidating their disjointed legacy security products by adopting our comprehensive platform. Second, the increasing use of AI is creating new avenues of growth for us. For example, the rising adoption of Gen AI is exposing new gaps in organizations' security posture. To help our customers address these risks, earlier this year, we launched Gen AI Security, which enables customers to realize the productivity benefits of Gen AI without compromising data security. Using our Gen AI security, customers can gain visibility, apply access control and enforce data protection policies to prevent their sensitive data from leaking. Third, I'm thrilled to share that we have achieved a major milestone with our cloud platform, surpassing over $0.5 trillion transactions daily, that is T as in trillion. This further demonstrates our widening market leadership position. These transactions generate a vast quantity of proprietary loans that feed our massive data lake. These are not firewall logs that often can't inspect SSL traffic for cyber threat detection. These are complete logs that have structured and unstructured data, including the full URL. We leverage this proprietary data to train AI models that power innovations throughout our platform. Our AI analytics solution, including unified vulnerability management, Risk360, Business Insights are seeing strong traction. AI analytics contributed nearly 3 points to new and upsell business growth in Q4 and 2 points for the entire fiscal '24, even though some of these products were only available for a part of the year. I am pleased with the contribution of AI analytics in fiscal '24 and with continued expansion of this solution, I expect its contribution to continue to grow. With an addressable market of $96 billion, we believe we are in the very early stages of opportunity with Zero Trust and AI. The cyber threat environment continues to worsen as the limitations of firewall and VPN-based architecture are exploited by threat actors to launch an increasing volume of sophisticated attacks. Over the last year, we saw an 18% increase in ransomware attacks blocked by the Zscaler cloud. Our season threat research team is tracking 391 of the most sophisticated ransomware families, including many that were uncovered by Zscaler in the past year. Driven by the increased number of cyber breaches, more customers are adopting our Zero Trust platform. For example, in a new logo win, a Top 10 Fortune 500 industry machinery company purchased Zscaler for users for 100,000 users in a multi-year seven-figure ACV deal. The customer previously purchased a firewall-based SASE solution to consolidate firewall, secure web gateways, and MPLS network spend. Subsequently, they realized the so-called SASE solution allows lateral tech movement and does not deliver Zero Trust Security. They chose Zscaler to replace their firewall-based SASE. Our purpose-built proxy-based cloud platform makes our customers' branches and data centers invisible to such actors, hence they can't be discovered and they can't be attacked. In addition to landing new logo platform purchases, we are also upselling our platform. Our land and expand motion creates a flywheel of continuous engagement and upsell. To give you an example, in a seven-figure upsell deal, a Fortune 200 financial services customer bought ZPA and ZDX after their successful ZIA deployment for 68,000 users. After securing Internet and SaaS access with Zscaler, it was natural for them to expand to our broader platform. ZPA for Zero Trust access to private applications, aimed for user-to-application segmentation to eliminate lateral type propagation, and ZDX to quickly identify and resolve end-to-end performance issues. With this purchase, the customer's ARR more than doubled to nearly $10 million. Next, I am happy to share that customers continue to adopt advanced features of our data protection pillar, making it one of our fastest-growing pillars. For example, in a new logo win, an American healthcare provider purchased multiple pillars of our platform, including ZIA transformation, data protection advanced, and ZDX for 124,000 users in a multi-year eight-figure TCV deal. Our data protection pillar was critical to this win due to its comprehensive capabilities, which include securing all types of data whether structured or unstructured. Data in motion or data addressed and data across all channels, including web, email, endpoint, SaaS, cloud workloads and more. Next, let me discuss our emerging products, including ZDX, Zero Trust for Branch and cloud, and AI analytics. I'm delighted to share that emerging products contributed approximately 22% of new and upsell business in fiscal '24, up from 18% in fiscal '23. We expect this contribution to grow to mid-20s in fiscal '25. Our Zero Trust for branch and cloud solution, including Zero Trust for workflows, Zero Trust SD-WAN, and Zero Trust segmentation is driving more and more meaningful wins. Let me share two examples, in an upsell win, a Fortune 500 financial services customer purchased Zero Trust for workloads to protect their on-prem applications. Zero Trust for workloads contributed approximately one-third of the seven-figure upsell ACV deal, which doubled the annual spend of this existing $1 million dollar ARR customer. In another upsell win, a Top 10 pharmaceutical company purchased our Zero Trust SD-WAN solution to protect over 30 manufacturing sites, eliminating the need for firewalls and making each site like a Starbucks. Zero Trust SD-WAN was nearly 50% off the seven-figure ACV deal. Our expanding portfolio of emerging products further strengthened by our acquisition of Avalor and Airgap is opening doors for sales to new customers. With the addition of Airgap, Zscaler is expanding to provide Zero Trust Security inside branches, factories, and campuses, where customers traditionally relied on East-West firewalls and network access control on NAP. By combining Airgap with our Zero Trust SD-WAN, we can not only replace firewalls at the edge, but also eliminate firewalls inside these sites. We are also seeing strong traction for the unified vulnerability management solution we acquired through Avalor. By combining our customers' enterprise security and business system data with our proprietary law data from half a trillion daily transactions, Avalor delivers real-time actionable insights and operational efficiencies for customers to improve their overall security posture. We expect new logo conversations that start with Airgap or Avalor or other emerging products to expand into broader platform opportunities. We will continue to invest in our platform expansion. Moving to the federal vertical, I am excited to share we landed a new cabinet-level agency, increasing our count of cabinet-level agencies to 13. In a seven-figure ACV deal, this customer purchased Zscaler for users for 5,000 users. With over 100,000 employees, this customer presents a significant 20x upsell opportunity. Having landed 13 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies, including the DoD, we see large upsell opportunities in the federal vertical with the increasing adoption of Zero Trust. Building upon our success in the U.S., we are accelerating our public sector go-to-market investments in other nations that are modeling the Zero Trust security initiatives similarly to the U.S. This is a large opportunity for us, but like many government initiatives, this will take time. Now let me share some updates on our sales organization. First, we had lower-than-expected attrition and we had a strong hiring quarter. In fiscal '25, we plan to continue hiring reps at a strong pace and expect attrition to further improve. Second, I'm pleased to report that sales productivity was better-than-expected during the quarter, driven by acceleration in new and upsell business. In fiscal '25, we expect sales productivity to continue to improve with the second-half stronger than the first. Third, we increased investment in the Global System Integrators or GSI channel by hiring leaders experienced in building GSI programs for large enterprises. These hires are driving significant progress in developing mutual go-to-market plans with GSIs that integrate the Zscaler platform with their customers' digital transformation projects. Most large GSIs are already Zscaler customers and that enables them to showcase to their customers the value Zscaler Zero Trust platform delivers. This quarter, we added another large GSI End-User customer, making eight of the top-10 GSIs by revenue Zscaler customers. This GSI purchased Zscaler for users for over 300,000 users, in our largest-ever TCV deal in the services vertical. This GSI is consolidating multiple point products, including secure web gateways, load balancers, VPNs, firewalls, and MPLS network, which is expected to deliver 200% ROI to this customer. I am pleased with the progress we're making in transforming our go-to-market engine to an account-centric sales motion, which is contributing to growth of our large customers. We added nearly double the number of global 2000 logos in fiscal '24 as compared to fiscal '23. We ended fiscal '24 with approximately 35% of global 2000 companies and more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies as our customers. Our customer base spending $1 million plus annually grew by 26% year-over-year to $567 million and we ended the quarter with over 60 customers spending $5 million plus annually. We expect this large customer momentum to continue in fiscal '25. Finally, I want to address the topic of cloud resilience that has come to the forefront due to the recent cloud outages of Microsoft and CrowdStrike. When customers rely on a mission-critical cybersecurity service, there's no room for service interruptions. From inception, Zscaler has built a cloud security platform that has been seamlessly scaling with high-reliability and resilience. Operating such a service is no trivial task and requires years of experience. Unproven vendors, including new entrants and legacy firewall companies, do not have this experience. By operating the world's largest security cloud with superior resilience for over a decade, we have earned the trust of the largest enterprises. This is a clear differentiator for us and is driving the growth of our business. As an innovator and a market leader, in January 2023, we became the first cloud security company to introduce a business continuity service that enables customers to continue their operations even during catastrophic events. In conclusion, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the confluence of two large secular growth drivers, Zero Trust security and AI. We enter fiscal '25 with a stronger go-to-market machine, increased pace of R&D innovation, strong adoption of our emerging products, and high levels of customer satisfaction with an NPS score of over 70. With our customer obsession, expanding platform, and a large addressable market, I expect another strong year, which will move us closer to our goal of $5 billion in ARR. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Our Q4 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $593 million, up 30% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 55% of revenue, EMEA was 30%, and APJ was 15%. For the full-year, revenue was $2.17 billion, up 34% year-over-year. Our total calculated billings in Q4 grew 27% year-over-year and 45% sequentially to $911 million. Our calculated current billings grew 27% year-over-year. Like last year, some customers paid us upfront on multiyear deals and the percentage of total calculated billings coming from such upfront payments was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% from a year ago to $4.418 billion. The current RPO was approximately 48% of the total RPO. We ended Q4 with 567 customers with over $1 million in ARR and 3,100 customers with over $100,000 in ARR. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customer's digital transformation journeys. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 115%. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned. Turning to the rest of our Q4 financial performance, the total gross margin of 81.1% compared to 81.4% in the prior quarter and 80.7% in the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin benefited by approximately 60 basis points from a change in our accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year to $353 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model with an operating margin of approximately 22%, an increase of about 260 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 23%, including data center CapEx of approximately 8% of revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Before getting to the details of Q1 and full-year fiscal 2025 guidance, I wanted to share additional context about our framework for billing guidance. We expect full-year fiscal '25 calculated billings of $3.110 billion to $3.135 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 19% to 20%. We expect first-half billings to be in the range of 39% to 39.5% of full-year billings guide with Q1 to be approximately 16.2% of full-year billings guide. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year billings growth of approximately 13% in the first-half, accelerating to 23% growth in the second-half. In no particular order, I'd like to share three key factors that are driving this acceleration. One, as Jay mentioned, we expect sales productivity to continue to improve with the second-half stronger than the first. We expect this to contribute to strong new upsell and renewal activity in the year; two, our strong and growing pipeline supports second-half acceleration; and three, from a timing perspective, our contracted non-cancelable billings from prior year's active contracts are scheduled to grow 7% in the first-half and 23% in the second-half. This naturally implies a stronger second-half in billings growth, giving a strong visibility into total billings growth in the second-half. Moving on to taxes, please note that we expect to continue to be a modest cash taxpayer in fiscal 2025 with an estimated cash tax of approximately $45 million to $50 million. For non-GAAP P&L reporting, I'd like to call your attention to a change we are making to our non-GAAP tax calculations. Starting fiscal 2025 and going forward, we're establishing a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, which is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2025. Please refer to our earnings release and financial supplemental for fiscal '23 and fiscal '24 comparisons reflecting this new non-GAAP tax rate. Turning to the rest of guidance, as a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $604 million to $606 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 22%, gross margins of 80%. I would also like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX, Zero Trust Branch and cloud and AI analytics will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. In addition, we'll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure to scale with the growing demand. Operating profit in the range of $114 million to $116 million, net other income of $18 million, income taxes of $31 million. Earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.63, assuming 164 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2025, revenue in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 20% to 21%. Operating profit in the range of $530 million to $540 million, income taxes of approximately $140 million, and earnings per share in the range of $2.81 to $2.87, assuming approximately 164 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be approximately 23.5% to 24%, including higher CapEx this year. We expect our data center CapEx to be approximately 3 points higher as a percent of revenue compared to fiscal 2024, as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we will invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth and profitability. With that, operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Please standby for our first question thank you. And it comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please proceed.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here and a nice quarter on the billings and on next year's billings guide. Maybe if I give it to one question, Jay, maybe I'll make it for you. Can you [Technical Difficulty] drop a little bit there? I think we all know your views on firewall-based solutions, but maybe out of curiosity, how about some of the newer players in SASE that are maybe attacking this with a similar kind of pure-play cloud approach as Zscaler? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Saket, thank you. We have not seen any meaningful change on the competitive landscape. In fact, if I would say, as the market is looking for a broader platform that's integrated and it's looking for proven vendor because the resilience has become a very important thing our brand has gotten better. On the high-end of the market, we actually feel like we're very good. We mentioned about the number of new logos. Last year, we added essentially doubled in '24 over '25. We've seen whether the firewall vendors or some other vendors, either they lack the proxy architecture or they lack a multi-tenant architecture. Architecture is critical for win and that's a big advantage for us. Even if you build the architecture the time and experience it takes to build a highly reliable, highly resilient cloud is massive. And then these large enterprises have to trust you. It took us a long time to earn the trust of these customers. So we feel we are in a good position. We keep on innovating the gap between our offering and what I call so would be competitors is growing bigger and bigger. So I feel very bullish and comfortable for the platform and the gap we are creating with other competitors.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. And I'll echo my congrats on a real strong finish to the year. Jay, I appreciate your comments about the Microsoft and CrowdStrike related outage in July and why Zscaler is designed in a way that's highly available and frankly relied upon by customers as an in-line solution. But I'm wondering if that event in any way from what you can tell has changed the way customers are thinking about their cyber strategies and Zscaler's place within that? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Brad, It's a good question after the CrowdStrike out, customers are more focused on resilience, which is our strength. In fact, I personally got lots and lots of calls right after the incident. They wanted to know about what we're doing about it, that we ended up personally inviting actually wide invitation briefing to 1,000 or so our largest customers. I was surprised to see that within a matter of a week or so, about 700 customers registered for the briefings, we ended up doing multiple of them. The main question was, this is mission-critical service and how are we protected? The good thing is Zscaler deliver business continuity plan or DR service in Jan 2023, the first vendor to deliver it, the only vendor that has a true BCP. So the importance of mission criticality has gone up significantly since the outage that was caused by CrowdStrike. In fact, about 40% of Zscalers large customers have already deployed BCP for ZIA. So while our customers want resilience, they also do want consolidation, but they do not want consolidation such that it makes them dependent on a single vendor, especially single vendor for applications and security. This sentiment has become even stronger after the Midnight Blizzard of Microsoft issues. So I think we are well-positioned. We did a good job in building mission verticality. And I think it's important and our customers are working totally with us.\nBrad Zelnick: Very helpful, Jay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Roger Boyd with UBS. Please proceed.\nRoger Boyd: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Remo, I wanted to ask you about the billings guide and if you could just speak to the general level of conservatism there. You've been pretty clear even before this quarter about the expected headwind coming out of the go-to-market transition, but it does sound like sales productivity was better than expected in both 3Q and 4Q this year. So just beyond that, anything else giving you more pause or tempering your expectations around the broader macro environment, sales cycles, or anything else? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, great question. So I mean, billings guide really reflects, again, we broke out the first-half versus second-half. And you know, as we talked about in the sales organization, we had higher attrition than we expected in Q3 and that attrition has stabilized in Q4. Hiring those account reps, this could to take time for those account reps to basically get to full productivity. We expect them to get to strong productivity in the second-half, our pipeline supports our guidance. And as we called out also, when you take a look at billings, billings is made up of new and upsell renewals and contracted billings. And one of the things we called out on the script is contracted billings are scheduled billings up from prior year contracts. So those are what we're seeing, we're seeing that because of the business is getting more second-half weighted, we're seeing that this -- our guide reflects that. And as we called out, in the first-half, contracted billings is expected to increase on a year-over-year basis 7% and in the second-half 23%. What I can say also is that from my perspective, being here at Zscaler for almost eight years, there's a change in our sales organization. You know, the change is basically it's a more mature, very strong leadership and also an organization that I feel is going to be able to sell deeper into accounts and really sell to the value of Zscaler. So the puts and takes are from my perspective is that strong demand for Zero Trust, we're going to continue to expand in the G2K, which represents around 35% in the Fortune 500 customers. But the key thing with Zscaler also is that we're innovating. So you look at our emerging products, they represented 22% of our total new and upsell in fiscal '24, we expect that to go up to 25%. So that's going to be our continued focus. It's not only selling our existing core products, but also innovating. As I mentioned, strong momentum in the go-to-market team. We just had our SKO and the feedback from everybody who went there was just very, very positive. I just really feel good about where we're at. I mean, having said that, the backdrop, it's still a challenging spending environment. But I feel that Zscaler with our platform with what we're building our go-to-market, I just think we're just very, very well-positioned. Jay? anything.\nJay Chaudhry: No, it's good. I think the last comment I mentioned is, in today's environment, CIOs do want ROI cost savings, cost takeout. We're in a unique position to remove a number of point products that help justify closing our deals.\nRoger Boyd: Great.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nJoseph Gallo: Hey guys, thanks for the question. Jay, I want to follow up on that last question. I mean, you've obviously started the branch out very successfully beyond ZIA and ZPA evidenced by AI and data protection success. However, post the CrowdStrike incident, we've heard customers don't want to put all their eggs in one basket. Does this hinder your ability to sell incremental products? And then Remo, maybe you can just elaborate on how you're thinking about NRR in your fiscal '25 billings guide? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: So it's a very good question. So now CrowdStrike wasn't really an issue of putting all of your eggs in one basket. CrowdStrike was one of the point products. Each product must work well. So on one side, customers do want consolidation. If you got two dozen products, they want to bring it down to a handful of key platform providers, but they do not want to go to the extreme of going with a single vendor that wants to sell all security products or a single vendor that wants to sell you all the applications and security products. In fact, most of the CIOs, I want to, they have been standardizing in-line access to three providers, one for EDR, one for identity, and one for Zero Trust actions. I think that's a good combination because you end up getting a couple of extra layers, but you still have separation. So in this environment, our customers aren't really pushing back on us because we tell them don't buy everything through Zscaler. You've got an EDR provider, you've got an identity provider and we'll do the rest of Zero Trust on activity. And that's how we carefully choose the markets we get into. So we feel comfortable and good about the expansion and selection of areas, where we want to compete in.\nRemo Canessa: From an NRR perspective, Joseph, 115% I believe is outstanding. We're not guiding to NRR. The only time we really look at it is, as we mentioned before on these calls, really the key for me is just driving top-line business, whether it comes from existing customers or new customers, but 115% at our scale, I think is outstanding.\nJoseph Gallo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks guys. Great solid finish for the year. Remo, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to try and beat the dead horse here again on the billings. Just want to make sure I understand this right. I mean, in '24, you didn't have any unusual seasonality in the first-half, second-half on year-over-year patterns. They were quite similar in billings. So what is it that's driving the 7% and 23% differences in the first and the second-half? Are things being pushed out? Do you just expect deals to push out, hence you expect to close more or renew more in the second-half? Is that a macro comment? Was there something that happened two, three years ago, lumpsum that somehow comes back into play here? Anything that you can do to dig in just a little bit more on that would be greatly appreciated?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So it's really -- if you take a look at the call-out is scheduled billings. And scheduled billings growth in the first-half was 7% and scheduled billings growth on a year-over-year basis, we see a 23% for this year. So then the question is step-back and what creates that? So we signed three-year contracts. In the three-year contracts, they're scheduled billings. So we have those scheduled billings. Those billings are coming through. Now, if you take a look and go back into fiscal '23 first-half and fiscal '24 first-half, there were macro challenges. So it's a challenging environment from Zscaler's perspective. So therefore, with that challenging environment, in the first-half of fiscal '23 and fiscal '24, now those scheduled billings are coming through and those scheduled billings are lower. That's what's creating that growth rate of 7% year-over-year in the first-half. Now having said that, what I made to the comment I made before was that the business is getting more second-half. We're becoming a larger company, becoming more second-half. So our guidance reflects that and that scheduled billings of 23%, those are contracted billings, they're scheduled and we expect to get those billings.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and it comes from the line of Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Great.\nBrian Essex: Great, Thank you, and good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Jay, I think -- I think you may have touched on this in your prepared remarks, but I want to circle back into the -- to the macro, specifically the competitive environment with regard to pricing. And there are certainly in the Zero Trust space, we're seeing a lot of initiatives to consolidate on certain platforms. Some of that is flexible pricing, different duration, giving away products for free. How is that impacting the pricing environment that you're dealing with? I understand that there's a lot of times an architectural change that's attractive with your platform, but just wanted to touch maybe if you could peel back a layer on the pricing dynamics just to understand what you see in your environment? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: So as I said during my prepared remarks, yes, the macro remains challenging and there's deal scrutiny. But also at the same time, cyber, it's very important. In many areas, good enough is good enough. In cyber and large enterprises, good enough is not good enough. So customers do want a good -- a very good cyber solution. That's number one. And number two, in the cyber area, a real Zero Trust architecture that's cloud native does play an important role that matters. Now, once you do that, your pipeline actually build, you are engaged with customers and the next part comes in, can you close the deal? Now closing the deal in today's environment does require that you are able to actually show the customer that you can take a bunch of products out and you can save money for the customers. And we are able to release. We are able to replace a number of new -- number of products, like the firewalls, VPNs, NAV products, and the like. When we are able to show that we are able to eliminate those products, the customer likes it, that helped us both. No, we have our new and upsell business has accelerated actually. So we are seeing strength in area. So personally, I'm not worried about the competition. I'm able to handle pricing situations by showing the number of products you can move. Think of other vendors. Do you think a firewall vendor who wants to remove a bunch of point products? The biggest installed base in terms of products today is firewalls. They want to protect those firewalls. We take on those firewalls, we take on those VPNs. So we just have to -- this area we keep on getting better at is making sure we engage at the sea level, number one. Number two, make sure we create a good business value assessment and we have owned that process quite a bit.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it's from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks guys for the questions. Maybe one on the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about, obviously, it was a Q4, but -- and we assume it's back-end loaded. But the linearity of the quarter, anything abnormal with deals that pushed or pulled? And I guess maybe if you could comment a little bit more specifically on trends in August thus far that would be -- or I guess now we're in the September, but through August, that would be helpful?\nRemo Canessa: The trends in August, I'll let Jay speak about that. Q4, we talked about that the quarters have become more back-end loaded. Nothing -- it was similar to the prior few quarters, Q4. So nothing unusual with Q4 from a linearity perspective. And regarding trends in August, we can't give specific trends on dollar amounts or anything like that or business, but maybe Jay can give a few comments.\nJay Chaudhry: I think nothing unusual to talk about in August. Our business is making progress as usual. So I think you'll probably hear more about us as we get better.\nMatt Hedberg: Maybe if I could just squeeze one more in. You know, it seems like in the spirit of consolidation, it feels like you guys are in a good spot to consolidate a lot of customer spend. Can you talk about large deal visibility, understanding it is -- it is hard to predict the timing of those things, but could you talk about sort of the growth in your large deal pipeline and kind of the focus on increasingly playing that consolidation role?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, there is no slowing down on consolidation of point products. We have been seeing our deals in general getting bigger. They're seeing upsell going more and more. So if customers spend X, they're spending more with us. I shared several deals, several large deals, where customers started at X and it's gone up to Y or Z and whatnot. So the main thing for customers are looking for consolidation is, number one, can you give me better cyber and data protection? Number two, can I operationally run and manage these things better? Number three, can you do cost savings? That message is loud and clear and we're handling all of that. And for one area I'll highlight for consolidation, which is playing a bigger role for us is data protection. When customers started with Zscaler, ZIA, they started with cyber protection was the primary focus to make sure they don't get compromised. Now with ransomware attacks where data is often ex-filtrated, data protection has become a bigger and more important item than it used to be. Since we are sitting in line for the traffic that goes via the Internet, we are the natural provider, natural partner to do data protection. And we're seeing a growth in data protection that has become one of the fastest growing area for us. I think a few quarters ago, we mentioned that it has exceeded, it has surpassed $4 billion or for us. And also we expanded this platform quite a bit. We used to do in-line DLP as the primary thing. Now we also got DLP or email as a big thing, SaaS, SSPM, SASE kind of stuff and now DSPM are becoming more areas. So I think we've got a great expanding platform with cost-savings, I think they're extremely well-positioned.\nRemo Canessa: So from my perspective, also Matt, I mean, just some numbers we called out on the script, 567 customers with greater than $1 million ARR, 3,100 customers of greater than $100,000 and I believe 60 -- over 60 customers with $5 million in ARR, half a trillion transactions per day. So to put in perspective, I mean, order of magnitude, that's more than anybody has seen. At the time of our public offering, we're doing 30 billion transactions per day. So we've gone from 30 billion transactions to 500 billion transactions. The data that we receive, the information that we receive that we're able to basically help our customers for a security perspective. So I just don't think there's anybody else out there who can do it. So it's my view that we are in a great position to capture this market. I also believe that with the go-to-market changes that we've made over the last nine months, we're going to sell deeper in the accounts and also we've been one of the things we called out GSIs. That's going to be an area that we're going to focus in on as we go forward. I think the opportunity is really big. I believe the platform is well-positioned to really protect customers and governments throughout the world. And I think, you know, we feel good about where we're at right now.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks. Super helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari with Baird. Please proceed.\nShrenik Kothari: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So, Jay, in light of what you said, right, you guys are expanding the platform beyond just securing users and now delivering Zero Trust for applications, workloads and IoT, and you gave example of a new logo win with Top 10, strong customer demand for the broad approach. Just can you elaborate on the nature and composition of these contracts, the non-cancelable billings, the compensation of this pipeline in terms of users and seats versus workloads and applications that you called out? And does that help with the overall kind of land and expand motion moving more towards the workloads and application base and a follow-up for Remo as well?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Let me start with the platform expansion. As I said during my prepared remarks, most of the vendors are trying to really mature a product for protecting users. They've done that extremely well, 47 million some users protected. So it is natural for us to expand it to our workloads, IoT, OT devices and the like. In terms of growth, to give you some data points, we talk about emerging products from the newer areas and then we've got the mature flagship products on emerging products, which is where the workload protection, IoT, OT type of stuff falls in, it was about 22% in fiscal '24. It had gone up from 18% in fiscal '23 and we expect it to go to mid-20s in fiscal '25. So that's growing faster. That's why it's able to carve out market share out of that. Now the exciting thing about that area is there's literally no real competition to do these things in Zero Trust fashion. Yes, some of the workloads and all this done through firewalls, communication, IoT, OT, what do you do, firewalls and VPNs. We all know that firewalls and VPNs have to go away. And we are well-positioned. It's just that -- it's a little bit different sale. It's the same audience, but a little bit different. IoT, OT, a lot of stuff is linked to manufacturing and plants and the like. So you need to reach out of this audience, but CSOs and CIOs do play a common role with the acquisition of Airgap, which does actually device segmentation for IoT, OT extremely well without needing any firewalls, without needing any network access control devices, it is one of area that's being really showing tons of interest in our customer base. In fact, our number of engagements with device segmentation for IoT, OT based on Airgap has gone up significantly. So that's why I feel like the gap between us and people trying to come from behind is growing and the barrier to entries is not trivial in this space. Remo, you want to talk about the...\nRemo Canessa: Yes. From a contracted billing perspective, just -- again, the key point is that we signed three-year contracts upfront. And so getting that certainty with that contract is good. And then the billing happens afterwards on an annual basis afterwards. That's the scheduled contract billing. So what we're seeing is our contract lengths are increasing, which is positive. And also we're seeing our deal size increasing, which is positive too. But we're also seeing customers buying more of our product and across our platform with [Technical Difficulty] And again, getting a three-year contract with a scheduled billing gives you certainty related to the billings, but also getting that three-year contract gives you time to basically sell that customer more. And as I mentioned before, which is really key is that the sales organization, go-to-market organization, we're going to be selling deeper into the accounts. That's going to be our focus. We're going to look for new customers, but we're also going to look to sell deeper into our accounts. So longer contracts, it's a good thing.\nShrenik Kothari: Got it. Thanks a lot Jay and Remo. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\nPatrick Colville: Hey, Jay, thank you so much for taking my question here. I guess I want to ask about emerging products. I mean, it was 22% of new and upsell in fiscal '24. I mean, very impressive to see those emerging products ramp. I mean, we're going to get this in the 10-K, but what was ZPA and then ZIA as a proportion of new and upsell into fiscal '24? And I guess -- pardon me, the second part of the question is, how do you expect ZPA and ZIA to trend in fiscal '25? I mean, what's the sustainability and remaining TAM for those two product lines?\nJay Chaudhry: So very good question. So let's start with ZIA and ZPA. You know at the time of IPO, there was only one product ZIA. ZPA was kind of a rounding error, so to speak. But today, if you look at the mix between ZIA and ZPA, ZPA has gone from literally nothing to about 40% -- over 40% of the new business that we are doing between the two of the products. So that's very remarkable. In fact, if it goes too high-up, I'll be kind of wondering, is ZIA is not going fast enough. So I expect it to grow somewhat more, but not quite. At the end of the day, it could get to 50-50. I expect every Zscaler customer for every user to have ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX, those three products make it a complete package and we call it Zscaler for Users. Zscaler for Users has become our single largest queue basically because that's what our sales team leads with, which really says that our goal is for every customer to buy those three products. That's kind of one key area. Now what is the second part of your question? Sorry, I forgot.\nPatrick Colville: I guess it's -- the question we get from investors is how -- what is the sustainability of those business lines? And I guess what you just articulated is that there's a lot to go in ZPA, but maybe talk about ZIA. Is there a lot to go there or is that a more mature segment?\nJay Chaudhry: So let's also -- let's start with the second part. That is how much market penetration done and how much market penetration we have left to take. As ZIA was the starting product, obviously, almost all customers start with ZIA though we are seeing some customers starting with ZPA, so the number is relatively small. But take G2K, we reached nearly 35% of G2K, which means there are about 300 companies -- sorry, yes, 300 companies that have spent -- sorry, 35% of them are Zscaler customers. Now about probably an area of 60% of our large ZIA customers also at ZPA. So that's good penetration. But in terms of the opportunity for us, only about -- of the 35% G2K, about 300 of them spend over $1 million with us. That means that of the existing customer, the 400 more that could easily go to $1 million for us. But many of the customers in that same group have gone to $5 million. So what I'm saying, there's an opportunity for us to upsell, go from 35% G2K to a higher number and among those 35%, who sell more ZIA and ZPA. So there's no lack of market for us. Other point I'll make is on the high-end of the market, we do extremely, extremely well. Those customers are sophisticated, they need the functionality, breadth, depth, and reliability and resilience we offer. So we are counting on this thing. Our account-focused program that our new CRO is driving is actually focused on going deeper and wider into our existing accounts and getting new large logo accounts as well. So I hope that gives you the color you're looking for.\nPatrick Colville: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Please proceed.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. And thanks for taking the question. For Jay, Remo, I know you talked about this a bit in the script, but I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about headcount growth in fiscal '25 and where you're really investing most across sales and marketing and R&D? Thanks so much.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. We do expect to increase headcount in fiscal '25. Our fiscal '25 headcount increase will be across all the areas, R&D, sales and marketing, G&A and cloud. I would say the pace of hiring in fiscal '25 will be less than what it was in fiscal '24. In fiscal '24, we added about 1,400 employees. We went from 5,900 employees to 7,300. So I would think about more of a moderate pace in hiring in fiscal '25 versus '24.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question, one moment please. Next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nHamza Fodderwala: Good evening. Thanks for fitting me in. Either for Jay or Remo, curious since Mike and the new sales leadership have been on in the last few quarters. What are some of the early indications that you're seeing early proof points that gives you confidence heading into fiscal '25?\nJay Chaudhry: So good question. Remember when we set out to make some of these changes, the key thing was for us was we wanted to move from early-stage companies that focus on opportunity-centric stuff to account-centric stuff. That was one of the key terms. We have put a program in place. We trained the sales force and we are actually making good progress in pursuing this process. How do you see the results? You start seeing more upsell in the account base plus and then you start seeing new logo as well. So we are seeing good upsell large deals in large accounts, that's what we expected. In fact, if you think about it, our overall number of $1 million ARR customers has gone up to 567 million. Our customers with $5 million or more ARR has gone 260 million. Now all of that is not attributable to the new team because the new team started working for the past couple of quarters, but we're seeing key results for that. The second thing we're seeing as a result is with the GSI involvement, we have a special focus on GSIs, who actually are embedding our offering into their offerings. So it becomes part of their offerings as well. We're seeing good early indications of that. Number three, the quality of sales leaders and reps we are hiring, a number of them come from the background with a focus on account to focus selling and working large accounts to larger deals. We are seeing the quality of those people. So from my point of view, the transition is going better than I expected. I'm very pleased with it and I'm very bullish about it.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: From my perspective. Yes, from my perspective, I'll give you my two sentences and make it really quick. At the end of the day, we've got a great company with a great platform, where significant need of your product on a worldwide basis, that's required, quite frankly. It comes down to one thing and that is people. And I believe what I'm seeing with the leadership that we have, but it's in our go-to-market team across the board. It is -- it is great to see. And really, I think sets us up well going forward. And as Jay mentioned, you know, strong leaders will hire strong people. And I believe the leaderships we have on board is very, very strong.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. I think the comment I'll make is a barrier to entry to do what Zscaler has done is very hard and cyber is becoming more and more important and we are excited for the opportunity ahead of us. With that, I want to thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at one of these investor conferences. Thanks again.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Our Q4 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $593 million, up 30% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 55% of revenue, EMEA was 30%, and APJ was 15%. For the full-year, revenue was $2.17 billion, up 34% year-over-year. Our total calculated billings in Q4 grew 27% year-over-year and 45% sequentially to $911 million. Our calculated current billings grew 27% year-over-year. Like last year, some customers paid us upfront on multiyear deals and the percentage of total calculated billings coming from such upfront payments was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% from a year ago to $4.418 billion. The current RPO was approximately 48% of the total RPO. We ended Q4 with 567 customers with over $1 million in ARR and 3,100 customers with over $100,000 in ARR. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customer's digital transformation journeys. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 115%. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned. Turning to the rest of our Q4 financial performance, the total gross margin of 81.1% compared to 81.4% in the prior quarter and 80.7% in the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin benefited by approximately 60 basis points from a change in our accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 8% sequentially and 26% year-over-year to $353 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model with an operating margin of approximately 22%, an increase of about 260 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 23%, including data center CapEx of approximately 8% of revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Before getting to the details of Q1 and full-year fiscal 2025 guidance, I wanted to share additional context about our framework for billing guidance. We expect full-year fiscal '25 calculated billings of $3.110 billion to $3.135 billion or year-over-year growth of approximately 19% to 20%. We expect first-half billings to be in the range of 39% to 39.5% of full-year billings guide with Q1 to be approximately 16.2% of full-year billings guide. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year billings growth of approximately 13% in the first-half, accelerating to 23% growth in the second-half. In no particular order, I'd like to share three key factors that are driving this acceleration. One, as Jay mentioned, we expect sales productivity to continue to improve with the second-half stronger than the first. We expect this to contribute to strong new upsell and renewal activity in the year; two, our strong and growing pipeline supports second-half acceleration; and three, from a timing perspective, our contracted non-cancelable billings from prior year's active contracts are scheduled to grow 7% in the first-half and 23% in the second-half. This naturally implies a stronger second-half in billings growth, giving a strong visibility into total billings growth in the second-half. Moving on to taxes, please note that we expect to continue to be a modest cash taxpayer in fiscal 2025 with an estimated cash tax of approximately $45 million to $50 million. For non-GAAP P&L reporting, I'd like to call your attention to a change we are making to our non-GAAP tax calculations. Starting fiscal 2025 and going forward, we're establishing a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, which is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2025. Please refer to our earnings release and financial supplemental for fiscal '23 and fiscal '24 comparisons reflecting this new non-GAAP tax rate. Turning to the rest of guidance, as a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $604 million to $606 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 22%, gross margins of 80%. I would also like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX, Zero Trust Branch and cloud and AI analytics will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time-to-market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. In addition, we'll continue to invest in our cloud and AI infrastructure to scale with the growing demand. Operating profit in the range of $114 million to $116 million, net other income of $18 million, income taxes of $31 million. Earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.63, assuming 164 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2025, revenue in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 20% to 21%. Operating profit in the range of $530 million to $540 million, income taxes of approximately $140 million, and earnings per share in the range of $2.81 to $2.87, assuming approximately 164 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be approximately 23.5% to 24%, including higher CapEx this year. We expect our data center CapEx to be approximately 3 points higher as a percent of revenue compared to fiscal 2024, as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we will invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth and profitability. With that, operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes, great question. So I mean, billings guide really reflects, again, we broke out the first-half versus second-half. And you know, as we talked about in the sales organization, we had higher attrition than we expected in Q3 and that attrition has stabilized in Q4. Hiring those account reps, this could to take time for those account reps to basically get to full productivity. We expect them to get to strong productivity in the second-half, our pipeline supports our guidance. And as we called out also, when you take a look at billings, billings is made up of new and upsell renewals and contracted billings. And one of the things we called out on the script is contracted billings are scheduled billings up from prior year contracts. So those are what we're seeing, we're seeing that because of the business is getting more second-half weighted, we're seeing that this -- our guide reflects that. And as we called out, in the first-half, contracted billings is expected to increase on a year-over-year basis 7% and in the second-half 23%. What I can say also is that from my perspective, being here at Zscaler for almost eight years, there's a change in our sales organization. You know, the change is basically it's a more mature, very strong leadership and also an organization that I feel is going to be able to sell deeper into accounts and really sell to the value of Zscaler. So the puts and takes are from my perspective is that strong demand for Zero Trust, we're going to continue to expand in the G2K, which represents around 35% in the Fortune 500 customers. But the key thing with Zscaler also is that we're innovating. So you look at our emerging products, they represented 22% of our total new and upsell in fiscal '24, we expect that to go up to 25%. So that's going to be our continued focus. It's not only selling our existing core products, but also innovating. As I mentioned, strong momentum in the go-to-market team. We just had our SKO and the feedback from everybody who went there was just very, very positive. I just really feel good about where we're at. I mean, having said that, the backdrop, it's still a challenging spending environment. But I feel that Zscaler with our platform with what we're building our go-to-market, I just think we're just very, very well-positioned. Jay? anything. From an NRR perspective, Joseph, 115% I believe is outstanding. We're not guiding to NRR. The only time we really look at it is, as we mentioned before on these calls, really the key for me is just driving top-line business, whether it comes from existing customers or new customers, but 115% at our scale, I think is outstanding. Yes. So it's really -- if you take a look at the call-out is scheduled billings. And scheduled billings growth in the first-half was 7% and scheduled billings growth on a year-over-year basis, we see a 23% for this year. So then the question is step-back and what creates that? So we signed three-year contracts. In the three-year contracts, they're scheduled billings. So we have those scheduled billings. Those billings are coming through. Now, if you take a look and go back into fiscal '23 first-half and fiscal '24 first-half, there were macro challenges. So it's a challenging environment from Zscaler's perspective. So therefore, with that challenging environment, in the first-half of fiscal '23 and fiscal '24, now those scheduled billings are coming through and those scheduled billings are lower. That's what's creating that growth rate of 7% year-over-year in the first-half. Now having said that, what I made to the comment I made before was that the business is getting more second-half. We're becoming a larger company, becoming more second-half. So our guidance reflects that and that scheduled billings of 23%, those are contracted billings, they're scheduled and we expect to get those billings. The trends in August, I'll let Jay speak about that. Q4, we talked about that the quarters have become more back-end loaded. Nothing -- it was similar to the prior few quarters, Q4. So nothing unusual with Q4 from a linearity perspective. And regarding trends in August, we can't give specific trends on dollar amounts or anything like that or business, but maybe Jay can give a few comments. So from my perspective, also Matt, I mean, just some numbers we called out on the script, 567 customers with greater than $1 million ARR, 3,100 customers of greater than $100,000 and I believe 60 -- over 60 customers with $5 million in ARR, half a trillion transactions per day. So to put in perspective, I mean, order of magnitude, that's more than anybody has seen. At the time of our public offering, we're doing 30 billion transactions per day. So we've gone from 30 billion transactions to 500 billion transactions. The data that we receive, the information that we receive that we're able to basically help our customers for a security perspective. So I just don't think there's anybody else out there who can do it. So it's my view that we are in a great position to capture this market. I also believe that with the go-to-market changes that we've made over the last nine months, we're going to sell deeper in the accounts and also we've been one of the things we called out GSIs. That's going to be an area that we're going to focus in on as we go forward. I think the opportunity is really big. I believe the platform is well-positioned to really protect customers and governments throughout the world. And I think, you know, we feel good about where we're at right now. Yes. From a contracted billing perspective, just -- again, the key point is that we signed three-year contracts upfront. And so getting that certainty with that contract is good. And then the billing happens afterwards on an annual basis afterwards. That's the scheduled contract billing. So what we're seeing is our contract lengths are increasing, which is positive. And also we're seeing our deal size increasing, which is positive too. But we're also seeing customers buying more of our product and across our platform with [Technical Difficulty] And again, getting a three-year contract with a scheduled billing gives you certainty related to the billings, but also getting that three-year contract gives you time to basically sell that customer more. And as I mentioned before, which is really key is that the sales organization, go-to-market organization, we're going to be selling deeper into the accounts. That's going to be our focus. We're going to look for new customers, but we're also going to look to sell deeper into our accounts. So longer contracts, it's a good thing. From my perspective. Yes, from my perspective, I'll give you my two sentences and make it really quick. At the end of the day, we've got a great company with a great platform, where significant need of your product on a worldwide basis, that's required, quite frankly. It comes down to one thing and that is people. And I believe what I'm seeing with the leadership that we have, but it's in our go-to-market team across the board. It is -- it is great to see. And really, I think sets us up well going forward. And as Jay mentioned, you know, strong leaders will hire strong people. And I believe the leaderships we have on board is very, very strong. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Ashwin. We delivered a strong Q4 with all metrics exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Revenue grew 30% year-over-year. Billings grew 27% and profitability reached new records with operating margins of approximately 22% and free cash flow margin of 23%. We also achieved a new milestone of $1 billion in quarterly bookings in Q4, driven by an acceleration in new and upsell business in the quarter. For the full-year, revenue grew 34% and free cash flow grew 75%, resulting in free cash flow margin of 27%, a new record for the company. With another year of strong top and bottom-line performance, we exceeded the Rule of 60 for the fourth consecutive year. Despite the recent changes in our go-to-market organization, we delivered these outstanding results, driven by strong customer demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform. I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in go-to-market execution, the pace of innovation and customer adoption of our expanded platform. I'm also pleased to share we crossed $2.5 billion in ARR in Q4, and we expect to achieve a new milestone of $3 billion or more in ARR in fiscal '25. Before getting into further details of the quarter, let me share a few observations on the demand environment. First, customer adoption Zero Trust Platforms is stronger than ever, with Q4 setting a record for new and upsell business. Our platform secures 47 million users across nearly 8,700 customers. While other vendors are still struggling to deliver cloud security for users, we expanded our platform beyond users to deliver Zero Trust security for applications, workloads and, IoT/OT devices. Customers are consolidating their disjointed legacy security products by adopting our comprehensive platform. Second, the increasing use of AI is creating new avenues of growth for us. For example, the rising adoption of Gen AI is exposing new gaps in organizations' security posture. To help our customers address these risks, earlier this year, we launched Gen AI Security, which enables customers to realize the productivity benefits of Gen AI without compromising data security. Using our Gen AI security, customers can gain visibility, apply access control and enforce data protection policies to prevent their sensitive data from leaking. Third, I'm thrilled to share that we have achieved a major milestone with our cloud platform, surpassing over $0.5 trillion transactions daily, that is T as in trillion. This further demonstrates our widening market leadership position. These transactions generate a vast quantity of proprietary loans that feed our massive data lake. These are not firewall logs that often can't inspect SSL traffic for cyber threat detection. These are complete logs that have structured and unstructured data, including the full URL. We leverage this proprietary data to train AI models that power innovations throughout our platform. Our AI analytics solution, including unified vulnerability management, Risk360, Business Insights are seeing strong traction. AI analytics contributed nearly 3 points to new and upsell business growth in Q4 and 2 points for the entire fiscal '24, even though some of these products were only available for a part of the year. I am pleased with the contribution of AI analytics in fiscal '24 and with continued expansion of this solution, I expect its contribution to continue to grow. With an addressable market of $96 billion, we believe we are in the very early stages of opportunity with Zero Trust and AI. The cyber threat environment continues to worsen as the limitations of firewall and VPN-based architecture are exploited by threat actors to launch an increasing volume of sophisticated attacks. Over the last year, we saw an 18% increase in ransomware attacks blocked by the Zscaler cloud. Our season threat research team is tracking 391 of the most sophisticated ransomware families, including many that were uncovered by Zscaler in the past year. Driven by the increased number of cyber breaches, more customers are adopting our Zero Trust platform. For example, in a new logo win, a Top 10 Fortune 500 industry machinery company purchased Zscaler for users for 100,000 users in a multi-year seven-figure ACV deal. The customer previously purchased a firewall-based SASE solution to consolidate firewall, secure web gateways, and MPLS network spend. Subsequently, they realized the so-called SASE solution allows lateral tech movement and does not deliver Zero Trust Security. They chose Zscaler to replace their firewall-based SASE. Our purpose-built proxy-based cloud platform makes our customers' branches and data centers invisible to such actors, hence they can't be discovered and they can't be attacked. In addition to landing new logo platform purchases, we are also upselling our platform. Our land and expand motion creates a flywheel of continuous engagement and upsell. To give you an example, in a seven-figure upsell deal, a Fortune 200 financial services customer bought ZPA and ZDX after their successful ZIA deployment for 68,000 users. After securing Internet and SaaS access with Zscaler, it was natural for them to expand to our broader platform. ZPA for Zero Trust access to private applications, aimed for user-to-application segmentation to eliminate lateral type propagation, and ZDX to quickly identify and resolve end-to-end performance issues. With this purchase, the customer's ARR more than doubled to nearly $10 million. Next, I am happy to share that customers continue to adopt advanced features of our data protection pillar, making it one of our fastest-growing pillars. For example, in a new logo win, an American healthcare provider purchased multiple pillars of our platform, including ZIA transformation, data protection advanced, and ZDX for 124,000 users in a multi-year eight-figure TCV deal. Our data protection pillar was critical to this win due to its comprehensive capabilities, which include securing all types of data whether structured or unstructured. Data in motion or data addressed and data across all channels, including web, email, endpoint, SaaS, cloud workloads and more. Next, let me discuss our emerging products, including ZDX, Zero Trust for Branch and cloud, and AI analytics. I'm delighted to share that emerging products contributed approximately 22% of new and upsell business in fiscal '24, up from 18% in fiscal '23. We expect this contribution to grow to mid-20s in fiscal '25. Our Zero Trust for branch and cloud solution, including Zero Trust for workflows, Zero Trust SD-WAN, and Zero Trust segmentation is driving more and more meaningful wins. Let me share two examples, in an upsell win, a Fortune 500 financial services customer purchased Zero Trust for workloads to protect their on-prem applications. Zero Trust for workloads contributed approximately one-third of the seven-figure upsell ACV deal, which doubled the annual spend of this existing $1 million dollar ARR customer. In another upsell win, a Top 10 pharmaceutical company purchased our Zero Trust SD-WAN solution to protect over 30 manufacturing sites, eliminating the need for firewalls and making each site like a Starbucks. Zero Trust SD-WAN was nearly 50% off the seven-figure ACV deal. Our expanding portfolio of emerging products further strengthened by our acquisition of Avalor and Airgap is opening doors for sales to new customers. With the addition of Airgap, Zscaler is expanding to provide Zero Trust Security inside branches, factories, and campuses, where customers traditionally relied on East-West firewalls and network access control on NAP. By combining Airgap with our Zero Trust SD-WAN, we can not only replace firewalls at the edge, but also eliminate firewalls inside these sites. We are also seeing strong traction for the unified vulnerability management solution we acquired through Avalor. By combining our customers' enterprise security and business system data with our proprietary law data from half a trillion daily transactions, Avalor delivers real-time actionable insights and operational efficiencies for customers to improve their overall security posture. We expect new logo conversations that start with Airgap or Avalor or other emerging products to expand into broader platform opportunities. We will continue to invest in our platform expansion. Moving to the federal vertical, I am excited to share we landed a new cabinet-level agency, increasing our count of cabinet-level agencies to 13. In a seven-figure ACV deal, this customer purchased Zscaler for users for 5,000 users. With over 100,000 employees, this customer presents a significant 20x upsell opportunity. Having landed 13 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies, including the DoD, we see large upsell opportunities in the federal vertical with the increasing adoption of Zero Trust. Building upon our success in the U.S., we are accelerating our public sector go-to-market investments in other nations that are modeling the Zero Trust security initiatives similarly to the U.S. This is a large opportunity for us, but like many government initiatives, this will take time. Now let me share some updates on our sales organization. First, we had lower-than-expected attrition and we had a strong hiring quarter. In fiscal '25, we plan to continue hiring reps at a strong pace and expect attrition to further improve. Second, I'm pleased to report that sales productivity was better-than-expected during the quarter, driven by acceleration in new and upsell business. In fiscal '25, we expect sales productivity to continue to improve with the second-half stronger than the first. Third, we increased investment in the Global System Integrators or GSI channel by hiring leaders experienced in building GSI programs for large enterprises. These hires are driving significant progress in developing mutual go-to-market plans with GSIs that integrate the Zscaler platform with their customers' digital transformation projects. Most large GSIs are already Zscaler customers and that enables them to showcase to their customers the value Zscaler Zero Trust platform delivers. This quarter, we added another large GSI End-User customer, making eight of the top-10 GSIs by revenue Zscaler customers. This GSI purchased Zscaler for users for over 300,000 users, in our largest-ever TCV deal in the services vertical. This GSI is consolidating multiple point products, including secure web gateways, load balancers, VPNs, firewalls, and MPLS network, which is expected to deliver 200% ROI to this customer. I am pleased with the progress we're making in transforming our go-to-market engine to an account-centric sales motion, which is contributing to growth of our large customers. We added nearly double the number of global 2000 logos in fiscal '24 as compared to fiscal '23. We ended fiscal '24 with approximately 35% of global 2000 companies and more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies as our customers. Our customer base spending $1 million plus annually grew by 26% year-over-year to $567 million and we ended the quarter with over 60 customers spending $5 million plus annually. We expect this large customer momentum to continue in fiscal '25. Finally, I want to address the topic of cloud resilience that has come to the forefront due to the recent cloud outages of Microsoft and CrowdStrike. When customers rely on a mission-critical cybersecurity service, there's no room for service interruptions. From inception, Zscaler has built a cloud security platform that has been seamlessly scaling with high-reliability and resilience. Operating such a service is no trivial task and requires years of experience. Unproven vendors, including new entrants and legacy firewall companies, do not have this experience. By operating the world's largest security cloud with superior resilience for over a decade, we have earned the trust of the largest enterprises. This is a clear differentiator for us and is driving the growth of our business. As an innovator and a market leader, in January 2023, we became the first cloud security company to introduce a business continuity service that enables customers to continue their operations even during catastrophic events. In conclusion, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the confluence of two large secular growth drivers, Zero Trust security and AI. We enter fiscal '25 with a stronger go-to-market machine, increased pace of R&D innovation, strong adoption of our emerging products, and high levels of customer satisfaction with an NPS score of over 70. With our customer obsession, expanding platform, and a large addressable market, I expect another strong year, which will move us closer to our goal of $5 billion in ARR. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Saket, thank you. We have not seen any meaningful change on the competitive landscape. In fact, if I would say, as the market is looking for a broader platform that's integrated and it's looking for proven vendor because the resilience has become a very important thing our brand has gotten better. On the high-end of the market, we actually feel like we're very good. We mentioned about the number of new logos. Last year, we added essentially doubled in '24 over '25. We've seen whether the firewall vendors or some other vendors, either they lack the proxy architecture or they lack a multi-tenant architecture. Architecture is critical for win and that's a big advantage for us. Even if you build the architecture the time and experience it takes to build a highly reliable, highly resilient cloud is massive. And then these large enterprises have to trust you. It took us a long time to earn the trust of these customers. So we feel we are in a good position. We keep on innovating the gap between our offering and what I call so would be competitors is growing bigger and bigger. So I feel very bullish and comfortable for the platform and the gap we are creating with other competitors. Yes. Brad, It's a good question after the CrowdStrike out, customers are more focused on resilience, which is our strength. In fact, I personally got lots and lots of calls right after the incident. They wanted to know about what we're doing about it, that we ended up personally inviting actually wide invitation briefing to 1,000 or so our largest customers. I was surprised to see that within a matter of a week or so, about 700 customers registered for the briefings, we ended up doing multiple of them. The main question was, this is mission-critical service and how are we protected? The good thing is Zscaler deliver business continuity plan or DR service in Jan 2023, the first vendor to deliver it, the only vendor that has a true BCP. So the importance of mission criticality has gone up significantly since the outage that was caused by CrowdStrike. In fact, about 40% of Zscalers large customers have already deployed BCP for ZIA. So while our customers want resilience, they also do want consolidation, but they do not want consolidation such that it makes them dependent on a single vendor, especially single vendor for applications and security. This sentiment has become even stronger after the Midnight Blizzard of Microsoft issues. So I think we are well-positioned. We did a good job in building mission verticality. And I think it's important and our customers are working totally with us. No, it's good. I think the last comment I mentioned is, in today's environment, CIOs do want ROI cost savings, cost takeout. We're in a unique position to remove a number of point products that help justify closing our deals. So it's a very good question. So now CrowdStrike wasn't really an issue of putting all of your eggs in one basket. CrowdStrike was one of the point products. Each product must work well. So on one side, customers do want consolidation. If you got two dozen products, they want to bring it down to a handful of key platform providers, but they do not want to go to the extreme of going with a single vendor that wants to sell all security products or a single vendor that wants to sell you all the applications and security products. In fact, most of the CIOs, I want to, they have been standardizing in-line access to three providers, one for EDR, one for identity, and one for Zero Trust actions. I think that's a good combination because you end up getting a couple of extra layers, but you still have separation. So in this environment, our customers aren't really pushing back on us because we tell them don't buy everything through Zscaler. You've got an EDR provider, you've got an identity provider and we'll do the rest of Zero Trust on activity. And that's how we carefully choose the markets we get into. So we feel comfortable and good about the expansion and selection of areas, where we want to compete in. So as I said during my prepared remarks, yes, the macro remains challenging and there's deal scrutiny. But also at the same time, cyber, it's very important. In many areas, good enough is good enough. In cyber and large enterprises, good enough is not good enough. So customers do want a good -- a very good cyber solution. That's number one. And number two, in the cyber area, a real Zero Trust architecture that's cloud native does play an important role that matters. Now, once you do that, your pipeline actually build, you are engaged with customers and the next part comes in, can you close the deal? Now closing the deal in today's environment does require that you are able to actually show the customer that you can take a bunch of products out and you can save money for the customers. And we are able to release. We are able to replace a number of new -- number of products, like the firewalls, VPNs, NAV products, and the like. When we are able to show that we are able to eliminate those products, the customer likes it, that helped us both. No, we have our new and upsell business has accelerated actually. So we are seeing strength in area. So personally, I'm not worried about the competition. I'm able to handle pricing situations by showing the number of products you can move. Think of other vendors. Do you think a firewall vendor who wants to remove a bunch of point products? The biggest installed base in terms of products today is firewalls. They want to protect those firewalls. We take on those firewalls, we take on those VPNs. So we just have to -- this area we keep on getting better at is making sure we engage at the sea level, number one. Number two, make sure we create a good business value assessment and we have owned that process quite a bit. I think nothing unusual to talk about in August. Our business is making progress as usual. So I think you'll probably hear more about us as we get better. Yes, there is no slowing down on consolidation of point products. We have been seeing our deals in general getting bigger. They're seeing upsell going more and more. So if customers spend X, they're spending more with us. I shared several deals, several large deals, where customers started at X and it's gone up to Y or Z and whatnot. So the main thing for customers are looking for consolidation is, number one, can you give me better cyber and data protection? Number two, can I operationally run and manage these things better? Number three, can you do cost savings? That message is loud and clear and we're handling all of that. And for one area I'll highlight for consolidation, which is playing a bigger role for us is data protection. When customers started with Zscaler, ZIA, they started with cyber protection was the primary focus to make sure they don't get compromised. Now with ransomware attacks where data is often ex-filtrated, data protection has become a bigger and more important item than it used to be. Since we are sitting in line for the traffic that goes via the Internet, we are the natural provider, natural partner to do data protection. And we're seeing a growth in data protection that has become one of the fastest growing area for us. I think a few quarters ago, we mentioned that it has exceeded, it has surpassed $4 billion or for us. And also we expanded this platform quite a bit. We used to do in-line DLP as the primary thing. Now we also got DLP or email as a big thing, SaaS, SSPM, SASE kind of stuff and now DSPM are becoming more areas. So I think we've got a great expanding platform with cost-savings, I think they're extremely well-positioned. Yes. Let me start with the platform expansion. As I said during my prepared remarks, most of the vendors are trying to really mature a product for protecting users. They've done that extremely well, 47 million some users protected. So it is natural for us to expand it to our workloads, IoT, OT devices and the like. In terms of growth, to give you some data points, we talk about emerging products from the newer areas and then we've got the mature flagship products on emerging products, which is where the workload protection, IoT, OT type of stuff falls in, it was about 22% in fiscal '24. It had gone up from 18% in fiscal '23 and we expect it to go to mid-20s in fiscal '25. So that's growing faster. That's why it's able to carve out market share out of that. Now the exciting thing about that area is there's literally no real competition to do these things in Zero Trust fashion. Yes, some of the workloads and all this done through firewalls, communication, IoT, OT, what do you do, firewalls and VPNs. We all know that firewalls and VPNs have to go away. And we are well-positioned. It's just that -- it's a little bit different sale. It's the same audience, but a little bit different. IoT, OT, a lot of stuff is linked to manufacturing and plants and the like. So you need to reach out of this audience, but CSOs and CIOs do play a common role with the acquisition of Airgap, which does actually device segmentation for IoT, OT extremely well without needing any firewalls, without needing any network access control devices, it is one of area that's being really showing tons of interest in our customer base. In fact, our number of engagements with device segmentation for IoT, OT based on Airgap has gone up significantly. So that's why I feel like the gap between us and people trying to come from behind is growing and the barrier to entries is not trivial in this space. Remo, you want to talk about the... So very good question. So let's start with ZIA and ZPA. You know at the time of IPO, there was only one product ZIA. ZPA was kind of a rounding error, so to speak. But today, if you look at the mix between ZIA and ZPA, ZPA has gone from literally nothing to about 40% -- over 40% of the new business that we are doing between the two of the products. So that's very remarkable. In fact, if it goes too high-up, I'll be kind of wondering, is ZIA is not going fast enough. So I expect it to grow somewhat more, but not quite. At the end of the day, it could get to 50-50. I expect every Zscaler customer for every user to have ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX, those three products make it a complete package and we call it Zscaler for Users. Zscaler for Users has become our single largest queue basically because that's what our sales team leads with, which really says that our goal is for every customer to buy those three products. That's kind of one key area. Now what is the second part of your question? Sorry, I forgot. So let's also -- let's start with the second part. That is how much market penetration done and how much market penetration we have left to take. As ZIA was the starting product, obviously, almost all customers start with ZIA though we are seeing some customers starting with ZPA, so the number is relatively small. But take G2K, we reached nearly 35% of G2K, which means there are about 300 companies -- sorry, yes, 300 companies that have spent -- sorry, 35% of them are Zscaler customers. Now about probably an area of 60% of our large ZIA customers also at ZPA. So that's good penetration. But in terms of the opportunity for us, only about -- of the 35% G2K, about 300 of them spend over $1 million with us. That means that of the existing customer, the 400 more that could easily go to $1 million for us. But many of the customers in that same group have gone to $5 million. So what I'm saying, there's an opportunity for us to upsell, go from 35% G2K to a higher number and among those 35%, who sell more ZIA and ZPA. So there's no lack of market for us. Other point I'll make is on the high-end of the market, we do extremely, extremely well. Those customers are sophisticated, they need the functionality, breadth, depth, and reliability and resilience we offer. So we are counting on this thing. Our account-focused program that our new CRO is driving is actually focused on going deeper and wider into our existing accounts and getting new large logo accounts as well. So I hope that gives you the color you're looking for. Yes. We do expect to increase headcount in fiscal '25. Our fiscal '25 headcount increase will be across all the areas, R&D, sales and marketing, G&A and cloud. I would say the pace of hiring in fiscal '25 will be less than what it was in fiscal '24. In fiscal '24, we added about 1,400 employees. We went from 5,900 employees to 7,300. So I would think about more of a moderate pace in hiring in fiscal '25 versus '24. So good question. Remember when we set out to make some of these changes, the key thing was for us was we wanted to move from early-stage companies that focus on opportunity-centric stuff to account-centric stuff. That was one of the key terms. We have put a program in place. We trained the sales force and we are actually making good progress in pursuing this process. How do you see the results? You start seeing more upsell in the account base plus and then you start seeing new logo as well. So we are seeing good upsell large deals in large accounts, that's what we expected. In fact, if you think about it, our overall number of $1 million ARR customers has gone up to 567 million. Our customers with $5 million or more ARR has gone 260 million. Now all of that is not attributable to the new team because the new team started working for the past couple of quarters, but we're seeing key results for that. The second thing we're seeing as a result is with the GSI involvement, we have a special focus on GSIs, who actually are embedding our offering into their offerings. So it becomes part of their offerings as well. We're seeing good early indications of that. Number three, the quality of sales leaders and reps we are hiring, a number of them come from the background with a focus on account to focus selling and working large accounts to larger deals. We are seeing the quality of those people. So from my point of view, the transition is going better than I expected. I'm very pleased with it and I'm very bullish about it. Yes. I think the comment I'll make is a barrier to entry to do what Zscaler has done is very hard and cyber is becoming more and more important and we are excited for the opportunity ahead of us. With that, I want to thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at one of these investor conferences. Thanks again."

I also want to inform you that we'll be attending the Bank of America Global Technology Conference, in San Francisco, on June 5. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Ashwin. We delivered an outstanding quarter with all metrics exceeding our guidance. And I'm very pleased to increase our full-year guidance based on our strong performance. Revenue in Q3 grew by 32% year-over-year, and billings grew by 30%. Our $1 million-plus ARR customers increased 31% year-over-year to 523, and we ended the quarter with over 50 customers with $5 million-plus in ARR. Our disciplined approach to growth is reflected in our operating profit which nearly doubled year-over-year, and our operating margin reached a record 22%. I'm also pleased to report that we had our first quarter of GAAP profitability on a net income basis for Q3. Our strong performance was driven by continued demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform, which we purpose-built to secure communication among users, workloads, and devices. We expect demand to remain strong as an increasing number of enterprises are planning to adopt our platform for better cyber and data protection. Zero Trust security remains our top initiative for IT teams as legacy castle-and-moat firewall-based security is ineffective in the new world of cloud and AI. Our Zero Trust Exchange, processing over 400 billion transactions and preventing billions of security and policy violations per day, provides superior security to our customers. For example, last calendar year, our platform prevented over two billion phishing attempts, up 60% year-over-year. The cyber and data protection capabilities of our platform are resonating with customers, and we are accelerating the expansion of our core platform with innovations across multiple pillars. We recently introduced the industry's first AI-powered Co-pilot for ZDX, our digital experience monitoring solution. This helps simplify and automate detection and resolution of performance issues. We added two significant products to our data protection pillar. One, Data Security Posture Management, or DSPM, to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in public clouds; and two, GenAI App Security to provide deep visibility and granular controls for GenAI apps. We introduced Zero Trust Network Segmentation, which expands our platform to local area networks inside branches, campuses, and factories. We expanded our AI Cloud solutions by introducing Unified Vulnerability Management to enable customers to proactively identify critical vulnerabilities. We will continue our rapid platform expansion with organic innovations as well as strategic acquisitions. We recently acquired two early-stage innovators, Avalor and Airgap Networks. Avalor's Data Fabric ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to dynamically prioritize vulnerabilities based on holistic risk. This innovative Data Fabric will combine data from our 400 billion daily transactions with over 150 third-party data sources to add various contexts to provide better understanding of risk for timely mitigation. As a result, customers can get real-time actionable insights in operational efficiencies, improving their overall security posture. For securing customer branches, campuses, and factories, we continue to innovate our Zero Trust Branch solution, released last year, enables each branch office, campus, and factory to be treated like a Starbucks, which means there is no lateral threat movement as the branches are not on the corporate network, and there is no need for firewalls as branches are no longer exposed to Internet. With the Airgap acquisition, we are taking branch security to the next level as we are introducing the industry-first Zero Trust segmentation inside branches, campuses, and factories for servers and IoT, OT devices. This eliminates the need for legacy fiber-based segmentation for East West traffic. We talked about our $72 billion market opportunity in the past. Our recent acquisitions and other innovations increase our market opportunity by several billion dollars as they extend our platform into new adjacent markets including vulnerability management, security operations and branch security. Moving on to our AI innovations, we are developing multiple AI powered applications including Risk360 Business Insights, Unified Vulnerability Management and more. We are training our AI security models with the vast amounts of data generated by over 400 billion daily transactions on our platform to deliver superior threat detection. We are leveraging AI to automatically classify data and enforce policies for better data loss prevention. We have delivered GenAI App Security to enable secured use of AI apps by our customers. Our GenAI App Security delivers one, visibility into the AI services used by employees; two, policy control, which allows different user groups to access only approved AI services from the thousands of such services and three, enforcement of data protection policies to prevent sensitive data from leaking to public AI services. We will be showcasing these and other innovations that combine the power of Zero Trust with AI at our Zenith Live User Conference in June. Organizations are relying on Zscaler to continue to innovate as threat actors are evolving and posing new challenges by frequently exploiting firewall and VPN-based security architecture. Recently, hackers exploited a Zero Day vulnerability of a leading Next-Gen firewall and a vulnerability of a leading VPN. Such exploits put organizations at risk as attackers can move likely on the flat networks created by legacy firewalls. These shortfalls in legacy security will continue to be exploited until enterprises embrace Zero Trust Architecture and phase out firewalls and VPNs. Zscaler's Zero Trust Architecture eliminates lateral tech movement, which dramatically improves security posture of organizations. Our differentiated Zero Trust and proxy-based architecture is foundational to delivering superior security. Let me give you a few examples. After experiencing a catastrophic cyberattack last year, a large financial services new logo customer purchased our ZIA data protection and ZDX pillars for 25,000 users in a seven-figure ACV multi-year deal. This customer wanted Zero Trust Architecture and hence excluded their current firewall vendors from consideration. Our superior architecture and strong data protection capabilities were key to winning this deal as the customer said; Zscaler's CASB, EDM and OCR technologies are amazing. Zscaler just works. In another example, an existing global manufacturing customer after learning about a major VPN vulnerability rolled out Zscaler to 100,000 devices in just three days. Subsequently, the customer increased the purchase of Zscaler for users, including ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Data Protection in a seven-figure ACV deal, increasing their ARR by over $5 million. This customer also made an initial purchase of Zero Trust for branch and our advanced privileged remote access solution, which speaks to customers growing interest in our broader platform. Customers are also purchasing more of our platform to eliminate legacy tech debt and consolidate multiple point products while simplifying IT operations and improving user experience. Let me highlight two upsell deals that illustrate this. After making an initial purchase last year, a Global 100 Financial Services customer significantly expanded the purchase of Zscaler for users in a seven-figure ACV deal for over 64,000 users. Despite having years of relationship with the legacy firewall security vendor, they chose Zscaler. This customer is consolidating multiple point products, including Secure Web Gateway, VPN, and VDI. We work closely with one of our GSI partners on this large project. This deal is an example of us working with GSI partners to expand our market opportunity. In another upsell win, a large APJ-based financial services customer signed a seven-figure ACV multi-year deal for 10,000 users buying most of our platform services. In addition to expanding the purchase of Zscaler for users, they purchased our Zero Trust for workloads, Zero Trust for branch, and AI Cloud solutions. Our emerging products contributed nearly a third of the ACV value of the deal. I'm very pleased to share that we're seeing strong customer interest in our emerging products, which contributed nearly a quarter of our new and upsell business this quarter. Here are a few examples. In an eight-figure ACV deal, a Fortune 500 technology customer expanded the purchase of Zscaler for users and made their first purchase of Zero Trust for workloads and our AI Cloud solutions. With this purchase, the customer's total ARR increased over 5X to more than $10 million. This was also our largest workload protection deal to date, representing seven figures in ACV. I'm thrilled to see our recent innovations in workload protection receiving increased traction. We closed several deals for our AI Cloud solutions, including Risk360 and Business Insights, with customers across multiple verticals, including broadcasting, consulting, insurance, and many more. CISOs get inundated with lots of security alerts and signals that don't help them take specific actions based on risk. Customers are buying Risk360 as it provides them with the overall risk score of the organizations, the factors contributing to risk, and actionable recommendations to reduce risk. For Zero Trust branch, one of the largest retailers in Europe who initially adopted ZIA, ZDX, and Data Protection last year expanded the deployment in a seven-figure upsell deal to include the full suite of Zscaler for users and Zero Trust SD-WAN. Zero Trust SD-WAN, which will be deployed at the regional locations, contributed about a quarter of the ACV value of this deal. Next, in the federal vertical, we are proud to be serving 12 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies, and we continue to pursue new and upsell business opportunities across the federal market to help them adopt Zero Trust architecture as mandated by the President's executive order. To give an example, in a seven-figure upsell win, an existing cabinet-level agency increased the purchase of ZIA and ZPA by over 50%, significantly increasing the ARR of this already $10 million plus customer. Next, let me give you an update on our progress in the Department of Defense, or DoD, segment. DoD has a requirement to implement Zero Trust with the technologies and solutions that work best for individual military services and departments. I'm thrilled to share that we signed a seven-figure ACV deal with the DoD branch this quarter. In this land deal, the customer made an initial purchase of Zscaler for users to protect 50,000 users. With our proven Zero Trust architecture, this latest DoD deal demonstrates that we are well-positioned to capture the large cybersecurity opportunity at the DoD. Next, let me give you an update on our go-to-market organization, where we continue to make great progress. First, to capture the strong demand for our platform and to scale our business to $5 billion in ARR and beyond, we appointed Mike Rich as a Chief Revenue Officer in Q2. Mike hired key leaders in Q3, and he now has his full management team in place. The quality and caliber of Mike's leadership team is exceptional. I'm very pleased with the progress of our sales hiring, particularly at the leadership level. With the right leaders in place, we are now focused on increasing the pace of hiring quota-carrying reps. Second, as I mentioned last quarter, we are evolving our sales motion from opportunity-centric to account-centric. The eight-figure ACV deal with the Fortune 500 technology company that I called out earlier is an example of the success of this new sales motion. We engage closely with this customer to recommend the best solution for now and the future. We look forward to working with them as they are fully embracing digital transformation and Zero Trust security. In conclusion, we are on a mission to take our platform everywhere so customers can benefit from better security, simplified IT operations and improved user productivity. We are one of the few vendors that deliver tangible cost savings as we eliminate multiple legacy point products. The last three decades of the security industry have been centered around firewalls which are no longer effective in today's Cloud, Mobile, and AI world. I believe the next three decades will be defined by Zero Trust architecture. We have the right platform and the right team to delight our customers and capture our large and growing market opportunity. I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to sharing at [XenonFive] (ph) how Zscaler is combining the power of Zero Trust with AI to power the future of secure digital transformation. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Our Q3 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals, the changes in our sales organization, and higher than expected sales attrition in the quarter. Revenue is $553 million, up 32% year-over-year, and up 5% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue, EMEA was 31%, and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q3 grew 30% year-over-year and remained flat sequentially at $628 million. Our calculated current billings grew 29% year-over-year. Our Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, grew 27% from a year ago to $3.824 billion. Current RPO was approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q3 with 523 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR and 2922 customers with over $100,000 in ARR. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation journeys. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 116%. While good for our business, our increased success of selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned. Turning to the rest of our Q3 financial performance, total gross margin of 81.4% compares to 80.8% in the prior quarter and 80.2% in the year-ago quarter, on a year-over-year basis, gross margins benefited by approximately 60 basis points from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, beginning in fiscal 2024, we extended the depreciable, useful life of our servers and network equipment and our cloud infrastructure for four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year to $328 million. We continued to generate significant leverage in our financial model, with operating margin reaching 22%, an increase of approximately 680 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 22%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of our revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Moving on to guidance for Q4 and full-year fiscal 2024, as a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $565 million to $567 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 24% to 25%. Gross margins with 80%, operating profit in the range of $107 million to $109 million, net other income of $17 million, income taxes of $11 million, earnings per share in the range of $0.69 to $0.70, assuming 165 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2024, we're increasing our guidance as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.140 billion to $2.142 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of approximately 32%, calculated billings in the range of $2.603 billion to $2.606 billion or year-over-year of approximately 28%, operating profit in the ranges of $422 million to $424 million which reflects up to 490 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year, income taxes of approximately $32 million, earnings per share in the range of $2.99 to $3.01 assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be in the low-to-mid 20%. We will give specific fiscal '25 guidance on the next earnings call, but I'd like to mention that the increased spend on the data center CapEx, which we'd originally planned for fiscal '24 is now planned for fiscal '25. Q3 was a transitional quarter for our go-to-market team, and I believe we did an outstanding job navigating through it. Although our attrition was higher than we expected, as Jay mentioned, we had a strong quarter hiring, particularly at the sales leadership level. We're now focused on increasing the pace of hiring quota-carrying reps. We believe the combination of our existing sales team with these new hires will result in a much stronger go-to-market organization. That said, new hires will take time to ramp to full productivity, which we believe will result in a few points of headwind to our total billings growth in fiscal '25. With our customer obsession, expanding platform, and strengthening sales teams, we're well positioned to continue to gain share in a large and growing market for us. With that, Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, thanks for taking my questions, guys. Congrats on the quarter, really, really nice to see the results in, obviously, a difficult selling environment. I guess, Jay, I think one of the questions that we often get from investors is around security consolidation. And I think you gave a lot of great anecdotal evidence around success of newer products and the traction you're seeing there. Could you expand upon that and just talk a little bit more about the role of Zscaler in broader consolidation, because it certainly feels like customers want to do more with less, and just how strategic is Zscaler in that initiative?\nJay Chaudhry: Of course, Matt, thank you. Customers do want consolidation and simplification of lots of point products, but they want to do it along best of deep platforms. They don't believe in a single vendor offering the entire, what I may call, God security platform. Our customers are moving a bunch of front point product, the whole DMZ, demilitarized zone goes away. So, we are playing a big role in consolidation, we're taking out lots of firewalls, VPNs, and that's how lots of savings come. That's why we're able to justify the sale of our platform by taking out a lot of products. Now, customers do want two or three tiers of security. That's why often it's Zscaler for inline by a media vendor and identity vendor. But the notion of selling ELA bundle everything doesn't go well. More and more CIO and CFOs are scrutinizing [shelves] (ph) with us being involved. So, consolidation is happening, we are playing a big role, but it's focused, selected consolidation, not a pointblank give-me-everything type of stuff.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here, and echo my congrats on the quarter. Jay, maybe I'll make my question for you, I think we all know your views on firewall-based [SaaSy] (ph) solutions. But I'm curious how you're faring competitively against the smaller competitors here that are maybe more purpose built SaaSy solutions. And do you feel like that the market's view here on pricing is changing at all as we see more of those purpose built SaaSy competitors enter the market? So, the results certainly would indicate so, but just want to hear your view on that part of the competitive landscape.\nJay Chaudhry: So, thanks, Saket. So, yes, small SaaSy vendors, as you know, we play in the large enterprise market. We don't really see some of these small SaaSy vendors that are so-called purpose built. A lot of those purpose-built vendors come from taking firewall as a service into a network together, and all that type of stuff. Part of the challenge I have with the SaaSy thing is that it says SD-WAN soft SFC. My customers, my CSOs believe that SD-WAN enables lateral-type movement. So, where we are headed, we think SD-WAN has to go away, it'll be replaced with Zero Trust SD-WAN. That's the new market segment we are pioneering. So, we will keep on driving innovations. Sometimes investors think that SaaSy of SFC is a static market. They often ask the question, \"Jay, aren't these guys going to catch up with us?\" Of course, they're trying to catch up and do what we did four years ago, but we've done another two years ahead, two years ahead. In the cyber space it's a race, and we keep on innovating at a faster pace. And I don't think smaller SaaSy vendors or firewall vendors will be able to catch up with us.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Great, thank you very much, and it's great to see you guys executing against a tough environment here. But I was taken back by a little bit of the commentary around the higher attrition in your sales organization even as you're bringing in a lot of additional new sales people and sales leadership. So, can you talk a little bit about the mechanics of why that is occurring? Is that a reflection of change on policy? Is it a change in skill sets that the firm thinks it needs? What has caused that attrition, and should we be sanguine when we're hearing that you're seeing accelerating people departing the firm?\nJay Chaudhry: So, Alex, with the departure of our COO, we saw higher attrition in Q3 than expected. But we expect it to stabilize in Q4. It's a combination of factors, including skill set. But I'm very pleased with how well the TTM transition has progressed. With the hiring of key leaders in Q3, Mike now has full management team. As you know, we have a great brand; we are a destination for top talent. With the right leaders in place, we have accelerated our pace of hiring quota-carrying reps in Q4. Our high-caliber leaders are attracting and hiring seasoned reps, and they will play a key role in making us successful to take us from $2 billion to $5 billion. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes, I mean it's a great question, Alex. The attrition is -- you got to keep in mind it's both voluntary and unvoluntary attrition. As Jay mentioned, with Mike Rich coming onboard, he's hired his entire leadership in his first quarter here, his first full quarter. Our focus now is going to be increasing the pace of hiring for quota-carrying sales reps. Just to give you some color, in the first month of this quarter, which is May, we've hired comparably the same amount of reps that we hired in all of Q3. So, what you want to do is you've got to get your leadership in place, because that leadership is going to drive the makeup of the sales and go-to-market organization. As Jay mentioned, the go-to-market organization that we have, I feel very, very good about it, I feel outstanding, quite frankly. Pleased with the work that's being done, the people they're bringing onboard, and the direction we're going, I think, is absolutely outstanding.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. And if I may say, I think I'm very pleased with the transition, is a part of the plan to bring Mike onboard to get to account-based selling.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you, guys so much for taking the question, and congrats especially on all the emerging product success that you're having. Jay, I wanted to follow up on Saket's question, because I think some investors are concerned about intensifying competition in your port market, not just amongst specialized SASE players, but some of the bigger ones as well. And I know Zscaler has always distinguished itself first and foremost on its architectural advantage, Zero Trust Exchange, et cetera. But what can you share with us to help appreciate the durability of that advantage? And maybe for Remo, what quantitative metrics can you share whether it's win rates, pricing trends, sales cycle times or anything else that can help us gauge the competitive environment? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: Okay. So, first of all, starting with, as we said, architecture matters, it's like going from traditional car to electric car. Most of the large vendors are trying to build upon what they have and we don't believe they'll ever get there. Okay. So, that's just the architecture. Number two, the market functionality in this area is not static. It's moving and it's evolving. You recall when we went public six years ago, our platform was relatively small. Look at how market has expanded. And that's only just for users. There's a big market for workload. You saw a number of deals we talked about where workload is taking good traction. Then there are trillions of IoT OT device. We are the right platform; we're expanding in that area. In fact, part of that reason we did Airgap acquisition was to expanding to IoT OT inside the campus, inside the plant to do Zero Trust segmentation, which typically has been done by firewalls. And look at the data protection that area has exploded, nobody comes close to doing data protection as well as we do. So, functionality is number two. The third thing I believe will keep us ahead in the long run is speed of innovation. You've seen how well we have innovated, how fast we've innovated. That's for sure this is not going to slow down. The last point I'll make in this area that I'm extremely proud of, more proud of than any of our financial staff is a Net Promoter Score of 7. Happy Customers Buy More. I'll share one interesting snippet. A few months ago I counted CXOs I have worked with who have bought Zscaler for more than once from us. This is Fortune 1,000 companies, the number I came with 285. So, all this stuff makes me very confident and proud. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. From a win rate basis, they continue to be very high, so no change in win rates. Pricing trends, really not seeing anything from a pricing trend perspective, it's just remaining relatively constant. I think what that speaks to is basically the strategic nature of our platform and what we do for our customers. And also sales cycles, we talked about our sales cycles for large deals of nine to 12 months. We've mentioned a few quarters ago that they're moving more towards that 12 month, really no change there either.\nJay Chaudhry: If I may add a little bit on the pricing pressure, Remo, of course, there is some pricing pressure, but we are focused on value selling. When we are able to go in and say, we are unable to take out ex-million of dollars, what is technology and we'll do it so much in Q1, so much in Q2, so much in Q3, we are able to secure a pretty good pricing. That's the point I want to make. The market scrutiny is there, but my team is doing a good job in showing value to our customer by eliminating lots of point products.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd with UBS. Your line is open.\nRoger Boyd: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Remo, I know you're not guiding to fiscal '25, but you did suggest that the attrition you're seeing in the third quarter here would be a few points impactful of growth next year. I don't think we'll comment on that, but wondering alternatively if you can just talk about your growth versus profitability framework. In the past, you've talked about biasing towards margin expansion under a certain level of growth, but the messaging right now, it sounds like you feel pretty confident about rehiring under the new sales leadership. You're also working on GAAP profitability, a lot of moving parts, but just any thoughts on how you're thinking about that growth versus profitability framework from here would be great. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll focus in on the growth versus profitability, and also the GAAP profit. I think that hits most of your points. From my perspective, Zscaler is perfectly positioned with our platform in its early stages in this emerging market, where we're expanding basically our product base. So, from my view and Jay's view, we will still continue to invest on top-line growth. You saw in Q3, our operating profitability on a non-GAAP basis was 22%. When we went public, we said our operating profitability target was 20% to 22%. We get 22%. I am not concerned about operating profitability. The model basically will increase profitability naturally as the business slows down. So, there's no reason really to focus on operating profitability. And really, the name of the game right now is to continue to invest and build that top-line growth. From my perspective, also on a GAAP profitability, we got the GAAP profitability in Q3, primarily related to stock-based compensation going down to 22% of revenue. That 22% of revenue relates to a reversal of PSUs or certain executives left the company. So, going forward on a GAAP possibility, we will get the GAAP possibility, but I don't want to make any projections of when that's going to happen. Again, the focus is on top line growth and also maintaining operating profitability. For modeling purposes, one of the things I didn't comment on, but I'll comment on now, think about operating profitability going up slightly in fiscal 25. Not a lot. Again, our focus is growth. And as long as we feel we're making the right investments to really exploit this market and increase shareholder value; we're going to continue to do that. So, very, very slight increase in operating profitability is what you should think about fiscal '24 versus fiscal '25.\nJay Chaudhry: And investments in two big areas, keep on innovating at a faster and faster pace, building some of the disruptive technologies that we are so proud of. Number two, keep on investing, go-to-market.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.\nParam Singh: Yes, hi. Thank you. This is Param Singh for Ittai Kidron. First of all, I want to understand your 4Q guidance a little bit. If I just go back the last couple of years, your year-to-year growth rate doesn't change much from 3Q to 4Q, but there's a significant deceleration in your 4Q guide this time. So, I want to understand, is that something that I'm missing outside of say a little bit of conservatism for higher sales attrition that maybe people are not thinking about right now?\nRemo Canessa: Thank you for the question. Number one, we like being prudent. So, that's number one. Number two is Q3 was a very, very strong quarter for us. We beat the basically consensus on a top line basis by 8%. And also, fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we called out that we had a large $20 million deal. So, it's a tough compare from a billing perspective going into -- tough compare for '24 versus '23, and you got the last point, the attrition did play into it also.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Heath with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nEric Heath: Hey, thanks for taking my question, again, just really strong results in acceleration, pretty difficult to compare, so great to see. Jay, I mean, look, the macro environment is pretty tough, so I'd be curious to hear some of your perspective more on the topic and just hear what customers' willingness to do transformational projects like SASE at the moment, especially when they do seem to be hitting the pause button in other areas.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, macro remains tough, [TU] (ph) scrutiny remains high. But the two things that are helping us, one, CIOs, CISOs, and boards remain very worried about cyber with all the ransomware attacks. So, if you play a critical role in minimizing cyber threats, as we do with Zero Trust architecture to minimize lateral movement, we get attention and engagement with C-level. But if then you can show the CXO that you are going to do this cyber initiative, and you're going to save X million dollars, you get more attention. So, those two things are helping us build a strong engagement and pipeline. Even if you do that, the next hurdle is you need to convince the CFO that actually the savings can be done. They're being more scrutinizing, show me savings quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter. We have a strong business value assessment team. We engage with the C-level early on and we show those benefits. Think of this way, how many cyber companies are out there that can actually show tangible savings? You think a firewall company will show savings? No, they want to say protect their firewalls. They don't want to do cannibalization. We can cannibalize. We can actually take out all the firewalls and VPNs and that can media out the world. So, it's a good opportunity. We just want to make sure we have the high caliber seasoned salespeople who can engage with C-level and drive all these initiatives. And that's why I'm so excited about the leadership under Mike and the sales team. We are expanding and growing.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJoseph Gallo: Hey guys, thanks for the question and really nice results, especially in looking at broader software. Jay, how should we think about the sustainability of these growth numbers? And then as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months where are the biggest upside drivers to the top line model? Is it the Salesforce ramping or is it the new products? And then congrats on that quarter of new business coming from emerging, how should we think about that next year? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Sorry, the first part was sustainability of what?\nJoseph Gallo: Sustainability of growth and what the biggest upside level is?\nJay Chaudhry: Okay, all right. The biggest upside, so you mentioned three points there. It's kind of interesting. One is obviously Salesforce matters. It makes a big difference. So, the initiative we're going through with Salesforce, making sure more and more our salespeople are able to engage at the C-level, consultated combined with our GSI initiatives, is obviously a big, big opportunity for us. Then you talked about the emerging products. They're very good. They're actually evolving, they're taking -- they're giving us the results we want. But if you want to ask me what's going to give us the biggest numbers in terms of dollar wise, when emerging stock from small number, they don't move the needle. What's going to move the needle from product point of view? CPA has a strong growth; we still expect CPA to give strong growth. Zscaler digital experience has grown significantly. It will move the needle next year. And the data protection portfolio has become significant. It's pretty sizable. And if you ask me, almost every Zscaler customer over time should have our own data protection because once we are sitting in line for traffic inspection, we are the natural vendor to be doing data protection. And that's another area for growth; plenty of product offerings. The two areas, new area, that can really change things quite a bit for us. Zero Trust segmentation with acquisition of air gap. It's a new market we're entering into so far. We stayed up to the branch. We never went inside the branch. We left the east-west firewalls alone. Now we're going in there, not with a better firewall, but without a firewall doing Zero Trust segmentation. And Avalor opens a whole range of opportunities and Zenith Live will talk more about that, but very, very bullish in the product portfolio. But once you combine your amazing portfolio with a great go-to market team, you've got excellence.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Jay and Remo, I wanted to reconcile the strength in the execution this quarter against the very explicit commentary around higher than expected sales capacity attrition. So, I'm wondering if you can map back to anything internally that helped drive that outperformance on sales execution in spite of sales capacity departure. And maybe specifically, if you can update us on how the verticalization efforts you've instituted in the go-to-market organization? How those has been yielding relative to your expectation? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry: So maybe I can start, Remo, and you come back to it. So, first of all, verticalization, it's a journey as companies grow, they get there. Companies that are more solution-centric, they actually need to be more vertical. We started our vertical journey with the federal market, then we expanded to Fed market and then we recently expanded to health care. And you're going to see some more expansions, but more importantly, you're going to see some more initiatives to accelerate the growth of those markets. It's going very well and Mike Rich and his team come from the previous company where they actually have gone through the vertical journey. So, I'm very comfortable with people pursuing it successfully. Your second question was, in spite of attrition, good numbers, what's involved? Zscaler is not a point product where the sale depends upon the sales rep and SC alone. It's the teamwork we have told you all alone that we require, we have some very seasoned CXOs who have been former CIOs, CTOs, top of people, we need some architects, we had talked about business value assessment. When you have a team like this engaged, the departure of some number of sales people has a limited impact and we are doing very well as you saw from our results.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean just to add on to Jay and just to also confirm from my perspective, the execution that we had in the quarter was outstanding and that's driven for the entire sales organization. It is the new sales people coming on board and our existing sales people. I think one of the things that our execution and the reason that we did well, it really speaks to the strength of Zscaler and our platform and the need of our customers for our service. As Jay mentioned, relationships matter and no company have ever been in my career has the relationships with CXOs that have been as high and a strategic on a worldwide basis, not even close to what we have here at Zscaler. That matters, solution architects matters, architectural workshops matter. There's more -- there's, it is really a team that goes into customers with EBCs. It's really unique company and what we talked about when we're going public is that it's not a box sale and box sales are more, I want to say tactical, let's call it tactical. This is a strategic sell, which really takes the understanding and of companies at the highest level to make these transformational changes. So, I think all of that basically played into our execution.\nJay Chaudhry: And one more comment I'll make. Our customers view us as very strategic and mission critical partner. That being the case, there's a strong engagement and that's why our overall retention is so high.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari with Baird. Your line is open.\nShrenik Kothari: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great quarter. So, Jay, you highlighted data protection in the Q&A. And we are also hearing about the increasing need for kind of very comprehensive data protection. It's been a key focus area for us. It seems like it's starting to pay dividends, it's kind of inflecting up now. So, just curious like as overall AI workloads get bigger and the digital and cloud adoption continues to rise across industries. So, how do you see like new verticals and potentially new use cases that could potentially expand your TAM and also drive growth in the next year, like thinking next year and beyond?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. The new use cases, the new products are definitely increasing our TAM. In fact, if you look at data protection, what it used to be for DLP inline, it's only a piece of it, data at rest, data sitting endpoint, data sitting in public cloud, data loss related to SaaS security, supply chain vendors, it's all expanding DSPM, all of that portfolio that expanded our TAM quite a bit. AI is kind of interesting. It's increasing the TAM itself, but it's also getting embedded in all products. We leverage AI and data protection quite a bit. Workload is growing, we're very bullish about it. A big area of TAM expansion for us is actually Zero Trust per branch. We think this is where we are hit. We believe it's a matter of time in three, four years. Everyone will say, are you using traditional SD-WAN or are you using Zero Trust SD-WAN? We're the only vendor in the market that offers Zero Trust SD-WAN and Copycats will try to come and follow-up in the next three, four years, then we're going to move to the next level. We will talk about probably in coming quarters. But if you asked me to take a guess, Ashwin and I have been debating a little bit. We think we added somewhere in the $10 billion to $20 billion on top of $72 billion we have talked about before.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on the go-to-market side, just anecdotally, we've heard that some of the larger GSIs, folks like Accenture, we just heard that they're fans of Mike Rich. So, I'd be curious, like what can he do better there that maybe Zscaler was not doing before? Just how can you improve those relationships and drive more growth?\nRemo Canessa: Yes, it's a good point. We highlighted last quarter, three things we'll be doing as Mike's key initiative focus from opportunity centric to account centric being one, GSI has been two and verticals being three. All three are making good progress. And GSI know the value we bring to the table. We have been doing a number of deals, but as Jay is always impatient and saying not doing enough deals, we need to do more. So, one of the key that's needed for us would be to bring in some more higher caliber leaders in that space. We have added a number of leaders who comes from having worked with GSIs like Accenture and working with cloud providers at billions of dollars of work in the business. So, expansion in expertise and caliber in that area is going to accelerate our business and we are counting on it.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. This is Patrick on for Josh. Coming back to the competition, we've seen several firewall and VPN based vulnerabilities disclosed from some of your competitors in recent months that offer those solutions. Can you talk about what impact those have had on demand, if any? And then, anything specific to call out in the federal space there as well? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So, it's true. We all have been reading both the vulnerability is coming from some of the leading VPN vendors and some of the fiber vendors out there as well. It has increased demand. The number of engagements we have already closed that came from the VPN vulnerabilities that federal government, CISA issued a directive for, there are number of them in the pipeline. I'm not sure I can give you quantifiable number, but I can tell you it's a meaningful number. Customers now fully understand that whether VPN, on prem or VPN MOS as a cloud service, as a virtual machine is still a VPN and we are replacing a lot of those that becomes a starting point for ZPA. Then they start looking for Zero Trust segmentation and the like. In the federal government, they used it longer than the public and private sector. But public sector has decided to eliminate all of those VPNs that have been deployed out there. We got a number of active engagements going on. You've seen our federal business is going quite well, very pleased with the progress we're making. And CISA combination are playing an important role. Most of our deals there combine both of them. So, any user can access any application from anywhere in Zero Trust fashion.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you for taking the questions. Jay, Workload Protection has done fairly well overall, but historically speaking, the deal sizes have been limited. Given the success that you sort of called out in your prepared remarks, do you think we may be at an inflection point for workload protection? Or does the pipeline suggest that we're still a ways off from that? And then a quick clarification for Remo, if I may, Remo, you mentioned operating profitability going up slightly in fiscal '25. Does that apply to Op margins as well? Or are you saying that we should only expect operating profit dollars to go up slightly? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. In the Workload Protection, a thing I'm very proud of is nobody in the market talks for Zero Trust Communication and Workload the way we do, I guess we like to be pioneers out there. We need to evangelize. The debt market is taking off, it has to take off. The deal size in technology type of companies are getting bigger. The deal size in traditional companies are still smaller because the workloads in production are still coming up, but not as fast. So, I do believe it's a matter of time and almost all of Zscaler customers will be buying our workload product and it will bring a big market opportunities. But I think a number of other products that are probably growing faster than this. I don't want to kind of say it's not good. It is very strategic for us. You're working with the customers. It's a matter of time as revenue starts growing at a faster pace.\nJay Chaudhry: And Gregg, I was referring to operating profit margin percent.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. Thanks. My question is on NRR. You talked a lot about upsell and new products and ability to expand, but your NRR has declined from 120% to 117% to 116% in the last three quarters. How do you connect it to your comments on new products? And on the flip side, the contribution of new customers went up to 50% of your growth this quarter. Can you give us a little bit details on the profile, meaning do you go to different verticals, down market to SMB? Is there any color to this growth with new customers? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes, the NRR at 116%, I think is outstanding. The things that influence NRR and we talked about this many times with our users, basically we're trying to sell the user platform to our customers and that includes ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. So, that is going to influence NRR. Also customers buying within a year doesn't get captured NRR, because NRR is basically a custom device this year versus a year later, but if they buy within the year that could impact NRR.\nRemo Canessa: Having said all that, 116 is a really good number from our perspective.\nJay Chaudhry: And as said over the past many years, the faster you sell, the lower your NRR and the bigger bundle you sell, the lower. So, we look at it as a factor, but it's not the most important factor we track.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the interest of time, our final question will come from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel. Your line is open, Adam.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Adam Borg with Stifel, thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Jay on the Advanced Plus Bundle, I know this is a newer offering, that you talked about a few quarters back and it's a healthy pricing uplift given some of the new AKI capabilities. And I was just curious if you could talk more about how that Advanced Plus Bundle is resonating and kind of what percent of the installed base you think this is really addressable to over time? Thanks so much.\nJay Chaudhry: Overall, our customers are buying bigger and bigger bundles. That's why our pricing is our ARR is going up, because the bigger bundles can take out more products and give them functionality. I'm not sure I have any quantitative data to provide you but actually speaking, bigger bundles are happening. As you listen to our prepared remarks, it's no longer that buying bundles for users along with users, we're selling platforms, selling data protection. And quite often, we begin to sell AI solution like Risk360 and the like as well.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Jay for closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: Well, thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at some of the upcoming conferences. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Our Q3 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals, the changes in our sales organization, and higher than expected sales attrition in the quarter. Revenue is $553 million, up 32% year-over-year, and up 5% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue, EMEA was 31%, and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q3 grew 30% year-over-year and remained flat sequentially at $628 million. Our calculated current billings grew 29% year-over-year. Our Remaining Performance Obligations, or RPO, grew 27% from a year ago to $3.824 billion. Current RPO was approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q3 with 523 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR and 2922 customers with over $100,000 in ARR. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation journeys. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 116%. While good for our business, our increased success of selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start and faster upsells within a year can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned. Turning to the rest of our Q3 financial performance, total gross margin of 81.4% compares to 80.8% in the prior quarter and 80.2% in the year-ago quarter, on a year-over-year basis, gross margins benefited by approximately 60 basis points from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, beginning in fiscal 2024, we extended the depreciable, useful life of our servers and network equipment and our cloud infrastructure for four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 2% sequentially and 21% year-over-year to $328 million. We continued to generate significant leverage in our financial model, with operating margin reaching 22%, an increase of approximately 680 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 22%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of our revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Moving on to guidance for Q4 and full-year fiscal 2024, as a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $565 million to $567 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 24% to 25%. Gross margins with 80%, operating profit in the range of $107 million to $109 million, net other income of $17 million, income taxes of $11 million, earnings per share in the range of $0.69 to $0.70, assuming 165 million fully diluted shares. For the full-year fiscal 2024, we're increasing our guidance as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.140 billion to $2.142 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of approximately 32%, calculated billings in the range of $2.603 billion to $2.606 billion or year-over-year of approximately 28%, operating profit in the ranges of $422 million to $424 million which reflects up to 490 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year, income taxes of approximately $32 million, earnings per share in the range of $2.99 to $3.01 assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be in the low-to-mid 20%. We will give specific fiscal '25 guidance on the next earnings call, but I'd like to mention that the increased spend on the data center CapEx, which we'd originally planned for fiscal '24 is now planned for fiscal '25. Q3 was a transitional quarter for our go-to-market team, and I believe we did an outstanding job navigating through it. Although our attrition was higher than we expected, as Jay mentioned, we had a strong quarter hiring, particularly at the sales leadership level. We're now focused on increasing the pace of hiring quota-carrying reps. We believe the combination of our existing sales team with these new hires will result in a much stronger go-to-market organization. That said, new hires will take time to ramp to full productivity, which we believe will result in a few points of headwind to our total billings growth in fiscal '25. With our customer obsession, expanding platform, and strengthening sales teams, we're well positioned to continue to gain share in a large and growing market for us. With that, Operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes, I mean it's a great question, Alex. The attrition is -- you got to keep in mind it's both voluntary and unvoluntary attrition. As Jay mentioned, with Mike Rich coming onboard, he's hired his entire leadership in his first quarter here, his first full quarter. Our focus now is going to be increasing the pace of hiring for quota-carrying sales reps. Just to give you some color, in the first month of this quarter, which is May, we've hired comparably the same amount of reps that we hired in all of Q3. So, what you want to do is you've got to get your leadership in place, because that leadership is going to drive the makeup of the sales and go-to-market organization. As Jay mentioned, the go-to-market organization that we have, I feel very, very good about it, I feel outstanding, quite frankly. Pleased with the work that's being done, the people they're bringing onboard, and the direction we're going, I think, is absolutely outstanding. Yes. From a win rate basis, they continue to be very high, so no change in win rates. Pricing trends, really not seeing anything from a pricing trend perspective, it's just remaining relatively constant. I think what that speaks to is basically the strategic nature of our platform and what we do for our customers. And also sales cycles, we talked about our sales cycles for large deals of nine to 12 months. We've mentioned a few quarters ago that they're moving more towards that 12 month, really no change there either. Yes. I'll focus in on the growth versus profitability, and also the GAAP profit. I think that hits most of your points. From my perspective, Zscaler is perfectly positioned with our platform in its early stages in this emerging market, where we're expanding basically our product base. So, from my view and Jay's view, we will still continue to invest on top-line growth. You saw in Q3, our operating profitability on a non-GAAP basis was 22%. When we went public, we said our operating profitability target was 20% to 22%. We get 22%. I am not concerned about operating profitability. The model basically will increase profitability naturally as the business slows down. So, there's no reason really to focus on operating profitability. And really, the name of the game right now is to continue to invest and build that top-line growth. From my perspective, also on a GAAP profitability, we got the GAAP profitability in Q3, primarily related to stock-based compensation going down to 22% of revenue. That 22% of revenue relates to a reversal of PSUs or certain executives left the company. So, going forward on a GAAP possibility, we will get the GAAP possibility, but I don't want to make any projections of when that's going to happen. Again, the focus is on top line growth and also maintaining operating profitability. For modeling purposes, one of the things I didn't comment on, but I'll comment on now, think about operating profitability going up slightly in fiscal 25. Not a lot. Again, our focus is growth. And as long as we feel we're making the right investments to really exploit this market and increase shareholder value; we're going to continue to do that. So, very, very slight increase in operating profitability is what you should think about fiscal '24 versus fiscal '25. Thank you for the question. Number one, we like being prudent. So, that's number one. Number two is Q3 was a very, very strong quarter for us. We beat the basically consensus on a top line basis by 8%. And also, fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we called out that we had a large $20 million deal. So, it's a tough compare from a billing perspective going into -- tough compare for '24 versus '23, and you got the last point, the attrition did play into it also. Yes. I mean just to add on to Jay and just to also confirm from my perspective, the execution that we had in the quarter was outstanding and that's driven for the entire sales organization. It is the new sales people coming on board and our existing sales people. I think one of the things that our execution and the reason that we did well, it really speaks to the strength of Zscaler and our platform and the need of our customers for our service. As Jay mentioned, relationships matter and no company have ever been in my career has the relationships with CXOs that have been as high and a strategic on a worldwide basis, not even close to what we have here at Zscaler. That matters, solution architects matters, architectural workshops matter. There's more -- there's, it is really a team that goes into customers with EBCs. It's really unique company and what we talked about when we're going public is that it's not a box sale and box sales are more, I want to say tactical, let's call it tactical. This is a strategic sell, which really takes the understanding and of companies at the highest level to make these transformational changes. So, I think all of that basically played into our execution. Yes, it's a good point. We highlighted last quarter, three things we'll be doing as Mike's key initiative focus from opportunity centric to account centric being one, GSI has been two and verticals being three. All three are making good progress. And GSI know the value we bring to the table. We have been doing a number of deals, but as Jay is always impatient and saying not doing enough deals, we need to do more. So, one of the key that's needed for us would be to bring in some more higher caliber leaders in that space. We have added a number of leaders who comes from having worked with GSIs like Accenture and working with cloud providers at billions of dollars of work in the business. So, expansion in expertise and caliber in that area is going to accelerate our business and we are counting on it. Yes. In the Workload Protection, a thing I'm very proud of is nobody in the market talks for Zero Trust Communication and Workload the way we do, I guess we like to be pioneers out there. We need to evangelize. The debt market is taking off, it has to take off. The deal size in technology type of companies are getting bigger. The deal size in traditional companies are still smaller because the workloads in production are still coming up, but not as fast. So, I do believe it's a matter of time and almost all of Zscaler customers will be buying our workload product and it will bring a big market opportunities. But I think a number of other products that are probably growing faster than this. I don't want to kind of say it's not good. It is very strategic for us. You're working with the customers. It's a matter of time as revenue starts growing at a faster pace. Having said all that, 116 is a really good number from our perspective."

            "content": "Thank you, Ashwin. We delivered an outstanding quarter with all metrics exceeding our guidance. And I'm very pleased to increase our full-year guidance based on our strong performance. Revenue in Q3 grew by 32% year-over-year, and billings grew by 30%. Our $1 million-plus ARR customers increased 31% year-over-year to 523, and we ended the quarter with over 50 customers with $5 million-plus in ARR. Our disciplined approach to growth is reflected in our operating profit which nearly doubled year-over-year, and our operating margin reached a record 22%. I'm also pleased to report that we had our first quarter of GAAP profitability on a net income basis for Q3. Our strong performance was driven by continued demand for our Zero Trust Exchange platform, which we purpose-built to secure communication among users, workloads, and devices. We expect demand to remain strong as an increasing number of enterprises are planning to adopt our platform for better cyber and data protection. Zero Trust security remains our top initiative for IT teams as legacy castle-and-moat firewall-based security is ineffective in the new world of cloud and AI. Our Zero Trust Exchange, processing over 400 billion transactions and preventing billions of security and policy violations per day, provides superior security to our customers. For example, last calendar year, our platform prevented over two billion phishing attempts, up 60% year-over-year. The cyber and data protection capabilities of our platform are resonating with customers, and we are accelerating the expansion of our core platform with innovations across multiple pillars. We recently introduced the industry's first AI-powered Co-pilot for ZDX, our digital experience monitoring solution. This helps simplify and automate detection and resolution of performance issues. We added two significant products to our data protection pillar. One, Data Security Posture Management, or DSPM, to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in public clouds; and two, GenAI App Security to provide deep visibility and granular controls for GenAI apps. We introduced Zero Trust Network Segmentation, which expands our platform to local area networks inside branches, campuses, and factories. We expanded our AI Cloud solutions by introducing Unified Vulnerability Management to enable customers to proactively identify critical vulnerabilities. We will continue our rapid platform expansion with organic innovations as well as strategic acquisitions. We recently acquired two early-stage innovators, Avalor and Airgap Networks. Avalor's Data Fabric ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to dynamically prioritize vulnerabilities based on holistic risk. This innovative Data Fabric will combine data from our 400 billion daily transactions with over 150 third-party data sources to add various contexts to provide better understanding of risk for timely mitigation. As a result, customers can get real-time actionable insights in operational efficiencies, improving their overall security posture. For securing customer branches, campuses, and factories, we continue to innovate our Zero Trust Branch solution, released last year, enables each branch office, campus, and factory to be treated like a Starbucks, which means there is no lateral threat movement as the branches are not on the corporate network, and there is no need for firewalls as branches are no longer exposed to Internet. With the Airgap acquisition, we are taking branch security to the next level as we are introducing the industry-first Zero Trust segmentation inside branches, campuses, and factories for servers and IoT, OT devices. This eliminates the need for legacy fiber-based segmentation for East West traffic. We talked about our $72 billion market opportunity in the past. Our recent acquisitions and other innovations increase our market opportunity by several billion dollars as they extend our platform into new adjacent markets including vulnerability management, security operations and branch security. Moving on to our AI innovations, we are developing multiple AI powered applications including Risk360 Business Insights, Unified Vulnerability Management and more. We are training our AI security models with the vast amounts of data generated by over 400 billion daily transactions on our platform to deliver superior threat detection. We are leveraging AI to automatically classify data and enforce policies for better data loss prevention. We have delivered GenAI App Security to enable secured use of AI apps by our customers. Our GenAI App Security delivers one, visibility into the AI services used by employees; two, policy control, which allows different user groups to access only approved AI services from the thousands of such services and three, enforcement of data protection policies to prevent sensitive data from leaking to public AI services. We will be showcasing these and other innovations that combine the power of Zero Trust with AI at our Zenith Live User Conference in June. Organizations are relying on Zscaler to continue to innovate as threat actors are evolving and posing new challenges by frequently exploiting firewall and VPN-based security architecture. Recently, hackers exploited a Zero Day vulnerability of a leading Next-Gen firewall and a vulnerability of a leading VPN. Such exploits put organizations at risk as attackers can move likely on the flat networks created by legacy firewalls. These shortfalls in legacy security will continue to be exploited until enterprises embrace Zero Trust Architecture and phase out firewalls and VPNs. Zscaler's Zero Trust Architecture eliminates lateral tech movement, which dramatically improves security posture of organizations. Our differentiated Zero Trust and proxy-based architecture is foundational to delivering superior security. Let me give you a few examples. After experiencing a catastrophic cyberattack last year, a large financial services new logo customer purchased our ZIA data protection and ZDX pillars for 25,000 users in a seven-figure ACV multi-year deal. This customer wanted Zero Trust Architecture and hence excluded their current firewall vendors from consideration. Our superior architecture and strong data protection capabilities were key to winning this deal as the customer said; Zscaler's CASB, EDM and OCR technologies are amazing. Zscaler just works. In another example, an existing global manufacturing customer after learning about a major VPN vulnerability rolled out Zscaler to 100,000 devices in just three days. Subsequently, the customer increased the purchase of Zscaler for users, including ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Data Protection in a seven-figure ACV deal, increasing their ARR by over $5 million. This customer also made an initial purchase of Zero Trust for branch and our advanced privileged remote access solution, which speaks to customers growing interest in our broader platform. Customers are also purchasing more of our platform to eliminate legacy tech debt and consolidate multiple point products while simplifying IT operations and improving user experience. Let me highlight two upsell deals that illustrate this. After making an initial purchase last year, a Global 100 Financial Services customer significantly expanded the purchase of Zscaler for users in a seven-figure ACV deal for over 64,000 users. Despite having years of relationship with the legacy firewall security vendor, they chose Zscaler. This customer is consolidating multiple point products, including Secure Web Gateway, VPN, and VDI. We work closely with one of our GSI partners on this large project. This deal is an example of us working with GSI partners to expand our market opportunity. In another upsell win, a large APJ-based financial services customer signed a seven-figure ACV multi-year deal for 10,000 users buying most of our platform services. In addition to expanding the purchase of Zscaler for users, they purchased our Zero Trust for workloads, Zero Trust for branch, and AI Cloud solutions. Our emerging products contributed nearly a third of the ACV value of the deal. I'm very pleased to share that we're seeing strong customer interest in our emerging products, which contributed nearly a quarter of our new and upsell business this quarter. Here are a few examples. In an eight-figure ACV deal, a Fortune 500 technology customer expanded the purchase of Zscaler for users and made their first purchase of Zero Trust for workloads and our AI Cloud solutions. With this purchase, the customer's total ARR increased over 5X to more than $10 million. This was also our largest workload protection deal to date, representing seven figures in ACV. I'm thrilled to see our recent innovations in workload protection receiving increased traction. We closed several deals for our AI Cloud solutions, including Risk360 and Business Insights, with customers across multiple verticals, including broadcasting, consulting, insurance, and many more. CISOs get inundated with lots of security alerts and signals that don't help them take specific actions based on risk. Customers are buying Risk360 as it provides them with the overall risk score of the organizations, the factors contributing to risk, and actionable recommendations to reduce risk. For Zero Trust branch, one of the largest retailers in Europe who initially adopted ZIA, ZDX, and Data Protection last year expanded the deployment in a seven-figure upsell deal to include the full suite of Zscaler for users and Zero Trust SD-WAN. Zero Trust SD-WAN, which will be deployed at the regional locations, contributed about a quarter of the ACV value of this deal. Next, in the federal vertical, we are proud to be serving 12 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies, and we continue to pursue new and upsell business opportunities across the federal market to help them adopt Zero Trust architecture as mandated by the President's executive order. To give an example, in a seven-figure upsell win, an existing cabinet-level agency increased the purchase of ZIA and ZPA by over 50%, significantly increasing the ARR of this already $10 million plus customer. Next, let me give you an update on our progress in the Department of Defense, or DoD, segment. DoD has a requirement to implement Zero Trust with the technologies and solutions that work best for individual military services and departments. I'm thrilled to share that we signed a seven-figure ACV deal with the DoD branch this quarter. In this land deal, the customer made an initial purchase of Zscaler for users to protect 50,000 users. With our proven Zero Trust architecture, this latest DoD deal demonstrates that we are well-positioned to capture the large cybersecurity opportunity at the DoD. Next, let me give you an update on our go-to-market organization, where we continue to make great progress. First, to capture the strong demand for our platform and to scale our business to $5 billion in ARR and beyond, we appointed Mike Rich as a Chief Revenue Officer in Q2. Mike hired key leaders in Q3, and he now has his full management team in place. The quality and caliber of Mike's leadership team is exceptional. I'm very pleased with the progress of our sales hiring, particularly at the leadership level. With the right leaders in place, we are now focused on increasing the pace of hiring quota-carrying reps. Second, as I mentioned last quarter, we are evolving our sales motion from opportunity-centric to account-centric. The eight-figure ACV deal with the Fortune 500 technology company that I called out earlier is an example of the success of this new sales motion. We engage closely with this customer to recommend the best solution for now and the future. We look forward to working with them as they are fully embracing digital transformation and Zero Trust security. In conclusion, we are on a mission to take our platform everywhere so customers can benefit from better security, simplified IT operations and improved user productivity. We are one of the few vendors that deliver tangible cost savings as we eliminate multiple legacy point products. The last three decades of the security industry have been centered around firewalls which are no longer effective in today's Cloud, Mobile, and AI world. I believe the next three decades will be defined by Zero Trust architecture. We have the right platform and the right team to delight our customers and capture our large and growing market opportunity. I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to sharing at [XenonFive] (ph) how Zscaler is combining the power of Zero Trust with AI to power the future of secure digital transformation. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Of course, Matt, thank you. Customers do want consolidation and simplification of lots of point products, but they want to do it along best of deep platforms. They don't believe in a single vendor offering the entire, what I may call, God security platform. Our customers are moving a bunch of front point product, the whole DMZ, demilitarized zone goes away. So, we are playing a big role in consolidation, we're taking out lots of firewalls, VPNs, and that's how lots of savings come. That's why we're able to justify the sale of our platform by taking out a lot of products. Now, customers do want two or three tiers of security. That's why often it's Zscaler for inline by a media vendor and identity vendor. But the notion of selling ELA bundle everything doesn't go well. More and more CIO and CFOs are scrutinizing [shelves] (ph) with us being involved. So, consolidation is happening, we are playing a big role, but it's focused, selected consolidation, not a pointblank give-me-everything type of stuff. So, thanks, Saket. So, yes, small SaaSy vendors, as you know, we play in the large enterprise market. We don't really see some of these small SaaSy vendors that are so-called purpose built. A lot of those purpose-built vendors come from taking firewall as a service into a network together, and all that type of stuff. Part of the challenge I have with the SaaSy thing is that it says SD-WAN soft SFC. My customers, my CSOs believe that SD-WAN enables lateral-type movement. So, where we are headed, we think SD-WAN has to go away, it'll be replaced with Zero Trust SD-WAN. That's the new market segment we are pioneering. So, we will keep on driving innovations. Sometimes investors think that SaaSy of SFC is a static market. They often ask the question, \"Jay, aren't these guys going to catch up with us?\" Of course, they're trying to catch up and do what we did four years ago, but we've done another two years ahead, two years ahead. In the cyber space it's a race, and we keep on innovating at a faster pace. And I don't think smaller SaaSy vendors or firewall vendors will be able to catch up with us. So, Alex, with the departure of our COO, we saw higher attrition in Q3 than expected. But we expect it to stabilize in Q4. It's a combination of factors, including skill set. But I'm very pleased with how well the TTM transition has progressed. With the hiring of key leaders in Q3, Mike now has full management team. As you know, we have a great brand; we are a destination for top talent. With the right leaders in place, we have accelerated our pace of hiring quota-carrying reps in Q4. Our high-caliber leaders are attracting and hiring seasoned reps, and they will play a key role in making us successful to take us from $2 billion to $5 billion. Remo? Yes. And if I may say, I think I'm very pleased with the transition, is a part of the plan to bring Mike onboard to get to account-based selling. Okay. So, first of all, starting with, as we said, architecture matters, it's like going from traditional car to electric car. Most of the large vendors are trying to build upon what they have and we don't believe they'll ever get there. Okay. So, that's just the architecture. Number two, the market functionality in this area is not static. It's moving and it's evolving. You recall when we went public six years ago, our platform was relatively small. Look at how market has expanded. And that's only just for users. There's a big market for workload. You saw a number of deals we talked about where workload is taking good traction. Then there are trillions of IoT OT device. We are the right platform; we're expanding in that area. In fact, part of that reason we did Airgap acquisition was to expanding to IoT OT inside the campus, inside the plant to do Zero Trust segmentation, which typically has been done by firewalls. And look at the data protection that area has exploded, nobody comes close to doing data protection as well as we do. So, functionality is number two. The third thing I believe will keep us ahead in the long run is speed of innovation. You've seen how well we have innovated, how fast we've innovated. That's for sure this is not going to slow down. The last point I'll make in this area that I'm extremely proud of, more proud of than any of our financial staff is a Net Promoter Score of 7. Happy Customers Buy More. I'll share one interesting snippet. A few months ago I counted CXOs I have worked with who have bought Zscaler for more than once from us. This is Fortune 1,000 companies, the number I came with 285. So, all this stuff makes me very confident and proud. Remo? If I may add a little bit on the pricing pressure, Remo, of course, there is some pricing pressure, but we are focused on value selling. When we are able to go in and say, we are unable to take out ex-million of dollars, what is technology and we'll do it so much in Q1, so much in Q2, so much in Q3, we are able to secure a pretty good pricing. That's the point I want to make. The market scrutiny is there, but my team is doing a good job in showing value to our customer by eliminating lots of point products. And investments in two big areas, keep on innovating at a faster and faster pace, building some of the disruptive technologies that we are so proud of. Number two, keep on investing, go-to-market. Yes, macro remains tough, [TU] (ph) scrutiny remains high. But the two things that are helping us, one, CIOs, CISOs, and boards remain very worried about cyber with all the ransomware attacks. So, if you play a critical role in minimizing cyber threats, as we do with Zero Trust architecture to minimize lateral movement, we get attention and engagement with C-level. But if then you can show the CXO that you are going to do this cyber initiative, and you're going to save X million dollars, you get more attention. So, those two things are helping us build a strong engagement and pipeline. Even if you do that, the next hurdle is you need to convince the CFO that actually the savings can be done. They're being more scrutinizing, show me savings quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter. We have a strong business value assessment team. We engage with the C-level early on and we show those benefits. Think of this way, how many cyber companies are out there that can actually show tangible savings? You think a firewall company will show savings? No, they want to say protect their firewalls. They don't want to do cannibalization. We can cannibalize. We can actually take out all the firewalls and VPNs and that can media out the world. So, it's a good opportunity. We just want to make sure we have the high caliber seasoned salespeople who can engage with C-level and drive all these initiatives. And that's why I'm so excited about the leadership under Mike and the sales team. We are expanding and growing. Sorry, the first part was sustainability of what? Okay, all right. The biggest upside, so you mentioned three points there. It's kind of interesting. One is obviously Salesforce matters. It makes a big difference. So, the initiative we're going through with Salesforce, making sure more and more our salespeople are able to engage at the C-level, consultated combined with our GSI initiatives, is obviously a big, big opportunity for us. Then you talked about the emerging products. They're very good. They're actually evolving, they're taking -- they're giving us the results we want. But if you want to ask me what's going to give us the biggest numbers in terms of dollar wise, when emerging stock from small number, they don't move the needle. What's going to move the needle from product point of view? CPA has a strong growth; we still expect CPA to give strong growth. Zscaler digital experience has grown significantly. It will move the needle next year. And the data protection portfolio has become significant. It's pretty sizable. And if you ask me, almost every Zscaler customer over time should have our own data protection because once we are sitting in line for traffic inspection, we are the natural vendor to be doing data protection. And that's another area for growth; plenty of product offerings. The two areas, new area, that can really change things quite a bit for us. Zero Trust segmentation with acquisition of air gap. It's a new market we're entering into so far. We stayed up to the branch. We never went inside the branch. We left the east-west firewalls alone. Now we're going in there, not with a better firewall, but without a firewall doing Zero Trust segmentation. And Avalor opens a whole range of opportunities and Zenith Live will talk more about that, but very, very bullish in the product portfolio. But once you combine your amazing portfolio with a great go-to market team, you've got excellence. So maybe I can start, Remo, and you come back to it. So, first of all, verticalization, it's a journey as companies grow, they get there. Companies that are more solution-centric, they actually need to be more vertical. We started our vertical journey with the federal market, then we expanded to Fed market and then we recently expanded to health care. And you're going to see some more expansions, but more importantly, you're going to see some more initiatives to accelerate the growth of those markets. It's going very well and Mike Rich and his team come from the previous company where they actually have gone through the vertical journey. So, I'm very comfortable with people pursuing it successfully. Your second question was, in spite of attrition, good numbers, what's involved? Zscaler is not a point product where the sale depends upon the sales rep and SC alone. It's the teamwork we have told you all alone that we require, we have some very seasoned CXOs who have been former CIOs, CTOs, top of people, we need some architects, we had talked about business value assessment. When you have a team like this engaged, the departure of some number of sales people has a limited impact and we are doing very well as you saw from our results. And one more comment I'll make. Our customers view us as very strategic and mission critical partner. That being the case, there's a strong engagement and that's why our overall retention is so high. Yes. The new use cases, the new products are definitely increasing our TAM. In fact, if you look at data protection, what it used to be for DLP inline, it's only a piece of it, data at rest, data sitting endpoint, data sitting in public cloud, data loss related to SaaS security, supply chain vendors, it's all expanding DSPM, all of that portfolio that expanded our TAM quite a bit. AI is kind of interesting. It's increasing the TAM itself, but it's also getting embedded in all products. We leverage AI and data protection quite a bit. Workload is growing, we're very bullish about it. A big area of TAM expansion for us is actually Zero Trust per branch. We think this is where we are hit. We believe it's a matter of time in three, four years. Everyone will say, are you using traditional SD-WAN or are you using Zero Trust SD-WAN? We're the only vendor in the market that offers Zero Trust SD-WAN and Copycats will try to come and follow-up in the next three, four years, then we're going to move to the next level. We will talk about probably in coming quarters. But if you asked me to take a guess, Ashwin and I have been debating a little bit. We think we added somewhere in the $10 billion to $20 billion on top of $72 billion we have talked about before. Yes. So, it's true. We all have been reading both the vulnerability is coming from some of the leading VPN vendors and some of the fiber vendors out there as well. It has increased demand. The number of engagements we have already closed that came from the VPN vulnerabilities that federal government, CISA issued a directive for, there are number of them in the pipeline. I'm not sure I can give you quantifiable number, but I can tell you it's a meaningful number. Customers now fully understand that whether VPN, on prem or VPN MOS as a cloud service, as a virtual machine is still a VPN and we are replacing a lot of those that becomes a starting point for ZPA. Then they start looking for Zero Trust segmentation and the like. In the federal government, they used it longer than the public and private sector. But public sector has decided to eliminate all of those VPNs that have been deployed out there. We got a number of active engagements going on. You've seen our federal business is going quite well, very pleased with the progress we're making. And CISA combination are playing an important role. Most of our deals there combine both of them. So, any user can access any application from anywhere in Zero Trust fashion. And Gregg, I was referring to operating profit margin percent. Yes, the NRR at 116%, I think is outstanding. The things that influence NRR and we talked about this many times with our users, basically we're trying to sell the user platform to our customers and that includes ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. So, that is going to influence NRR. Also customers buying within a year doesn't get captured NRR, because NRR is basically a custom device this year versus a year later, but if they buy within the year that could impact NRR. And as said over the past many years, the faster you sell, the lower your NRR and the bigger bundle you sell, the lower. So, we look at it as a factor, but it's not the most important factor we track. Overall, our customers are buying bigger and bigger bundles. That's why our pricing is our ARR is going up, because the bigger bundles can take out more products and give them functionality. I'm not sure I have any quantitative data to provide you but actually speaking, bigger bundles are happening. As you listen to our prepared remarks, it's no longer that buying bundles for users along with users, we're selling platforms, selling data protection. And quite often, we begin to sell AI solution like Risk360 and the like as well. Well, thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at some of the upcoming conferences. Thank you."

JMP Technology Conference in San Francisco on March 4th, and Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco on March 6th. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry : Thank you, Bill. I am pleased to share our Q2 results, which once again exceeded our guidance for the top line and the bottom line, even amidst an ongoing, challenging macro environment. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year, and billings grew by 27%. Our customer base spending $1 million or more continues to grow by over 30%. Our operating profit more than doubled year-over-year, and our free cash flow margin reached are record for Q2. During the quarter, we made solid progress on our strategy to scale our go-to-market engine to reach our goal of $5 billion and beyond in ARR. To augment our already strong sales team, we're adding more experienced leaders with a proven track record of running large operations. Considering these leadership changes, I am particularly proud of our field sales execution this quarter. Before getting to the details of our fiscal Q2, let me share a few observations on the business environment. Based on my conversations with hundreds of CIOs and CISOs, I expect demand for Zero-Trust security to remain robust in 2024 and expect customer budgets for Zero-Trust to be up this year, particularly in light of the recent surge in the number of high-profile breaches. Threat actors continue to exploit vulnerabilities of firewalls and VPNs, which allow them to spread ransomware laterally inside an organization. In a recent example, a VPN vulnerability was so severe that CISA, the U.S. Cybersecurity agency, took the extraordinary step of mandating that federal civilian agencies disconnect their Ivanti Pulse Secure VPNs within 48 hours. This is yet another example of why customers are increasingly realizing that their security posture remains vulnerable and are motivated to transform their firewall-based security to our Zero Trust Architecture. Spinning up firewalls and VPNs in the cloud and calling it a sassy solution doesn't solve cybersecurity challenges. While customers want to consolidate point products, they're looking for a fully integrated platform that delivers zero trust architecture. Cyber is so mission critical that customers will invest in the industry-leading solutions rather than rely on cheaper or less effective products that are included as part of their ELAs. They want best-of-breed platforms with the best functionality that integrate with other platforms, thus eliminating dozens of point products. Zscaler's Zero Trust platform is an integrated and purpose-built solution that delivers comprehensive security and provides a compelling user experience while reducing cost. Strong customer interest in our platform drove a record first-half total bookings with nearly half of net new bookings coming from new logo customers. We added a record number of new logos for our Q2. This demonstrates the momentum in our business and we're increasing our outlook for revenue and billings for fiscal 2024. We are operating in a strong demand environment for zero trust architecture. To capture this demand and scale our business to $5 billion ARR and beyond, we appointed Mike Rich as our Chief Revenue Officer last quarter. Mike joined us from ServiceNow where he established a scalable go-to-market engine to drive deeper engagements with large enterprises. Going forward, Mike and his team are focusing on three key areas. First, our existing opportunity-led sales engine has helped us deliver strong growth over the years, enabling us to surpass $2 billion in ARR. To drive our next phase of growth, we are evolving from an opportunity-centric to an account-centric sales motion, leveraging Mike's experience in building such plans. As we grow our sales organization, we are adding more experienced leaders and strategic sellers with the right level of experience working with CXOs and global system integrators. As we begin our planning for fiscal \u201825, we are developing account plans that are aligned with our customers' long-term strategic initiatives and we are partnering with our customers to build transformation roadmaps to modernize their security and IT infrastructure. Second, we launched our top accounts pilot program a couple of quarters ago, which is successfully driving deeper platform engagements and adoption. Building upon our initial success and leveraging Mike's experience, we are scaling this program across more top accounts. Third, we are increasing our focus on vertical selling. We introduced a vertical specific sales motion a few years ago, starting with the public sector and expanded it to the healthcare vertical last year. Based upon the successful growth in these verticals, we plan to continue to expand program into more verticals by adding domain experts who can drive vertical specific strategies to better align with our customers' strategic initiatives. We now have a double-digit number of customers spending more than $10 million with us annually. With our expanded platform and these go-to-market initiatives, I believe we will see more and more of our large enterprise customers reach $10 million ARR levels over time. Now let me highlight three factors that drove our performance in Q2. First, we are seeing continued success in selling our broader platform, including ZPA, Data Protection, CDX, Zero Trust for Workloads, Zero Trust for Branch, and AI -powered solutions. Driven by upsells, our $1 million ARR customer count grew by 31% year-over-year ending the quarter with nearly 500 such customers. Second, we had a strong federal quarter with particular strength in upsells to cabinet level agencies. We have plenty of opportunity to expand further in the federal market. Third, we achieved a Q2 record for new logo additions, deflecting early success with our channel investments. Our $100, 000 or more ARR customer base grew 21% year-over-year, ending the quarter with over 2, 800 such customers. Let me highlight two new logo deals from the quarter. First, a Fortune 100 Health Care customer purchased ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Advanced Data Protection for 10, 000 users in a 7-figure ACV deal. ZPA will greatly enhance their security and user experience while eliminating legacy security gateways by consolidating the VPN and VDI appliances. Protecting patient healthcare records is of paramount importance to this customer, which made data protection a crucial consideration for this deal. For the next phase, they are planning to expand to over 100, 000 users, representing a significant upsell opportunity for us. In another new logo deal, after suffering repeated ransomware attacks, a technology company purchased 20, 000 seats of ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Advanced Data Protection. They're phasing out the legacy castle-and-moat firewall-based security, which failed to protect them against ransomware attacks. This customer excluded the incumbent firewall-based SASE vendor from consideration, as they wanted a true Zero Trust architecture. This is a multiyear 8-figure TCV deal, which is expected to generate over 100% ROI for the customer by eliminating the multiple-figure ACV deal. Now, let me highlight two upsell deals that highlight broader adoption of our comprehensive platform. In a 7-figure ACV deal, an existing Fortune 500 Financial services enterprise, currently using ZIA, ZPA and Data Protection, upgraded to our high-end ZPA Transformation bundle and added Endpoint DLP for 73, 000 users. This also marks our largest Endpoint DLP deal since the introduction of this module just two quarters ago in our Data Protection solution. By moving to the high-end of our ZPA and Data Protection packages, this customer increased their annual spend with us by over 60% to over $10 million annually. In another 7-figure ACV deal, a major global mining company increased their ZIA and ZDX purchases to 48, 000 users and purchased ZPA transformation for 30, 000 users. With the ZPA purchase, the customer is eliminating their VPN appliances and providing Zero Trust access for their workforce spread across remote locations worldwide. With this expanded purchase of our platform, the customer\u2019s annual spend with us nearly doubled to approximately $5 million. Next, let me discuss our opportunities in the Federal market. As I mentioned earlier, we saw strong growth in net new ACV from the Federal vertical in Q2. After our initial lands at 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies, we continue to win additional awards as agencies are increasingly adopting Zero Trust architecture to meet the President\u2019s Executive Order. For example, in a seven-figure upsell deal, an agency customer expanded their seats with ZIA, ZPA and Data Protection purchases, nearly doubling their annual spend with us. With this upsell, the customer is already approaching $5 million in annual spend, even though we are still less than 15% penetrated in terms of the number of users, representing a significant upsell opportunity in this agency. With the highest levels of FedRAMP certifications for both ZIA and ZPA, we are very well positioned to benefit from continued growth with our federal customers. Building upon our success in the US, we are investing in building public sector programs for half a dozen nations that have adopted FedRAMP like certification programs. This is a significant opportunity for us, but like any government initiative this will take time. Moving on, our R&D engine continues to deliver innovations, rapidly expanding our platform and providing larger upsell opportunities. Given our strategic position, we are interacting with more CXOs than ever before and having much deeper engagements. For example, we recently hosted a CXO summit in India, attended by over 200 senior IT leaders, including over 100 CXOs. At the summit, one CXO said and I quote the velocity of features that Zscaler releases every time we meet is extremely impressive. Our comprehensive platform protects not just users, but also workloads, and IoT/OT devices. While still early, we are seeing growing traction in our emerging platform solutions, including Zero Trust for Workloads, Zero Trust for Branch and Zero Trust for B2B, as well as our AI/ML powered solutions. Zero Trust for Workloads continues to gain wider adoption. For example, in an upsell win, a financial technology company purchased Zero Trust for Workloads for 25, 000 workloads, which contributed to nearly doubling their annual spend with us to over $1 million. A large aerospace company more than tripled their Zero Trust for Workloads purchase, contributing to a 60% increase in their annual spend with us to over $1 million. In January, we launched Zero Trust for Branch which enables one-to-one connectivity between branch devices and applications, thus securing branch IoT/OT devices and eliminating the risk of lateral threat movement. Our Zscaler plug-and-play appliance would be the only solution customers will need at the branch, as it eliminates the need for legacy SD-WAN appliances, routers, and firewalls, thus dramatically simplifying branch networking and security. Zero Trust for branch is a key component of our Zero Trust SASE solution, which is the industry\u2019s first single vendor SASE solution built on Zero Trust. Zero Trust SASE pairs Zscaler\u2019s leading SSE with our new Zero Trust SD-WAN. We have seen early adoption of our Zero Trust SASE from customers across a range of industries including: A U.S. based Energy and Retail company. A Europe based Fortune 500 manufacturing company. A U.S. based Financial Services company, and many more. Moving to our AI cloud, within this portfolio, our newest products Risk360 and Business Insights are growing rapidly. Business Insights is helping CIOs and CFOs optimize cost of their SaaS applications, office locations, and more. For example, an existing Global 2000 consumer products customer purchased Business Insights for 97, 000 users to replace their home-grown solution that cost over $500, 000 annually. Recently adopted SEC disclosure requirements and Board level interest in understanding cyber risk are driving demand for Risk360. For example, A Global 2000 manufacturing customer purchased Risk360 for nearly 16, 000 users to automate the process of risk quantification and take proactive measures to reduce cyber risk. We have already delivered several AI innovations, including ML-based data classification, ML-based policy recommendations, Risk360, Business Insights, and more. In addition, one of the AI products I\u2019m particularly excited about is Breach Predictor. Breach Predictor is our vision to leverage the power of our platform to predict breaches before customers get breached. We are working relentlessly to bring this and more industry leading AI innovations to our customers this year. With our innovation engine humming and delivering cutting-edge products, and our go-to-market organization focused on scaling and growth, I\u2019m more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead of us, and our ability to capitalize on those opportunities. Now, I\u2019d like to turn over the call to Remo Canessa for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa : Thank you, Jay. Our Q2 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $525 million, up 35% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue, EMEA was 31%, and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q2 grew 27% year-over-year to $628 million. On a sequential basis, total billings increased 37% quarter-over-quarter. Our calculated current billings grew 26% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 29% from a year ago to $3.613 billion. The current RPO is approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q2 with 497 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding 29 such customers in the quarter. We also saw strength in $100, 000 ARR customers this quarter, which grew to 2, 820, adding 112 customers sequentially. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers\u2019 digital transformation initiatives. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 117%. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned. Turning to the rest of our Q2 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.8% compares to 80.7% in the prior quarter and 80.4% in the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin benefited by approximately 60 basis points from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, beginning fiscal 2024, we extended the depreciable useful life of our servers and network equipment in our cloud infrastructure from four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $321 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model, with operating margin reaching 19.6%, an increase of approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. We believe we are still operating in a challenging macroenvironment and customers continue to scrutinize large deals. Customer interest in our platform remains strong, and we are adding experienced sales leaders to our already strong sales team to position us well for sustainable growth in the long-term. In our outlook for fiscal 2024, we're balancing our business optimism with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and sales leadership changes. Moving on to guidance for Q3 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $534 million to $536 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 28%. Gross margins of 80%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We're currently managing the emerging products for time to market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $98 million to $100 million. Net other income of $15 million. Income taxes of $10 million. Earnings per share in the range of $0.64 to $0.65, assuming 161 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we're increasing our guidance as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.118 billion to $2.122 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 31%. Calculated billings in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.57 billion or year-over-year growth of 25% to 26%. From a modeling perspective, Q3 is typically our seasonally weaker quarter. Consistent with our historical seasonal patterns, we expect billings to decline sequentially by approximately 7% in Q3. Operating profit in the range of $395 million to $400 million, which reflects up to 400 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year. Income taxes of approximately $35 million. Earnings per share in the range of $2.73 to $2.77, assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be up year-over-year and in the low-20% range. We continue to expect our data center CapEx to be high-single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year, reflecting the 3-percentage points to 4-percentage points of headwind to free cash flow margins. We expect the timing of CapEx spend to be more towards the later part of the second half of the year as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we plan to continue to invest significantly to drive long-term growth while increasing profitability. Before moving on to Q&A, I would like to note that Bill Choi, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Finance and Investors Relations, will be leaving us in a couple of weeks. This is a bittersweet moment for me, as Bill has been instrumental in building the finance practice here, but happy for him as he is moving to pursue his first CFO opportunity at an AI networking company. We wish him great success in his next endeavor. With that operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.\nAlex Henderson: Well, first off, I've got to say, Bill, it was great working with you and congratulations on progression in your career. As for you guys on Zscaler, nice quarter. Thanks for a good print. The first question I have for you is really against the backdrop of already expected difficult decision making environment. Has there been any change in deal size, in deal process time, closure rates, win rates over the last quarter that might show some incremental improvement versus where we were in the prior quarter? Are there any green shoots evident in those key metrics?\nJay Chaudhry : Alex, thank you for the question. The short answer is we haven't seen any meaningful change for a number of things you mentioned. Take, for example, macro. It's pretty much a similar environment. Our deals keep on growing. We are doing large deals, so there's no significant crash on deals. We do see demand for cybersecurity products remaining strong. Customers do have budgets for cyber, even though they may be tightening budget for IT overall. And this is because Zero Trust is a top priority. But it boils down to two things when I talk to lots of CIOs. They do want to take care of cyber. But if you can fix cyber, and reduce cost at the same time, it becomes a much better situation. Zscaler happens to be in a position where we do it extremely well. If you look at most point products out there, they don't save money. In fact, security generally is a cost. We replace a number of point products, save money, give far better security, as we are sitting in pretty good shape.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thanks so much and congrats to you, Bill. It's been a fun ride since the IPO. Jay, just following the last question, I appreciate your comments on the environment. You obviously had one of your key competitors last week talking of customer fatigue and you guys are at least in the federal market. You're telling us a little bit of a different story but can you specifically share thoughts about competitors giving away free product and the impact it can or is already having on Zscaler and maybe the extent to which you're factoring that into your outlook ahead.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, thank You, Brad. We really do not see any cyber spending fatigue among our customers. In fact many of the CIOs that told me that cyber is a priority for spend. But they do have ELA fatigue because a lot of stuff has been becoming shelf wear and it's being scrutinized. Regarding free stuff, many vendors have been trying to give it away for a while and we have been successfully winning against this strategy for a long time. I mean look at our retention rate. It used to be been 90s at IPO now, now it's high 90s and fundamentally cyber is so mission critical that customers will invest in the industry's leading solution rather than rely on cheaper and less effective products that are included as a part of an ELA bundle. Look, we are really dealing with a secular trend too. Just like the role of data center diminished and public out to a call, similarly, the role of firewalls is diminishing and the demand for Zero Trust security is growing and this is bound to impact sales of firewall vendors and this naturally puts the legacy vendors in a defensive position. And they're trying to cover giveaway products as bundles which end up becoming shelf wear and this strategy starts to unravel over time. We'll stick to our strategy.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks, Jay, maybe just a quick follow-up one for Remo. Remo on the back half billing seasonality that you've set up now for us, could you just maybe speak to any factors we may want to consider and what it is that drives your confidence, and now it looks like a pretty big sequential Q4 as you've set it up for us. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : Yes, I mean, we made a go-to-market change during the quarter because you're aware, Mike Rich, Mike has hit the ground running and is doing an absolutely outstanding job, balancing the strength that we've got with our sales organization as well as bringing new leadership in. If you take a look at our guide for the year, it is slightly up, we're being prudent. The key thing, I think, for our investors to recognize and what Jay said, this is a large market opportunity. It's a huge market opportunity. And when it's a huge market opportunity, when you look at companies giving away things for free, especially in security, that's one area that basically I wouldn't shortchange. So what we're seeing with the market opportunity, our engagement with our customers, with Mike Rich on board, we feel good about our guidance going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great, thank you, Bill. Certainly going to miss you. Can't wait to see where you land next. And then, overall, just great quarter. Congrats on another strong execution. I wanted to ask you guys about the US federal sector. It sounds like you had some strong upsells in the US Fed may have contributed to some of your upside this quarter. Do you think some of these agencies that you mentioned that are really under-penetrated, they might serve as a role model to other agencies in the U.S. government which could help you continue your growth there and how does your pipeline look in the U.S. Fed over the next few quarters? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry : As we have been investing in the federal market for quite some time. We got the highest level of certification and we're doing very well. In fact, we are heavily engaged with all federal agencies including DOD, 12 of the 15 agencies on our customers. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the federal deal that we doubled the number of users and we doubled that ARR to approximately about $5 million. And with this, we are less than 15% penetrated in the agency in terms of the number of users which means there's an 85% wide space to go up there. We feel good. We keep on investing in it and I think it's a strong area for us. Remo?\nRemo Canessa : Well positioned. And as Jay mentioned, 12 to 15 basically agencies that we're in, these are big deals in federal. It's hard to predict when these deals are going to close. From our perspective, we're well positioned, very well positioned going forward. We've made significant investments with our certifications and also our team, which we feel is outstanding. So the answer to your question, Andy, is we feel good about federal. But, again, bigger type deals, hard to forecast, but we feel good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. I have a small question and a big question. The small one is about billing. You guide it down 7% sequentially and then guide it up 53% if I take the implied 4Q, which is the highest growth in billing. You had the same problem last year. What's the meaning of it? What's the meaning of billing being weak and then billing being so strong in the fourth quarter? What needs to happen for it to materialize? So that's a small one. The bigger one, Jay, maybe you wanted me to take it one at a time or you wanted me just to ask both?\nJay Chaudhry : No, go ahead.\nTal Liani: Jay, the second one is a bigger question. SASE is used to be a very secure, a very safe market for you because there were only two players and maybe two and a half players. And now we're seeing tons of competition coming in. And competition is coming at very low pricing. And Fortinet is talking about one-third of your price. The newcomers are coming either through bundling, which enables them to reduce price, or as an add-on to a firewall, which again enables them to bundle and reduce price. And if I ask the question in a provocative way, I'll ask it, what prevents this market from turning into what happened to FireEye and what happened to Sandboxing that when competition started, pricing collapsed in the market?\nJay Chaudhry : So, Remo start with you.\nRemo Canessa : So, the things that we've got going on in the third order, first of all, this is our normal range, a much of decline over the last five years from Q2 to Q3. I talked about on a prior question the go-to-market changes that we've made. That certainly plays into things. Related to the back half in the fourth quarter with the implied increase basically in billing, it's related to pipeline close rates and the forecast that our team has come up with. Again, from our perspective, we feel it's prudent guidance. We feel good about it, and we feel that we are in a great position to go forward with the team that we have and will build in our sales organization.\nJay Chaudhry : Okay, regarding your bigger question, that's SASE, the market and the competition. Let me put it this way. They are point products and the platforms. You absorb point products into platforms. And then there are products that are mission critical, the products that are not mission critical. FireEye, Sandbox was a feature from day one, it\u2019s not a much barrier to entry. Everyone could build it and add it into the main platform. CASB was a point product all along, became that way. Cloud Security Boston Management, a point product gets bundled with something. And then there's something called platform. For example, the code of our platform, Zero Trust Architecture proxy based, sitting in line, inspecting traffic, and you add things to it. So it's almost like ERP. You see lots of product going out in many areas. Customers don't remove and put in an ERP for vendor A or vendor B because somebody feels like I need to enter the ERP space. I think SASE market is almost like that. This is so mission critical. All traffic goes through us. In fact, a CIO told me, Jay, Zscaler is more mission critical than Microsoft Office 365 because you must work all the time. So with that in mind, our customers may look at this thing. Price is a secondary factor. Reliability, availability, and effectiveness of doing cyber protection is an important factor. My customers also tell me that they have so many firewalls, so many VPNs, and the threats are growing so the credibility of firewall vendors overall is less. Maybe I can use another analogy. You want to buy a pacemaker; you don't try to cut corner and buy one at sale. You want to buy something else, yes, you may be able to do so. Yes, competition is coming. We see that, but I can tell you some of the new firewall vendors that announced the SASE act entrance, I haven't come across them in the recent months as I've seen out there. I think the platform keeps on growing. We started with outbound traffic, now inbound traffic. The platform must have the most comprehensive data protection. None of these firewall vendors can do a lot of data protection. Data protection starts with the proper SASE architecture. Then we moved on to expand to workloads, to IoT/OT, and on to B2B. And the pace of innovation is kept on going. I'm very comfortable with our platform story. We need to keep on focusing on go-to-market to keep on going faster and faster. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Could you touch a little bit more on your vertical selling motion and maybe some of those new markets that you will have special overlays for? And I would love a little more commentary around your success with your IoT/OT solution. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, so let's start with vertical market first. About five or six years ago, we started with a first vertical. That was a public sector. And then within that vertical, we expanded into federal government and state government, education and the like. And those things have been very successful for us. For a year ago, we expanded to health care verticals. And then now we want to expand to a couple of more verticals. When company gets to a certain level, you can actually afford to go vertical because vertical requires a decent amount of footprint. Vertical requires some of the expertise in those areas. For example, we have hired some people who come from very good backgrounds, who have spent time in those vertical markets. So we think it's a good natural area for us to expand. And it's not a new, something totally new for us. We've been there, done it, we need to know, we need to learn how to expand it. For example, financial is a strong market for us. It's almost like a vertical today, though it's not a formal vertical. So we'll see, you'll see us expanding in more verticals. That was the first part. The second part of the question, what was the second part.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg with RBC.\nMatt Swanson: Yes, thank you. This is actually Matt Swanson from that Hedberg. I wanted to follow up on Andy's earlier question on the federal vertical. Yes, it's been a place that's been a little bit mixed among your peers and with the strong results, is anything change from your perspective from a competitive standpoint? Or you mentioned the Zero Trust mandates. Are there things that are changing the federal government that are leaving this scaler better positioned relative to some of your peers that maybe have seen a little weakness in that vertical?\nJay Chaudhry : We have seen no weakness, no slowdown in the federal market. In fact, adoption of Zero Trust keeps on growing, especially under the president's mandate. So all agencies, whether federal government, civilian side, or defense side, we have strong engagements and we feel very good about it. But as Remo said, some of these deals can be big and lumpy, but we are in good shape. And the certifications we got at the highest level for all products puts us in an especially very good position and our strong sales team in place.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hello. This is Mark on for Fatima. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you maybe just speak up a little bit more on the leverage you guys recognize in this quarter, and then really the meaningful to the on margin expansion, even though there's a pretty long roster of initiatives you guys is looking to implement, such as verticalization. So any sorts of leverage performance this quarter, and how does sort of your investment stance or philosophy differ today versus maybe three months ago? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : Mark, it's actually very hard to hear you. So what I picked up was you were asking about a little more information about our vertical approach. Is that correct?\nUnidentified Analyst : Can you hear me now?\nRemo Canessa : A little better.\nJay Chaudhry : A little better, yes.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Sorry about that. So we were just more so wondering, can you maybe speak a little bit more on the leverage you guys recognize this quarter, and then maybe the meaningful to on the margin expansion. We know that there's a lot of initiatives you guys are looking to implement, such as verticalization. So we just wanted to get a sense of the source of leverage performance this quarter, and how does your investment philosophy basically differ today versus three months ago, and going forward. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : So I'll take that you. I believe, Mark, you're talking about operating leverage. So we exceeded in revenue. Our gross margins were higher, and our operating expenses came lower. Having said that, we did hire significantly during the quarter, and we'll continue to hire as we go forward. The key thing I think to really think about Zscaler is that we are early in this market. We have a model which we've talked about in the past that we can leverage related to operating profitability and free cash flow. We've shown 700 basis points increase and operating profitability on a year-over-year basis. In one way that's great. And another way is we need to continue to invest. So our focus is still growth. We'll be mindful and manage your operating profitability and free cash flow. But this is a huge market opportunity. And quite frankly with Mike Rich on board and our focus that we're going to have towards large accounts and penetrating large accounts. What we talked about is that we have a 6x opportunity in our existing install-based upsell new products. And also when you take a look at the penetration of the market it's in the teens probably that Zscaler has. So large market opportunity, the ability to leverage upwards profitability and free cash flow. When you take a look at our contribution margin in years two and three, it's over 60%. A lot of levers we can pull. And so we feel good about where we are. We're going to continue to invest and we will manage our operating profitability. But again, I'm not concerned about hitting our operating profitability targets or free cash flow. Our model is well-built, especially with 80% gross margins to do that. Jay, anything to contribute?\nJay Chaudhry : No, right and clear.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Boyd with UBS.\nRoger Boyd: Thanks for taking the questions. And Bill, first off, congrats. I think pretty much summarized the best when you call it a bittersweet moment. But, Jay, I was wondering if you could expand on how you're approaching SD-WAN and single-vendor SASE market, really how that approach differs from traditional vendors there and how you see this changing your competitive standpoint in the market for security edge in general. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes. So we have always wanted to make sure we deliver Zero Trust solutions. SD-WAN was a good technology because it was cheaper. But D-WAN nothing for security. SD-WAN enabled the same lateral movement that the previous networks did. So, but our customers do want to simply file branches. So, they've been talking to us. We launched our Zero Trust for Branch solution a few months ago, and then actually there's a January, the second release of that. So with that, we actually are making available a plug-in play appliance that you simply ship, you drop in the branch, you plug in the internet, and it's auto-discovered, and in 15 minutes it's up and running. No route papers to manage, no Zero Trust architecture makes it wonderful. So our customers are very excited about it. So really, so that is our Zero Trust SD-WAN, it's not traditional SD-WAN. So combined with our SSE and Zero Trust, so we are actually offering the full SASE solution for the first time in the market, Zero Trust SASE solution. I can tell you the number of customers who are eager and ready to roll it out is very large. We're already working with a number of customers, but over the coming quarters, I'm very bullish with the success of this new offering. And it has the full potential to disrupt traditional SD-WANs and traditional SASEs as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: Great. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. First of all, Bill, congratulations from me as well. It's great to see your success. Maybe Jay for you. So we've seen a little bit of executive turnover here as we watch the story from the sidelines, and would love to get your sense of, and obviously some of these make a lot of sense, right? People come as a team, who believe as a team, there are relationships there, and you did a great job previously calling it out as being a factor of conservatism in your outlook. So maybe two quarter for me. One has turnover been what you expected it to be, particularly given what you've kind of like folded into your guidance and then two, maybe frame out what kind of or how deep and meaningful some organizational changes that Mike Rich might be driving within the organization. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry : Okay, good. So starting with our sales attrition is down in the quarter. And second, when leaders leave, it's natural for some people to follow. But as Zscaler has become a very big brand. We have become a top destination for top talent. And we are no short in attracting some of the best and the brightest sales leader and account manager in the market. Mike has built and he continues to build a strong team that includes many, many good leaders. Now, when it comes to organization changes, as we mentioned last time, we are evolving our sales model. There's no wholesale any meaning significant change. We years ago, we had to move to top down conference selling at the sea level because that's what drives transformation. Remember I said, when I used to go and sell two box huggers, they would kind of say, please go away. So our process has been top down. It has been strategic. It's aligned with the background, white, broad form. So we have been doing a lot of that stuff, our business value assessment and topic count stuff and stuff. So these are evolutionary changes. And they're not really, they're no large basket change across. So we're pretty comfortable in evolving from where we are to get to where we need to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Levine with Evercore ISI.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thank you for taking my question and Bill congrats on the opportunity. Two parts. One, can you maybe help us understand where NRR maybe troughs out, where you see that trending throughout \u201824, perhaps into fiscal \u201825? And then Jay, you had comments and maybe piggyback of last question on opportunity centric to more of an account centric sales motion. Maybe explain to us what that means and who kind of somewhat appreciated that change.\nRemo Canessa : Yes. I'll answer the NRR question and Jay can answer the opportunity question. So we don't guide the NRR and quite frankly we only look at NRR at the end of each quarter. So we're not providing any guidance in NRR. It can be impacted as we called out on the script related to large deals or more being bought up front, customers buying within the quarter. So, it is a metric that's it's going to move around. But again, we do not provide any guidance on NRR.\nJay Chaudhry : Okay. The second part, opportunity-centric versus account-centric. In an opportunity-centric model, the rep normally engages on a tactical basis, the customers are all being, where is my opportunity, where's the deal, let me brought the deal. In the account-centric sale, we create account plans, we focus on growing the account. Now, when you are a young company, you don't have that many customers. You naturally are opportunity-centric and it serves you well. At our stage, there will be a large number of customers. It is important for us to move towards being account-centric. We have a large platform to sell. So, once we land, working with account, creating a joint plan to expand becomes far more effective. And as we scale to $5 billion ARR and beyond, so it's evolving to really become long-term strategic partner with the customer. We have been doing it at a small scale in some pockets of the business. Now, we want to take it across at a larger scale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hey, thank you very much. Bill, congrats to you. It's been a pleasure. I have a question for either Jay or Remo. Some investors are harping just a bit on short-term billing, slowing down a little this quarter. But conversely, based on my numbers, both RPO bookings and CRPO bookings actually accelerated this quarter, which is impressive. So just to level set for all of us, because we know that these metrics can sometimes be a little noisy, is there any incremental slowdown that you have observed in any facet in the Q2 or any change in the level of execution? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : First of all RPO, CRPO is based on contracted value. And again, those did very well. Billings is actually what's being built. So there's always going to be differences between CRPO and RPO versus short-term billings and in billings. As the company gets bigger, it's just the numbers are growing, but the numbers are, you're not going to get the type of growth rates when four or five years ago. But again, from my perspective, the short-term billings growth rate of 26%, that's very good. That's outstanding.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, many thanks. Good evening. Remo, I wanted to start with you, if I could. I wanted to turn the federal comments around a little bit. Your federal business has been very strong for a number of different quarters. And in the past, you've actually provided some context of growth on the federal standalone. And I just wanted to see if you could revisit that. And the lens that I'm putting on the question is, there's been some investor concern that your federal business has been outstanding. And yet, that would suggest a that there's been a more, a greater slowdown, if you will, on the corporate business. So I just wanted to see if you could provide any context for that. And then Jay, perhaps for you, you actually in your prepared remarks talked about, I think you said one half of your net new bookings were from new logos, if I heard you correctly, which is a very strong metric. And I just wondered if you could characterize how, you see that unfolding new logos in particular, as you look out over the next number of quarters. Thank you very much and congrats to Bill.\nRemo Canessa : Keith, I'll start. The federal business has been good for us, because as I mentioned, we're well positioned. We'll provide color on the contribution of federal on an annual basis. I haven't said that. I'll go out and put my neck out, which maybe I should.\nKeith Bachman: Bill's leaving so it's safe.\nRemo Canessa : With Bill's leaving, that's right. He's picking me at the table. We're well positioned in federal. It really comes down to our executions. Let the numbers play the way they play. We'll see how it plays through. But we feel good about our federal business. It's been strong. I would not say it's been carrying us. That's the key comment. But it is basically a vertical that I see that we have a lot of potential. We just need to execute.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, and non-federal is pretty good, too.\nJay Chaudhry : So, I mean, we are bullish, but both sides of the business. Moving on to the second part, yes, business, strong business coming from net new logos. It's good in terms of future. And as customer base is getting bigger and bigger. And we have lots of platforms to sell. From a directional point of view, I think we have been planning the upsell being in the, whatever, 60%, 65% range somewhere else there Remo, and new logo, the rest. So I think that's really how we see us moving forward. Now, part of the thing that I'm excited about is we are seeing more and more of million-dollar customers being on board. The number is about almost 500 customers that are a million dollars. Then they are trying to get to $5 million and $10 million. So we are targeting towards getting more and more customers a $1 million to $5 million to $10 million. That's probably the bigger target than trying to get lots of new logos by count of logos.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe research.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey, guys, can you hear me? Congrats, Bill, and I apologize for the amazing cafe music in the background. But the one question I have that's been on my mind is just none of what you guys are talking about tonight kind of happens overnight. So I guess, were these sales changes factored into the initial guidance that you gave back in Q4? Or are you actually embedding incremental services and related to these changes in the outlook going forward?\nRemo Canessa : I'll speak to basically both Q2 and Q3. In Q2, we said we were expecting close rates to be slightly worse. Things came in pretty much as we thought they would. For Q3, our assumption also there's a level of conservatism slight. Again, for Q3, they're related to close rates.\nOperator: And we'll have our last question from the line of Peter Weed with A.B. Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. And I guess following up, maybe a couple of questions that we've had here, I mean, I will agree impressive to see the continued acceleration and new customer contribution. I think that had been a worry maybe a year ago whether or not that was going to continue. And obviously you've talked a little bit about expansion coming down with landing orders or deals up front leaving a little bit less upsell, cross-sell opportunity. Maybe help break down a couple of things. One is with a lot more new customers landing in the short term, would this be a good signal for kind of a year from now and in the short term getting some lift just because newer customers expand more. And secondly, how would you think about the opportunity around expansion? Like what are the things that you think you can do to grow the upsell opportunity even though customers are landing larger today? What are you going to be doing to kind of create some lift there with expansion in the future?\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, so if you think about what we've done over the past several years since our IPO, we essentially used to start with, in fact, the ZIA, mostly business. They would ask, what about transformation? Then what about next? When ZPA came in great expansion, CDX came in, a number of new products have been coming in. So we are actually able to expand quite a bit. In fact, even today, as we said in our current customer base, we could literally take our ARR by 6x if we sold all these growth user products to our customers. So even I would even say we have no lack of product to sell. And customers are embracing broader and broader platform. If you look at all that deals, they use that talk about, reading the script and say, huh, CIS, EPS, EDX and data protection. And so it is becoming pretty significant. So we have a big, big upsell opportunities, things like data protection. They don't want to go with someone else to do data protection if the traffic is going through our platforms. So that's one piece. And the second piece is everyone is talking about only users when they talk about Zero Trust safety or they talk about whatever safety. That's only one piece. Then you talk about how about workloads? That's a bigger opportunity. IoT/OT is a sigma opportunity. B2B, where your customer, suppliers and partners need to access information through our Zero Trust platform. So I think there's a big opportunity on the product side, on the sales side, we keep on learning and refining some of the stuff. We do have some of the overlay specialists. We don't do overlay sales per se, but there are specialists in certain areas because you need to be able to go deeper. So we are definitely taking advantage of that. We are pleased with the results, but we'll keep on tweaking and refining to get better and better results.\nPeter Weed: And the new customer success that you've been having, do you anticipate that provides some additional lift kind of looking at a year or so, just as a mix of new customers has increased?\nJay Chaudhry : We don't wait for a year or two years for the contract. We are in the process of we sell, we go, we talk. Literally, it's an ongoing engagement with the customers. So you're not going to see lumpy things from our us. Like people said, hey after COVID what's going to happen after three years? When three years came in most of our customers had done an upsell or two with us.\nOperator: That concludes the question and answer session. This time I would like to turn it back to Jay Chaudhry for closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry : Well, thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at one of the investor conferences. Thanks.\nRemo Canessa : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Our Q2 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $525 million, up 35% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue, EMEA was 31%, and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q2 grew 27% year-over-year to $628 million. On a sequential basis, total billings increased 37% quarter-over-quarter. Our calculated current billings grew 26% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 29% from a year ago to $3.613 billion. The current RPO is approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q2 with 497 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding 29 such customers in the quarter. We also saw strength in $100, 000 ARR customers this quarter, which grew to 2, 820, adding 112 customers sequentially. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 117%. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned. Turning to the rest of our Q2 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.8% compares to 80.7% in the prior quarter and 80.4% in the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin benefited by approximately 60 basis points from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, beginning fiscal 2024, we extended the depreciable useful life of our servers and network equipment in our cloud infrastructure from four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $321 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model, with operating margin reaching 19.6%, an increase of approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. We believe we are still operating in a challenging macroenvironment and customers continue to scrutinize large deals. Customer interest in our platform remains strong, and we are adding experienced sales leaders to our already strong sales team to position us well for sustainable growth in the long-term. In our outlook for fiscal 2024, we're balancing our business optimism with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and sales leadership changes. Moving on to guidance for Q3 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $534 million to $536 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 28%. Gross margins of 80%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We're currently managing the emerging products for time to market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $98 million to $100 million. Net other income of $15 million. Income taxes of $10 million. Earnings per share in the range of $0.64 to $0.65, assuming 161 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we're increasing our guidance as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.118 billion to $2.122 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 31%. Calculated billings in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.57 billion or year-over-year growth of 25% to 26%. From a modeling perspective, Q3 is typically our seasonally weaker quarter. Consistent with our historical seasonal patterns, we expect billings to decline sequentially by approximately 7% in Q3. Operating profit in the range of $395 million to $400 million, which reflects up to 400 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year. Income taxes of approximately $35 million. Earnings per share in the range of $2.73 to $2.77, assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be up year-over-year and in the low-20% range. We continue to expect our data center CapEx to be high-single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year, reflecting the 3-percentage points to 4-percentage points of headwind to free cash flow margins. We expect the timing of CapEx spend to be more towards the later part of the second half of the year as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we plan to continue to invest significantly to drive long-term growth while increasing profitability. Before moving on to Q&A, I would like to note that Bill Choi, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Finance and Investors Relations, will be leaving us in a couple of weeks. This is a bittersweet moment for me, as Bill has been instrumental in building the finance practice here, but happy for him as he is moving to pursue his first CFO opportunity at an AI networking company. We wish him great success in his next endeavor. With that operator, you may now open the call for questions. Yes, I mean, we made a go-to-market change during the quarter because you're aware, Mike Rich, Mike has hit the ground running and is doing an absolutely outstanding job, balancing the strength that we've got with our sales organization as well as bringing new leadership in. If you take a look at our guide for the year, it is slightly up, we're being prudent. The key thing, I think, for our investors to recognize and what Jay said, this is a large market opportunity. It's a huge market opportunity. And when it's a huge market opportunity, when you look at companies giving away things for free, especially in security, that's one area that basically I wouldn't shortchange. So what we're seeing with the market opportunity, our engagement with our customers, with Mike Rich on board, we feel good about our guidance going forward. Well positioned. And as Jay mentioned, 12 to 15 basically agencies that we're in, these are big deals in federal. It's hard to predict when these deals are going to close. From our perspective, we're well positioned, very well positioned going forward. We've made significant investments with our certifications and also our team, which we feel is outstanding. So the answer to your question, Andy, is we feel good about federal. But, again, bigger type deals, hard to forecast, but we feel good. So, the things that we've got going on in the third order, first of all, this is our normal range, a much of decline over the last five years from Q2 to Q3. I talked about on a prior question the go-to-market changes that we've made. That certainly plays into things. Related to the back half in the fourth quarter with the implied increase basically in billing, it's related to pipeline close rates and the forecast that our team has come up with. Again, from our perspective, we feel it's prudent guidance. We feel good about it, and we feel that we are in a great position to go forward with the team that we have and will build in our sales organization. Mark, it's actually very hard to hear you. So what I picked up was you were asking about a little more information about our vertical approach. Is that correct? A little better. So I'll take that you. I believe, Mark, you're talking about operating leverage. So we exceeded in revenue. Our gross margins were higher, and our operating expenses came lower. Having said that, we did hire significantly during the quarter, and we'll continue to hire as we go forward. The key thing I think to really think about Zscaler is that we are early in this market. We have a model which we've talked about in the past that we can leverage related to operating profitability and free cash flow. We've shown 700 basis points increase and operating profitability on a year-over-year basis. In one way that's great. And another way is we need to continue to invest. So our focus is still growth. We'll be mindful and manage your operating profitability and free cash flow. But this is a huge market opportunity. And quite frankly with Mike Rich on board and our focus that we're going to have towards large accounts and penetrating large accounts. What we talked about is that we have a 6x opportunity in our existing install-based upsell new products. And also when you take a look at the penetration of the market it's in the teens probably that Zscaler has. So large market opportunity, the ability to leverage upwards profitability and free cash flow. When you take a look at our contribution margin in years two and three, it's over 60%. A lot of levers we can pull. And so we feel good about where we are. We're going to continue to invest and we will manage our operating profitability. But again, I'm not concerned about hitting our operating profitability targets or free cash flow. Our model is well-built, especially with 80% gross margins to do that. Jay, anything to contribute? Yes. I'll answer the NRR question and Jay can answer the opportunity question. So we don't guide the NRR and quite frankly we only look at NRR at the end of each quarter. So we're not providing any guidance in NRR. It can be impacted as we called out on the script related to large deals or more being bought up front, customers buying within the quarter. So, it is a metric that's it's going to move around. But again, we do not provide any guidance on NRR. First of all RPO, CRPO is based on contracted value. And again, those did very well. Billings is actually what's being built. So there's always going to be differences between CRPO and RPO versus short-term billings and in billings. As the company gets bigger, it's just the numbers are growing, but the numbers are, you're not going to get the type of growth rates when four or five years ago. But again, from my perspective, the short-term billings growth rate of 26%, that's very good. That's outstanding. Keith, I'll start. The federal business has been good for us, because as I mentioned, we're well positioned. We'll provide color on the contribution of federal on an annual basis. I haven't said that. I'll go out and put my neck out, which maybe I should. With Bill's leaving, that's right. He's picking me at the table. We're well positioned in federal. It really comes down to our executions.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. I am pleased to share our Q2 results, which once again exceeded our guidance for the top line and the bottom line, even amidst an ongoing, challenging macro environment. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year, and billings grew by 27%. Our customer base spending $1 million or more continues to grow by over 30%. Our operating profit more than doubled year-over-year, and our free cash flow margin reached are record for Q2. During the quarter, we made solid progress on our strategy to scale our go-to-market engine to reach our goal of $5 billion and beyond in ARR. To augment our already strong sales team, we're adding more experienced leaders with a proven track record of running large operations. Considering these leadership changes, I am particularly proud of our field sales execution this quarter. Before getting to the details of our fiscal Q2, let me share a few observations on the business environment. Based on my conversations with hundreds of CIOs and CISOs, I expect demand for Zero-Trust security to remain robust in 2024 and expect customer budgets for Zero-Trust to be up this year, particularly in light of the recent surge in the number of high-profile breaches. Threat actors continue to exploit vulnerabilities of firewalls and VPNs, which allow them to spread ransomware laterally inside an organization. In a recent example, a VPN vulnerability was so severe that CISA, the U.S. Cybersecurity agency, took the extraordinary step of mandating that federal civilian agencies disconnect their Ivanti Pulse Secure VPNs within 48 hours. This is yet another example of why customers are increasingly realizing that their security posture remains vulnerable and are motivated to transform their firewall-based security to our Zero Trust Architecture. Spinning up firewalls and VPNs in the cloud and calling it a sassy solution doesn't solve cybersecurity challenges. While customers want to consolidate point products, they're looking for a fully integrated platform that delivers zero trust architecture. Cyber is so mission critical that customers will invest in the industry-leading solutions rather than rely on cheaper or less effective products that are included as part of their ELAs. They want best-of-breed platforms with the best functionality that integrate with other platforms, thus eliminating dozens of point products. Zscaler's Zero Trust platform is an integrated and purpose-built solution that delivers comprehensive security and provides a compelling user experience while reducing cost. Strong customer interest in our platform drove a record first-half total bookings with nearly half of net new bookings coming from new logo customers. We added a record number of new logos for our Q2. This demonstrates the momentum in our business and we're increasing our outlook for revenue and billings for fiscal 2024. We are operating in a strong demand environment for zero trust architecture. To capture this demand and scale our business to $5 billion ARR and beyond, we appointed Mike Rich as our Chief Revenue Officer last quarter. Mike joined us from ServiceNow where he established a scalable go-to-market engine to drive deeper engagements with large enterprises. Going forward, Mike and his team are focusing on three key areas. First, our existing opportunity-led sales engine has helped us deliver strong growth over the years, enabling us to surpass $2 billion in ARR. To drive our next phase of growth, we are evolving from an opportunity-centric to an account-centric sales motion, leveraging Mike's experience in building such plans. As we grow our sales organization, we are adding more experienced leaders and strategic sellers with the right level of experience working with CXOs and global system integrators. As we begin our planning for fiscal \u201825, we are developing account plans that are aligned with our customers' long-term strategic initiatives and we are partnering with our customers to build transformation roadmaps to modernize their security and IT infrastructure. Second, we launched our top accounts pilot program a couple of quarters ago, which is successfully driving deeper platform engagements and adoption. Building upon our initial success and leveraging Mike's experience, we are scaling this program across more top accounts. Third, we are increasing our focus on vertical selling. We introduced a vertical specific sales motion a few years ago, starting with the public sector and expanded it to the healthcare vertical last year. Based upon the successful growth in these verticals, we plan to continue to expand program into more verticals by adding domain experts who can drive vertical specific strategies to better align with our customers' strategic initiatives. We now have a double-digit number of customers spending more than $10 million with us annually. With our expanded platform and these go-to-market initiatives, I believe we will see more and more of our large enterprise customers reach $10 million ARR levels over time. Now let me highlight three factors that drove our performance in Q2. First, we are seeing continued success in selling our broader platform, including ZPA, Data Protection, CDX, Zero Trust for Workloads, Zero Trust for Branch, and AI -powered solutions. Driven by upsells, our $1 million ARR customer count grew by 31% year-over-year ending the quarter with nearly 500 such customers. Second, we had a strong federal quarter with particular strength in upsells to cabinet level agencies. We have plenty of opportunity to expand further in the federal market. Third, we achieved a Q2 record for new logo additions, deflecting early success with our channel investments. Our $100, 000 or more ARR customer base grew 21% year-over-year, ending the quarter with over 2, 800 such customers. Let me highlight two new logo deals from the quarter. First, a Fortune 100 Health Care customer purchased ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Advanced Data Protection for 10, 000 users in a 7-figure ACV deal. ZPA will greatly enhance their security and user experience while eliminating legacy security gateways by consolidating the VPN and VDI appliances. Protecting patient healthcare records is of paramount importance to this customer, which made data protection a crucial consideration for this deal. For the next phase, they are planning to expand to over 100, 000 users, representing a significant upsell opportunity for us. In another new logo deal, after suffering repeated ransomware attacks, a technology company purchased 20, 000 seats of ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Advanced Data Protection. They're phasing out the legacy castle-and-moat firewall-based security, which failed to protect them against ransomware attacks. This customer excluded the incumbent firewall-based SASE vendor from consideration, as they wanted a true Zero Trust architecture. This is a multiyear 8-figure TCV deal, which is expected to generate over 100% ROI for the customer by eliminating the multiple-figure ACV deal. Now, let me highlight two upsell deals that highlight broader adoption of our comprehensive platform. In a 7-figure ACV deal, an existing Fortune 500 Financial services enterprise, currently using ZIA, ZPA and Data Protection, upgraded to our high-end ZPA Transformation bundle and added Endpoint DLP for 73, 000 users. This also marks our largest Endpoint DLP deal since the introduction of this module just two quarters ago in our Data Protection solution. By moving to the high-end of our ZPA and Data Protection packages, this customer increased their annual spend with us by over 60% to over $10 million annually. In another 7-figure ACV deal, a major global mining company increased their ZIA and ZDX purchases to 48, 000 users and purchased ZPA transformation for 30, 000 users. With the ZPA purchase, the customer is eliminating their VPN appliances and providing Zero Trust access for their workforce spread across remote locations worldwide. With this expanded purchase of our platform, the customer's annual spend with us nearly doubled to approximately $5 million. Next, let me discuss our opportunities in the Federal market. As I mentioned earlier, we saw strong growth in net new ACV from the Federal vertical in Q2. After our initial lands at 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies, we continue to win additional awards as agencies are increasingly adopting Zero Trust architecture to meet the President's Executive Order. For example, in a seven-figure upsell deal, an agency customer expanded their seats with ZIA, ZPA and Data Protection purchases, nearly doubling their annual spend with us. With this upsell, the customer is already approaching $5 million in annual spend, even though we are still less than 15% penetrated in terms of the number of users, representing a significant upsell opportunity in this agency. With the highest levels of FedRAMP certifications for both ZIA and ZPA, we are very well positioned to benefit from continued growth with our federal customers. Building upon our success in the US, we are investing in building public sector programs for half a dozen nations that have adopted FedRAMP like certification programs. This is a significant opportunity for us, but like any government initiative this will take time. Moving on, our R&D engine continues to deliver innovations, rapidly expanding our platform and providing larger upsell opportunities. Given our strategic position, we are interacting with more CXOs than ever before and having much deeper engagements. For example, we recently hosted a CXO summit in India, attended by over 200 senior IT leaders, including over 100 CXOs. At the summit, one CXO said and I quote the velocity of features that Zscaler releases every time we meet is extremely impressive. Our comprehensive platform protects not just users, but also workloads, and IoT/OT devices. While still early, we are seeing growing traction in our emerging platform solutions, including Zero Trust for Workloads, Zero Trust for Branch and Zero Trust for B2B, as well as our AI/ML powered solutions. Zero Trust for Workloads continues to gain wider adoption. For example, in an upsell win, a financial technology company purchased Zero Trust for Workloads for 25, 000 workloads, which contributed to nearly doubling their annual spend with us to over $1 million. A large aerospace company more than tripled their Zero Trust for Workloads purchase, contributing to a 60% increase in their annual spend with us to over $1 million. In January, we launched Zero Trust for Branch which enables one-to-one connectivity between branch devices and applications, thus securing branch IoT/OT devices and eliminating the risk of lateral threat movement. Our Zscaler plug-and-play appliance would be the only solution customers will need at the branch, as it eliminates the need for legacy SD-WAN appliances, routers, and firewalls, thus dramatically simplifying branch networking and security. Zero Trust for branch is a key component of our Zero Trust SASE solution, which is the industry's first single vendor SASE solution built on Zero Trust. Zero Trust SASE pairs Zscaler's leading SSE with our new Zero Trust SD-WAN. We have seen early adoption of our Zero Trust SASE from customers across a range of industries including: A U.S. based Energy and Retail company. A Europe based Fortune 500 manufacturing company. A U.S. based Financial Services company, and many more. Moving to our AI cloud, within this portfolio, our newest products Risk360 and Business Insights are growing rapidly. Business Insights is helping CIOs and CFOs optimize cost of their SaaS applications, office locations, and more. For example, an existing Global 2000 consumer products customer purchased Business Insights for 97, 000 users to replace their home-grown solution that cost over $500, 000 annually. Recently adopted SEC disclosure requirements and Board level interest in understanding cyber risk are driving demand for Risk360. For example, A Global 2000 manufacturing customer purchased Risk360 for nearly 16, 000 users to automate the process of risk quantification and take proactive measures to reduce cyber risk. We have already delivered several AI innovations, including ML-based data classification, ML-based policy recommendations, Risk360, Business Insights, and more. In addition, one of the AI products I'm particularly excited about is Breach Predictor. Breach Predictor is our vision to leverage the power of our platform to predict breaches before customers get breached. We are working relentlessly to bring this and more industry leading AI innovations to our customers this year. With our innovation engine humming and delivering cutting-edge products, and our go-to-market organization focused on scaling and growth, I'm more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead of us, and our ability to capitalize on those opportunities. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Remo Canessa for our financial results. Alex, thank you for the question. The short answer is we haven't seen any meaningful change for a number of things you mentioned. Take, for example, macro. It's pretty much a similar environment. Our deals keep on growing. We are doing large deals, so there's no significant crash on deals. We do see demand for cybersecurity products remaining strong. Customers do have budgets for cyber, even though they may be tightening budget for IT overall. And this is because Zero Trust is a top priority. But it boils down to two things when I talk to lots of CIOs. They do want to take care of cyber. But if you can fix cyber, and reduce cost at the same time, it becomes a much better situation. Zscaler happens to be in a position where we do it extremely well. If you look at most point products out there, they don't save money. In fact, security generally is a cost. We replace a number of point products, save money, give far better security, as we are sitting in pretty good shape. Yes, thank You, Brad. We really do not see any cyber spending fatigue among our customers. In fact many of the CIOs that told me that cyber is a priority for spend. But they do have ELA fatigue because a lot of stuff has been becoming shelf wear and it's being scrutinized. Regarding free stuff, many vendors have been trying to give it away for a while and we have been successfully winning against this strategy for a long time. I mean look at our retention rate. It used to be been 90s at IPO now, now it's high 90s and fundamentally cyber is so mission critical that customers will invest in the industry's leading solution rather than rely on cheaper and less effective products that are included as a part of an ELA bundle. Look, we are really dealing with a secular trend too. Just like the role of data center diminished and public out to a call, similarly, the role of firewalls is diminishing and the demand for Zero Trust security is growing and this is bound to impact sales of firewall vendors and this naturally puts the legacy vendors in a defensive position. And they're trying to cover giveaway products as bundles which end up becoming shelf wear and this strategy starts to unravel over time. We'll stick to our strategy. As we have been investing in the federal market for quite some time. We got the highest level of certification and we're doing very well. In fact, we are heavily engaged with all federal agencies including DOD, 12 of the 15 agencies on our customers. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the federal deal that we doubled the number of users and we doubled that ARR to approximately about $5 million. And with this, we are less than 15% penetrated in the agency in terms of the number of users which means there's an 85% wide space to go up there. We feel good. We keep on investing in it and I think it's a strong area for us. Remo? No, go ahead. So, Remo start with you. Okay, regarding your bigger question, that's SASE, the market and the competition. Let me put it this way. They are point products and the platforms. You absorb point products into platforms. And then there are products that are mission critical, the products that are not mission critical. FireEye, Sandbox was a feature from day one, it's not a much barrier to entry. Everyone could build it and add it into the main platform. CASB was a point product all along, became that way. Cloud Security Boston Management, a point product gets bundled with something. And then there's something called platform. For example, the code of our platform, Zero Trust Architecture proxy based, sitting in line, inspecting traffic, and you add things to it. So it's almost like ERP. You see lots of product going out in many areas. Customers don't remove and put in an ERP for vendor A or vendor B because somebody feels like I need to enter the ERP space. I think SASE market is almost like that. This is so mission critical. All traffic goes through us. In fact, a CIO told me, Jay, Zscaler is more mission critical than Microsoft Office 365 because you must work all the time. So with that in mind, our customers may look at this thing. Price is a secondary factor. Reliability, availability, and effectiveness of doing cyber protection is an important factor. My customers also tell me that they have so many firewalls, so many VPNs, and the threats are growing so the credibility of firewall vendors overall is less. Maybe I can use another analogy. You want to buy a pacemaker; you don't try to cut corner and buy one at sale. You want to buy something else, yes, you may be able to do so. Yes, competition is coming. We see that, but I can tell you some of the new firewall vendors that announced the SASE act entrance, I haven't come across them in the recent months as I've seen out there. I think the platform keeps on growing. We started with outbound traffic, now inbound traffic. The platform must have the most comprehensive data protection. None of these firewall vendors can do a lot of data protection. Data protection starts with the proper SASE architecture. Then we moved on to expand to workloads, to IoT/OT, and on to B2B. And the pace of innovation is kept on going. I'm very comfortable with our platform story. We need to keep on focusing on go-to-market to keep on going faster and faster. I hope that helps. Yes, so let's start with vertical market first. About five or six years ago, we started with a first vertical. That was a public sector. And then within that vertical, we expanded into federal government and state government, education and the like. And those things have been very successful for us. For a year ago, we expanded to health care verticals. And then now we want to expand to a couple of more verticals. When company gets to a certain level, you can actually afford to go vertical because vertical requires a decent amount of footprint. Vertical requires some of the expertise in those areas. For example, we have hired some people who come from very good backgrounds, who have spent time in those vertical markets. So we think it's a good natural area for us to expand. And it's not a new, something totally new for us. We've been there, done it, we need to know, we need to learn how to expand it. For example, financial is a strong market for us. It's almost like a vertical today, though it's not a formal vertical. So we'll see, you'll see us expanding in more verticals. That was the first part. The second part of the question, what was the second part. We have seen no weakness, no slowdown in the federal market. In fact, adoption of Zero Trust keeps on growing, especially under the president's mandate. So all agencies, whether federal government, civilian side, or defense side, we have strong engagements and we feel very good about it. But as Remo said, some of these deals can be big and lumpy, but we are in good shape. And the certifications we got at the highest level for all products puts us in an especially very good position and our strong sales team in place. A little better, yes. No, right and clear. Yes. So we have always wanted to make sure we deliver Zero Trust solutions. SD-WAN was a good technology because it was cheaper. But D-WAN nothing for security. SD-WAN enabled the same lateral movement that the previous networks did. So, but our customers do want to simply file branches. So, they've been talking to us. We launched our Zero Trust for Branch solution a few months ago, and then actually there's a January, the second release of that. So with that, we actually are making available a plug-in play appliance that you simply ship, you drop in the branch, you plug in the internet, and it's auto-discovered, and in 15 minutes it's up and running. No route papers to manage, no Zero Trust architecture makes it wonderful. So our customers are very excited about it. So really, so that is our Zero Trust SD-WAN, it's not traditional SD-WAN. So combined with our SSE and Zero Trust, so we are actually offering the full SASE solution for the first time in the market, Zero Trust SASE solution. I can tell you the number of customers who are eager and ready to roll it out is very large. We're already working with a number of customers, but over the coming quarters, I'm very bullish with the success of this new offering. And it has the full potential to disrupt traditional SD-WANs and traditional SASEs as well. Okay, good. So starting with our sales attrition is down in the quarter. And second, when leaders leave, it's natural for some people to follow. But as Zscaler has become a very big brand. We have become a top destination for top talent. And we are no short in attracting some of the best and the brightest sales leader and account manager in the market. Mike has built and he continues to build a strong team that includes many, many good leaders. Now, when it comes to organization changes, as we mentioned last time, we are evolving our sales model. There's no wholesale any meaning significant change. We years ago, we had to move to top down conference selling at the sea level because that's what drives transformation. Remember I said, when I used to go and sell two box huggers, they would kind of say, please go away. So our process has been top down. It has been strategic. It's aligned with the background, white, broad form. So we have been doing a lot of that stuff, our business value assessment and topic count stuff and stuff. So these are evolutionary changes. And they're not really, they're no large basket change across. So we're pretty comfortable in evolving from where we are to get to where we need to go. Okay. The second part, opportunity-centric versus account-centric. In an opportunity-centric model, the rep normally engages on a tactical basis, the customers are all being, where is my opportunity, where's the deal, let me brought the deal. In the account-centric sale, we create account plans, we focus on growing the account. Now, when you are a young company, you don't have that many customers. You naturally are opportunity-centric and it serves you well. At our stage, there will be a large number of customers. It is important for us to move towards being account-centric. We have a large platform to sell. So, once we land, working with account, creating a joint plan to expand becomes far more effective. And as we scale to $5 billion ARR and beyond, so it's evolving to really become long-term strategic partner with the customer. We have been doing it at a small scale in some pockets of the business. Now, we want to take it across at a larger scale. Yes, and non-federal is pretty good, too. So, I mean, we are bullish, but both sides of the business. Moving on to the second part, yes, business, strong business coming from net new logos. It's good in terms of future. And as customer base is getting bigger and bigger. And we have lots of platforms to sell. From a directional point of view, I think we have been planning the upsell being in the, whatever, 60%, 65% range somewhere else there Remo, and new logo, the rest. So I think that's really how we see us moving forward. Now, part of the thing that I'm excited about is we are seeing more and more of million-dollar customers being on board. The number is about almost 500 customers that are a million dollars. Then they are trying to get to $5 million and $10 million. So we are targeting towards getting more and more customers a $1 million to $5 million to $10 million. That's probably the bigger target than trying to get lots of new logos by count of logos. Yes, so if you think about what we've done over the past several years since our IPO, we essentially used to start with, in fact, the ZIA, mostly business. They would ask, what about transformation? Then what about next? When ZPA came in great expansion, CDX came in, a number of new products have been coming in. So we are actually able to expand quite a bit. In fact, even today, as we said in our current customer base, we could literally take our ARR by 6x if we sold all these growth user products to our customers. So even I would even say we have no lack of product to sell. And customers are embracing broader and broader platform. If you look at all that deals, they use that talk about, reading the script and say, huh, CIS, EPS, EDX and data protection. And so it is becoming pretty significant. So we have a big, big upsell opportunities, things like data protection. They don't want to go with someone else to do data protection if the traffic is going through our platforms. So that's one piece. And the second piece is everyone is talking about only users when they talk about Zero Trust safety or they talk about whatever safety. That's only one piece. Then you talk about how about workloads? That's a bigger opportunity. IoT/OT is a sigma opportunity. B2B, where your customer, suppliers and partners need to access information through our Zero Trust platform. So I think there's a big opportunity on the product side, on the sales side, we keep on learning and refining some of the stuff. We do have some of the overlay specialists. We don't do overlay sales per se, but there are specialists in certain areas because you need to be able to go deeper. So we are definitely taking advantage of that. We are pleased with the results, but we'll keep on tweaking and refining to get better and better results. We don't wait for a year or two years for the contract. We are in the process of we sell, we go, we talk. Literally, it's an ongoing engagement with the customers. So you're not going to see lumpy things from our us. Like people said, hey after COVID what's going to happen after three years? When three years came in most of our customers had done an upsell or two with us. Well, thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at one of the investor conferences. Thanks."

I also want to inform you that we'll be attending the UBS Global Technology Conference tomorrow. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. I'm pleased to share our first quarter results, which exceeded our guidance across all metrics. We delivered 40% revenue growth and 34% billings growth. Our operating profit and free cash flow more than doubled year-over-year, and free cash flow margin reached a record 45%. We exceeded the rule of 60 for the 13th consecutive quarter, at a significant scale of $2 billion plus in ARR, we are delivering a unique combination of high growth and high profitability that only a few SaaS companies have accomplished. In Q1, we executed well in a challenging macro environment and what is typically a slower quarter for us. The elevated scrutiny of large deals remains mostly unchanged. The increased frequency of high-profile breaches, coupled with impending SEC disclosure requirements has propelled Zero Trust security more into focus at the management and the Board level. Against this backdrop, we achieved a Q1 record for number of new logo customers with over $1 million in ARR. We also achieved a record for new pipeline generation in a quarter. More customers are adopting our broader platform to consolidate multiple point products, increasing our average deal size. As a result, we are actively working on more large, multiyear, multi-pillar opportunities than ever before. To meet this demand and to further scale our business, we're adding two key go-to-market leaders, one in sales and one in marketing. I will provide details about these new executives after reviewing our Q1 performance. Let me highlight three factors that drove our strong Q1 performance. First, large new logo wins were strong this quarter with a Q1 record of 14 new logos contributing over $1 million ARR. We ended with 468 such customers, up 34% year-over-year. These wins spanned across many verticals, proving that every vertical needs Zscaler. Second, Customers are buying the broader Zscaler platform with multiple product pillars. I have said before, over time, I believe every one of our customers will buy ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for every user to deliver secure, fast and reliable access to any application anywhere. This quarter, nearly half of our new logo customers purchased all three user pillars, ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. In addition, strong platform upsells drove our 120% dollar-based net retention rate. Third, this was a record U.S. federal quarter with new business up over 90% year-over-year, including four deals that are greater than $1 million in ACV. We are starting to see larger awards as multiple U.S. federal agencies are standardizing on Zscaler to meet the President's executive order to adopt Zero Trust security. We are extremely proud of having landed 12 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies as our customers, where we have plenty of opportunity to expand. For example, at a cabinet level agency, we expanded the ZIA and ZPA deployment from 25,000 users to 100,000 users, while cross-selling ZDX for all 100,000 users. We also won a top defense integrator who purchased ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for its employees. In parallel, they launched a go-to-market service to take Zscaler to their federal customers. As our SI partners are selling and deploying Zscaler for their customers they are also adopting Zscaler to make their own business secure, agile and competitive. From my conversations with hundreds of IT executives, it's clear that cybersecurity is the number 1 IT spending priority. Adopting Zero Trust architecture and protecting their enterprise from Gen AI risks are top priorities for CISOs in 2024. We have enhanced our data protection policies or AIML applications and tools to protect our customers' risk of data loss due to increasing use of Gen AI, our AI-powered threat protection uses a diffusion model to detect complex exploits and to catch sophisticated phishing attacks that evade traditional security controls. These AI-driven features are included in our Advanced Plus bundles, which are often priced 20% higher than advanced bundles. We now secured on average over 2 billion AI transactions every month for our customers.  Next, let me discuss some of our Q1 deals, which demonstrate our differentiation and business value. We are starting to see some wins where customers are coming to us after initially purchasing a firewall-based single vendor SASE solution that failed to deliver in the real world. For those who are not familiar, firewall-based single vendor SASE is the combination of SD-WAN and firewall and VPN deployed as VMs in the cloud. A leading software company made an architectural shift to our Zero Trust exchange platform after trying to deploy a leading firewall vendor SASE solutions across 50 office locations and multiple public cloud sites. It became clear to the customer that this solution expanded their attack surface to all locations and increase the risk of lateral threat movement. They decided to move to our Zero Trust security with the purchase of Zscaler for users, our complete bundle for ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for all 25,000 employees. Our Zero Trust Exchange connects users directly to apps, eliminating attack surface and lateral threat movement. The Unmanaged devices, the customer is deploying our browser isolation with ZPA to enable third parties to access their applications. Deals like this reinforce our conviction that firewall-based SaaS solutions are not the future of security that some analysts advocate. Customers are choosing Zscaler's purpose-built Zero Trust platform. Let me highlight one new logo win where our superior security helped the customer after a breach. Despite extensive investments in firewalls and VPNs, a hospitality and gaming company experienced a crippling Ransomware breach. To restore their operations, they purchased the entire Zscaler for users bundle for 25,000 users. With Zscaler, the apps are now hidden from threat actors behind our Zero Trust Exchange and can't be discovered, exploited or DDoS. This customer also purchased our new Risk 360 solution to understand the organization-wide risk and to get actionable information to reduce it. We have shared with you that data protection is one of the fastest-growing solutions for us. For our customers, after implementing cyber protection, adopting data protection is the natural second phase of their Zero Trust journey. For example, a Fortune 500 travel and hospitality services provider more than doubled their annual spend with us with data protection being a critical component of the upsell. The first purchase was ZIA for 22,000 users to inspect all traffic, including TLS encrypted traffic for cyber protection. As the next step, they are implementing real-time in-line DLP for sensitive data. Our solution also enables this customer to enforce policies for secure use of AI applications. These deals highlight the breadth and depth of our Zero Trust security platform. We also help our customers achieve high ROI by eliminating tech debt and consolidating multiple point products. For example, a Fortune 200 financial services group turned to Zscaler to consolidate data centers and safely adopt cloud with the necessary security controls for regulatory compliance. They purchased Zscaler for users bundled for 10,000 employees and workload communication for 1,500 workloads. By leveraging our cloud platform, they will eliminate half of the data centers, reduce their MPLS spend and consolidate security and networking client products. We are eliminating several point products, including secure web gateways, firewalls, IPS appliances, VPNs, CASB and DLP from seven security vendors. This deal is expected to generate a remarkable 5x ROI for the customer. I'm also excited to share that ZDX one of our emerging pillars continues to gain significant customer adoption. It is an important part of every deal conversation due to its unique ability to eliminate IT blind spots. ZDX significantly reduces helpless hours spent on ticket resolutions and manual correlation or metrics. Let me highlight a new logo deal where ZDX played a pivotal role. A top-ranked U.S. hospital network purchased ZIA and ZDX advance plus for 87,000 users and ZPA for 40,000 users. What initially began as a ZIA and ZPA project quickly evolved into a significant ZDX opportunity. The ZDX component alone is seven figures in ACV. Unlike the existing performance tools, ZDX provides comprehensive visibility and root cause analysis for users, devices and applications. This deal is a great example of the leverage we gained from working with system integrators like Accenture, who was awarded this overall transformation project. We're also seeing strong customer interest in workload protection on other emerging product pillar. Our Zero Trust Exchange is designed for any to any secured communication. It may be users to apps workload to workload or IoT OT devices. Thousands of enterprises already leverage Zscaler platform for secure user-to-app communication. It is natural for them to extend our Zero Trust platform to secure their workload communication. To radically simplify multi-cloud connectivity and automated deployment of workload protection at scale, we recently released significant enhancements to our workload communications offering, including granular workload segmentation using AWS user-defined tags, the first Zero Trust security solution for workloads in the market, the only alternative is legacy virtual firewalls and real-time auto discovery of cloud resources. More than one-third of our customers have made initial purchases for workload protection. Workload communication often starts with small land deals. And we expect to rapidly expand to secure the growing number of workloads. Zscaler pioneered Zero Trust and SASE, both delivered by our cloud-native platform. we have established ourselves as a premier provider for user protection and are now making progress expanding into workload protection and IoT OT protection. We continue to push the boundaries of what our platform can achieve, extending it for B2B and 5G use cases. As we are like a switchboard for all communications, we collect full transaction logs and trillions of signals daily. We are utilizing those signals and logs to deliver AI-powered insights and automation for our customers. Let me discuss a few of the high-value products in our AI cloud family. We recently launched Risk360, which is the industry's first holistic AI-powered risk quantification and mitigation solution. It delivers up-to-date risk posture and recommends corrective actions to mitigate risk in a timely fashion. We have already closed 10 plus Risk360 deals and are in active evaluations with over 100 enterprises. For these deals, we are getting 6-figure ACV on average, and we expect to grow this value over time. Risk360 provides critical insights to CISOs when reporting on cybersecurity risk strategy and governance, particularly in light of new SEC regulations. Another exciting new product, breach predictor currently under development uses predictive and generative AI models to anticipate potential bread scenarios and eliminate those risks before they materialize. Early feedback from customers who have previewed breach predictor indicates the enormous potential value this solution can deliver. We are working with our technology partners to bring this world-class innovation to thousands of customers to proactively protect against potential breaches. While we have achieved tremendous success for user protection solutions, our platform's potential in other categories is just beginning. Our relentless innovations have paved the way for an ever-growing stream of opportunities. As our platform continues to scale and expand, our go-to-market efforts are continuing to evolve and scale as well. to enable the next stage of go-to-market scaling. I'm excited to share the appointments of two exceptional leaders, Mike Rich, CRO and President of Global Sales; and Joyce Kim as CMO. They bring a wealth of experience in driving revenue and pipeline growth. Mike joins from ServiceNow, Will as the President for Americas, we establish an efficient and scalable process to drive deeper engagements to large enterprises and to scale their business to over $8 billion in revenue and experience that's critical to the next phase of our growth journey. Joyce's previous experience includes CMO roles at Twilio, Genesis and ARM with expertise in building high-performance marketing teams and driving impactful marketing strategies and campaigns. With Mike assuming leadership of our sales organization, Dali in his capacity as the COO can focus on scaling our business operations. Dali has been instrumental in establishing the go-to-market process. which has helped Zscaler achieve a milestone of $2 billion in ARR. With our expanded portfolio of products and experienced CRO and CMO on board we will further scale our value-add sales process for larger platform deals, which will sustain our high growth. I'm thrilled to have strong go-to-market leaders who we believe will drive world-class execution to scale our business beyond $5 billion in ARR. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Our Q1 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 53% of revenue, EMEA was 32% and APJ was 15%. As Jay highlighted, from a new business perspective, Federal had its best new ACV quarter ever, growing over 90% year-over-year. Our new ACV outside of the Fed also grew year-over-year. . Our total calculated billings in Q1 grew 34% year-over-year to $457 million. On a sequential basis, total billings declined 37% quarter-over-quarter with a difficult comparison to Q4, which had a $20 million upfront billing on a multiyear deal. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years, and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Our calculated current billings grew 33% year-over-year, a seasonal decline of 32% quarter-over-quarter. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 30% from a year ago to $3.49 billion, The current RPO is approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q1 with 468 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding 19 such customers in the quarter. 14 of the 19 $1 million ARR customer adds were new logos, which was a record for Q1. The continued strength of this large customer metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We also entered the quarter with 2708 customers with greater than $100,000 in ARR. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 120%. Turning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.7% and compares to 80.7% in the prior quarter and 81.4% in the year ago quarter. Higher public cloud usage for emerging products drove the year-over-year change in the gross margin partially offset by approximately 60 basis points of benefit from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned last quarter, as a result of advances in technology and efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment. Starting this quarter, we extended the depreciable useful life of these assets in our cloud infrastructure from four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 26% year-over-year to $311 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model with operating margin reaching 18%, an increase of approximately 620 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue, Free cash flow benefited from strong collections for Q4 billings, including the $20 million upfront billings I mentioned. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. While the global macro environment remains challenging, and customers continue to scrutinize large deals from our perspective, customer sentiment seems to be stabilizing. Our customer engagements remain strong, and we have a large and growing pipeline. However, we want to be prudent in our assumptions given the sales leadership change. In our outlook for fiscal '24, we're balancing our business optimism and continued sales execution with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. With that in mind, let me provide our guidance for Q2 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $505 million to $507 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 30% to 31%, gross margins of 80%, including the change in accounting for useful life of server equipment. I would also like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for workloads will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time to market and grow, not optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $84 million to $86 million. Net other income of $15 million, income taxes of $8 million, earnings per share in the range of $0.57 to $0.58, assuming $160 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we're updating our guidance as follows: increased revenue in the range of $2.09 billion to $2.1 billion or year-over-year growth of 29% to 30%; calculated billings in the range of $2.52 billion to $2.56 billion or year-over-year growth of 24% to 26%, we still expect our first half mix to be approximately 42% of our full year billings guide; increased operating profit in the range of $360 million to $365 million, which reflects up to 250 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year; income taxes of $35 million; increased earnings per share in the range of $2.45 to $2.48 assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be up year-over-year and in the low 20% range. We continue to expect our data center CapEx to be high single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year, reflecting a three to four percentage points of headwind to free cash flow margins. We expect the timing of CapEx spend to be more towards the second half of the year as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. With our new CRO and CMO coming on board, we expect to step up our sales and marketing investments in the coming quarters. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we plan to invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth while increasing profitability. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. And congrats on a strong start to the year and nice to see the leverage in these results. Jay, your distinction of SASE has always been clear and it's perhaps no more obvious than right now at a time when traditional network security providers are having a tough time selling more and more boxes. And it seems they're paying you a nice complement as they all double down their focus on the cloud and SASE. So as this all plays out competitively and you're increasingly subject to the law of large numbers, how should we think about your ability to sustain high growth and specifically the rate at which you can scale your emerging product portfolio? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Brad, very good question. It is flattering to see all kind of vendors becoming SASE vendors overnight. But the challenge for them would be, it's a different architecture. It's not an incremental change and feature you can add on to it. That's where we spent a dozen plus years building a true Zero Trust architecture, which is an advantage. That's why we became the market leader. We pioneered this market. We evangelized to the fact that this is what's needed for better cybersecurity and ransomware protection and cost reduction. The way I look at - to sustain high growth is the following. One, is there a market demand came out? The market is growing and expanding at much faster pace than I even thought. Two, do you have the right platform with the right architecture, the right functionality? You've seen us build this platform on a true Zero Trust architecture and expanded over the years. I think of what we had at the time of IPO versus what we have today. And the third area is go-to-market execution. We've done a great job starting with IPO, crossing $2 billion in ARR. And now we've got our sights set on crossing $5 billion. And we have been growing and adapting go-to-market also along with the platform. That's why I'm very excited about bringing two key leaders: Mike as CRO; and Joyce as CMO, who can help us take us to the next level. Great market execution, great platform. I think with that, I'm very excited about the opportunity in front of us.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question here. Jay, maybe for you, just building off of that last question on some of the slowness that we've seen with the traditional network security guys and the challenges with appliances. The question for you is maybe do you feel like customers are more willing now to replace their appliance firewalls at least at the branch with SASE architecture like what Zscaler provides so well?\nJay Chaudhry: You know what I said many times, firewalls won't go away, but they will become like mainframes. We have been replacing firewalls at the branches from the last several years. Now that trend is accelerated. And from one of the new things that\u2019s done to help accelerate the demise of firewalls and branches is our branch connector technology, which now we package to make it available. So you can become a Starbucks-like office in a matter of minutes rather than trying to wait for a long, long time. So we've seen a campus environment becoming just like that. The only place where firewalls have been playing a significant role for a while is the data center, the east-west traffic and the like. You know that traffic is going away from the data center and that demand has to go away. So a big thing for someone to do it right, had to really offer a Starbucks like branch and zero-trust architecture. Market has made progress with traditional SD-WAN. We think traditional SD-WAN is a transitory technology. And once we have [broached] (ph) the market with Branch Connector actually is the next big phase to make it simple. Very excited with the opportunity to make the world free of firewalls.\nSaket Kalia: Makes sense. Thanks guys.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: I'm torn on what to ask, but I think I'll go with the question around the channels. So you guys have been doing a lot of work on expanding your VAR channels, expanding reach into federal, expanding reach into MSPs, expanding into the cloud arena as much as possible. Can you give us some sense of how you think the mix of your sales leads will be driven by those different channel opportunities as we move through the current fiscal year, please?\nJay Chaudhry: Sure. Alex, you rightfully said, we don't have a simple straight VAR channel that traditionally firewall and network security vendors had. We have VARs who play a role. We have system integrators and we have service providers. And then there's a separate set of SIs for federal business as well. Let's look at each of these areas. VARs were slow to adopt Zscaler but now as the market has moved more and more of them are embracing us and our leader, [Indiscernible] has launched a number of programs where we're seeing very good progress, with new source pipeline coming from our channel. The area we see probably a very rapidly growing opportunity is global systems incubators. Actually, my coming from ServiceNow, where a lot of partnership with global SIs have played a big role I expect that area to accelerate. And in this next level of fulfillment versus transformation. We like partners who work with us and work with partners - sorry, our customers to do transformation. And we have been selective. You aren't going to find us with 5,000 or 10,000 channel partners. Our partners are hundreds. And we are doing targeted programs. We're working with some of the very large global SIs and very large deals to do transformation. I mentioned one of these deals in my prepared remarks, and I mentioned another SI who actually brought Zscaler internal along with actually launching the service to go out there. Remo, do you want to add any more color?\nRemo Canessa: No, I think that's good, Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Okay. Thank you, Alex.\nAlex Henderson: No comment on internal sales? Which is obviously a piece of it?\nRemo Canessa: So yes. So we've increased our capacity in the quarter for our sales reps. Our plan is to increase capacity through the year. The one comment I'd make on Q1 is that we were - we did hit our expectations internally, but we expect to hit basically our sales targets for the year. The current sales capacity that we have supports our guidance. And as Jay mentioned, with the new leadership with Mike on board, we'll be looking to accelerate our hiring as we go through fiscal '24.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist. Your line is open.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks. And thanks for taking my questions. Great execution here. Jay, one for you, and then I'll jump back in queue. On these new advance plus bundles, obviously very exciting. Just can you share with - you said AIs included - some of the new AI included in that. Can you talk about adoption rates and whether or not you're getting any pushback on pricing as it relates to some of those bundles?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So we have had advanced bundles that include a bunch of functionality of ZIA or ZPA type of stuff. Now we have added functionality where some of the data protection can be done with AI advanced techniques, some of the cyber threat protection can be done using that. So we clear these bundles, we call them advanced plus. So we're getting very good traction. And these advanced plus bundles are about 20% or so higher than the non-plus bundles. So this is a good area. In fact, this is a good way for us to reach our customers as they're looking at buying these bundles with additional functionality, it's helping them, it's helping us. Now in addition, we are also creating some standalone SKUs. We talked about Risk360, a very popular recently introduced product. When I talked about having closed 10-plus deals in a pretty significant manner where the average ACV is sitting in six figures. And then you'll see some more SKUs coming down the road as you'll really be - as AI cloud is one of the big focus areas. And the reason we're making focus is because we have better logs, better data to train AIML models. The starting point of good AIML is the data that we have better than anybody else.\nJoel Fishbein: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Stanley. Your line is open.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe building a little bit on Joel's question. You mentioned in your prepared remarks with an example around data protection as kind of one of the faster-growing solutions and how it doubled spend at an existing customer. Just curious the potential for that and what you're seeing relative to typical uplift when you're able to attach that solution? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: You know when Zscaler customer started working with us several years ago, the number 1 focus for them was cyber protection, so they don't get compromised. Data protection was slower in adoption, data protection also takes a little bit work, there's more contributions and customization needed. And in large enterprises where our large customers have been, they've used Symantec 1, 2, as one of the primary data protection products. Over the past five, six years ago, we have expanded our data protection platform significantly, not just in line, but can be actually endpoint DLP cloud data protection, all those things, including EDM IDM technology are there. So with all that technology, we are in a great position to replace some of those complicated data protection products out there. And it's natural. If we are sitting in traffic path, if we are doing access and inspection, it's natural for the customers to use our cloud because the traffic is coming to a cloud from all kinds of positions. That's really driving our growth. That's why we talked about this data protection DRR is approaching $0.25 billion and it grew 60% year-over-year for us, and we see a lot of growth for quite a long time in this area. Did I answer your question?\nRob Owens: Yes. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: The one comment I'll make is, we have more complete platform for data protection. And customers want one set of policies, whether they want to secure data at rest or data at motion. That's why it's picking up quite fast.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJoseph Gallo: Hi, guys. Appreciate the question. Remo, I appreciate the rationale on the full year billings guide. But just on methodology, is there any changes there? I mean you saw a strong 1Q driven by Fed stream why not pass along some of that beat. Is that solely due to the market? Or the go-to-market change conservatism? Or is there anything else you're seeing there with large customer calendar '24 budgets? And then maybe just to simplistically ask, is fiscal '24 billings more or less conservative now than it was 90 days ago?\nRemo Canessa: Great question. So I mean the guide that we gave is solely related to basically the go-to-market with our new sales leadership on board. We feel it's prudent to do that. When you take a look at close rates for Q2 this year versus last year, we're being a little more conservative with our close rates this Q2. From a market - overall market perspective, the macro still remains challenging, but we feel that things - that there's more of an acceptance to Zero Trust, there's more of an understanding of our platform. So we feel good. Regarding guidance, whether it's more conservative now or not, I'd like to say we like being prudent. And again, it's all related to go-to-market with our new CRO, and I don't want to comment any further than that.\nJoseph Gallo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Remo, I wanted to ask you about some of the idiosyncratic drivers in your federal business. And more specifically, as we think about all the momentum that you're seeing now, how should we think about the durability of growth in the federal vertical? Meaning, is this like a three to five year product cycle where we'll see a ramp and then we should be cognizant of a slowdown? Is it an 18-month to 36-month product cycle? How do we think about some of the visibility you have in federal and how it's going to impact your growth over the medium term? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: It's another great question, Gabriel. I'll start and then maybe Jay can come in also. We've invested significantly in federal. This is not an overnight basically what's occurring. This is occurring over the last five, six years of significant investments both from a platform technology as well as people within the federal organization that works for us. We're in 12 of the 15 agencies, cabinet agencies. As Jay talked about in the script, our growth rate in federal in Q1 was 90% year-over-year. I feel that we are very well positioned in federal, what we talked about, we've got incredibly strong federal team. And I feel that going forward, federal should be a good driver, potentially significant driver for Zscaler. And we're doing well in federal. I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So this is the how I think about it. First of all, number of users in the federal commerce DoD, non-DoD. Yes, we do have 12 of the 15 cabin lab agencies, but they are in various stages. There's a big, big upsell opportunities there itself. Then DoD, just scratching the surface out there. So if you look at from a number of users' point of view, it's a massive market in front of us because we count number of users. Then there are workloads for federal. There's a whole range of IoT, OT devices in federal business that needs to be taken care of. So massive stuff, but then on top of that, it's a platform. Our platform has expanded, it keeps on expanding. So I think this is a significant growth opportunity for a long, long time. And then DoD takes us to next - sorry, federal takes to other federal friendly countries out there. They all want to follow the NATO friendly countries want to adopt what U.S. has done here. That's an opportunity for us. The state governments are getting very, very worried about adopting Zero Trust. That's another big opportunity for us. So very bullish. We've done some big investments, and that's why we have some of the best certifications for Zscaler platform than any other company out there.\nGabriela Borges: Thank you for the color. And congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. Thank you. So Jay, we are seeing this convergence between cloud workload protection platform, [CSPM, CIM] a lot of other acronyms that are being thrown into this seat kind of bucket. We're also seeing a number of next-gen vendors that seem to have more of a product-led sales motion aimed at the developer, which contrasts with your approach, which is more a high touch A,B to C level. So as a product that fits between build and run time environment, and you could argue maybe that portfolio is shifting either to even further left. How do you balance those dynamics when you look to go to market with your CNAPP offering?\nJay Chaudhry: It's a very good question. So all those four letter acronyms you gave us. And we tried to track them. And there have been 100-plus vendors in that space over the past two years. So about a year ago, I used to see a new vendor show up every other day. For the last year or so it has slowed down and actually they're shrinking. But there's adjacent next to it. That is cloud workload communication. Cloud workload communication is about workloads soft, Internet workloads talking to each other. That's where our core strength comes in the Zero Trust architecture. We are the only vendor, I know out there. We have workloads talk to each other through Zero Trust architecture without being on the network. That\u2019s our starting point. Then we look at the CNAPP as an extended. To me, CNAPP is almost like cases in many ways. You make API call, leading logs, you're leading configurations to figure out the risk and whatnot. And that is towards shifting more of the left. We believe that a combination of cloud workload detection, along with CNAPP, puts us in a better position. Regarding product net growth. I think there's an interesting opportunity for some of the companies obviously, we don't come from that side. I haven't seen many, many security companies have grown to hundreds of millions of dollars doing product that growth. But we are watching and monitoring the space, but we will be going from where our strength is. Our large customers, loves Zscalers users, now they're embracing Zscaler for workloads, for communication, and that allows us to extend it to CNAPP space as well. That's how we look at it.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Hi, there. Thank you for taking my question. I mean, really impressive set of results, guys. So congrats on the start in the new fiscal year as you have with - you guys have shown very impressive momentum. I guess I wanted to touch on the leadership change. These two new executive level hires. How has Dali's role changed? Is he still at the firm? Or has he moved on? And if so, how can we expect his decisions to change going forward?\nJay Chaudhry: Dali has an active role as the COO of the company. He has played a phenomenal role in Zscalers growth you've seen over the past four years. He have built a great go-to-market machine that has helped us go past $2 billion in ARR. So Mike's goal is take us from here to $5 billion and beyond. This frees up Dali to focus more in his capacity as a COO to really help scale our business operations capabilities. Now what do you mean by that? As we are growing at a rapid pace. We have many things to improve on scaling side up in the operational side, streamlining our post-sale customer engagements. Ranging from support to TAM to deployment, to success. How do you bring them together to make it more productive and better stay in line for better value realization of the customers. Second example, we do cash process systems, productivity improvement, streamlining. If we do a better job in these areas as a company will become a lot more productive and Dali's experience across the company will help us achieve some of those key things that are needed\nPatrick Colville: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Jay and Remo both spoke about the challenging macro backdrop. And I think Remo, if I - correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said that you did not hit your internal targets for 1Q. I guess, what do you think the reasons for that were? I mean, you have new go-to-market people, and you explained that with the guide with Joe's question. And sometimes that means the previous people were an issue, but your COO is really good at it to say the least. I know Remo said customer sentiment is stabilizing, but I'm not quite sure how that sort of fits in. Has the macro gotten a little worse? Or is there something else that I'm not thinking about?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. The macro has not gotten worse. And the comment, John, was related to quota-carrying reps. So we didn't hit our internal projections for internal reps. We do expect to catch up. We've talked about before on earlier calls, we're in a huge market opportunity. We're going to invest significantly in our company. You can see in the second half, we're going to increase our sales and marketing spend based on our guidance. That's related to just overall, we've gotten new CMO on board with Mike on Board. That was the gist of the comment. It's related basically purely to quota-carrying reps. We did increase capacity, but not to the levels we wanted. And from my perspective, John, it's really execution on our part. We need to execute better on that part.\nJohn DiFucci: Got it. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTal Liani: I'm sorry, I pressed on the mute button. Can hear me now?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes.\nTal Liani: Perfect. Okay. RPO growth was slower. Also, the billing guidance was a tad below, although you hit the quarter, you're above the quarter expectations. So I wanted to ask about the discount level contract duration. Was there any change in the pricing environment or contract duration this quarter that is driving the lower RPOs? And also, how do I think about - I know you don't provide kind of quarterly, but how do I think about first half versus second half in terms of billings and RPOs? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean a lot of questions in there, but I appreciate you bringing off. RPO decline, it's primarily related to federal. Federal is a big piece of our business. And when you look at federal, federal contracts or even though they're multiyear contracts, really take federal in for one year in our CRPO. So that was a big driver for that. When you take out basically federal out of the contract duration, really contract durations are comparable year-over-year and also quarter-over-quarter. Discount levels, no, not really seeing anything on a discount level perspective. I'd say it's the same and has been the same for a while. First half, second half, you can expect billings to be in the 42% range in the first half and the rest basically in the second half. But the RPO basically relates to - primarily relates to federal business, which is one year - one year recognized.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Jay, this one's for you. You were very explicit about the success in the federal business coming from very strong wins and partnerships with federal SIs. So I wanted to better understand what the moat and differentiation is. And if you can help explain to us why this wouldn't necessarily cannibalize your direct business, which you're executing just fantastically in?\nJay Chaudhry: So our direct business versus channel business, almost all of our business is supposed to be changed. A few customers insist that they must do a deal directly with us. So the channel is supposed to bring leverage. The more channel partners are working closely with us, the more heavy lifting to do, better productivity, better our sales acceleration happens. So it's important for us. Now in a transformation sale like ours, the channel wasn't quite ready there to say, hey, tell me the latest box I'm ready to sell. We had to work with them to show them transformation. Federal government is driving big transformation at all levels. President's Executive order is asking for Zero Trust architecture. And there are a large number of systems integrators in the federal market who actually need technology like ours to make it happen. And in federal, it becomes more interesting as you must have certification up to certain levels, there are FedRAMP certification at the medium level at high level and whatnot and IFI. We've done most of them. So with certifications leveraging those system integrators we are able to drive transformation. And I think we are in a very good shape sitting there with a big market, working side by side with our partners. So there's no cannibalization. Did I make it clear? Or did I miss something?\nFatima Boolani: No, that\u2019s super clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Remo, regarding your comment on the sales changes and the impact of the full year billings guide. Just curious, are you anticipating the leadership change will drive a broader restructuring in the sales org? Like you saw a few years ago when Dali came on Board? Or is it going to be more incremental? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So the leadership we have in our sales organization is very strong with what Dali has created. I don't see significant changes. Maybe Jay can speak to it, but I don't see significant changes. And again, the structure that we've built under Dali's leadership was a very strong basically structure.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. In many ways, our sales process at Zscaler is very similar to ServiceNow sales process. It's consultative, it is top-down selling, it's enterprise focus. Really, so we expect the same kind of stuff to carry on, there needs to be - there will be ongoing refinements, but don't expect any big changes. Some of the things, as I talked to Mike early on as he's understanding the organization, you'll see probably more focus on top account program. We have a big opportunity to take our large customers and double, triple or quadruple the ARR with us because our platform supports it. You're going to see more focus on verticals. We already have some level of verticals, public sectors of vertical for us, health care, you'll see more focus area. You're also going to see more persona focus in our sales staff. And I mentioned early on too, you'll probably see more focus on global system integrators as they drive some of the large transformations, but no significant changes.\nHamza Fodderwala: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC. Your line is open.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Remo, a question for you on the macro. There's been a couple of questions on billings and RPO and obviously, the federal strength. But I guess maybe I'm just a little confused because when I look back at your Q4 script, when you talked about the macros, you said you noted global uncertainty, but it seems to me like there was a change in tone from your comments here. I think you said - you noted customer sentiment is starting to stabilize. So I guess I'm just sort of curious, what drove that comment that things are starting to stabilize versus last quarter when you noted uncertainty? And is this something that happened during the quarter? Or anything that kind of prompt you to maybe change the script a bit from 4Q?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll let Jay comment to...\nJay Chaudhry: I think what I commented last time, was there's a slight reduction in scrutiny of the deal so the tone I exactly used. I think what we're seeing though, we are saying there's no change in macro the way we haven't seen. So macro is not playing a role at this stage. To say the forecast needs to be assuming macros not getting any worse than it has been.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari of Baird. Your line is open.\nShrenik Kothari: Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congress on the great Jay and Remo. It's great to see your focus on large transformative deals in top accounts as you just highlighted, Jay. The ongoing traction with bundled offerings across your emerging new products contributing to the new business. So all of that speaks to create in-house kind of innovation model that you have talked about. Jay, how do you see the role of strategic M&A play in expansion plans as we are starting to see with some others especially around cloud and data security. And what if any potential areas to focus? And Remo, can you provide the new versus upsell split in the quarter and how it compares to the expected the 40-60 mix. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Very good question. So with tighter funding and lots of security companies out there, we're seeing lots of attractive opportunities coming our way. We are looking at a number of innovative technologies and strong development teams. It's an option. It's done. A number of small ones in the past some time Yes, there are some areas, interesting technologies, especially in the new world of data and AI kind of stuff. It's an option we're keeping. I think you will not see us trying to buy revenue through an M&A. They're going to see us buying innovative, disruptive technologies that can help us get to market sooner, faster is important. And that integrates with our platform. I hate to see acquisition being done where you have standalone products, they don't work together with each other. But we are actively exploring those areas. There's no reason why we should not be. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. And the new and upsell was 45% new, 55% upsell. On our year-end call, we said we expect upsell to be above 60%. That's still our expectation for the year. But for the quarter, it was 55% or so.\nShrenik Kothari: Okay. Thanks a lot, Jay and Remo. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess, Remo, I wanted to dig into margins and specifically maybe gross margins, I mean, you guys are about 3x the size you were 2.5 years ago. But you've hovered kind of in this just below 81% gross margins, give or take, 50 basis points or so. And I appreciate the comments you had that emerging products will initially have lower gross margins. I think that's been the case for some time. But how do we think as you continue to grow at an accelerated pace and scale, how can we expect that to impact your margins? How are you managing your infrastructure? And then maybe just an adjacent comment on sales and marketing, it seems as though that was quite a bit lower than billings. Did you hold back on sales and marketing spend ahead of the arrival of Mike and Joyce? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, a few questions. Did we hold back the sales and marketing spend? No problem. We hold back sales and marketing spend, not really. It's just the way things worked out. Maybe a little bit on the marketing side, but that's about it, but not really. From a gross margin perspective, our stated gross margin has been between 78% and 82% then you're right, Brian. We've been in the 80% range for a long time. The beauty of Zscaler, quite frankly, is the platform technology that's been created. When I started here, we're doing 30 billion transactions per day. We are doing 360 billion transactions per day right now. And we still have 80% gross margin. The benefit that we have is we can make decisions really to maximize gross margin or to get applications or applications or increase the strength of our product by going through public cloud. So we balance that. I would expect gross margins to be in the 78%, 82% long term, short term, midterm, I'd expect the 80% gross margin range. If we need to shift our focus with more increase in our margins, we will but we do manage it. We do look at it and the emerging products do carry lower gross margins. And we'll keep on innovating. We're not going to slow down building more products.\nBrian Essex: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay Chaudhry, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: My sincere thanks to our employees, our customers and partners for delivering a strong quarter. Thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at some of the investor conferences. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Remo Canessa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. Our Q1 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 53% of revenue, EMEA was 32% and APJ was 15%. As Jay highlighted, from a new business perspective, Federal had its best new ACV quarter ever, growing over 90% year-over-year. Our new ACV outside of the Fed also grew year-over-year. . Our total calculated billings in Q1 grew 34% year-over-year to $457 million. On a sequential basis, total billings declined 37% quarter-over-quarter with a difficult comparison to Q4, which had a $20 million upfront billing on a multiyear deal. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years, and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Our calculated current billings grew 33% year-over-year, a seasonal decline of 32% quarter-over-quarter. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 30% from a year ago to $3.49 billion, The current RPO is approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q1 with 468 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding 19 such customers in the quarter. 14 of the 19 $1 million ARR customer adds were new logos, which was a record for Q1. The continued strength of this large customer metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We also entered the quarter with 2708 customers with greater than $100,000 in ARR. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 120%. Turning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.7% and compares to 80.7% in the prior quarter and 81.4% in the year ago quarter. Higher public cloud usage for emerging products drove the year-over-year change in the gross margin partially offset by approximately 60 basis points of benefit from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned last quarter, as a result of advances in technology and efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment. Starting this quarter, we extended the depreciable useful life of these assets in our cloud infrastructure from four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 26% year-over-year to $311 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model with operating margin reaching 18%, an increase of approximately 620 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue, Free cash flow benefited from strong collections for Q4 billings, including the $20 million upfront billings I mentioned. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. While the global macro environment remains challenging, and customers continue to scrutinize large deals from our perspective, customer sentiment seems to be stabilizing. Our customer engagements remain strong, and we have a large and growing pipeline. However, we want to be prudent in our assumptions given the sales leadership change. In our outlook for fiscal '24, we're balancing our business optimism and continued sales execution with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. With that in mind, let me provide our guidance for Q2 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $505 million to $507 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 30% to 31%, gross margins of 80%, including the change in accounting for useful life of server equipment. I would also like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for workloads will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time to market and grow, not optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $84 million to $86 million. Net other income of $15 million, income taxes of $8 million, earnings per share in the range of $0.57 to $0.58, assuming $160 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we're updating our guidance as follows: increased revenue in the range of $2.09 billion to $2.1 billion or year-over-year growth of 29% to 30%; calculated billings in the range of $2.52 billion to $2.56 billion or year-over-year growth of 24% to 26%, we still expect our first half mix to be approximately 42% of our full year billings guide; increased operating profit in the range of $360 million to $365 million, which reflects up to 250 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year; income taxes of $35 million; increased earnings per share in the range of $2.45 to $2.48 assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be up year-over-year and in the low 20% range. We continue to expect our data center CapEx to be high single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year, reflecting a three to four percentage points of headwind to free cash flow margins. We expect the timing of CapEx spend to be more towards the second half of the year as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. With our new CRO and CMO coming on board, we expect to step up our sales and marketing investments in the coming quarters. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we plan to invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth while increasing profitability. Operator, you may now open the call for questions. No, I think that's good, Jay. So yes. So we've increased our capacity in the quarter for our sales reps. Our plan is to increase capacity through the year. The one comment I'd make on Q1 is that we were - we did hit our expectations internally, but we expect to hit basically our sales targets for the year. The current sales capacity that we have supports our guidance. And as Jay mentioned, with the new leadership with Mike on board, we'll be looking to accelerate our hiring as we go through fiscal '24. Great question. So I mean the guide that we gave is solely related to basically the go-to-market with our new sales leadership on board. We feel it's prudent to do that. When you take a look at close rates for Q2 this year versus last year, we're being a little more conservative with our close rates this Q2. From a market - overall market perspective, the macro still remains challenging, but we feel that things - that there's more of an acceptance to Zero Trust, there's more of an understanding of our platform. So we feel good. Regarding guidance, whether it's more conservative now or not, I'd like to say we like being prudent. And again, it's all related to go-to-market with our new CRO, and I don't want to comment any further than that. It's another great question, Gabriel. I'll start and then maybe Jay can come in also. We've invested significantly in federal. This is not an overnight basically what's occurring. This is occurring over the last five, six years of significant investments both from a platform technology as well as people within the federal organization that works for us. We're in 12 of the 15 agencies, cabinet agencies. As Jay talked about in the script, our growth rate in federal in Q1 was 90% year-over-year. I feel that we are very well positioned in federal, what we talked about, we've got incredibly strong federal team. And I feel that going forward, federal should be a good driver, potentially significant driver for Zscaler. And we're doing well in federal. I'll turn it over to Jay. Yes. The macro has not gotten worse. And the comment, John, was related to quota-carrying reps. So we didn't hit our internal projections for internal reps. We do expect to catch up. We've talked about before on earlier calls, we're in a huge market opportunity. We're going to invest significantly in our company. You can see in the second half, we're going to increase our sales and marketing spend based on our guidance. That's related to just overall, we've gotten new CMO on board with Mike on Board. That was the gist of the comment. It's related basically purely to quota-carrying reps. We did increase capacity, but not to the levels we wanted. And from my perspective, John, it's really execution on our part. We need to execute better on that part. Yes. I mean a lot of questions in there, but I appreciate you bringing off. RPO decline, it's primarily related to federal. Federal is a big piece of our business. And when you look at federal, federal contracts or even though they're multiyear contracts, really take federal in for one year in our CRPO. So that was a big driver for that. When you take out basically federal out of the contract duration, really contract durations are comparable year-over-year and also quarter-over-quarter. Discount levels, no, not really seeing anything on a discount level perspective. I'd say it's the same and has been the same for a while. First half, second half, you can expect billings to be in the 42% range in the first half and the rest basically in the second half. But the RPO basically relates to - primarily relates to federal business, which is one year - one year recognized. Yes. So the leadership we have in our sales organization is very strong with what Dali has created. I don't see significant changes. Maybe Jay can speak to it, but I don't see significant changes. And again, the structure that we've built under Dali's leadership was a very strong basically structure. Yes. I'll let Jay comment to... Yes. And the new and upsell was 45% new, 55% upsell. On our year-end call, we said we expect upsell to be above 60%. That's still our expectation for the year. But for the quarter, it was 55% or so. Yes, a few questions. Did we hold back the sales and marketing spend? No problem. We hold back sales and marketing spend, not really. It's just the way things worked out. Maybe a little bit on the marketing side, but that's about it, but not really. From a gross margin perspective, our stated gross margin has been between 78% and 82% then you're right, Brian. We've been in the 80% range for a long time. The beauty of Zscaler, quite frankly, is the platform technology that's been created. When I started here, we're doing 30 billion transactions per day. We are doing 360 billion transactions per day right now. And we still have 80% gross margin. The benefit that we have is we can make decisions really to maximize gross margin or to get applications or applications or increase the strength of our product by going through public cloud. So we balance that. I would expect gross margins to be in the 78%, 82% long term, short term, midterm, I'd expect the 80% gross margin range. If we need to shift our focus with more increase in our margins, we will but we do manage it. We do look at it and the emerging products do carry lower gross margins. And we'll keep on innovating. We're not going to slow down building more products. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Chaudhry",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. I'm pleased to share our first quarter results, which exceeded our guidance across all metrics. We delivered 40% revenue growth and 34% billings growth. Our operating profit and free cash flow more than doubled year-over-year, and free cash flow margin reached a record 45%. We exceeded the rule of 60 for the 13th consecutive quarter, at a significant scale of $2 billion plus in ARR, we are delivering a unique combination of high growth and high profitability that only a few SaaS companies have accomplished. In Q1, we executed well in a challenging macro environment and what is typically a slower quarter for us. The elevated scrutiny of large deals remains mostly unchanged. The increased frequency of high-profile breaches, coupled with impending SEC disclosure requirements has propelled Zero Trust security more into focus at the management and the Board level. Against this backdrop, we achieved a Q1 record for number of new logo customers with over $1 million in ARR. We also achieved a record for new pipeline generation in a quarter. More customers are adopting our broader platform to consolidate multiple point products, increasing our average deal size. As a result, we are actively working on more large, multiyear, multi-pillar opportunities than ever before. To meet this demand and to further scale our business, we're adding two key go-to-market leaders, one in sales and one in marketing. I will provide details about these new executives after reviewing our Q1 performance. Let me highlight three factors that drove our strong Q1 performance. First, large new logo wins were strong this quarter with a Q1 record of 14 new logos contributing over $1 million ARR. We ended with 468 such customers, up 34% year-over-year. These wins spanned across many verticals, proving that every vertical needs Zscaler. Second, Customers are buying the broader Zscaler platform with multiple product pillars. I have said before, over time, I believe every one of our customers will buy ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for every user to deliver secure, fast and reliable access to any application anywhere. This quarter, nearly half of our new logo customers purchased all three user pillars, ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. In addition, strong platform upsells drove our 120% dollar-based net retention rate. Third, this was a record U.S. federal quarter with new business up over 90% year-over-year, including four deals that are greater than $1 million in ACV. We are starting to see larger awards as multiple U.S. federal agencies are standardizing on Zscaler to meet the President's executive order to adopt Zero Trust security. We are extremely proud of having landed 12 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies as our customers, where we have plenty of opportunity to expand. For example, at a cabinet level agency, we expanded the ZIA and ZPA deployment from 25,000 users to 100,000 users, while cross-selling ZDX for all 100,000 users. We also won a top defense integrator who purchased ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for its employees. In parallel, they launched a go-to-market service to take Zscaler to their federal customers. As our SI partners are selling and deploying Zscaler for their customers they are also adopting Zscaler to make their own business secure, agile and competitive. From my conversations with hundreds of IT executives, it's clear that cybersecurity is the number 1 IT spending priority. Adopting Zero Trust architecture and protecting their enterprise from Gen AI risks are top priorities for CISOs in 2024. We have enhanced our data protection policies or AIML applications and tools to protect our customers' risk of data loss due to increasing use of Gen AI, our AI-powered threat protection uses a diffusion model to detect complex exploits and to catch sophisticated phishing attacks that evade traditional security controls. These AI-driven features are included in our Advanced Plus bundles, which are often priced 20% higher than advanced bundles. We now secured on average over 2 billion AI transactions every month for our customers.  Next, let me discuss some of our Q1 deals, which demonstrate our differentiation and business value. We are starting to see some wins where customers are coming to us after initially purchasing a firewall-based single vendor SASE solution that failed to deliver in the real world. For those who are not familiar, firewall-based single vendor SASE is the combination of SD-WAN and firewall and VPN deployed as VMs in the cloud. A leading software company made an architectural shift to our Zero Trust exchange platform after trying to deploy a leading firewall vendor SASE solutions across 50 office locations and multiple public cloud sites. It became clear to the customer that this solution expanded their attack surface to all locations and increase the risk of lateral threat movement. They decided to move to our Zero Trust security with the purchase of Zscaler for users, our complete bundle for ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for all 25,000 employees. Our Zero Trust Exchange connects users directly to apps, eliminating attack surface and lateral threat movement. The Unmanaged devices, the customer is deploying our browser isolation with ZPA to enable third parties to access their applications. Deals like this reinforce our conviction that firewall-based SaaS solutions are not the future of security that some analysts advocate. Customers are choosing Zscaler's purpose-built Zero Trust platform. Let me highlight one new logo win where our superior security helped the customer after a breach. Despite extensive investments in firewalls and VPNs, a hospitality and gaming company experienced a crippling Ransomware breach. To restore their operations, they purchased the entire Zscaler for users bundle for 25,000 users. With Zscaler, the apps are now hidden from threat actors behind our Zero Trust Exchange and can't be discovered, exploited or DDoS. This customer also purchased our new Risk 360 solution to understand the organization-wide risk and to get actionable information to reduce it. We have shared with you that data protection is one of the fastest-growing solutions for us. For our customers, after implementing cyber protection, adopting data protection is the natural second phase of their Zero Trust journey. For example, a Fortune 500 travel and hospitality services provider more than doubled their annual spend with us with data protection being a critical component of the upsell. The first purchase was ZIA for 22,000 users to inspect all traffic, including TLS encrypted traffic for cyber protection. As the next step, they are implementing real-time in-line DLP for sensitive data. Our solution also enables this customer to enforce policies for secure use of AI applications. These deals highlight the breadth and depth of our Zero Trust security platform. We also help our customers achieve high ROI by eliminating tech debt and consolidating multiple point products. For example, a Fortune 200 financial services group turned to Zscaler to consolidate data centers and safely adopt cloud with the necessary security controls for regulatory compliance. They purchased Zscaler for users bundled for 10,000 employees and workload communication for 1,500 workloads. By leveraging our cloud platform, they will eliminate half of the data centers, reduce their MPLS spend and consolidate security and networking client products. We are eliminating several point products, including secure web gateways, firewalls, IPS appliances, VPNs, CASB and DLP from seven security vendors. This deal is expected to generate a remarkable 5x ROI for the customer. I'm also excited to share that ZDX one of our emerging pillars continues to gain significant customer adoption. It is an important part of every deal conversation due to its unique ability to eliminate IT blind spots. ZDX significantly reduces helpless hours spent on ticket resolutions and manual correlation or metrics. Let me highlight a new logo deal where ZDX played a pivotal role. A top-ranked U.S. hospital network purchased ZIA and ZDX advance plus for 87,000 users and ZPA for 40,000 users. What initially began as a ZIA and ZPA project quickly evolved into a significant ZDX opportunity. The ZDX component alone is seven figures in ACV. Unlike the existing performance tools, ZDX provides comprehensive visibility and root cause analysis for users, devices and applications. This deal is a great example of the leverage we gained from working with system integrators like Accenture, who was awarded this overall transformation project. We're also seeing strong customer interest in workload protection on other emerging product pillar. Our Zero Trust Exchange is designed for any to any secured communication. It may be users to apps workload to workload or IoT OT devices. Thousands of enterprises already leverage Zscaler platform for secure user-to-app communication. It is natural for them to extend our Zero Trust platform to secure their workload communication. To radically simplify multi-cloud connectivity and automated deployment of workload protection at scale, we recently released significant enhancements to our workload communications offering, including granular workload segmentation using AWS user-defined tags, the first Zero Trust security solution for workloads in the market, the only alternative is legacy virtual firewalls and real-time auto discovery of cloud resources. More than one-third of our customers have made initial purchases for workload protection. Workload communication often starts with small land deals. And we expect to rapidly expand to secure the growing number of workloads. Zscaler pioneered Zero Trust and SASE, both delivered by our cloud-native platform. we have established ourselves as a premier provider for user protection and are now making progress expanding into workload protection and IoT OT protection. We continue to push the boundaries of what our platform can achieve, extending it for B2B and 5G use cases. As we are like a switchboard for all communications, we collect full transaction logs and trillions of signals daily. We are utilizing those signals and logs to deliver AI-powered insights and automation for our customers. Let me discuss a few of the high-value products in our AI cloud family. We recently launched Risk360, which is the industry's first holistic AI-powered risk quantification and mitigation solution. It delivers up-to-date risk posture and recommends corrective actions to mitigate risk in a timely fashion. We have already closed 10 plus Risk360 deals and are in active evaluations with over 100 enterprises. For these deals, we are getting 6-figure ACV on average, and we expect to grow this value over time. Risk360 provides critical insights to CISOs when reporting on cybersecurity risk strategy and governance, particularly in light of new SEC regulations. Another exciting new product, breach predictor currently under development uses predictive and generative AI models to anticipate potential bread scenarios and eliminate those risks before they materialize. Early feedback from customers who have previewed breach predictor indicates the enormous potential value this solution can deliver. We are working with our technology partners to bring this world-class innovation to thousands of customers to proactively protect against potential breaches. While we have achieved tremendous success for user protection solutions, our platform's potential in other categories is just beginning. Our relentless innovations have paved the way for an ever-growing stream of opportunities. As our platform continues to scale and expand, our go-to-market efforts are continuing to evolve and scale as well. to enable the next stage of go-to-market scaling. I'm excited to share the appointments of two exceptional leaders, Mike Rich, CRO and President of Global Sales; and Joyce Kim as CMO. They bring a wealth of experience in driving revenue and pipeline growth. Mike joins from ServiceNow, Will as the President for Americas, we establish an efficient and scalable process to drive deeper engagements to large enterprises and to scale their business to over $8 billion in revenue and experience that's critical to the next phase of our growth journey. Joyce's previous experience includes CMO roles at Twilio, Genesis and ARM with expertise in building high-performance marketing teams and driving impactful marketing strategies and campaigns. With Mike assuming leadership of our sales organization, Dali in his capacity as the COO can focus on scaling our business operations. Dali has been instrumental in establishing the go-to-market process. which has helped Zscaler achieve a milestone of $2 billion in ARR. With our expanded portfolio of products and experienced CRO and CMO on board we will further scale our value-add sales process for larger platform deals, which will sustain our high growth. I'm thrilled to have strong go-to-market leaders who we believe will drive world-class execution to scale our business beyond $5 billion in ARR. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results. Brad, very good question. It is flattering to see all kind of vendors becoming SASE vendors overnight. But the challenge for them would be, it's a different architecture. It's not an incremental change and feature you can add on to it. That's where we spent a dozen plus years building a true Zero Trust architecture, which is an advantage. That's why we became the market leader. We pioneered this market. We evangelized to the fact that this is what's needed for better cybersecurity and ransomware protection and cost reduction. The way I look at - to sustain high growth is the following. One, is there a market demand came out? The market is growing and expanding at much faster pace than I even thought. Two, do you have the right platform with the right architecture, the right functionality? You've seen us build this platform on a true Zero Trust architecture and expanded over the years. I think of what we had at the time of IPO versus what we have today. And the third area is go-to-market execution. We've done a great job starting with IPO, crossing $2 billion in ARR. And now we've got our sights set on crossing $5 billion. And we have been growing and adapting go-to-market also along with the platform. That's why I'm very excited about bringing two key leaders: Mike as CRO; and Joyce as CMO, who can help us take us to the next level. Great market execution, great platform. I think with that, I'm very excited about the opportunity in front of us. You know what I said many times, firewalls won't go away, but they will become like mainframes. We have been replacing firewalls at the branches from the last several years. Now that trend is accelerated. And from one of the new things that's done to help accelerate the demise of firewalls and branches is our branch connector technology, which now we package to make it available. So you can become a Starbucks-like office in a matter of minutes rather than trying to wait for a long, long time. So we've seen a campus environment becoming just like that. The only place where firewalls have been playing a significant role for a while is the data center, the east-west traffic and the like. You know that traffic is going away from the data center and that demand has to go away. So a big thing for someone to do it right, had to really offer a Starbucks like branch and zero-trust architecture. Market has made progress with traditional SD-WAN. We think traditional SD-WAN is a transitory technology. And once we have [broached] (ph) the market with Branch Connector actually is the next big phase to make it simple. Very excited with the opportunity to make the world free of firewalls. Thank you. Sure. Alex, you rightfully said, we don't have a simple straight VAR channel that traditionally firewall and network security vendors had. We have VARs who play a role. We have system integrators and we have service providers. And then there's a separate set of SIs for federal business as well. Let's look at each of these areas. VARs were slow to adopt Zscaler but now as the market has moved more and more of them are embracing us and our leader, [Indiscernible] has launched a number of programs where we're seeing very good progress, with new source pipeline coming from our channel. The area we see probably a very rapidly growing opportunity is global systems incubators. Actually, my coming from ServiceNow, where a lot of partnership with global SIs have played a big role I expect that area to accelerate. And in this next level of fulfillment versus transformation. We like partners who work with us and work with partners - sorry, our customers to do transformation. And we have been selective. You aren't going to find us with 5,000 or 10,000 channel partners. Our partners are hundreds. And we are doing targeted programs. We're working with some of the very large global SIs and very large deals to do transformation. I mentioned one of these deals in my prepared remarks, and I mentioned another SI who actually brought Zscaler internal along with actually launching the service to go out there. Remo, do you want to add any more color? Okay. Thank you, Alex. Yes. So we have had advanced bundles that include a bunch of functionality of ZIA or ZPA type of stuff. Now we have added functionality where some of the data protection can be done with AI advanced techniques, some of the cyber threat protection can be done using that. So we clear these bundles, we call them advanced plus. So we're getting very good traction. And these advanced plus bundles are about 20% or so higher than the non-plus bundles. So this is a good area. In fact, this is a good way for us to reach our customers as they're looking at buying these bundles with additional functionality, it's helping them, it's helping us. Now in addition, we are also creating some standalone SKUs. We talked about Risk360, a very popular recently introduced product. When I talked about having closed 10-plus deals in a pretty significant manner where the average ACV is sitting in six figures. And then you'll see some more SKUs coming down the road as you'll really be - as AI cloud is one of the big focus areas. And the reason we're making focus is because we have better logs, better data to train AIML models. The starting point of good AIML is the data that we have better than anybody else. You know when Zscaler customer started working with us several years ago, the number 1 focus for them was cyber protection, so they don't get compromised. Data protection was slower in adoption, data protection also takes a little bit work, there's more contributions and customization needed. And in large enterprises where our large customers have been, they've used Symantec 1, 2, as one of the primary data protection products. Over the past five, six years ago, we have expanded our data protection platform significantly, not just in line, but can be actually endpoint DLP cloud data protection, all those things, including EDM IDM technology are there. So with all that technology, we are in a great position to replace some of those complicated data protection products out there. And it's natural. If we are sitting in traffic path, if we are doing access and inspection, it's natural for the customers to use our cloud because the traffic is coming to a cloud from all kinds of positions. That's really driving our growth. That's why we talked about this data protection DRR is approaching $0.25 billion and it grew 60% year-over-year for us, and we see a lot of growth for quite a long time in this area. Did I answer your question? The one comment I'll make is, we have more complete platform for data protection. And customers want one set of policies, whether they want to secure data at rest or data at motion. That's why it's picking up quite fast. Yes. So this is the how I think about it. First of all, number of users in the federal commerce DoD, non-DoD. Yes, we do have 12 of the 15 cabin lab agencies, but they are in various stages. There's a big, big upsell opportunities there itself. Then DoD, just scratching the surface out there. So if you look at from a number of users' point of view, it's a massive market in front of us because we count number of users. Then there are workloads for federal. There's a whole range of IoT, OT devices in federal business that needs to be taken care of. So massive stuff, but then on top of that, it's a platform. Our platform has expanded, it keeps on expanding. So I think this is a significant growth opportunity for a long, long time. And then DoD takes us to next - sorry, federal takes to other federal friendly countries out there. They all want to follow the NATO friendly countries want to adopt what U.S. has done here. That's an opportunity for us. The state governments are getting very, very worried about adopting Zero Trust. That's another big opportunity for us. So very bullish. We've done some big investments, and that's why we have some of the best certifications for Zscaler platform than any other company out there. It's a very good question. So all those four letter acronyms you gave us. And we tried to track them. And there have been 100-plus vendors in that space over the past two years. So about a year ago, I used to see a new vendor show up every other day. For the last year or so it has slowed down and actually they're shrinking. But there's adjacent next to it. That is cloud workload communication. Cloud workload communication is about workloads soft, Internet workloads talking to each other. That's where our core strength comes in the Zero Trust architecture. We are the only vendor, I know out there. We have workloads talk to each other through Zero Trust architecture without being on the network. That's our starting point. Then we look at the CNAPP as an extended. To me, CNAPP is almost like cases in many ways. You make API call, leading logs, you're leading configurations to figure out the risk and whatnot. And that is towards shifting more of the left. We believe that a combination of cloud workload detection, along with CNAPP, puts us in a better position. Regarding product net growth. I think there's an interesting opportunity for some of the companies obviously, we don't come from that side. I haven't seen many, many security companies have grown to hundreds of millions of dollars doing product that growth. But we are watching and monitoring the space, but we will be going from where our strength is. Our large customers, loves Zscalers users, now they're embracing Zscaler for workloads, for communication, and that allows us to extend it to CNAPP space as well. That's how we look at it. Dali has an active role as the COO of the company. He has played a phenomenal role in Zscalers growth you've seen over the past four years. He have built a great go-to-market machine that has helped us go past $2 billion in ARR. So Mike's goal is take us from here to $5 billion and beyond. This frees up Dali to focus more in his capacity as a COO to really help scale our business operations capabilities. Now what do you mean by that? As we are growing at a rapid pace. We have many things to improve on scaling side up in the operational side, streamlining our post-sale customer engagements. Ranging from support to TAM to deployment, to success. How do you bring them together to make it more productive and better stay in line for better value realization of the customers. Second example, we do cash process systems, productivity improvement, streamlining. If we do a better job in these areas as a company will become a lot more productive and Dali's experience across the company will help us achieve some of those key things that are needed Yes. So our direct business versus channel business, almost all of our business is supposed to be changed. A few customers insist that they must do a deal directly with us. So the channel is supposed to bring leverage. The more channel partners are working closely with us, the more heavy lifting to do, better productivity, better our sales acceleration happens. So it's important for us. Now in a transformation sale like ours, the channel wasn't quite ready there to say, hey, tell me the latest box I'm ready to sell. We had to work with them to show them transformation. Federal government is driving big transformation at all levels. President's Executive order is asking for Zero Trust architecture. And there are a large number of systems integrators in the federal market who actually need technology like ours to make it happen. And in federal, it becomes more interesting as you must have certification up to certain levels, there are FedRAMP certification at the medium level at high level and whatnot and IFI. We've done most of them. So with certifications leveraging those system integrators we are able to drive transformation. And I think we are in a very good shape sitting there with a big market, working side by side with our partners. So there's no cannibalization. Did I make it clear? Or did I miss something? Yes. In many ways, our sales process at Zscaler is very similar to ServiceNow sales process. It's consultative, it is top-down selling, it's enterprise focus. Really, so we expect the same kind of stuff to carry on, there needs to be - there will be ongoing refinements, but don't expect any big changes. Some of the things, as I talked to Mike early on as he's understanding the organization, you'll see probably more focus on top account program. We have a big opportunity to take our large customers and double, triple or quadruple the ARR with us because our platform supports it. You're going to see more focus on verticals. We already have some level of verticals, public sectors of vertical for us, health care, you'll see more focus area. You're also going to see more persona focus in our sales staff. And I mentioned early on too, you'll probably see more focus on global system integrators as they drive some of the large transformations, but no significant changes. I think what I commented last time, was there's a slight reduction in scrutiny of the deal so the tone I exactly used. I think what we're seeing though, we are saying there's no change in macro the way we haven't seen. So macro is not playing a role at this stage. To say the forecast needs to be assuming macros not getting any worse than it has been. Yes. Very good question. So with tighter funding and lots of security companies out there, we're seeing lots of attractive opportunities coming our way. We are looking at a number of innovative technologies and strong development teams. It's an option. It's done. A number of small ones in the past some time Yes, there are some areas, interesting technologies, especially in the new world of data and AI kind of stuff. It's an option we're keeping. I think you will not see us trying to buy revenue through an M&A. They're going to see us buying innovative, disruptive technologies that can help us get to market sooner, faster is important. And that integrates with our platform. I hate to see acquisition being done where you have standalone products, they don't work together with each other. But we are actively exploring those areas. There's no reason why we should not be. Remo? My sincere thanks to our employees, our customers and partners for delivering a strong quarter. Thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at some of the investor conferences. Thank you."
