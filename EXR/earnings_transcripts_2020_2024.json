[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norman, Vice President of Capital Markets. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nJeff Norman: Thank you Cindy. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's fourth quarter 2020 Earnings Call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the Company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, February 23rd, 2021. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer. And Joe, you may be on mute. Operator, do we have Joe's line connected.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff. Can you hear me now?\nJeff Norman: Yes, we hear you now. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sorry everyone. Thanks Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. I hope everyone and their families remain healthy and that your 2021 is off to a good start. In my 35 years in real estate, I can't remember another year with as many positive and negative twist and turns in such a short period of time as we saw in 2020. The range of emotions I felt from March, when I was worried about the daily safety of our employees and customers; to April, when I wondered when rental demand in our sector would return; to September, when we saw some of the strongest occupancy and rental rate fundamentals in our Company's history are hard to describe. I am proud of our team's resilience in how well they responded to 2020's unprecedented challenges. Our team's efforts together with our balanced portfolio, sophisticated platform and innovative external growth efforts yielded a great result in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with same-store occupancy of 94.8%, an all-time year-end high for Extra Space. Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which we have experienced since August and a return to positive same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2.3%, a 380 basis point acceleration from the third quarter. We also had excellent expense control with a 0.6% decrease in same-store expenses, resulting in 3.4% NOI growth in the quarter. Our return to positive NOI gains coupled with strong external investment activity yielded core FFO growth of 16.5% in the quarter. Despite the challenges of the year, the fourth quarter was full of accomplishments, including completion of two preferred equity investments totaling $350 million, $147 million in acquisitions, $168 million in bridge loan closings, the addition of 44 stores to our management platform, and receipt of NAREIT's Leader in the Light award, recognizing Extra Space for its sustainability efforts. This is the first time a storage company has received this award. While we are excited about the accomplishments of 2020, we are even more optimistic about how our efforts have positioned us for 2021. Rentals continue to be steady and vacates continue to be muted. We are heading into 2021 with the highest occupancy we have ever experienced at this time of year and expect rental rates to remain strong. We have already added 51 third-party management stores in 2021 and our acquisition, management and bridge loan pipelines are robust. But we are also mindful of the risks we face. We recognize that current or potential government regulations could impede same-store revenue and expense performance. We believe that vacates may eventually return to more normal levels and we recognize that the challenges related to new supply have not subsided completely and will continue to suppress rate growth in many markets. As in the past, our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance in the face of any risks which materialize. In short, despite significant turbulence, we had a very successful 2020 and look forward to an even better 2021. We continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholders' long-term value and to deliver the results our shareholders have come to expect from Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a great fourth quarter with reaccelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers. Late fees and other income continue to be lower year-over-year and partially offset rental income, but we saw improvement in both line items from levels experienced in the third quarter. We lowered expenses in all controllable expense categories in the quarter and despite property tax increases of 6.4%, we still delivered a reduction in same-store expenses overall. This resulted in same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.48, a year-over-year increase of 16.5% and well above consensus estimates. Our same-store performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth in tenant reinsurance income, management fees, and interest and investment income. We continue to evolve our balance sheet to reduce secured debt and increase the size of our unencumbered pool. Our efforts resulted in Moody's issuing Extra Space a BAA2 credit rating on January 28th, our second investment grade credit rating now providing us access to the public bond market. We are excited to add another capital option to finance future growth, reduced total cost of debt, and further ladder our maturities. At year-end, we had higher than normal revolver balances and variable rate debt due to the elevated capital activity that took place in the fourth quarter, including settling our convertible notes, completing preferred equity investments, and closing substantial bridge loan and acquisition volume. A significant portion of these transactions were temporarily funded by draws on our revolving lines. We are comfortable doing so -- we were comfortable doing so knowing we were actively issuing on our ATM, had pending bridge loan sales and are recapitalizing stores into a JV, which bring our revolver balances down to historical levels. Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2021 with ranges that are wider than previous -- than in previous years to address some of the uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on customer behavior and government regulation. Our new same-store pool includes a total of 860 stores, which is essentially flat with last year. The number of new stores added to the pool was generally offset by sites removed due to disposition or redevelopment. We anticipate the changes in the same-store pool will benefit our 2021 same-store revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 4.25% to 5.5%, driven by higher occupancy in the first half of the year and elevated rates in new and existing -- to new and existing customers. Same-store expense growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, primarily driven by higher property tax expense. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth range of 4.25% to 6.25%. The acquisition market continues to be expensive and we will remain disciplined but opportunistic. We expect to do significant acquisition volume and plan to close a number of transactions with joint venture partners. Our guidance assumes $350 million in Extra Space investment, approximately $180 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to close approximately $400 million of bridge loans and plan to retain 20% to 25% of those balances or approximately $100 million in 2021. We have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for shareholders and we will be creative as we deploy capital in the sector. Our full year core FFO is estimated to be between $5.85 and $6.05 per share. We anticipate $0.16 of dilution from value-add acquisitions or C of O stores, down $0.04 from 2020. We also added additional guidance related to our expected interest income for 2021 as well as notes clarifying the recognition of our preferred investments in SmartStop and NexPoint, which can be found in the outlook tables of our earnings release. As Joe mentioned, 2020 has been a memorable year for Extra Space. We are excited to turn the page and are already on our way to a very strong 2021. And with that, let's turn it over to Cindy to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America.\nAlua Askarbek: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions today and congrats on a great quarter. And it looks like 2021 is going to be great for you guys as well. So, I just wanted to start off and ask a little bit more on what you guys are expecting for revenues this year? So, how are you thinking about occupancy for the first half versus the second half and a little bit more on the rental rate assumptions?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Alua this is Scott. I can give you a little bit more detail in terms of what our guidance assumes. We are assuming that our occupancy stays strong. So, in January and into February, our gap has actually expanded to be just over 300 basis points. So what's happened is January and February typically have lower occupancy, declining occupancy. We haven't seen that. So we moved from 240 basis point delta in occupancy to over 300 basis points where we are today. So we are assuming that occupancy holds at this high level through the end of the summer, at which point we expect occupancy to fall more to historical levels. So last year in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter we saw occupancy 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher than normal. This year, we expect that to be a 100 basis points to 200 basis points headwind for us. So we expect it to be lower and to fall back more to historical levels. We expect the first quarter to be strong in terms of revenue growth continuing to accelerate from the fourth quarter. The second quarter should be the peak and that is mainly due to some easy comps from last year and then continued good into the third quarter with the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter being challenging.\nAlua Askarbek: Okay, makes sense. And then I guess just a little bit more on the third-party management for 2021. You mentioned that you already added 51 new stores. Can we expect a large acceleration in third-party management compared to 2020 and 2019?\nJoe Margolis: So, this is Joe. The -- and thank you for your kind words about our performance. It's not Scott and me, it's over 4,000 employees who every day bring their best work and have really done an outstanding job. With respect to third-party management, our activity in January and February with 51 stores added is a little elevated because we took 37 stores on in connection with the JCAP transaction. So I would expect our 2021 activity to be similar to our 2020 activity in terms of gains.\nAlua Askarbek: Okay, got it. Thank you so much.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Alua.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Hi, thank you. Can you guys just provide a little bit of color on how existing customer rate increases have been trending just relative to your historical norms? And do you suspect that you're going to be able to continue pushing these pretty aggressively in '21?\nJoe Margolis: So we're still subject to restrictions on existing customer rate increase in many markets across the country and that -- we abide by all those regulations and that of course is the limit to us. Absent that, our ECRI increases average high-single-digits, 10%, about the same as always. And interestingly, we continue to move out rates in response to ECRI and we have seen no increase in move-out rates. So, hopefully, at some point those regulations -- restrictions are lifted and we can get back to fully normal behavior. But we are limited now. We understood that and took that into account in our guidance, and hopefully, we can get back to normal sooner rather than later.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay, thank you. And then just to make sure, on growth front, are you guys currently seeing more opportunity with stabilized assets or with assets in some sort of lease-up right now?\nJoe Margolis: I'm sorry, more opportunities with what type of assets? I couldn't understand you.\nSpenser Allaway: Stabilized versus assets in some form of lease-up.\nJoe Margolis: Yes, thank you very much. So -- and sorry about that. So, what we bought is more lease-up assets. Stabilized -- pricing on stabilized assets is very hard for us to make sense of. We will probably be more active on that front in 2021 with joint venture partners, just to make the pricing makes sense to us. But everything we bought in 2020 was lease-up. If you kind of average, we were in the mid-3s first year and stabilized on average in 17 months in the mid-6s. So I think that's the best use of our acquisition dollars today.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay, thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.\nRick Skidmore: Good morning, Joe and Scott. Question on Joe for the -- on the supply growth, how are you seeing supply across your markets? You mentioned kind of flattish. But are there any particular markets where you're seeing outsized supply growth? Or how are you thinking about supply in 2021 and into 2022? Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thanks. Good question. So supply is still an issue, that's the short answer. We did see substantial pull back in 2020 due to COVID. We -- I'm going to speak to our same-store pool, not national statistics, I'll speak to what matters to us. We had projected in 2020 that about 30% of our same-store pool would be impacted by new supply and when you look at the actual numbers, it was only around 21%. So almost a third got pushed or canceled because of COVID. In 2022, we project 22% of our same-store pool will be impacted by new stores and I think there will be, like there is every year, some number of those stores get delayed or maybe even canceled. So we are seeing an incremental decrease in new supply and that's good news. But I would caution you on two fronts; one is, we still have significant supply delivered in many markets over the last several years and we're working through that and that affects our ability to push rate. And secondly, with the performance of storage, particularly in comparison to other asset classes, I would not be surprised if that attracts more capital, more developers to the market. So new supply isn't going away. It's not in many -- every market, but in the markets where it is, it's something we need to deal with.\nRick Skidmore: Thank you. And then, Joe, just maybe one other follow-up on the bridge loan program. You mentioned, I think $400 million targeted for 2021. Is that sort of in the pipeline or is that an aspirational goal? Maybe help us frame that and then how you think about the path forward from some of these bridge loan and other investments that you're making to help with the FFO growth?\nJoe Margolis: So, we have about $196 million in the pipeline. So we believe $400 million is an achievable goal and the bridge loan program is very accretive for us because the whole note reach maybe in the 5% to 6% but by the time we sell the A and keep the B, the rate we're getting is 9%, 10%, 11% plus we're getting management of the stores and the economics there. We also hope to buy a bunch of these and I think we bought one and have two that we're targeting to buy. And it's an immature program. But as we get deeper into it, I hope it turns into an acquisition pipeline as well.\nRick Skidmore: Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you -- so migration has been a big topic over this period or this pandemic and I was just wondering, are you starting to see that at all across your portfolio and does it make you sort of change, wherein you're thinking about where you might want to invest in the future as you look at acquisitions?\nJoe Margolis: Thanks Smedes. So, we haven't seen differential in performance between the markets that have been called out as people are fleeing San Francisco or people are fleeing New York and the markets that people are supposedly fleeing to. And I don't know if that's because people are storing their stuff in Manhattan before they go out to Borough, New Jersey and at some point, that will unwind. But as of now, we don't see performance differential based on that reported phenomenon. What we do see is performance difference based on new supply, to go back to the previous question. That's where we have the weakest power. I'll also tell you, there's been a number of articles coming out recently that question whether the urban flight is as widespread as been reported in COVID. I just read an article that most of the people leaving San Francisco are settling in the counties around San Francisco, they're not going to Utah or Florida or Texas. And then lastly, and this is just one man's opinion, I don't believe COVID is the death of New York City. I believe young people like to live in cities. Cities have a lot of advantages. And I don't believe that this is the death of the big cities. So to answer your question, we're much more focused on micro markets as we look to buy things, and we're not -- we have not yet adjusted our investment strategy based on urban flight.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, thank you for that. I just wanted to ask you too, your net-adds in the fourth quarter for third-party management were quite a bit lower than the gross additions. And I just was wondering what sort of caused that churn and is that something that you would expect to see going forward, perhaps, seeing it like from the first quarter.\nJoe Margolis: Yes, great question. So, we had 38 stores leave our platform in the fourth quarter and 87 leave our platform in 2020, almost all of them were because of sales. Very, very few were a change in managers. We bought 15 of those 87 stores, not a huge percentage and the issue is pricing. We try to remain disciplined and not overpay, in our view, for things. There is also some subset of these stores that are not of a quality we want to own. We have to manage but not own. So given where prices is, I would expect that we continue to have sales. I hope we can do a better job through structures that we buy more of them, but our number one goal is not to do something that's dilutive to our shareholder's value. So if pricing gets beyond what we think is reasonable, we're going to do our best to transition the store to the new buyer.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you appreciate it.\nJoe Margolis:  Sure. Thanks, Smedes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, good afternoon. First question, Scott, apologies if I missed this, but what were move-in rates or move in rate growth, I guess, in the quarter and in January and what are you seeing early in February?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So, our achieved rates in the fourth quarter and really for the back half of the year, we're about 10% year -- ahead of where they were the prior year. And in the first quarter of this year, January and February, we're seeing rates be at very similar levels, about 10% ahead of where they were last year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then, just following up on rental rate trends and just given how the industry has tightened up here over the last couple of quarters. And you've seen a lot of rent growth during the off peak season which Joe, I think, you noted began in August. As we think about the peak leasing season ramping up now, is it possible that we see rate increases similar to what Extra Space and the industry has experienced historically during the peak periods from where rates are today and is that factored into guidance?\nScott Stubbs: So, we are assuming that the first quarter we continue these rate that we've been -- we've been experiencing. Second quarter, our achieved rates, we would expect to be very strong, because if you remember, in the second quarter when things really dropped, we dropped rates 20% to 30%. And so when you're looking at a rate that was 20% to 30% lower and then it's already 10% above, you're going to see some significant rate growth for customers that move in at April, May even into early June and those are all factored into our guidance.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And how far above -- where are rates today relative to sort of that March, April, May timeframe?\nScott Stubbs: So if you -- I'll just give you one point of reference and that's our achieved -- I mean our achieved rate compared to our in-place rents and this isn't necessarily the move-out rate versus the move-in rate. Our in-place rents are actually above our achieved rates today. Now remember, this is the time of year when this is usually the most negative, meaning your achieved rates in January and February it's the highest -- your existing customer rates are compared to your achieved rates on an annual basis. So the fact that our rates are up 10% year-over-year in February is good. So our in-place rents are about high single-digits above where the achieved rates are today.\nTodd Thomas: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one question, the taxes in the TRS that are forecast to be up to about $19 million to $20 million. I know in the past you've executed on sort of a variety of different strategies to minimize that tax expenses. Are there any opportunities that you see today as you look ahead?\nJoe Margolis: So we are continuing to take advantage of some solar opportunities where you -- where you continue to use that from an ESG perspective and a sustainability perspective as well as some tax benefits. That's the big one that we have today.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Do you see any potential downside to that -- the tax expense in the TRS going forward?\nScott Stubbs: So, I think it will depend a little bit on where rates -- tax rates go, and then also what happens with solar credits. I think that you've seen them burning off. I would expect with the change in President, they could initiate additional credits but those are -- we'll continue to monitor those.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks Todd.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Great quarter and great guidance. So, I'm curious, are the kind of rent increase ceilings like California and other cities might have put in place, what is implicit in your guidance in terms of those policies loosening up? Are you assuming that you can push rates further in the back half in California or is that just going to be upside -- potential upside to guidance?\nJoe Margolis: So, we don't assumes that we gets relief from those in the first half of 2021. The back half of 2021, I believe, we still are moderating some of those rates. So there is some upside to that. But there's also a downside if something turns in the wrong direction and additional restrictions are put into place.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. And just going back to the supply topic, you talked about the percent impact to your same-store pool. But I'm curious about the decimal impact, so not just 30% being impacted or 21% being impacted but the decimal impact is -- at the end of the day, when all is said and done, if it decimal impact, is that even better?\nJoe Margolis: I'm not sure I understood the question. So we've tried to be clear on this call and others that supply is the biggest factor that's impeding our performance in that, in markets like the Boroughs in Northern New Jersey and Texas markets, Florida markets etc. our ability to raise rents. We can fill the stores up. We can keep them in -- at very high occupancy rates. It's -- our ability to raise rent is impacted by the new supply. Ki Bin, I don't know if that answered your question and if not let me know and I'll try better.\nKi Bin Kim: Well, you said I think about 21% we're seeing are so called impacted by supply, but that could mean 10% more supply coming to those markets or it could be 2% more spike in those markets. So that's how I was trying to gauge if it's leaning one way or another.\nJoe Margolis: Yes there, it -- listen, this is a micro-market business and that's an astute comment, it varies widely. We've had situations where we've had properties come in very close to an existing property, brand new development and because of traffic patterns or barriers like bridges or rivers or whatever specific reason, we've had absolutely no impact on our property. We also see that it's better for a store to -- new store to come into a market where it's 10 square feet per person than two square feet per person, because the percentage increase on a market that's full and has 10 square feet per person, you'd only have to capture a marginal part of everyone's demand to fill your store up, where if it's only two square foot per person and you're increasing supply by 50%, that's a more difficult -- at least in the short term, a more difficult problem. So it is absolutely a -- we get these numbers 21%, 30% whatever, it is a market-by-market, store-by-store analysis and that's how we do it for our guidance. We create individual budgets based on what we know could happen in the markets for each store. We do our best to project performance and we roll that all up and that becomes our guidance.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Hi, thanks. Just listening to your posture calling for some moderation in occupancy. Certainly, these are historic highs and it's probably prudent to do so. But what drives that move lower? Are you assuming some housing transaction slowing? Is it frozen consumer behavior that begins to thaw and people naturally start to move out after a 13 or 14 months. Maybe where do you kind of point to?\nScott Stubbs: So Todd, I would tell you -- go ahead, Joe.\nJoe Margolis: Sorry Scott. So, our elevated occupancy, one of the very important factors is moderation in vacates. And at some point, COIVD is going to be in the rear view mirror and we believe customer behavior will return to normal. Now, I don't think that means there is going to be an end of COVID day and someone is going to flip the switch and everyone runs to move out of their storages, right. We know that our customers are -- have a great deal of inertia and it's not high in their list and it may take them some time. We know that the largest increase in reason for storage we've seen over COVID is de cluttering of the house. And I don't think just because COVID is over, people are going to want to reclutter their house, right, that this may be a more permanent change. But with all that being said, we do believe vacates will eventually get back to more normal levels, and that will cause a reduction in occupancy.\nTodd Stender: Understood. Thanks, Joe. One more, just in the terms of maybe just sticking with bridge loans, you did sell some of your bridge loans, looks like you have a little bit more sold already this year. So it gives you a seat at the table when you want to go acquire a property, but now you've sold some, does that now limit your ability to acquire on that deal and -- that's one. And then two, how liquid is that market if you guys are trying to lighten up on loans or maybe it's a risk mitigation effort, maybe just some context there?\nJoe Margolis: So there, once we have sold an A-piece and we have sold $76 million of additional A-pieces in 2021. It does complicate the purchase, because we can wave our portion of the prepayment penalty. But the A-piece solid is not going to do that because they not getting any benefit from our purchase. So that is a challenge. Obviously as you get closer to maturity and those burn off, it's less of the challenge. We -- the second part of the question, when we started this program, we had a co-lending partner that we would co-originate the loans and at closing, close them with -- where we only help the B-piece. And we found that better execution over time was for us to close in all both pieces, package up the As into more meaningful chunks and then sell them. So that means we hold the As on our balance sheet for some period of time and you saw in the fourth quarter, how having those sold elevated our debt somewhat. But it gives us better execution particularly because now we have two buyers of the A-note. So there is some competition and redundancy for that and that seems to be working really well for us.\nTodd Stender: Great, thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.\nMike Mueller: Yes, hi. Scott, want to go back to, when you were talking about occupancy being strong up to 300 basis points through the summer and then you made a comment about a headwind down to a 100 basis points. Were you implying that by year-end, the occupancy comp was going to be a negative 100 basis points or your 300 basis points positive was going to shrink to 100 basis points positive?\nScott Stubbs: So in the back half of 2020, it was 200 basis point to 300 basis point benefit, and we are assuming that in the back half of 2021, it is a 100 basis point to 200 basis point headwind. So it's a negative comp year-over-year in the back half of 2021.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then, when you were talking about the portion or the markets where you still run into rental increase restrictions, how significant is that as a percentage of the whole portfolio.\nJoe Margolis: Sort of thinking how to measure that. Some of the rental rate restrictions are at a level that it's not that meaningful, right. In Alabama, you can't increase your rates more than 25% or Kansas to 25%. Now those are biggest states. But that gives you the idea. And other like California where it's 10% and it's a meaningful state for us, that is much more of a restriction. So we think the opportunity cost if you will, in 2021 because we were not able to raise the rates, is meaningful. It's likely over $10 million, but it's all included in our guidance.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay, that was it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, congrats in the quarter. Just two quick ones from me. One is just on the same-store expense guidance, you could just -- if you haven't already talked about, how should we think about sort of the property taxes and the payroll, which is sort of the largest items in terms of their contribution? Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So I can give you our assumptions in our guidance. The over -- about 55% of the increase actually relates to payroll -- to property tax increases and we are assuming that they're about 5.5% higher than they were in 2020. Our payroll increase is about 2%, increased year-over-year and that makes up another 10%. And then, we are assuming R&M is going up. We've had a couple of years with the down and we've had some benefit from lower comps with snow removal. So we think that's going to be a tough comp. We've seen some of that in the Northeast already to-date. So that's some of the larger assumptions in the 2021 guidance.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. My second question was just on the four assets that were sold. Just any color around there, maybe cap rates or why was it sold? Was it just a great offer? Just curious what the situations where there. Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: I would tell you, we thought the pricing was very good otherwise we wouldn't have sold. We retain management of the stores. We retain certain right of first refusals to buy them if they ever want to sell. I would tell you it was a tax motivated buyer and we were able to drive what I thought was very attractive terms because they have that motivation.\nRonald Kamdem: Helpful. Many thanks?\nJoe Margolis: I'm sorry?\nRonald Kamdem: So I said, thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lehman with Evercore ISI.\nMichael Lehman: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on supply, how much of your outlook includes the possibility of conversions from retail to storage with the amount of -- of kind of reliance on e-commerce that's been happening?\nJoe Margolis: So, when we know about it, it's absolutely included in our projections. Our folks in the field are charged with knowing what's going on in their micro-market and what can be converted. That being said, I think that is -- and we've done a bunch of that. We have a number of stores that are old retail centres. There is challenges to that. I don't think that's going to be a giant source of new self-storage. Some of the dark retail is dark retail for a reason and you don't -- we wouldn't want to put a storage site there. Some is dark retail but not zoned probably for a storage. And there is a lot of other physical issues with doing that. So there certainly will be some of that, but I don't see a wave -- a giant wave of new supply from retail conversions.\nMichael Lehman: Got it. Okay, that's it for me.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Oh, didn't realize I'll be back so quick. Just wanted to talk big picture about your bridge loan program, not just like what's in 2021 -- plain '21 guidance, but just longer term. Should we view this program as going to be in place for the indefinite future or is this more, there is a market opportunity that you're taking advantage of. So maybe in three years it really winds down. I'm just trying to understand the scope of the program long-term.\nJoe Margolis: So, we don't have a perfect crystal ball. Our belief is that there will be a demand for what we're doing now into the future. I also believe that it's incumbent on us to always understand where the capital voids are in the market and how we can make good risk-adjusted returns based on those capital voids. So if our current program gets smaller in the future because that capital need is not as great, I hope that our team and I expect that our team to find the next opportunity. One thing I think Extra Space has done well over the years is being innovative with the external growth and that means not executing the same strategy regardless of where you are in the market cycle. It's trying to understand that market cycle and see where you can make outsized returns at acceptable levels of risk. Right now that's bridge loans and I hope it continues forever, but if it doesn't, we'll find something else.\nKi Bin Kim: Right. And I would say I'm assuming there is a pretty wide funnel and what you end up closing is pretty select -- selective. But just curious, can you just describe like the deals that you've actually turned down and how big that funnel is at the top?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So the -- I think the two biggest limitations on the funnel at top is, we won't make construction loans. We could -- we could make lots and lots of loans if we're willing to make construction loans. But the great thing about the bridge loan program is if it goes bad and we have to take the property over that's 75% or 80% of underwritten value. We already operate it. We're happy to own it. That's not a bad result as opposed to taking over a half built defaulted construction project, we have no interest in that. So that's one limitation on the top of the funnel. The second is we have to manage the store and that some people are self-manage and want to continue that and they don't want us to manage the store, and then we won't do it. After that, we get to property quality, location, underwriting, we can get to the proceeds that the borrower wants, but there is -- we have a substantial pipeline and we feel confident we can hit our guidance for this year.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thanks again.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thanks Ki Bin.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thanks everyone for your interest in Extra Space and your support over the years. We're really looking forward to a strong 2021 strong double-digit core FFO growth. And appreciate your interest. I hope everyone in your families are well. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference calls. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Can you hear me now? Sorry everyone. Thanks Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. I hope everyone and their families remain healthy and that your 2021 is off to a good start. In my 35 years in real estate, I can't remember another year with as many positive and negative twist and turns in such a short period of time as we saw in 2020. The range of emotions I felt from March, when I was worried about the daily safety of our employees and customers; to April, when I wondered when rental demand in our sector would return; to September, when we saw some of the strongest occupancy and rental rate fundamentals in our Company's history are hard to describe. I am proud of our team's resilience in how well they responded to 2020's unprecedented challenges. Our team's efforts together with our balanced portfolio, sophisticated platform and innovative external growth efforts yielded a great result in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with same-store occupancy of 94.8%, an all-time year-end high for Extra Space. Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which we have experienced since August and a return to positive same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2.3%, a 380 basis point acceleration from the third quarter. We also had excellent expense control with a 0.6% decrease in same-store expenses, resulting in 3.4% NOI growth in the quarter. Our return to positive NOI gains coupled with strong external investment activity yielded core FFO growth of 16.5% in the quarter. Despite the challenges of the year, the fourth quarter was full of accomplishments, including completion of two preferred equity investments totaling $350 million, $147 million in acquisitions, $168 million in bridge loan closings, the addition of 44 stores to our management platform, and receipt of NAREIT's Leader in the Light award, recognizing Extra Space for its sustainability efforts. This is the first time a storage company has received this award. While we are excited about the accomplishments of 2020, we are even more optimistic about how our efforts have positioned us for 2021. Rentals continue to be steady and vacates continue to be muted. We are heading into 2021 with the highest occupancy we have ever experienced at this time of year and expect rental rates to remain strong. We have already added 51 third-party management stores in 2021 and our acquisition, management and bridge loan pipelines are robust. But we are also mindful of the risks we face. We recognize that current or potential government regulations could impede same-store revenue and expense performance. We believe that vacates may eventually return to more normal levels and we recognize that the challenges related to new supply have not subsided completely and will continue to suppress rate growth in many markets. As in the past, our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance in the face of any risks which materialize. In short, despite significant turbulence, we had a very successful 2020 and look forward to an even better 2021. We continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholders' long-term value and to deliver the results our shareholders have come to expect from Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. So, this is Joe. The -- and thank you for your kind words about our performance. It's not Scott and me, it's over 4,000 employees who every day bring their best work and have really done an outstanding job. With respect to third-party management, our activity in January and February with 51 stores added is a little elevated because we took 37 stores on in connection with the JCAP transaction. So I would expect our 2021 activity to be similar to our 2020 activity in terms of gains. Thank you. So we're still subject to restrictions on existing customer rate increase in many markets across the country and that -- we abide by all those regulations and that of course is the limit to us. Absent that, our ECRI increases average high-single-digits, 10%, about the same as always. And interestingly, we continue to move out rates in response to ECRI and we have seen no increase in move-out rates. So, hopefully, at some point those regulations -- restrictions are lifted and we can get back to fully normal behavior. But we are limited now. We understood that and took that into account in our guidance, and hopefully, we can get back to normal sooner rather than later. I'm sorry, more opportunities with what type of assets? I couldn't understand you. Yes, thank you very much. So -- and sorry about that. So, what we bought is more lease-up assets. Stabilized -- pricing on stabilized assets is very hard for us to make sense of. We will probably be more active on that front in 2021 with joint venture partners, just to make the pricing makes sense to us. But everything we bought in 2020 was lease-up. If you kind of average, we were in the mid-3s first year and stabilized on average in 17 months in the mid-6s. So I think that's the best use of our acquisition dollars today. Sure. Sure. Thanks. Good question. So supply is still an issue, that's the short answer. We did see substantial pull back in 2020 due to COVID. We -- I'm going to speak to our same-store pool, not national statistics, I'll speak to what matters to us. We had projected in 2020 that about 30% of our same-store pool would be impacted by new supply and when you look at the actual numbers, it was only around 21%. So almost a third got pushed or canceled because of COVID. In 2022, we project 22% of our same-store pool will be impacted by new stores and I think there will be, like there is every year, some number of those stores get delayed or maybe even canceled. So we are seeing an incremental decrease in new supply and that's good news. But I would caution you on two fronts; one is, we still have significant supply delivered in many markets over the last several years and we're working through that and that affects our ability to push rate. And secondly, with the performance of storage, particularly in comparison to other asset classes, I would not be surprised if that attracts more capital, more developers to the market. So new supply isn't going away. It's not in many -- every market, but in the markets where it is, it's something we need to deal with. So, we have about $196 million in the pipeline. So we believe $400 million is an achievable goal and the bridge loan program is very accretive for us because the whole note reach maybe in the 5% to 6% but by the time we sell the A and keep the B, the rate we're getting is 9%, 10%, 11% plus we're getting management of the stores and the economics there. We also hope to buy a bunch of these and I think we bought one and have two that we're targeting to buy. And it's an immature program. But as we get deeper into it, I hope it turns into an acquisition pipeline as well. Sure. Thanks Smedes. So, we haven't seen differential in performance between the markets that have been called out as people are fleeing San Francisco or people are fleeing New York and the markets that people are supposedly fleeing to. And I don't know if that's because people are storing their stuff in Manhattan before they go out to Borough, New Jersey and at some point, that will unwind. But as of now, we don't see performance differential based on that reported phenomenon. What we do see is performance difference based on new supply, to go back to the previous question. That's where we have the weakest power. I'll also tell you, there's been a number of articles coming out recently that question whether the urban flight is as widespread as been reported in COVID. I just read an article that most of the people leaving San Francisco are settling in the counties around San Francisco, they're not going to Utah or Florida or Texas. And then lastly, and this is just one man's opinion, I don't believe COVID is the death of New York City. I believe young people like to live in cities. Cities have a lot of advantages. And I don't believe that this is the death of the big cities. So to answer your question, we're much more focused on micro markets as we look to buy things, and we're not -- we have not yet adjusted our investment strategy based on urban flight. Yes, great question. So, we had 38 stores leave our platform in the fourth quarter and 87 leave our platform in 2020, almost all of them were because of sales. Very, very few were a change in managers. We bought 15 of those 87 stores, not a huge percentage and the issue is pricing. We try to remain disciplined and not overpay, in our view, for things. There is also some subset of these stores that are not of a quality we want to own. We have to manage but not own. So given where prices is, I would expect that we continue to have sales. I hope we can do a better job through structures that we buy more of them, but our number one goal is not to do something that's dilutive to our shareholder's value. So if pricing gets beyond what we think is reasonable, we're going to do our best to transition the store to the new buyer. Sure. Thanks, Smedes. So we are continuing to take advantage of some solar opportunities where you -- where you continue to use that from an ESG perspective and a sustainability perspective as well as some tax benefits. That's the big one that we have today. So, we don't assumes that we gets relief from those in the first half of 2021. The back half of 2021, I believe, we still are moderating some of those rates. So there is some upside to that. But there's also a downside if something turns in the wrong direction and additional restrictions are put into place. I'm not sure I understood the question. So we've tried to be clear on this call and others that supply is the biggest factor that's impeding our performance in that, in markets like the Boroughs in Northern New Jersey and Texas markets, Florida markets etc. our ability to raise rents. We can fill the stores up. We can keep them in -- at very high occupancy rates. It's -- our ability to raise rent is impacted by the new supply. Ki Bin, I don't know if that answered your question and if not let me know and I'll try better. Yes there, it -- listen, this is a micro-market business and that's an astute comment, it varies widely. We've had situations where we've had properties come in very close to an existing property, brand new development and because of traffic patterns or barriers like bridges or rivers or whatever specific reason, we've had absolutely no impact on our property. We also see that it's better for a store to -- new store to come into a market where it's 10 square feet per person than two square feet per person, because the percentage increase on a market that's full and has 10 square feet per person, you'd only have to capture a marginal part of everyone's demand to fill your store up, where if it's only two square foot per person and you're increasing supply by 50%, that's a more difficult -- at least in the short term, a more difficult problem. So it is absolutely a -- we get these numbers 21%, 30% whatever, it is a market-by-market, store-by-store analysis and that's how we do it for our guidance. We create individual budgets based on what we know could happen in the markets for each store. We do our best to project performance and we roll that all up and that becomes our guidance. Sure. Sorry Scott. So, our elevated occupancy, one of the very important factors is moderation in vacates. And at some point, COIVD is going to be in the rear view mirror and we believe customer behavior will return to normal. Now, I don't think that means there is going to be an end of COVID day and someone is going to flip the switch and everyone runs to move out of their storages, right. We know that our customers are -- have a great deal of inertia and it's not high in their list and it may take them some time. We know that the largest increase in reason for storage we've seen over COVID is de cluttering of the house. And I don't think just because COVID is over, people are going to want to reclutter their house, right, that this may be a more permanent change. But with all that being said, we do believe vacates will eventually get back to more normal levels, and that will cause a reduction in occupancy. So there, once we have sold an A-piece and we have sold $76 million of additional A-pieces in 2021. It does complicate the purchase, because we can wave our portion of the prepayment penalty. But the A-piece solid is not going to do that because they not getting any benefit from our purchase. So that is a challenge. Obviously as you get closer to maturity and those burn off, it's less of the challenge. We -- the second part of the question, when we started this program, we had a co-lending partner that we would co-originate the loans and at closing, close them with -- where we only help the B-piece. And we found that better execution over time was for us to close in all both pieces, package up the As into more meaningful chunks and then sell them. So that means we hold the As on our balance sheet for some period of time and you saw in the fourth quarter, how having those sold elevated our debt somewhat. But it gives us better execution particularly because now we have two buyers of the A-note. So there is some competition and redundancy for that and that seems to be working really well for us. Sure. Sort of thinking how to measure that. Some of the rental rate restrictions are at a level that it's not that meaningful, right. In Alabama, you can't increase your rates more than 25% or Kansas to 25%. Now those are biggest states. But that gives you the idea. And other like California where it's 10% and it's a meaningful state for us, that is much more of a restriction. So we think the opportunity cost if you will, in 2021 because we were not able to raise the rates, is meaningful. It's likely over $10 million, but it's all included in our guidance. I would tell you, we thought the pricing was very good otherwise we wouldn't have sold. We retain management of the stores. We retain certain right of first refusals to buy them if they ever want to sell. I would tell you it was a tax motivated buyer and we were able to drive what I thought was very attractive terms because they have that motivation. I'm sorry? Okay, thank you very much. So, when we know about it, it's absolutely included in our projections. Our folks in the field are charged with knowing what's going on in their micro-market and what can be converted. That being said, I think that is -- and we've done a bunch of that. We have a number of stores that are old retail centres. There is challenges to that. I don't think that's going to be a giant source of new self-storage. Some of the dark retail is dark retail for a reason and you don't -- we wouldn't want to put a storage site there. Some is dark retail but not zoned probably for a storage. And there is a lot of other physical issues with doing that. So there certainly will be some of that, but I don't see a wave -- a giant wave of new supply from retail conversions. Thank you. So, we don't have a perfect crystal ball. Our belief is that there will be a demand for what we're doing now into the future. I also believe that it's incumbent on us to always understand where the capital voids are in the market and how we can make good risk-adjusted returns based on those capital voids. So if our current program gets smaller in the future because that capital need is not as great, I hope that our team and I expect that our team to find the next opportunity. One thing I think Extra Space has done well over the years is being innovative with the external growth and that means not executing the same strategy regardless of where you are in the market cycle. It's trying to understand that market cycle and see where you can make outsized returns at acceptable levels of risk. Right now that's bridge loans and I hope it continues forever, but if it doesn't, we'll find something else. Sure. So the -- I think the two biggest limitations on the funnel at top is, we won't make construction loans. We could -- we could make lots and lots of loans if we're willing to make construction loans. But the great thing about the bridge loan program is if it goes bad and we have to take the property over that's 75% or 80% of underwritten value. We already operate it. We're happy to own it.

Sure. Thanks Ki Bin. Great. Thanks everyone for your interest in Extra Space and your support over the years. We're really looking forward to a strong 2021 strong double-digit core FFO growth. And appreciate your interest. I hope everyone in your families are well. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a great fourth quarter with reaccelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers. Late fees and other income continue to be lower year-over-year and partially offset rental income, but we saw improvement in both line items from levels experienced in the third quarter. We lowered expenses in all controllable expense categories in the quarter and despite property tax increases of 6.4%, we still delivered a reduction in same-store expenses overall. This resulted in same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.48, a year-over-year increase of 16.5% and well above consensus estimates. Our same-store performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth in tenant reinsurance income, management fees, and interest and investment income. We continue to evolve our balance sheet to reduce secured debt and increase the size of our unencumbered pool. Our efforts resulted in Moody's issuing Extra Space a BAA2 credit rating on January 28th, our second investment grade credit rating now providing us access to the public bond market. We are excited to add another capital option to finance future growth, reduced total cost of debt, and further ladder our maturities. At year-end, we had higher than normal revolver balances and variable rate debt due to the elevated capital activity that took place in the fourth quarter, including settling our convertible notes, completing preferred equity investments, and closing substantial bridge loan and acquisition volume. A significant portion of these transactions were temporarily funded by draws on our revolving lines. We are comfortable doing so -- we were comfortable doing so knowing we were actively issuing on our ATM, had pending bridge loan sales and are recapitalizing stores into a JV, which bring our revolver balances down to historical levels. Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2021 with ranges that are wider than previous -- than in previous years to address some of the uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on customer behavior and government regulation. Our new same-store pool includes a total of 860 stores, which is essentially flat with last year. The number of new stores added to the pool was generally offset by sites removed due to disposition or redevelopment. We anticipate the changes in the same-store pool will benefit our 2021 same-store revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 4.25% to 5.5%, driven by higher occupancy in the first half of the year and elevated rates in new and existing -- to new and existing customers. Same-store expense growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, primarily driven by higher property tax expense. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth range of 4.25% to 6.25%. The acquisition market continues to be expensive and we will remain disciplined but opportunistic. We expect to do significant acquisition volume and plan to close a number of transactions with joint venture partners. Our guidance assumes $350 million in Extra Space investment, approximately $180 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to close approximately $400 million of bridge loans and plan to retain 20% to 25% of those balances or approximately $100 million in 2021. We have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for shareholders and we will be creative as we deploy capital in the sector. Our full year core FFO is estimated to be between $5.85 and $6.05 per share. We anticipate $0.16 of dilution from value-add acquisitions or C of O stores, down $0.04 from 2020. We also added additional guidance related to our expected interest income for 2021 as well as notes clarifying the recognition of our preferred investments in SmartStop and NexPoint, which can be found in the outlook tables of our earnings release. As Joe mentioned, 2020 has been a memorable year for Extra Space. We are excited to turn the page and are already on our way to a very strong 2021. And with that, let's turn it over to Cindy to start our Q&A. Yes. Alua this is Scott. I can give you a little bit more detail in terms of what our guidance assumes. We are assuming that our occupancy stays strong. So, in January and into February, our gap has actually expanded to be just over 300 basis points. So what's happened is January and February typically have lower occupancy, declining occupancy. We haven't seen that. So we moved from 240 basis point delta in occupancy to over 300 basis points where we are today. So we are assuming that occupancy holds at this high level through the end of the summer, at which point we expect occupancy to fall more to historical levels. So last year in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter we saw occupancy 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher than normal. This year, we expect that to be a 100 basis points to 200 basis points headwind for us. So we expect it to be lower and to fall back more to historical levels. We expect the first quarter to be strong in terms of revenue growth continuing to accelerate from the fourth quarter. The second quarter should be the peak and that is mainly due to some easy comps from last year and then continued good into the third quarter with the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter being challenging. Thanks, Alua. Yes. So, our achieved rates in the fourth quarter and really for the back half of the year, we're about 10% year -- ahead of where they were the prior year. And in the first quarter of this year, January and February, we're seeing rates be at very similar levels, about 10% ahead of where they were last year. So, we are assuming that the first quarter we continue these rate that we've been -- we've been experiencing. Second quarter, our achieved rates, we would expect to be very strong, because if you remember, in the second quarter when things really dropped, we dropped rates 20% to 30%. And so when you're looking at a rate that was 20% to 30% lower and then it's already 10% above, you're going to see some significant rate growth for customers that move in at April, May even into early June and those are all factored into our guidance. So if you -- I'll just give you one point of reference and that's our achieved -- I mean our achieved rate compared to our in-place rents and this isn't necessarily the move-out rate versus the move-in rate. Our in-place rents are actually above our achieved rates today. Now remember, this is the time of year when this is usually the most negative, meaning your achieved rates in January and February it's the highest -- your existing customer rates are compared to your achieved rates on an annual basis. So the fact that our rates are up 10% year-over-year in February is good. So our in-place rents are about high single-digits above where the achieved rates are today. So, I think it will depend a little bit on where rates -- tax rates go, and then also what happens with solar credits. I think that you've seen them burning off. I would expect with the change in President, they could initiate additional credits but those are -- we'll continue to monitor those. Thanks Todd. So Todd, I would tell you -- go ahead, Joe. So in the back half of 2020, it was 200 basis point to 300 basis point benefit, and we are assuming that in the back half of 2021, it is a 100 basis point to 200 basis point headwind. So it's a negative comp year-over-year in the back half of 2021. Yes. So I can give you our assumptions in our guidance. The over -- about 55% of the increase actually relates to payroll -- to property tax increases and we are assuming that they're about 5.5% higher than they were in 2020. Our payroll increase is about 2%, increased year-over-year and that makes up another 10%. And then, we are assuming R&M is going up. We've had a couple of years with the down and we've had some benefit from lower comps with snow removal. So we think that's going to be a tough comp. We've seen some of that in the Northeast already to-date. So that's some of the larger assumptions in the 2021 guidance."

I trust everyone in their families remain healthy and are managing through this difficult time. 2020 has been a challenging and eventful year. And unprecedented conditions related to the pandemic have made it difficult to forecast performance. On our last call, we discussed the tailwinds we are experiencing in terms of rental activity, muted vacates, positive achieved rate trends and the resumption of normal operations. We also discussed the potential headwinds if we believed we could face, including economic and political risk, as well as changing customer behavior and new supply. During the third quarter, and to-date, the tailwinds improved stronger than we expected while the headwinds have not been as significant or have not materialized. Rental volume remains healthy, our vacate volume remains muted, resulting in an all-time high occupancy of approximately 96%. Through July, occupancy was inflated with non-paying customers due to the inability to auction delinquent units. However, as the quarter continued and auctions resume, we have been able to maintain our high occupancy and collections have returned to historically normal levels. Our elevated occupancy resulted in return of pricing power during the third quarter. In short, our stores are performing significantly better than we expected earlier in the pandemic. On the last call, we stated that we expected to have negative same-store revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters. Due to the continuation of the tailwinds we are experiencing, we have achieved positive revenue growth in October and are confident we will produce positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We remain mindful of the potential macro and industry-specific uncertainties that we have referenced during the third quarter. However, at present the risks do not appear to be negatively impacting the demand for storage or consumers\u2019 ability and willingness to pay for our product. The primary headwind impacting performance is new supply in certain markets. While the pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects and planning, properties are still being delivered and excess inventory is still leasing up, which will continue to suppress rate growth in high supply markets. Despite the improving trends, our same-store NOI remain negative in the third quarter. However, even with the disruption COVID-19 caused to our operations, we continue to grow core FFO per share, which is our ultimate goal. In the third quarter, FFO per share increased 5.6% and FFO growth for the first three quarters was 5%, both sizable beats over consensus. Our flexible organizational structure and focused on innovative capital-light strategies have enhanced FFO through new external growth channels and non-same-store income streams. These contributions paired with improving same-store trends lead us to believe that our 2020 FFO will comfortably exceed the high end of our pre-COVID expectations. Turning to external growth, acquisition volume has picked up in the sector as markets have started to settle, but pricing for widely brokered deals, particularly for stabilized properties remains very competitive. During the quarter, we have closed to put under contract an additional $140 million of acquisitions, bringing our total expected investment in 2020 to $287 million. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to find ways to creatively invest capital in the storage sector. Our bridge loan program continues to grow with approximately $315 million in bridge loans scheduled to close in 2020, with the expectation to sell 70% to 80% of the balances. We\u2019ve also approved $167 million of loans to close in 2021. We also purchased $103 million senior mezzanine note at a small discount. And subsequent to quarter-end, we invested in additional $50 million in SmartStop through our previously negotiated preferred equity investment. And through three quarters, we have added 72 stores net to our third-party management platform. In short, we continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholder\u2019s long-term value, to optimizing property level operations and efficiently and creatively investing capital in the storage sector at acceptable risk levels. I\u2019ll now turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we\u2019ve seen a number of positive trends during the quarter that are continuing into the fourth quarter. During September and October, we typically see occupancy and achieved rates start to moderate due to seasonality. This year, this has not been the case. Rentals remain steady, while vacates are still down and October occupancy remained relatively similar to this summer\u2019s highs at just under 96%, a positive year-over-year delta of approximately 260 basis points with less than 20 basis points of inflated occupancy related to non-paying tenants. New customer rates also remained strong. Achieved rates to new customer were flat year-over-year in July and improved to approximately 11% in August, September and October. We have completed the rollout of our online leasing platform, Rapid Rental, and have seen approximately 20% of rentals come through this channel. We have also reinstated existing customer rent increases in most markets with a focus on bringing customers with below market rates closer to current levels. To-date, such increases have not caused outsized vacate activity. Despite these strong trends, same-store revenue remained negative in the quarter, primarily driven by lower other income due to fewer assessed late fees and auction fees. We\u2019ve tried to work with our customers and have been lenient where appropriate given challenges related to the pandemic. We have been proactively controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, while ensuring we aren\u2019t hurting the long-term value of our properties or our business. Expense growth from property taxes was generally offset by savings in utilities and repairs and maintenance, and we managed to keep payroll generally flat without furloughs, layoffs or pay cuts. We continue to view marketing spend as an investment in top line revenue growth, and we\u2019ll continue to use this lever to drive revenue when the return wants it. We\u2019ve been tracking the results of California\u2019s Proposition 15 vote carefully, and it appears that it \u2013 that it will not pass and have an impact on property tax expense. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and have access to many types of capital at attractive pricing. We received $425 million from our previously completed private placement transaction, and subsequent to quarter-end, we used these funds, revolver capacity and shares to settle our $500 million convertible notes. All in all, 2020 has been an eventful year and we have certainly seen the landscape shift rapidly over the last two quarters. While we can\u2019t predict all of the future \u2013 we can\u2019t predict all of the future challenges we may face, we believe our flexible organizational structure are focused on innovation, and ultimately our people position us to react quickly to change and to capitalize on various opportunities to follow. We operate in a fantastic sector and our diversified portfolio, advanced platform and talented team will continue to maximize shareholder value, regardless of the economic climate. With that, let\u2019s turn it back over to Jenny to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nJeff Norman: Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.\nOperator: Yes. Your first question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Yes. I hopped on a little bit late, but I think, Joe, you said 2020 will exceed pre-COVID expectations. Is that correct?\nJoe Margolis: For FFO, yes, that\u2019s correct, Jeff.\nJeff Spector: Okay. That\u2019s a powerful statement. And so I just want to \u2013 we thought the results were very strong, stock under performing today a bit, I\u2019m just trying to think about market concerns, again, maybe your comfort visibility on the business. I know that\u2019s tough, but how are you thinking about 2021 guidance? I guess you typically provide next quarter. Like what gives you comfort to make the \u2013 to provide that guidance at that time versus not? Is it vaccine? Is it just watching cases and potential risk of shutdowns?\nJoe Margolis: So Jeff, I\u2019m not sure I understood your question. What gives us comfort to provide 2021 guidance or not? Is that the question?\nJeff Spector: Just trying to think ahead to correct to the next quarter and given business was more resilient than expected. A lot of the issues that you and your peers were concerned over starting back in March didn\u2019t transpire. Again, FFO better than pre-COVID expectations, like, are you planning to provide 2021 guidance? And if not, what would \u2013 help determine that?\nJoe Margolis: So our current plan is to provide 2021 guidance. If the political or medical situation gets to the level of uncertainty that we don\u2019t feel we could provide a range comfortably, then we\u2019ll have to rethink that position.\nJeff Spector: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then on a couple of the drivers that were discussed on the previous call. And I know we\u2019ve talked to you about the work-from-home benefits, EXR sector has been seeing or movement in the economy. I mean, from your standpoint, what\u2019s the most important thing to watch from here? Is it the housing market? The work-from-home or work from anywhere, it seems to continue at least for now. I know, there\u2019s always different levers at different times different cycles, but what\u2019s most important as we head into 202?\nJoe Margolis: So we\u2019ll watch our customer\u2019s behavior. We don\u2019t have perfect visibility as to how some of the things you\u2019re talking about, work-from-home, housing market, the direct correlation or translation to customer behavior. So we track literally every day customer behavior across a whole lot of metrics and optimize operations based on what we see.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rose Smedes with Citi.\nRose Smedes: Hi there. I guess, I\u2019m going to ask you about move out activities. And if you\u2019ve seen that relatively low relative to where you normally would have, which seems to be kind of like an industry issue. And I\u2019m just trying to think about it as that returns to maybe more normal levels in a post pandemic world. How do you think about more normalized occupancies? And how might you encourage customers to stay? Would you try to entice them with rents or you to occupancy levels where you could stand to maybe have that decline a little bit?\nJoe Margolis: So occupancy \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, vacate levels are still muted. They\u2019re still below historical norms. They\u2019re not as needed as they were earlier in the pandemic. But one of the factors, a strong factor in our very high occupancy is that vacates are muted. And I agree with you, risk of the future is that customer behavior returns to normal, vacates return to normal, and that puts pressure on occupancy. However, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to encourage people to stay in storage. Storage is a need based product. And at some point people won\u2019t need the storage anymore. And at that point, they\u2019ll leave. They may not leave immediately because of inertia, but sooner or later, they\u2019re going to realize I don\u2019t need this anymore. And even if we cut their rent to $1, they don\u2019t need it and they\u2019re going to go and move on and do whatever they need. So we can\u2019t encourage people to stay. What we can do is make sure that we can replace those tenants in the most efficient manner at the lowest cost at the best rate that we can.\nRose Smedes: Okay. Fair enough. And then, maybe you could just touch on the debt maturities that you have coming up through the balance of this year, I think, and into next year and kind of how you\u2019re thinking about handling those?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Smedes this is Scott, the major maturities that we had coming due at the end of this year were really two items. One was a $70 million loan that came due in September that we actually extended for a year. So that\u2019ll come due in the year. And the second piece is a $575 million convert. And that was actually paid off in two troches part of the $71 million getting paid off the 1 of October and the other $504 million getting paid off the second day of November. So we have paid \u2013 we\u2019ve either extended or paid those off and we paid that off with the proceeds from our private placement, which was a $425 million private placement, and then proceeds from our lines of credit.\nRose Smedes: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Smedes.\nOperator: The next question is from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.\nRick Skidmore: Good morning, Joe and Scott. Joe, could you just talk a little bit more about the bridge loan program, and how you assess the credit risk and then how you think about the pacing of that capital and the rates on those loans? Thanks. \nJoe Margolis: Sure. Happy to. So we started this program in 2019. We lend only on existing product or not development loans. The product has to be completed and operating. We manage each of these loans. So in addition to the economics of the loan, we get the economics of the management, contract. We look somewhat at the borrower\u2019s financial capacity, particularly, because they have obligations \u2013 personal obligations to replenish operating an interest reserves. But our primary collateral is the real estate. We underwrite this real estate as if we\u2019re going to buy it to the same team that underwrites our acquisitions. And we are \u2013 we make loans where we\u2019re comfortable. If we have to own the property at our loan balance, that we\u2019ll be happy that we did that. The second question with regard to pacing, this program has grown frankly faster this year than we thought. And we did a $100 million in our first year. We will fund or approve for funding, probably close to over $500 million this year. And I think the acceleration is because what people are just looking for a way to get to a better tomorrow. We\u2019re in this weird position. They just want to get some financing that will let them get their store to a more stabilized number, and then they can put permanent financing or sell or do whatever. It\u2019s important to remember that we sell 70% to 80% of the balances of the loan. So they\u2019re structured is first to mezz or A&B. We\u2019ll sell the first position and retain the second position that both leverages our return and allows us to control the amount of capital that\u2019s allocated to this program. Sorry for the long answer.\nRick Skidmore: And as you looked at 2021 expectations, thinking about the bridge loan program, continuing at those at the similar 2020 level? Or do you think it increases or comes down a bit? \nJoe Margolis: So I would expect the program to grow. Our goal is to grow these programs. As we develop more relationships, have more programmatic borrowers. It\u2019s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill. So it\u2019s my hope and expectation that we do more in 2021 than we did in 2020.\nRick Skidmore: Great. Thanks, Joe.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital.\nTodd Thomas: Thanks. Just following up on the bridge loan program a little bit, I guess it, you said you have an expectation to sell 70% to 80% of the balance. But what\u2019s on the books today and what is the average yield on those loans and sort of the weighted average maturity?\nJoe Margolis: So what\u2019s on the books today isn\u2019t representative of our final capital investment. When we first started this program, we would simultaneously close and sell the first tranche, so that never showed up on our books. We now think a better execution is to close them all on balance sheet, package it up in $30 million, $40 million, $50 million chunks, then take those to the market and sell it. So we currently have more on the balance sheet than we ultimately will because we\u2019re in the middle of selling a couple of those tranches. Yields on the whole loan or between 5% and 6%, there\u2019s a LIBOR for that puts the yields in that place. Once we sell it, the yields on our piece are between 9% and 11% and those numbers don\u2019t include management fees or having insurance that we get from managing the property.\nTodd Thomas: Got it.\nJoe Margolis: No, I just going to make the comparison of where we see cap rates and opportunity to make money, buying wholly-owned properties versus the yields we can get from this plus the management contract, plus we\u2019ve already bought three assets out of the loan program at somewhat of an acquisition pipeline. And it allows us just to create more partnerships, more relationships, which is so important to us in everything we do.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. So as you\u2019re sort of warehousing these loans and ultimately retaining 20% or 30% of the balance, how large or how much of an appetite do you have for this type of structure finance, investment portfolio overall. And do you plan on adding some additional disclosure to describe some of the details around this as it continues to grow?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So I think your second point is spot on. Now that this has gotten significant, we need to add some things to our SOPs and we will do that in 2021. Seeing that we sell the vast majority of the loan balances, I don\u2019t see a meaningful cap on what we can do. I don\u2019t know if we can grow this big enough where we won\u2019t have the capital to do it.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then, Joe, your \u2013 so your comments about supply still impacting fundamentals. I just wanted to circle back there. So, your occupancy for the portfolio overall is 95.9% and rates are trending higher. So, what impact is new supply having on the business today? It\u2019s hard to see those pressures right now, I guess, is demand just overwhelming that supply at this time, or is there something else; can you just expand on those comments a bit?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. those are macro stats. If you broke it down to the store level and look at stores that had new supply challenges or new supply competitors, they may still be leasing up quickly or have very high occupancy, but their rate growth, their rate power is very different than stores that don\u2019t have that new supply challenge. So, we\u2019re able to fill all our stores up. The impact of new supplies is on how much rate power we have.\nScott Stubbs: And Todd, you can see that sum in the supplementals, if you look at it by market. So for instance, if you look at Dallas or South Florida or New York City, you\u2019ll see that those are performing from a revenue growth perspective below the average versus markets that are performing above the average. And we would tell you that supply markets are typically performing below the average. \nTodd Thomas: Right. Okay. And I guess, given the improvement though in fundamentals that the industry has seen. Are you anticipating new supply growth to reaccelerate a bit? It sounded like it was expected to fall or moderate, what\u2019s the outlook like today? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So, I do expect moderation, equity \u2013 there\u2019s probably equity out there with developers, I think that is harder to get and there\u2019s some markets that it\u2019s just harder to underwrite to get the deal. So, new supply is not going to stop, but I would expect moderation. \nTodd Thomas: All right. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Commented that the transaction markets continued to open up. I was just wondering if you could provide some color around what portion of the deals you\u2019re seeing, are either assets that are in some phase of lease-up versus those that already stabilized? \nJoe Margolis: So, I actually don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever divided deals we\u2019re seeing, I don\u2019t know if I know the answer to what percentage of deals we\u2019re seeing on lease-up versus stabilized? I\u2019ll pay the deals we\u2019ve approved this year. We\u2019ve approved 22 stores for acquisition, and none of them were stabilized. They were all between \u2013 they averaged about 64% occupancy and that\u2019s stabilized periods of six to 36 months with stabilized cash flow in the mid-sixes. So, those are the type of deals that are attracted to \u2013 attractive to us now, stabilized stores, it\u2019s sub-five cap rates are not all that attractive to us.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you guys also mentioned that rental volumes have remained healthy. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the move-in trends and whether or not this growth is widespread throughout the whole portfolio, or if there are any markets that stood out in terms of elevated activity? \nScott Stubbs: Yes. I would tell you the rental volume and occupancies are consistent across the portfolio. So, it\u2019s not just urban versus suburban. If you look at our property occupancy in \u2013 we\u2019re full across the U.S., if you look at kind of rentals and vacates throughout the quarter, we actually had higher vacate volume this quarter due to auctions than we normally would, because we kind of moved six months worth of auctions into three months here. And so I would tell you our rental volume while it might be slightly below last year. last year was a really good year with July, we end very high. We\u2019re very close to historical norm. So, our rental volume has been strong, and we\u2019ve also been able to offset any vacancy that was created by the increase in auctions in the third quarter. So, we had those pent-up auctions as we paused during the stay-at-home timeframe.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Spenser.\nOperator: The next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, thanks. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the payroll line for a same-store pool was down slightly year-over-year, what\u2019s driving that \u2013 is that more of rental without having to talk to anybody just the automated process or is it just more cost controls by you guys and trying to manage that line item and any expectations going forward?\nJoe Margolis: So in the first and second quarters, I would tell you it was up slightly for a couple of reasons. One is we had a very tough comp from last year. We had very low payroll last year, as we had turnover that was maybe, a little higher and our time to fill was a little higher last year than it is this year. So this year, we\u2019ve had very little turnover. We also tried to be fair with our employees, as people got sick, because they had family members who got sick. So, our staffing was maybe a little higher in the second quarter. As we moved into the third quarter, we\u2019ve seen that normalized somewhat and in the second quarter, the other thing we saw is nobody was taking vacation. So, you\u2019re accruing the vacations there. Nobody was taking time off. And so we would expect it to be up slightly, but not to the degree it was in the first and second quarter.\nJuan Sanabria: Great, thanks. And then I was just hoping you could talk to the scenes, the auctions, et cetera, the late fees. What part does that stop being a drag? Does it have to do with how high occupied you are today? In other words, is the higher occupancy working against you on the fees in some respect, or is it just because the moveouts are down also obviously tied to your occupants. If you could just help us, when that will pass that pressure on the same-store revenue line?\nJoe Margolis: So, I would tell you late fees are down for a couple of reasons. One is you have a state of emergency orders that don\u2019t allow us to charge late fees in certain markets. So, in the Los Angeles area, we\u2019re not charging late fees or we\u2019re being lenient with late fees. The second one is early in the pandemic, and as we moved in and as people went to auction, we have been more lenient on late fees as we\u2019ve tried to be fair with our customers. as that auction volume has slowed, meaning we\u2019ve gotten through some of the pent-up options, we would expect that to normalize in areas, where we have had auctions and do not have state of emergencies.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you. \nJoe Margolis: Next one.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: So, when you look at the customer mix [indiscernible] occupancy lately, I mean, I guess it\u2019s kind of logical to assume it has to do with housing and people moving from different States. But is there something about that demand that you\u2019re getting that you think is more transitory in nature? Maybe, they don\u2019t stay as long versus what\u2019s more typical of your tenancy? \nJoe Margolis: No, we don\u2019t know, right. We don\u2019t know how this is going to play out and how long some of this demand generated by the virus is going to last. We do know that it\u2019s a good thing that more people are getting exposed to the product and using the product and now know that it\u2019s an option. But one of the uncertainties is it was all of colleges go back to normal and if people move back into the city and out of their parents\u2019 home. Do we lose some of this demand? It\u2019s a risk.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of acquisition activity in the self-storage sector, luckily for time. usually, you guys win more than your fair share. So, I\u2019m just curious, what this thing about just the excessive pricing or the quality of some of the deals out in the market, or is it that you just see more value in the bridge loan program and that\u2019s attracting your capital?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So, we don\u2019t judge success in the acquisition market by \u2013 who bought the most. I mean, if we could buy the most, we have the money; we can go out and bid more than anyone else. but at the end of the day, it\u2019s about the returns you produce for your investors. So, we are going to be active in the acquisition market when we can produce the good returns. we\u2019re going to be active in the bridge loan market. We\u2019re going to find creative ways, whether it\u2019s preferred deals or otherwise to do that and we\u2019re also going to increase our management and capital-light businesses. So, at the end of the day, we\u2019re not seeking to buy the most, we\u2019re seeking to make the most money. \nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Hong Thanh with JPMorgan.\nHong Thanh: I was wondering. So, you talked about expecting positive same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Is there any, I guess, baked-in assumptions about move-outs or rent growth that goes into that? \nJoe Margolis: So, I would tell you, obviously we\u2019ve made some assumptions. I think that we do have some vacancy assumptions in there, vacate assumptions. And if those, I think that if anything, if it keeps going like it is, we are very confident that that will be positive. I think that right now that we\u2019ve had positive rent growth in October, our occupancy is still 2.5% plus ahead of last year and rate increases have kicked in.\nHong Thanh: Got it. And I guess, would you able to quantify how much of a drag the rents that you signed in the pandemic and the fact \u2013 and the rent positives that add on just your overall rent number?\nJoe Margolis: So, in terms of quantifying them, we aren\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not looking to quantify them here today, but I would tell you that many of those are getting rate increases today that are going to be outsized as we move people more to market levels. So, if \u2013 our typical rent cycle is such that many of them have received rent increases or will be over the next month or two. So, we should be moving them to market and it should be much less of a drag into the fourth quarter.\nHong Thanh: Got it. And it sounds like you\u2019re accelerating that. is that right? \nJoe Margolis: So our rent increases are overall pretty similar to what they typically are in terms of our existing cap store rate increases. Remember, we still do have some state of emergency areas that are limiting the amount of rent increases that we can\u2019t pass through.\nHong Thanh: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Quick ones for me. Just going back to the demand question and the customer behavior. Just asking in a different way, just thematically, when you\u2019re doing the analysis and you\u2019re looking at the customer behavior, is there anything that stands out to sort of explain sort of the demand drivers, whether it\u2019d be college students or small businesses, work from home demand or people living in the city, just thematically, is there anything to call out there? And the corollary to that would be, as we think about normalization scenario, what is one time versus what\u2019s going to recur as well as what aren\u2019t we thinking about when things normalize that could actually be a demand positive? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So thematically. I would think about demand broadly two ways. One is, there is demand for storage is driven by life events, at least on the non-business side. And those life events occurred during a pandemic \u2013 some of those life events occurred during a pandemic and not during a pandemic, right. People are getting divorced, people are dying and moving to folks to old folks home, all this stuff that gives rise to storage demand, before the pandemic still happening. In addition, you have unique things like college students not going back to college, restaurants having their store half their tables and chairs, people leaving the city to work from home \u2013 people leaving the city to move back with their parents, because they don\u2019t want to be in the city. And that stuff \u2013 some of that stuff may eventually go back to normal. Some of it may be more permanent nature, and we don\u2019t know the mix of that. But we do know that we live in a dynamic country where there is economic movement, where there is movement of people and that will continue, and people will continue to use storage based on that. And on our customer acquisition platform will continue to reach out and acquire those customers.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then not to beat the dead horse on external growth, but just thinking about it sort of a different way, in terms of just the run rate, I think you said earlier about, obviously you could buy more guilt if you wanted to, but clearly the focus is about making money. But six months ago when COVID hit, I think we were all trying to get their arms around it, clearly the sector has done that really well. Should we just expect the level run rate activity acquisitions to increase? Simply because, maybe there is a little bit more confidence, a little bit more visibility. Could we get back to $200 million, $300 million, maybe even more in acquisitions? Assuming those opportunities are out there and they \u2013 and again they sort of meet your return requirements. How should we think about that?\nScott Stubbs: Well, we have $287 million already this year that we\u2019ve closed or under contract to close on the acquisition side. So I guess we have gotten back to the levels you had spoken about, and then we have our other growth activities. So if we keep go into the year, I don\u2019t think this will ever happen and by nothing, because the pricing doesn\u2019t make sense, it would destroy value and not create value, then we\u2019ll do that. If we have an opportunity to place $1 billion, because it\u2019s a accretive to our shareholders, then we\u2019ll do that. And it\u2019s incumbent on us to be aware of all the transactions to manufacture transactions, to structure things that create value for our shareholders. And I think if you look historically, what we\u2019ve done and the volume we\u2019ve done and how successful it\u2019s been, I hope that gives you some confidence that we\u2019ll continue to [Technical Difficulty] in the future.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thanks so much.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jenny. We\u2019re very happy to achieve 5.6% FFO growth this quarter. That\u2019s very meaningful accomplishment for us, particularly in a quarter where we have negative same-store NOI growth. And we do this through improving store performance both inside and outside the same-store pool and creative external growth and capital light activities. But none of this is possible without the jeans at the stores and here in our corporate office and at the call center who work really hard all the time, who exhibit our values, who work as teams, all managing through the pandemic. And I wouldn\u2019t want to end this call without acknowledging the hard work of all of our teammates. Thank you much, and I hope everyone has a great day\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. And thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. I trust everyone in their families remain healthy and are managing through this difficult time. 2020 has been a challenging and eventful year. And unprecedented conditions related to the pandemic have made it difficult to forecast performance. On our last call, we discussed the tailwinds we are experiencing in terms of rental activity, muted vacates, positive achieved rate trends and the resumption of normal operations. We also discussed the potential headwinds if we believed we could face, including economic and political risk, as well as changing customer behavior and new supply. During the third quarter, and to-date, the tailwinds improved stronger than we expected while the headwinds have not been as significant or have not materialized. Rental volume remains healthy, our vacate volume remains muted, resulting in an all-time high occupancy of approximately 96%. Through July, occupancy was inflated with non-paying customers due to the inability to auction delinquent units. However, as the quarter continued and auctions resume, we have been able to maintain our high occupancy and collections have returned to historically normal levels. Our elevated occupancy resulted in return of pricing power during the third quarter. In short, our stores are performing significantly better than we expected earlier in the pandemic. On the last call, we stated that we expected to have negative same-store revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters. Due to the continuation of the tailwinds we are experiencing, we have achieved positive revenue growth in October and are confident we will produce positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We remain mindful of the potential macro and industry-specific uncertainties that we have referenced during the third quarter. However, at present the risks do not appear to be negatively impacting the demand for storage or consumers' ability and willingness to pay for our product. The primary headwind impacting performance is new supply in certain markets. While the pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects and planning, properties are still being delivered and excess inventory is still leasing up, which will continue to suppress rate growth in high supply markets. Despite the improving trends, our same-store NOI remain negative in the third quarter. However, even with the disruption COVID-19 caused to our operations, we continue to grow core FFO per share, which is our ultimate goal. In the third quarter, FFO per share increased 5.6% and FFO growth for the first three quarters was 5%, both sizable beats over consensus. Our flexible organizational structure and focused on innovative capital-light strategies have enhanced FFO through new external growth channels and non-same-store income streams. These contributions paired with improving same-store trends lead us to believe that our 2020 FFO will comfortably exceed the high end of our pre-COVID expectations. Turning to external growth, acquisition volume has picked up in the sector as markets have started to settle, but pricing for widely brokered deals, particularly for stabilized properties remains very competitive. During the quarter, we have closed to put under contract an additional $140 million of acquisitions, bringing our total expected investment in 2020 to $287 million. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to find ways to creatively invest capital in the storage sector. Our bridge loan program continues to grow with approximately $315 million in bridge loans scheduled to close in 2020, with the expectation to sell 70% to 80% of the balances. We've also approved $167 million of loans to close in 2021. We also purchased $103 million senior mezzanine note at a small discount. And subsequent to quarter-end, we invested in additional $50 million in SmartStop through our previously negotiated preferred equity investment. And through three quarters, we have added 72 stores net to our third-party management platform. In short, we continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholder's long-term value, to optimizing property level operations and efficiently and creatively investing capital in the storage sector at acceptable risk levels. I'll now turn the time over to Scott. For FFO, yes, that's correct, Jeff. So Jeff, I'm not sure I understood your question. What gives us comfort to provide 2021 guidance or not? Is that the question? So our current plan is to provide 2021 guidance. If the political or medical situation gets to the level of uncertainty that we don't feel we could provide a range comfortably, then we'll have to rethink that position. So we'll watch our customer's behavior. We don't have perfect visibility as to how some of the things you're talking about, work-from-home, housing market, the direct correlation or translation to customer behavior. So we track literally every day customer behavior across a whole lot of metrics and optimize operations based on what we see. Sure. Thank you, Jeff. So occupancy \u2013 I'm sorry, vacate levels are still muted. They're still below historical norms. They're not as needed as they were earlier in the pandemic. But one of the factors, a strong factor in our very high occupancy is that vacates are muted. And I agree with you, risk of the future is that customer behavior returns to normal, vacates return to normal, and that puts pressure on occupancy. However, we don't think there's any way to encourage people to stay in storage. Storage is a need based product. And at some point people won't need the storage anymore. And at that point, they'll leave. They may not leave immediately because of inertia, but sooner or later, they're going to realize I don't need this anymore. And even if we cut their rent to $1, they don't need it and they're going to go and move on and do whatever they need. So we can't encourage people to stay. What we can do is make sure that we can replace those tenants in the most efficient manner at the lowest cost at the best rate that we can. Sure. Happy to. So we started this program in 2019. We lend only on existing product or not development loans. The product has to be completed and operating. We manage each of these loans. So in addition to the economics of the loan, we get the economics of the management, contract. We look somewhat at the borrower's financial capacity, particularly, because they have obligations \u2013 personal obligations to replenish operating an interest reserves. But our primary collateral is the real estate. We underwrite this real estate as if we're going to buy it to the same team that underwrites our acquisitions. And we are \u2013 we make loans where we're comfortable. If we have to own the property at our loan balance, that we'll be happy that we did that. The second question with regard to pacing, this program has grown frankly faster this year than we thought. And we did a $100 million in our first year. We will fund or approve for funding, probably close to over $500 million this year. And I think the acceleration is because what people are just looking for a way to get to a better tomorrow. We're in this weird position. They just want to get some financing that will let them get their store to a more stabilized number, and then they can put permanent financing or sell or do whatever. It's important to remember that we sell 70% to 80% of the balances of the loan. So they're structured is first to mezz or A&B. We'll sell the first position and retain the second position that both leverages our return and allows us to control the amount of capital that's allocated to this program. Sorry for the long answer. So I would expect the program to grow. Our goal is to grow these programs. As we develop more relationships, have more programmatic borrowers. It's kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill. So it's my hope and expectation that we do more in 2021 than we did in 2020. Sure. Thank you. So what's on the books today isn't representative of our final capital investment. When we first started this program, we would simultaneously close and sell the first tranche, so that never showed up on our books. We now think a better execution is to close them all on balance sheet, package it up in $30 million, $40 million, $50 million chunks, then take those to the market and sell it. So we currently have more on the balance sheet than we ultimately will because we're in the middle of selling a couple of those tranches. Yields on the whole loan or between 5% and 6%, there's a LIBOR for that puts the yields in that place. Once we sell it, the yields on our piece are between 9% and 11% and those numbers don't include management fees or having insurance that we get from managing the property. No, I just going to make the comparison of where we see cap rates and opportunity to make money, buying wholly-owned properties versus the yields we can get from this plus the management contract, plus we've already bought three assets out of the loan program at somewhat of an acquisition pipeline. And it allows us just to create more partnerships, more relationships, which is so important to us in everything we do. Yes. So I think your second point is spot on. Now that this has gotten significant, we need to add some things to our SOPs and we will do that in 2021. Seeing that we sell the vast majority of the loan balances, I don't see a meaningful cap on what we can do. I don't know if we can grow this big enough where we won't have the capital to do it. Yes. those are macro stats. If you broke it down to the store level and look at stores that had new supply challenges or new supply competitors, they may still be leasing up quickly or have very high occupancy, but their rate growth, their rate power is very different than stores that don't have that new supply challenge. So, we're able to fill all our stores up. The impact of new supplies is on how much rate power we have. So, I do expect moderation, equity \u2013 there's probably equity out there with developers, I think that is harder to get and there's some markets that it's just harder to underwrite to get the deal. So, new supply is not going to stop, but I would expect moderation. Thank you. So, I actually don't know if I've ever divided deals we're seeing, I don't know if I know the answer to what percentage of deals we're seeing on lease-up versus stabilized? I'll pay the deals we've approved this year. We've approved 22 stores for acquisition, and none of them were stabilized. They were all between \u2013 they averaged about 64% occupancy and that's stabilized periods of six to 36 months with stabilized cash flow in the mid-sixes. So, those are the type of deals that are attracted to \u2013 attractive to us now, stabilized stores, it's sub-five cap rates are not all that attractive to us. Thanks, Spenser. So in the first and second quarters, I would tell you it was up slightly for a couple of reasons. One is we had a very tough comp from last year. We had very low payroll last year, as we had turnover that was maybe, a little higher and our time to fill was a little higher last year than it is this year. So this year, we've had very little turnover. We also tried to be fair with our employees, as people got sick, because they had family members who got sick. So, our staffing was maybe a little higher in the second quarter. As we moved into the third quarter, we've seen that normalized somewhat and in the second quarter, the other thing we saw is nobody was taking vacation. So, you're accruing the vacations there. Nobody was taking time off. And so we would expect it to be up slightly, but not to the degree it was in the first and second quarter. So, I would tell you late fees are down for a couple of reasons. One is you have a state of emergency orders that don't allow us to charge late fees in certain markets. So, in the Los Angeles area, we're not charging late fees or we're being lenient with late fees. The second one is early in the pandemic, and as we moved in and as people went to auction, we have been more lenient on late fees as we've tried to be fair with our customers. as that auction volume has slowed, meaning we've gotten through some of the pent-up options, we would expect that to normalize in areas, where we have had auctions and do not have state of emergencies. Next one. No, we don't know, right. We don't know how this is going to play out and how long some of this demand generated by the virus is going to last. We do know that it's a good thing that more people are getting exposed to the product and using the product and now know that it's an option. But one of the uncertainties is it was all of colleges go back to normal and if people move back into the city and out of their parents' home. Do we lose some of this demand? It's a risk. Yes. So, we don't judge success in the acquisition market by \u2013 who bought the most. I mean, if we could buy the most, we have the money; we can go out and bid more than anyone else. but at the end of the day, it's about the returns you produce for your investors. So, we are going to be active in the acquisition market when we can produce the good returns. we're going to be active in the bridge loan market. We're going to find creative ways, whether it's preferred deals or otherwise to do that and we're also going to increase our management and capital-light businesses. So, at the end of the day, we're not seeking to buy the most, we're seeking to make the most money. So, I would tell you, obviously we've made some assumptions. I think that we do have some vacancy assumptions in there, vacate assumptions. And if those, I think that if anything, if it keeps going like it is, we are very confident that that will be positive. I think that right now that we've had positive rent growth in October, our occupancy is still 2.5% plus ahead of last year and rate increases have kicked in. So, in terms of quantifying them, we aren't \u2013 we're not looking to quantify them here today, but I would tell you that many of those are getting rate increases today that are going to be outsized as we move people more to market levels. So, if \u2013 our typical rent cycle is such that many of them have received rent increases or will be over the next month or two. So, we should be moving them to market and it should be much less of a drag into the fourth quarter. So our rent increases are overall pretty similar to what they typically are in terms of our existing cap store rate increases. Remember, we still do have some state of emergency areas that are limiting the amount of rent increases that we can't pass through. So thematically. I would think about demand broadly two ways. One is, there is demand for storage is driven by life events, at least on the non-business side. And those life events occurred during a pandemic \u2013 some of those life events occurred during a pandemic and not during a pandemic, right. People are getting divorced, people are dying and moving to folks to old folks home, all this stuff that gives rise to storage demand, before the pandemic still happening. In addition, you have unique things like college students not going back to college, restaurants having their store half their tables and chairs, people leaving the city to work from home \u2013 people leaving the city to move back with their parents, because they don't want to be in the city. And that stuff \u2013 some of that stuff may eventually go back to normal. Some of it may be more permanent nature, and we don't know the mix of that. But we do know that we live in a dynamic country where there is economic movement, where there is movement of people and that will continue, and people will continue to use storage based on that. And on our customer acquisition platform will continue to reach out and acquire those customers. Thanks, Ron. Thanks, Jenny. We're very happy to achieve 5.6% FFO growth this quarter. That's very meaningful accomplishment for us, particularly in a quarter where we have negative same-store NOI growth. And we do this through improving store performance both inside and outside the same-store pool and creative external growth and capital light activities. But none of this is possible without the jeans at the stores and here in our corporate office and at the call center who work really hard all the time, who exhibit our values, who work as teams, all managing through the pandemic. And I wouldn't want to end this call without acknowledging the hard work of all of our teammates. Thank you much, and I hope everyone has a great day"

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we've seen a number of positive trends during the quarter that are continuing into the fourth quarter. During September and October, we typically see occupancy and achieved rates start to moderate due to seasonality. This year, this has not been the case. Rentals remain steady, while vacates are still down and October occupancy remained relatively similar to this summer's highs at just under 96%, a positive year-over-year delta of approximately 260 basis points with less than 20 basis points of inflated occupancy related to non-paying tenants. New customer rates also remained strong. Achieved rates to new customer were flat year-over-year in July and improved to approximately 11% in August, September and October. We have completed the rollout of our online leasing platform, Rapid Rental, and have seen approximately 20% of rentals come through this channel. We have also reinstated existing customer rent increases in most markets with a focus on bringing customers with below market rates closer to current levels. To-date, such increases have not caused outsized vacate activity. Despite these strong trends, same-store revenue remained negative in the quarter, primarily driven by lower other income due to fewer assessed late fees and auction fees. We've tried to work with our customers and have been lenient where appropriate given challenges related to the pandemic. We have been proactively controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, while ensuring we aren't hurting the long-term value of our properties or our business. Expense growth from property taxes was generally offset by savings in utilities and repairs and maintenance, and we managed to keep payroll generally flat without furloughs, layoffs or pay cuts. We continue to view marketing spend as an investment in top line revenue growth, and we'll continue to use this lever to drive revenue when the return wants it. We've been tracking the results of California's Proposition 15 vote carefully, and it appears that it \u2013 that it will not pass and have an impact on property tax expense. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and have access to many types of capital at attractive pricing. We received $425 million from our previously completed private placement transaction, and subsequent to quarter-end, we used these funds, revolver capacity and shares to settle our $500 million convertible notes. All in all, 2020 has been an eventful year and we have certainly seen the landscape shift rapidly over the last two quarters. While we can't predict all of the future \u2013 we can't predict all of the future challenges we may face, we believe our flexible organizational structure are focused on innovation, and ultimately our people position us to react quickly to change and to capitalize on various opportunities to follow. We operate in a fantastic sector and our diversified portfolio, advanced platform and talented team will continue to maximize shareholder value, regardless of the economic climate. With that, let's turn it back over to Jenny to start our Q&A. Yes. Smedes this is Scott, the major maturities that we had coming due at the end of this year were really two items. One was a $70 million loan that came due in September that we actually extended for a year. So that'll come due in the year. And the second piece is a $575 million convert. And that was actually paid off in two troches part of the $71 million getting paid off the 1 of October and the other $504 million getting paid off the second day of November. So we have paid \u2013 we've either extended or paid those off and we paid that off with the proceeds from our private placement, which was a $425 million private placement, and then proceeds from our lines of credit. Thanks, Smedes. And Todd, you can see that sum in the supplementals, if you look at it by market. So for instance, if you look at Dallas or South Florida or New York City, you'll see that those are performing from a revenue growth perspective below the average versus markets that are performing above the average. And we would tell you that supply markets are typically performing below the average. Yes. I would tell you the rental volume and occupancies are consistent across the portfolio. So, it's not just urban versus suburban. If you look at our property occupancy in \u2013 we're full across the U.S., if you look at kind of rentals and vacates throughout the quarter, we actually had higher vacate volume this quarter due to auctions than we normally would, because we kind of moved six months worth of auctions into three months here. And so I would tell you our rental volume while it might be slightly below last year. last year was a really good year with July, we end very high. We're very close to historical norm. So, our rental volume has been strong, and we've also been able to offset any vacancy that was created by the increase in auctions in the third quarter. So, we had those pent-up auctions as we paused during the stay-at-home timeframe. Well, we have $287 million already this year that we've closed or under contract to close on the acquisition side. So I guess we have gotten back to the levels you had spoken about, and then we have our other growth activities. So if we keep go into the year, I don't think this will ever happen and by nothing, because the pricing doesn't make sense, it would destroy value and not create value, then we'll do that. If we have an opportunity to place $1 billion, because it's a accretive to our shareholders, then we'll do that. And it's incumbent on us to be aware of all the transactions to manufacture transactions, to structure things that create value for our shareholders. And I think if you look historically, what we've done and the volume we've done and how successful it's been, I hope that gives you some confidence that we'll continue to [Technical Difficulty] in the future."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Jeff Norman. Thank you. Please go ahead sir.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Oren. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call.

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you, Jeff, and thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry, and Extra Space. I am incredibly thankful to our employees to help to continue to operate our stores, service our customers, grow our company, strengthen our balance sheet and to do all the day-to-day blocking and tackling, that allows us to optimize our performance. All these good work was done in unusual and sometimes difficult working situations and often with added personal and family stress and uncertainty. It is said that crises does not create character, but reveals character. And I could not be prouder of the character the Extra Space team has shown during these past several months. This quarter also presented a stark reminder of racial injustice in our country. Approximately 40% of our teammates are black or other people of color, and I am proud them recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent that's been a focus of our company for many years. It is not a new initiative. However, the tragic events of the last two months reinforced to me that Extra Space is a values-driven company with a great inclusive culture, we can do better. In response, we have enhanced our existing diversity and inclusion initiatives and have taken several concrete steps to improve as a company. These steps are consistent with our company values and I am committed and our response will not be limited to making statements or temporary steps, but we'll be continuing and substantive. Turning to our performance in the second quarter. Most importantly, we were able to grow FFO in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have started to see several positive trends on which Scott will provide further detail. Our platform is able to find and capture high-value customers. Rentals have normalized and vacates remain muted. As a result, our occupancy is at an all time high and prices have begun to move in the right direction. Where we can, we have resumed more normal pricing, operational practices and auctions. However, these positive trends should not obscure the macro and industry specific risks we still face. There are still uncertainties with respect to the course and length of the virus, its economic impact and its effect on consumers and their willingness to pay for storage. While our occupancy is at an all time high, until recently we have not been allowed to initiate the auction process in several markets, which represents approximately 47% of our same-store NOI. As a result at the end of June, approximately 150 basis points of our occupancy is from non-paying tenants due to delays in auction. By the end of July, this inflated occupancy increased to approximately 200 basis points. We are now moving forward with auctions in most states, but due to notice periods, actual auctions in several states won't begin until September, which will be outside of the peak-leasing season for re-tenanting these units. Occupancy has also benefited from lower-than-normal vacant. I do not personally believe that, the moderation in vacates represents a permanent behavioral shift of our customers. Instead, at some point, more historically normal activity will resume and we will see vacates increase, putting further pressure on occupancy, when we may not have our full set of tools available to optimize returns, due to government state emergency orders or regulations. Also the non-COVID headwinds that we had coming into 2020 are still present. While we believe the pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects and planning, properties are still being delivered, and there is still excess inventory leasing up in many markets, which is depressing rate growth. So, while we are encouraged by recent results, there are enough remaining uncertainties and risks that we are not in a position to reinstate guidance. The possible outcomes remain too broad for guidance to be meaningful, depending on how the risks I've outlined play out. We will continue to be transparent on all metrics and answer questions that you may have, and we will continue to work hard every day and remain laser-focused on maximizing shareholders long-term value. And now, I'd like to wish Scott a happy birthday and turn the time over him to walk through some of the metrics that I mentioned.\nScott Stubbs: Thank you, Joe, and hello everyone. All of our properties are open and have been fully operating since May. We modified our stores by adding plexiglass partitions, stantions to direct the flow of traffic and sanitation stations to provide a safer experience for our customers and our employees. These updates have been effective and as demand started to pick up through the quarter. Our rentals rebounded improving from a negative 35% year-over-year delta in April to a positive 4% rental growth rate in June. Vacates for the quarter were approximately 17% lower year-over-year, resulting in strong occupancy growth, which went from a negative 60 basis point year-over-year gap at the end of April to a positive 100 basis point gap at the end of the quarter. At the end of July, this has expanded to 150 basis points. However, this increased occupancy came at a price. Our average achieved rate for the quarter was down approximately 17%. and as Joe mentioned, our quarter end occupancy was inflated by 150 basis points from non-paying customers. In May, we restarted our collection efforts, which have been successful. Accounts receivable less than 60 days have dropped back to historical levels; however, due to the delayed auctions and in key states such as California, New Jersey and New York, we are still working accounts receivable greater than 60 days through the system. Today, accounts receivable greater than 60 days as a percentage of rental income are running approximately 325 basis points higher than historical levels, and we have recognized a loss on aged accounts receivable based on estimated collections. All of these factors together with temporarily pausing existing customer rate increases in March, April and May will continue to drag on revenue growth in the back half of the year. While street rates and rental activity have improved significantly, it will take time for the impact of May and June's lower achieved rates to flow through to revenue. And we do not anticipate positive same-store revenue growth in the second half of the year. While we are being proactive with controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, we will continue to have expense pressure from payroll, property taxes and marketing expense. Property level performance will continue to be challenged in the back half of the year, but we are finding success in other parts of the business and have strengthened our balance sheet. We continue to find ways to grow externally and to accretively deploy capital in the self storage space. We have closed 52 million in bridge loans year-to-date with another $170 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. In July, we purchased a $103 million senior mezzanine note at a discount with an anticipated yield to maturity of 6.1%. Our third-party management platform provides capital light growth, providing management fees and tenant insurance driving non same-store income. We are also vigilantly pursuing acquisition opportunities and will act swiftly when we identify transactions that we believe add value to our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the addition of a new $300 million revolving credit facility and the closing of a $425 million private placement transaction during the quarter. Funds from the private placement transaction will be taken through delayed draw to pay-off our convertible notes and will increase our weighted-average debt maturity. As Joe mentioned, we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our business. That said, it is good to be in storage and our company is well-positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent high-level execution, and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. With that, let's turn it over to Oran to start our Q&A.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs.\nRick Skidmore: Hi. Good morning, Joe and Scott. Scott, can you talk about the Company's bad debt policy and how you think about expensing? And what the amount was a in the quarter that you expense? And how you think about the accounts receivable greater than 60 days going forward? Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Rick. So our bad debt has historically run at 1.6% to 1.8% of our revenue. During the quarter, our bad debt expense was about 50% higher than that. And that primarily has to do with the older accounts receivable and the things that have gone to auction. Our policy is to reserve for the majority of all accounts receivable that are 90 days or more past due. So much of what's in the 60 days and certainly almost all of what's in the 90 days or more past due has already flown through bad debt.\nRick Skidmore: And then maybe just shifting Joe to supply growth and talk about supply. What are you seeing in terms of perhaps delays in supply growth and deliveries and which particular markets do you see that supply growth particularly challenging currently?\nJoe Margolis: So, we do see delays in delivery of new product. One of the reasons -- well, we did have a good quarter with respect to new properties taken into our management platform, it was a little less than anticipated because some projects were delayed and won't be taken on until later in the year, but we absolutely are both experiencing and seeing delays and new products being delivered. The markets that we're concerned with are still the same markets that we were concerned with before. It's the Texas and Florida, Boroughs of New York City and some markets like that. There really COVID hasn't changed the markets that are faced with supply versus the ones.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rose from Citibank.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to ask you this a little bit more about the existing customer rate increases. I think in June you provided an update where you were able to increase rates in 27 out of 40 states in which you were operating. What is that now? And I guess what percentage of customers are have been, or are expected to receive rate increases, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the acceptance rate what you've seen so far as you push out rate increases for those who can get them?\nJoe Margolis: So, there's six states now where we're prohibited from issuing existing customer rate increase notices, and a few of those States, we have some meaningful exposure to, and then there's another 14 States where our ability is limited to a certain percentage and in some case that percentage is so high, it's a meaningless limit. So far as we have re-instituted existing customer rate increase notices, we have not seen any change in behavior. We've not seen increased move out in response to those notices. Although I would also caution you it's something we're closely monitoring and we're probably still early in that game. We're interested to see what happens when the additional unemployment insurance runs out factors like that. So something we're watching closely, Smedes.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then could you just talk a little bit more about the mezz loan that you mentioned that you purchased is that backed by a portfolio of assets and kind of, how are you thinking about that kind of loan to own, or just to get the yield or maybe a little more color there?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So it's absolutely a portfolio of 64 self storage assets. You know, they're in markets that overlay our footprint and as with any loan we make, if we end up having to own the assets, we're fully capable of operating them and adding value, and that's not a negative experience for us. So, we are always looking for opportunities to smartly invest our shareholders' money in creative position with the good risk posture. Our position in the first year is about $53 a square foot. So we feel pretty good about that. We think we're getting a fair return and we're very comfortable with the risk posture of the investment.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mr. Jeff Spector from Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. Good afternoon. Appreciate Joe, your balanced comments in your introductory remarks and just trying to think about many of the lessons you learned during some of the worst months we seen, let's say, March, April into May and recognizing of course the risks in the coming months. Would you do anything different in the coming months, let's say, if the reopening or closings continue versus what you initially did?\nJoe Margolis: So, I can't tell you we were perfect. We certainly did things and learned lessons that we will apply in the future. One thing that I will tell you that a company like Extra Space that has a large portfolio has an advantage is we don't have to guess too much things. So as we were going, was we were faced with many of these new situations. We very quickly tried different things in a test basis in several hundred stores and learned what worked and what didn't. So we didn't have to make kind of final decisions for the whole portfolio. And that was very beneficial, because we were faced with new customer situation, new customer behavior. We were able to quickly get to what performs best. And we'll certainly take those lessons with us in the future, and also take our testing culture and approach to new situations with us as well.\nJeff Spector: And, again, just thinking about the comments, in particular the risk of, with your auctions, and a lot of them, let's say happening in September outside peak leasing. I mean, we've heard other sectors, people comment that this year that maybe there's no peak leasing, maybe there's just steady leasing, maybe there's even pent up demand. Like, again, I'm just trying to get a feel for your comments. And I totally respect and get the comments that we need to be cautious here. There's still a lot of risk. I think expectations coming into the year, by the way, we're pretty low. But I mean, do you think that there actually was peak leasing or is this just, could the fall surprises?\nJoe Margolis: I agree with you, I think we don't know. I think we're in a new situation. And we don't know, if there will be steady leasing if there is pent up demand or if we'll see the more traditional leasing patterns. And it's one of the reasons we're uncomfortable providing guidance on what's going to happen for the rest of the year, because there are these unknowns.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mr. Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Market.\nTodd Thomas: Just first question. Following up on the bad debt expense, Scott, you've indicated that historically, the reserves 1.2% to 1.8% of revenue, so 50% greater this quarter and incremental 80 to 90 basis points of bad debt. Is that going to trend higher in future quarters or will that normalize beginning in third quarter as you work through some of the options and delinquencies?\nScott Stubbs: So, we would -- I think July will be a little bit higher, but we would expect it to normalize going forward. And what we're basing that on is, if you look at our zero to 68 ARs, they're backing historical norms, they're not continuing to grow. So assuming that continues, that trend continues those 0 to 60 become your 60 plus, if they were not paying. And so, the fact that they've gone back to historical norms, hopefully, everything else goes back to historical norms from here. So by the end of July, you've recognized majority of your bad debt related to this.\nTodd Thomas: And then the delayed auction activities, that's causing that, this inflated sort of physical occupancy. Have you started getting back in it at all or with notice periods, as you mentioned, is that process really just beginning now? And then as we think about the auction activity is increasing in the months ahead. Is that going to result in an influx of rentable units and effective sort of increase in supply coming back to the market over the next few months? Or is that not the right way to think about it?\nJoe Margolis: So, we have, one of the negatives of the delayed auction is the opportunity costs to nothing ever get the unit back. So we actually absolutely will try where we can to work with our tenants, and make some arrangement where they turn this, the unit back to us, so we can we can have it. But the majority of the units have to go through the auction process. We won't get them back until late in the third quarter. And at that point, we'll have to return to them. And kind of similar to Jeff's question earlier, we'll see what the environment is done to do so.\nTodd Thomas: And then can you just comment on what the recovery rates or I guess the collection rates have been like on the ARs here. Are you seeing bigger, right off and you have historically. Is there any information you can share on that?\nScott Stubbs: Todd, our recoveries have actually been slightly better than the historical norm. No. We'll see if that continues, but that's been our experience so far on the auctions that have happened.\nTodd Thomas: What do you attribute that to?\nScott Stubbs: Some of these people might just be choosing not to pay and so they may just be paying late versus having a true problem. I don't know for sure. That's some of our speculation.\nJoe Margolis: One thing we see across other asset classes is when the government tells you, you don't have to pay, or the government tells you there's no penalties, if you don't have to pay. Some people just choose not to do so.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mr. Samir with Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: Scott, as we think about the headwinds we're facing now and you've talked about the occupancy being inflated 200 basis points, 225 basis points of AR, which could potentially be bad debt. Is this a set up to a quarter or third quarter where things are going to get worse before they get better? Or do you think the second quarter is sort of a trough and revenue growth. And then there's sort of enough tailwinds where we start to see improvement going into the back half of this year? Where things are still negative but less bad?\nScott Stubbs: So first of all, I think just to clarify one thing that AR the majority of that has a large majority of that has already been written off. So you basically reserved for it in the second quarter, once they hit that 60 to 90 days, especially the 90-day accounts receivable have been reserved for. So we don't expect that to be a negative in the third quarter to the degree it was in the second quarter. We do expect those units coming back online to be a potential headwind for us.\nSamir Khanal: And what about it just kind of following up with tailwind, you think there's enough sort of tailwinds here to see some improvement in revenue growth where things are going to be less negative, or that's too early to say right now?\nScott Stubbs: I mean, we always hope for and we have confidence in our team in our systems that we're going to get every dollar we can optimize performance, but I would tell you there's enough uncertainties in macro economy and other factors that we can't say for certain now.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. And I guess just another question for me, and I know this was addressed a little bit earlier on ECRI, but just maybe a little bit more color, California is well documented with what's sort of a 10% max or increase in that, and I think some of the other states and municipalities have applied restrictions as well. But what do you think -- how should we think about sort of the push backs you were getting from states and municipalities? And it's not really a question for this year's growth, but as we think about maybe growth in the next year, how should we think about growth from the ECRI perspective?\nJoe Margolis: Well, we would hope that, these restrictions would be lifted and we can go back to our normal operating practice with prospective ECRI auctions. But, we don't control that. So, our job is to control what we can control and maximize performance and follow the line in other place.\nScott Stubbs: Samir, the other thing I would maybe add there is, they're not necessarily additive in a normal year, but in a year like this, where they are going to be below average, if you have certain states that either don't allow them or allow them to a limited amount, it does make it difficult to continue to grow your revenues, especially for customers who came in at a level significantly below street rate. It's difficult for us to move them more quickly to the average rate there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mr. Ryan Lumb from Green Street Advisors.\nRyan Lumb: Thanks. Joe, last quarter, you said that, you were likely to seek good number of distress, maybe see about deals or stores in some stage of lease up coming to market, given the stress in the market. Given what appears to be at least some improvement in demand in recent weeks, do you still anticipate the same volume of distressed assets, coming to market maybe this year or next?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I think, there's going to be a number of stores that were not stabilized that the owner or the lender or the equity investor is going to force some type of capital event. So I would say, yes.\nRyan Lumb: Okay. And then, I think you've had mentioned in the past that operating changed so dramatically in March and April that, many of the rules or relationships that govern sort of revenue management system were either sort of less effective or not applicable to very human environment and the approach to revenue management had to sort of temporarily be reworked. I'm just curious any color would be great. To what extent has you approached your revenue management sort of returned to normal, or are we still operating in sort of a different and trying new things?\nJoe Margolis: I guess part of my answer is I would say it Extra Space, we're always trying new things. We're always testing, innovating, trying to make the tools a little sharper and seeing what works. As I said earlier, I think we've learned a lot through this experience, some of which may be the permanent lessons and some may just be temporary. We are seeing more return to normal in terms of customer behavior. So for example our walking traffic has improved significantly. And that's an important metric that we look at and govern some of our behavior.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Mueller of JP Morgan.\nMike Mueller: A couple questions and I've had phone issues, so I apologize if this was addressed earlier. First, can you disclose if you have already, what the rate is on the most investment that you made? And then second, if you're working C of O deals in the market today, have you seen any meaningful changes to pricing?\nJoe Margolis: So, we have not approved a new C of O deal certainly in 2020, maybe even for 12 months. I'd have to think about that, but we have certainly not approved a new C of O deal in 2020. The just, pricing doesn't seem to make sense for us now. The rate, the base rate on our note is 5.5% and the yield to maturity is 6.1% on the C of O deal.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of a John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: I think Scott, you mentioned in the external pressure on payrolls, which I thought was interesting, just given the unemployment rates. But I was wondering you can comment on that as well as the potential ability to more permanently alleviate this cost with either touch of leasing or available employee hours?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So, the payroll cost comes, the pressure on payroll comes more from a tough count from last year. Our payroll was actually very low last year in wonderful quarters, I believe we were negative. So, it\u2019s the tough comps, is the main comment there. In terms of what we're looking at and, we think our managers are important, we think they're an important part of the sales process. We're always looking for opportunities to go touch less and deliver our customers the product in the manner that they would like to consume it. So, the example I would give you is pre-COVID. I think most people enjoyed working with a manager like their managers they were very successful in leasing units. Since this has happened, we've gone to a touch less process where your Managers are involved via telephone. And we have expanded that even further where they can do a complete rental online at 3 am with no manager involvement, and that's at, I believe, about 1200 of our stores as of today. So we continue to evolve that.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And you also mentioned that you are actively or more actively pursuing acquisition. I was wondering if you can elaborate on how pricing has moved and if you're seeing more interesting opportunities in newly developed products, stabilized assets, or more potential mezz investments.\nScott Stubbs: So I'll clarify in my remarks. I didn't mean to give the impression we are more actively pursuing acquisitions. We're always pursuing acquisitions. We're always looking for ways to smartly grow this company. And we're lucky to be in a great capital position where we have plenty of capital of all different sorts to pursue any acquisition that we think makes sense. The acquisition market has been somewhat muted in terms of things coming to the market and particularly things that seem to make sense for us. But we're always trying to find smart ways to present a good risk profile for us to grow the Company. So whether that's acquisitions, acquisitions adventures, reinvesting in our existing properties through expansions, a bridge loans, buying the mezz loan that we just bought. We're just going to try to be smart allocators of capital So I don't think pricing has moved for stabilized properties, and there's not a ton of cost out there, but if you have a stabilized self storage asset, it's going to attract in a good market. It's going to attract they're very low cap rate because people understand the stability of cash flow that comes from the self storage assets, rates are low and the alternatives are, are not as good. So I think, cap rates are still low. What is much more difficult to say is on a lease of asset. One\u2019s view of the Cap rate depends on one's view of the timing and rate on which you can lease up that store and people can have very, very different views of what that is. And I would say pricing is uncertain.\nOperator: And our next question comes from a Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Two quick ones from me. One was just going back to sort of the bad debt. I know the apartment peers variations geographically. Just curious, when I think about States like New York, New Jersey California, was there any sort of notable differences there versus sort of the average of the portfolio or any other color you can provide?\nJoe Margolis: Some observations we can make. We are seeing higher AR at stores that are in markets with lower household income and also at stores, if there's more cash paying customers as opposed to credit cards. But the biggest impact is if you kind of get the trifecta of lower household income, lots of cash paying customers, and you're in a state where we can option that's where we have the highest.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it understand. The other question was, we're hearing a lot more about theme de-urbanization, people moving from urban to suburban and curious when you think about your portfolio, are you seeing that translating into potentially more traffic or more demand on the margin for your suburban versus the urban part of the portfolio or it\u2019s just too tough to tell.\nJoe Margolis: So I would say we're seeing good demand across our portfolio. And if there is that trend, it is probably too early to tell. But one of the advantages of having a broadly diversified portfolio across a lot of primary and secondary are urban and suburban, however you want to characterize them growth, Mark, you know, we should be in a good balanced position to benefit from that if it occurs.\nRonald Kamdem: And you've mentioned July occupancy did you provide July achieved rates as well?\nScott Stubbs: We did not -- let me just kind of give you a little history of the rates through the quarter and how they progressed. Negative 10% in April, negative 20% in May, misses are achieved rates, negative 16% in June, and then July and achieved rates were effectively flat. Now, that sounds great if you don't put that in context, and the context I would give you is 1 July was an easy comp. Last year, we actually dropped rates in July to increase our occupancy. And then two we've seen a shift in channel in July, where we've seen more tenants coming walking in and renting an effective through our highest camp, it's a highest price channel. So we're encouraged by July and especially the trend of going from being so negative in May to being flat in July, but I think that probably helps that will context there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Rose from Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here. Joe, you made the SmartStop preferred investment last October 150 million which had a $15 million add on future. Did you invest that in the quarter? Or do you have plans to buy October, which I think was the one year timeline?\nJoe Margolis: So, that's a decision SmartStop will make we can't force them to take that money, they have the option to take that money.\nMichael Bilerman: And your discussions with them will make that likely or unlikely, would you, which way are they going to draw that capital and do you have any sort of details and how the portfolio is trending?\nJoe Margolis: So SmartStop would be the appropriate folks to ask if they want to take the capital and I don't want to speak for them. And we do monitor their portfolio. And I think they're a mirror good manager and they're performing similar to other good managers in the country.\nMichael Bilerman: And how do you, when you look at the competitive landscape. What are you seeing from the larger institutionally owned platforms versus the smaller operators and what sort of opportunities but also challenges? Does that present and still a pretty dispersed set of owners in terms of the competitive landscape?\nJoe Margolis: It's a difficult question to answer, Michael, because there's not a lot of clarity as to how some of the real small folks are behaving. Really don't know what their occupancy rate sensors are until, they want to sell it and you can take a look at their financials. In general, when we see smaller operators either, because they want us to take over management of their stores or because they're putting their store for sale, we can do better than they can. It's just as simple as that. We can run the stores better, we can throw them up more, and we can get higher rates. And I don't think that has changed at all because of COVID. If anything, I think maybe because more customers are now accessing stores through the web, our advantages may have improved.\nMichael Bilerman: And then you said the yield on the mezz was in the five with a six one yield to maturity. Where you stand within the capital stack? And if you could talked a little bit about the per square foot sort of value, but can talk about the capital structure that the yield -- and I recognize rates are low, but they yield for mezz seems light. So maybe you can just talk through the dynamics a little bit.\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So, I can't really talk about capital status. The question I would ask, right -- it's a great question. What percentage are you? But, I can't really talk about that because I want to talk about part valuation of the portfolio. But if you think about self storage in a $53 a square foot number, it will tell you, we're in a pretty secure, very secure part of the capital stack. So...\nMichael Bilerman: So maybe just talking about that capital structure, without giving us the equity value, maybe just talk through how much debt is there? Is there other sort of loans that are outstanding, just to understand the pieces that are in front of you or behind you?\nJoe Margolis: So, there is about $100 million dollar first, there's our piece, and then there's a junior mezz of about $82 million, and then there's the equity. So, our loan to value is much lower than a traditional mezz where you would expect to see a higher interest rate.\nMichael Bilerman: Right, 82 of junior. So this thing's got to fall pretty dramatically for you to be in ownership position versus just getting repaid.\nJoe Margolis: Correct.\nMichael Bilerman: But you got to blow through that $82 million of junior mezz.\nJoe Margolis: That's correct.\nMichael Bilerman: And then, is there anything on the valet storage side that you've witnessed sort of during this pandemic? Is that increased at all? Are you finding that an increased competitive source at all, as people want to maybe just store their goods and let someone else grab it from them?\nJoe Margolis: I would not say, we seen an increased competition from valet during the pandemic. We've not observed that.\nMichael Bilerman: I certainly would want them to come into my home, but I just didn't know whether there was just given the movement of people, whether that was being used by others.\nJoe Margolis: Yes.\nMichael Bilerman: Thank you very much.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Michael.\nMichael Bilerman: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond, James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hey, good morning out there. On the external growth front, have you guys looked at any large portfolios lately, or just one-off? I know you mentioned you always look at extra growth opportunities. We did see a big portfolio transact recently curious if you looked at that one or if it's more of a focus on the one-off opportunities.\nJoe Margolis: We're an active acquirer every year of storage, and because of that, we're brought and we see every opportunity in the market. We underwrite them all. We look hard at them and we think that we can acquire in a creative fashion, we'll try to execute, and if not, we'll let it go. So, I feel confident saying that, we see and analyze everything that's out there.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. And then can you quantify NOI exposure to those six states that are prohibiting the rate increases? Is that similar or maybe identical to the I think 47% of NOI under option restrictions?\nJoe Margolis: It's much less than the 47%. I'm looking at the states now. I don't have a number for you. We can get back.\nJonathan Hughes: Yes.\nJoe Margolis: We will get that number to you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from a Mr. Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Just wanted to ask about new supply and kind of the pipeline, I guess the macro data still shows it being relatively elevated and kind of the future pipeline still high as well. So I'm just curious if you kind of think that that data is accurate or kind of overstate and what do you think it really takes to see the pipeline materially come down? Because I know, some of the starts and completions got delayed. But, it still seems like there's new projects going in, which sort of seems hard to think that they tenfold today but just curious on your thoughts moving forward?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So, macro data is always interesting. But it's important to remember that we're in a very, very micro market business. So, you know the facts, it's much more interesting where the stores are going than how many of them are going. So, if development turns off in a market that has been over supplied, that marker will recover, even if the macro data shows development is in other markets. So we see them macro data that's available it is a little overstated. It is also subject to delays. Even in non-COVID years. There's been substantial delays, I think they don't take projects off their list to get killed as quickly as they could. It's not a criticism. It's hard information we get. But I'm not disagreeing with your point that we're still in the development cycle, there still are going to be projects that are going to be delivered and it's still something we're going to have to operate through in many markets.\nSteve Sakwa: And I guess just maybe as a follow up, I mean, when would you expect kind of, I guess a sharper fall off of new supply in your sub markets? Is that more like the back half of '21 or we really looking more like at 22 at this point?\nJoe Margolis: I think it's going to be a gradual decline in deliveries across all markets is supposed to develop, it's going to fall off a cliff and there'll be no more development anymore.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time we have no further questions. Mr. Joe, would you like to have any last remarks?\nJoe Margolis: Yes, so thank you everyone for your interest. As I said earlier, we have some headwinds. We're battling through them. We will control, we can control and focus our efforts on enhancing shareholder value, regardless of what gets thrown at us. I hope everyone in their families are well. We will get through this and we want a better time soon. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you very much for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry, and Extra Space. I am incredibly thankful to our employees to help to continue to operate our stores, service our customers, grow our company, strengthen our balance sheet and to do all the day-to-day blocking and tackling, that allows us to optimize our performance. All these good work was done in unusual and sometimes difficult working situations and often with added personal and family stress and uncertainty. It is said that crises does not create character, but reveals character. And I could not be prouder of the character the Extra Space team has shown during these past several months. This quarter also presented a stark reminder of racial injustice in our country. Approximately 40% of our teammates are black or other people of color, and I am proud them recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent that's been a focus of our company for many years. It is not a new initiative. However, the tragic events of the last two months reinforced to me that Extra Space is a values-driven company with a great inclusive culture, we can do better. In response, we have enhanced our existing diversity and inclusion initiatives and have taken several concrete steps to improve as a company. These steps are consistent with our company values and I am committed and our response will not be limited to making statements or temporary steps, but we'll be continuing and substantive. Turning to our performance in the second quarter. Most importantly, we were able to grow FFO in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have started to see several positive trends on which Scott will provide further detail. Our platform is able to find and capture high-value customers. Rentals have normalized and vacates remain muted. As a result, our occupancy is at an all time high and prices have begun to move in the right direction. Where we can, we have resumed more normal pricing, operational practices and auctions. However, these positive trends should not obscure the macro and industry specific risks we still face. There are still uncertainties with respect to the course and length of the virus, its economic impact and its effect on consumers and their willingness to pay for storage. While our occupancy is at an all time high, until recently we have not been allowed to initiate the auction process in several markets, which represents approximately 47% of our same-store NOI. As a result at the end of June, approximately 150 basis points of our occupancy is from non-paying tenants due to delays in auction. By the end of July, this inflated occupancy increased to approximately 200 basis points. We are now moving forward with auctions in most states, but due to notice periods, actual auctions in several states won't begin until September, which will be outside of the peak-leasing season for re-tenanting these units. Occupancy has also benefited from lower-than-normal vacant. I do not personally believe that, the moderation in vacates represents a permanent behavioral shift of our customers. Instead, at some point, more historically normal activity will resume and we will see vacates increase, putting further pressure on occupancy, when we may not have our full set of tools available to optimize returns, due to government state emergency orders or regulations. Also the non-COVID headwinds that we had coming into 2020 are still present. While we believe the pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects and planning, properties are still being delivered, and there is still excess inventory leasing up in many markets, which is depressing rate growth. So, while we are encouraged by recent results, there are enough remaining uncertainties and risks that we are not in a position to reinstate guidance. The possible outcomes remain too broad for guidance to be meaningful, depending on how the risks I've outlined play out. We will continue to be transparent on all metrics and answer questions that you may have, and we will continue to work hard every day and remain laser-focused on maximizing shareholders long-term value. And now, I'd like to wish Scott a happy birthday and turn the time over him to walk through some of the metrics that I mentioned. So, we do see delays in delivery of new product. One of the reasons -- well, we did have a good quarter with respect to new properties taken into our management platform, it was a little less than anticipated because some projects were delayed and won't be taken on until later in the year, but we absolutely are both experiencing and seeing delays and new products being delivered. The markets that we're concerned with are still the same markets that we were concerned with before. It's the Texas and Florida, Boroughs of New York City and some markets like that. There really COVID hasn't changed the markets that are faced with supply versus the ones. So, there's six states now where we're prohibited from issuing existing customer rate increase notices, and a few of those States, we have some meaningful exposure to, and then there's another 14 States where our ability is limited to a certain percentage and in some case that percentage is so high, it's a meaningless limit. So far as we have re-instituted existing customer rate increase notices, we have not seen any change in behavior. We've not seen increased move out in response to those notices. Although I would also caution you it's something we're closely monitoring and we're probably still early in that game. We're interested to see what happens when the additional unemployment insurance runs out factors like that. So something we're watching closely, Smedes. Sure. So it's absolutely a portfolio of 64 self storage assets. You know, they're in markets that overlay our footprint and as with any loan we make, if we end up having to own the assets, we're fully capable of operating them and adding value, and that's not a negative experience for us. So, we are always looking for opportunities to smartly invest our shareholders' money in creative position with the good risk posture. Our position in the first year is about $53 a square foot. So we feel pretty good about that. We think we're getting a fair return and we're very comfortable with the risk posture of the investment. So, I can't tell you we were perfect. We certainly did things and learned lessons that we will apply in the future. One thing that I will tell you that a company like Extra Space that has a large portfolio has an advantage is we don't have to guess too much things. So as we were going, was we were faced with many of these new situations. We very quickly tried different things in a test basis in several hundred stores and learned what worked and what didn't. So we didn't have to make kind of final decisions for the whole portfolio. And that was very beneficial, because we were faced with new customer situation, new customer behavior. We were able to quickly get to what performs best. And we'll certainly take those lessons with us in the future, and also take our testing culture and approach to new situations with us as well. I agree with you, I think we don't know. I think we're in a new situation. And we don't know, if there will be steady leasing if there is pent up demand or if we'll see the more traditional leasing patterns. And it's one of the reasons we're uncomfortable providing guidance on what's going to happen for the rest of the year, because there are these unknowns. So, we have, one of the negatives of the delayed auction is the opportunity costs to nothing ever get the unit back. So we actually absolutely will try where we can to work with our tenants, and make some arrangement where they turn this, the unit back to us, so we can we can have it. But the majority of the units have to go through the auction process. We won't get them back until late in the third quarter. And at that point, we'll have to return to them. And kind of similar to Jeff's question earlier, we'll see what the environment is done to do so. One thing we see across other asset classes is when the government tells you, you don't have to pay, or the government tells you there's no penalties, if you don't have to pay. Some people just choose not to do so. Well, we would hope that, these restrictions would be lifted and we can go back to our normal operating practice with prospective ECRI auctions. But, we don't control that. So, our job is to control what we can control and maximize performance and follow the line in other place. Yes. I think, there's going to be a number of stores that were not stabilized that the owner or the lender or the equity investor is going to force some type of capital event. So I would say, yes. I guess part of my answer is I would say it Extra Space, we're always trying new things. We're always testing, innovating, trying to make the tools a little sharper and seeing what works. As I said earlier, I think we've learned a lot through this experience, some of which may be the permanent lessons and some may just be temporary. We are seeing more return to normal in terms of customer behavior. So for example our walking traffic has improved significantly. And that's an important metric that we look at and govern some of our behavior. So, we have not approved a new C of O deal certainly in 2020, maybe even for 12 months. I'd have to think about that, but we have certainly not approved a new C of O deal in 2020. The just, pricing doesn't seem to make sense for us now. The rate, the base rate on our note is 5.5% and the yield to maturity is 6.1% on the C of O deal. Some observations we can make. We are seeing higher AR at stores that are in markets with lower household income and also at stores, if there's more cash paying customers as opposed to credit cards. But the biggest impact is if you kind of get the trifecta of lower household income, lots of cash paying customers, and you're in a state where we can option that's where we have the highest. So I would say we're seeing good demand across our portfolio. And if there is that trend, it is probably too early to tell. But one of the advantages of having a broadly diversified portfolio across a lot of primary and secondary are urban and suburban, however you want to characterize them growth, Mark, you know, we should be in a good balanced position to benefit from that if it occurs. So, that's a decision SmartStop will make we can't force them to take that money, they have the option to take that money. So SmartStop would be the appropriate folks to ask if they want to take the capital and I don't want to speak for them. And we do monitor their portfolio. And I think they're a mirror good manager and they're performing similar to other good managers in the country. It's a difficult question to answer, Michael, because there's not a lot of clarity as to how some of the real small folks are behaving. Really don't know what their occupancy rate sensors are until, they want to sell it and you can take a look at their financials. In general, when we see smaller operators either, because they want us to take over management of their stores or because they're putting their store for sale, we can do better than they can. It's just as simple as that. We can run the stores better, we can throw them up more, and we can get higher rates. And I don't think that has changed at all because of COVID. If anything, I think maybe because more customers are now accessing stores through the web, our advantages may have improved. Yes. So, I can't really talk about capital status. The question I would ask, right -- it's a great question. What percentage are you? But, I can't really talk about that because I want to talk about part valuation of the portfolio. But if you think about self storage in a $53 a square foot number, it will tell you, we're in a pretty secure, very secure part of the capital stack. So... So, there is about $100 million dollar first, there's our piece, and then there's a junior mezz of about $82 million, and then there's the equity. So, our loan to value is much lower than a traditional mezz where you would expect to see a higher interest rate. Correct. That's correct. I would not say, we seen an increased competition from valet during the pandemic. We've not observed that. Yes. Thanks, Michael. We're an active acquirer every year of storage, and because of that, we're brought and we see every opportunity in the market. We underwrite them all. We look hard at them and we think that we can acquire in a creative fashion, we'll try to execute, and if not, we'll let it go. So, I feel confident saying that, we see and analyze everything that's out there. It's much less than the 47%. I'm looking at the states now. I don't have a number for you. We can get back. We will get that number to you. Yes. So, macro data is always interesting. But it's important to remember that we're in a very, very micro market business. So, you know the facts, it's much more interesting where the stores are going than how many of them are going. So, if development turns off in a market that has been over supplied, that marker will recover, even if the macro data shows development is in other markets. So we see them macro data that's available it is a little overstated. It is also subject to delays. Even in non-COVID years. There's been substantial delays, I think they don't take projects off their list to get killed as quickly as they could. It's not a criticism. It's hard information we get. But I'm not disagreeing with your point that we're still in the development cycle, there still are going to be projects that are going to be delivered and it's still something we're going to have to operate through in many markets. I think it's going to be a gradual decline in deliveries across all markets is supposed to develop, it's going to fall off a cliff and there'll be no more development anymore. Yes, so thank you everyone for your interest. As I said earlier, we have some headwinds. We're battling through them. We will control, we can control and focus our efforts on enhancing shareholder value, regardless of what gets thrown at us. I hope everyone in their families are well. We will get through this and we want a better time soon. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and hello everyone. All of our properties are open and have been fully operating since May. We modified our stores by adding plexiglass partitions, stantions to direct the flow of traffic and sanitation stations to provide a safer experience for our customers and our employees. These updates have been effective and as demand started to pick up through the quarter. Our rentals rebounded improving from a negative 35% year-over-year delta in April to a positive 4% rental growth rate in June. Vacates for the quarter were approximately 17% lower year-over-year, resulting in strong occupancy growth, which went from a negative 60 basis point year-over-year gap at the end of April to a positive 100 basis point gap at the end of the quarter. At the end of July, this has expanded to 150 basis points. However, this increased occupancy came at a price. Our average achieved rate for the quarter was down approximately 17%. and as Joe mentioned, our quarter end occupancy was inflated by 150 basis points from non-paying customers. In May, we restarted our collection efforts, which have been successful. Accounts receivable less than 60 days have dropped back to historical levels; however, due to the delayed auctions and in key states such as California, New Jersey and New York, we are still working accounts receivable greater than 60 days through the system. Today, accounts receivable greater than 60 days as a percentage of rental income are running approximately 325 basis points higher than historical levels, and we have recognized a loss on aged accounts receivable based on estimated collections. All of these factors together with temporarily pausing existing customer rate increases in March, April and May will continue to drag on revenue growth in the back half of the year. While street rates and rental activity have improved significantly, it will take time for the impact of May and June's lower achieved rates to flow through to revenue. And we do not anticipate positive same-store revenue growth in the second half of the year. While we are being proactive with controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, we will continue to have expense pressure from payroll, property taxes and marketing expense. Property level performance will continue to be challenged in the back half of the year, but we are finding success in other parts of the business and have strengthened our balance sheet. We continue to find ways to grow externally and to accretively deploy capital in the self storage space. We have closed 52 million in bridge loans year-to-date with another $170 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. In July, we purchased a $103 million senior mezzanine note at a discount with an anticipated yield to maturity of 6.1%. Our third-party management platform provides capital light growth, providing management fees and tenant insurance driving non same-store income. We are also vigilantly pursuing acquisition opportunities and will act swiftly when we identify transactions that we believe add value to our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the addition of a new $300 million revolving credit facility and the closing of a $425 million private placement transaction during the quarter. Funds from the private placement transaction will be taken through delayed draw to pay-off our convertible notes and will increase our weighted-average debt maturity. As Joe mentioned, we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our business. That said, it is good to be in storage and our company is well-positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent high-level execution, and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. With that, let's turn it over to Oran to start our Q&A. Thanks, Rick. So our bad debt has historically run at 1.6% to 1.8% of our revenue. During the quarter, our bad debt expense was about 50% higher than that. And that primarily has to do with the older accounts receivable and the things that have gone to auction. Our policy is to reserve for the majority of all accounts receivable that are 90 days or more past due. So much of what's in the 60 days and certainly almost all of what's in the 90 days or more past due has already flown through bad debt. So, we would -- I think July will be a little bit higher, but we would expect it to normalize going forward. And what we're basing that on is, if you look at our zero to 68 ARs, they're backing historical norms, they're not continuing to grow. So assuming that continues, that trend continues those 0 to 60 become your 60 plus, if they were not paying. And so, the fact that they've gone back to historical norms, hopefully, everything else goes back to historical norms from here. So by the end of July, you've recognized majority of your bad debt related to this. Todd, our recoveries have actually been slightly better than the historical norm. No. We'll see if that continues, but that's been our experience so far on the auctions that have happened. Some of these people might just be choosing not to pay and so they may just be paying late versus having a true problem. I don't know for sure. That's some of our speculation. So first of all, I think just to clarify one thing that AR the majority of that has a large majority of that has already been written off. So you basically reserved for it in the second quarter, once they hit that 60 to 90 days, especially the 90-day accounts receivable have been reserved for. So we don't expect that to be a negative in the third quarter to the degree it was in the second quarter. We do expect those units coming back online to be a potential headwind for us. I mean, we always hope for and we have confidence in our team in our systems that we're going to get every dollar we can optimize performance, but I would tell you there's enough uncertainties in macro economy and other factors that we can't say for certain now. Samir, the other thing I would maybe add there is, they're not necessarily additive in a normal year, but in a year like this, where they are going to be below average, if you have certain states that either don't allow them or allow them to a limited amount, it does make it difficult to continue to grow your revenues, especially for customers who came in at a level significantly below street rate. It's difficult for us to move them more quickly to the average rate there. Yes. So, the payroll cost comes, the pressure on payroll comes more from a tough count from last year. Our payroll was actually very low last year in wonderful quarters, I believe we were negative. So, it's the tough comps, is the main comment there. In terms of what we're looking at and, we think our managers are important, we think they're an important part of the sales process. We're always looking for opportunities to go touch less and deliver our customers the product in the manner that they would like to consume it. So, the example I would give you is pre-COVID. I think most people enjoyed working with a manager like their managers they were very successful in leasing units. Since this has happened, we've gone to a touch less process where your Managers are involved via telephone. And we have expanded that even further where they can do a complete rental online at 3 am with no manager involvement, and that's at, I believe, about 1200 of our stores as of today. So we continue to evolve that. So I'll clarify in my remarks. I didn't mean to give the impression we are more actively pursuing acquisitions. We're always pursuing acquisitions. We're always looking for ways to smartly grow this company. And we're lucky to be in a great capital position where we have plenty of capital of all different sorts to pursue any acquisition that we think makes sense. The acquisition market has been somewhat muted in terms of things coming to the market and particularly things that seem to make sense for us. But we're always trying to find smart ways to present a good risk profile for us to grow the Company. So whether that's acquisitions, acquisitions adventures, reinvesting in our existing properties through expansions, a bridge loans, buying the mezz loan that we just bought. We're just going to try to be smart allocators of capital So I don't think pricing has moved for stabilized properties, and there's not a ton of cost out there, but if you have a stabilized self storage asset, it's going to attract in a good market. It's going to attract they're very low cap rate because people understand the stability of cash flow that comes from the self storage assets, rates are low and the alternatives are, are not as good. So I think, cap rates are still low. What is much more difficult to say is on a lease of asset. One's view of the Cap rate depends on one's view of the timing and rate on which you can lease up that store and people can have very, very different views of what that is. And I would say pricing is uncertain. We did not -- let me just kind of give you a little history of the rates through the quarter and how they progressed. Negative 10% in April, negative 20% in May, misses are achieved rates, negative 16% in June, and then July and achieved rates were effectively flat. Now, that sounds great if you don't put that in context, and the context I would give you is 1 July was an easy comp. Last year, we actually dropped rates in July to increase our occupancy. And then two we've seen a shift in channel in July, where we've seen more tenants coming walking in and renting an effective through our highest camp, it's a highest price channel. So we're encouraged by July and especially the trend of going from being so negative in May to being flat in July, but I think that probably helps that will context there."

First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Jeff Norman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead sir.\nJeff Norman: Thank you Daniel. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call.

Good morning and good afternoon to everyone and thank you for your interest in Extra Space. Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020 I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that every one of us has had our daily routines interrupted, stress put on our lives and may have dealt with the illness of family and friends. I sympathize with the difficulties everyone has endured and greatly appreciate the professionalism, positive attitudes and support shown by everyone on this call. At times of crisis reveal our true nature and our industry can be very proud of itself. I hope you and your loved ones are well, healthy and managing through this. Secondly, I'm frequently asked what makes Extra Space different or special. In response I describe our portfolio, our operating and technology platforms and most importantly our people. While all of these have performed well during this crisis it is our people, particularly our store managers, who have really stepped up and delivered in an extraordinary manner. All of our employees regardless of role or region of the country have adapted quickly to changing operating procedures and requirements and have gone to great efforts to keep our stores open and our customers safe and all of this was done while they were under the same personal stress and worry that we all are feeling. I could not be prouder of the people who make up Extra Space and feel extremely lucky to be part of such a great team. I know that whatever challenges lie ahead this team will strive to optimize performance while upholding Extra Space's values. With respect to performance, Q1 was a strong quarter. Even with the impact of COVID-19 in the latter part of March property revenue for the quarter was in line with expectations and same-store revenue growth was 1.9%. Core FFO per share growth was 6.9%, $0.04 higher than the top end of our guidance. We continue to see strong external growth through third-party management with 48 stores added to the platform and in bridge loan activity. External growth through acquisitions is currently muted as we patiently wait for opportunities that present attractive risk reward metrics. Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have been in contact with all of our lenders and partners and we are very comfortable to we have sufficient capital options to satisfy upcoming maturities as well as having additional capacity to be opportunistic if attractive investments become available in this unusual environment. We are proud of our strong start to the year and while we are fortunate that we have been able to keep our stores open, execute new leases and continue to provide our customers access to their belongings, we certainly have not been immune to the impacts of COVID-19. The financial impact of the changes to our operations caused by the pandemic such as the decision to pause auctions, temporarily suspend existing customer rent increases and a reduction in rental activity due to stay-at-home orders create a wide range of possible FFO outcomes some of which fall outside of our initial guidance. While we considered simply revising our annual guidance range we recognized that in order to provide accurate guidance one key driver impacting all primary revenue assumptions is the timing of lifting stay-at-home orders across the country and subsequent customer behavior. We are encouraged by the activity we see in markets like Detroit, Salt Lake City and most impactful to our portfolio multiple California markets where rental activity is improving but the uncertainty of when other major markets like New York City will reopen and how customers will respond in such dense urban markets reduces our performance visibility for the balance of the year. Therefore, since these key factors remain unclear and will vary from market to market we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance that would reasonably capture the full span of possibilities. It would also encourage us to produce guidance that may be overly cautious in order to include even remote possibilities. However, we believe it is important to be transparent with the information that we have to help our investors understand our company and the sector so they can make informed decisions. As we provide point-in-time metrics we urge you not to lose sight of the big picture. It is still a very good time to be invested in storage. Demand for our need-based product while temporarily slowed will continue. The life transitions that have made demand so durable in the past will continue. The advantages over smaller operators with our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and top-notch team are still in place. Our balance sheet quality is better than ever and external growth opportunities will likely increase going forward. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of those metrics in more detail.\nScott Stubbs: Thank You Joe and hello everyone. To understand our current operating trends it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March we further expanded our positive year-over-year occupancy Delta to 90 basis points while also increasing achieved rate. By early March our achieve rate for flat is slightly positive on a year-over-year basis. Beginning in mid-March stay at home orders caused a gradual reduction in rental activity. This was partially offset by increased college student rentals. However, as more orders were issued across the country the reduction in rentals and vacates increased significantly. Rentals were down 35% to 40% for the 30 days from mid-March to mid-April partially offset by vacates which were down approximately 25% during the same period. Over the last 15 days of April, rental velocity improved with 25 of our top 30 markets experiencing an increase in rental velocity compared to the previous 30 days. While rental volume has been down it is primarily due to lower walk-in traffic which is expected. Web traffic remains steady indicating that people are still looking for storage. Occupancy as of April 30th was 91.1% which is 60 basis points lower than this time last year but still very healthy. To give you some context occupancy at the end of the first quarter in 2008 was 84.1%. Our ability to acquire customers is significantly better today than leading up to the financial crisis and we believe we'll be able to continue to drive traffic to our properties and to maximize revenue. In April achieved rate for new rentals were down approximately 10% year-over-year. In March, we postponed sending existing customer rate increases which is having an adverse impact on our revenue growth. As municipalities lift stay-at-home orders we are resuming rate increases market by market. We collected 93% of rent in April and this is down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis for the same store pool due to increased accounts receivable and causing auctions. It is important to note that these levels were attained without making collection calls for aggressive following up with past new accounts from mid-March until the end of April. We have resumed these practices in May and we expect accounts receivable balances to decline. As Joe mentioned while we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent high-level execution and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. With that let's turn it over to Daniel to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi everyone, this is actually Alua Askarbek for Jeff today. Thank you for taking my questions. So just wondering if you could give any expectations or color on the third-party management platform in the near term? Are you expecting to see that to continue to grow or have you seen some declines in interest in the past few weeks? Anything on that would be great.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thank you for the question. So we had a great first quarter for our third-party management platform. We added 48 stores. We saw 18 stores leave the platform. So a net increase of 30. We added 12 in April. We had scheduled to add 19 but we're seeing some delays and one trend that we are seeing is that we're seeing less interest from new development as new development waned but more interest from owners of existing leased stores. So we expect to continue to grow that platform and have a very positive year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just one quick question, just your commentary on the share repurchase program. are you guys planning to continue that right now or do you think that's going to be paused for a little bit? \nJoe Margolis: We are proud that we are good allocators of capital and I think you can see that historically if you look at the timing of when we were heavy in the acquisition market, when we participated heavily in new development through C/Os and when we pull back and when we issued equity. Buying back shares is another allocation of capital decision and we will continually consider it in comparison to our other investment options.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Parker Decraene with Citi. Your line is now open. \nParker Decraene: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here. I wanted to ask you some on the occupancy side. The 911 at the end of April does that include the tenants that are in there but on delinquent status or I guess there's an economic occupancy or not?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. The occupancy as of the end of April does include all tenants that are in our properties and it includes about 20 basis points of occupancy for the month and a half of paused auctions.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then from a collectability standpoint, can you share anything I guess, so far in May, I don't know how much you have on autopay versus actual physical check?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So our autopay is about 65% of our tenants so almost two-thirds of our tenants are on autopay. So those continue to pay automatically. It's that other about 90% of our customers pay with a credit card and that other 25% are the ones that typically call in each month with a credit card or we reach out to them. So the month of May as well as question for the month of April we'll start reaching out to those tenants if they have not paid. So we're expecting to collect a large portion of those ARs that are current, 30 days.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Hello out there. You talked about reinstating the existing customer rate increase program some like market by market. Can you give us a kind of broader scope of how much is coming back online and how much you expect have come back online by end of the year?\nJoe Margolis: So we will resume in and are resuming our existing customer rate increase program market by market as they open up subject to governmental restrictions on that. So whether we can have it fully resumed by the end of the year is totally a function of when markets open up and government activity and frankly it's one reason we don't have enough transparency to give guidance.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And do you think as you open up certain markets, do you think the demand from people who couldn't use it that will come back out and start using sale stores will be greater than perhaps of people who were waiting to pull out their belongings from those storage units? Which one do you think will kind of went out when market start to open up?\nJoe Margolis: So we don't have a ton of data and I don't want to give you kind of what I think. So what I can tell you is based on the last two weeks of April. In 25 of our 30 markets we saw improvement in rental activity while vacates stayed flat. Now that's two weeks. We are encouraged by that but we're being patient to see how the situation plays out over time.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you Kim\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Metz: Hey guys, hey Joe just for clarity the move out activity you were saying was flat on a year-over-year basis here. So no additional churn from that kind of activity. But just to clarify.\nJoe Margolis: No, vacates, there was no change in vacate activity from say mid March to early April as compared to the last two weeks of April where -- if you look at mid March to early April on the rental side to the last two weeks of April there was significant improvement. So it's not year-over-year, it's how things are changing as we get deeper into this situation.\nJeremy Metz: Got it. Okay. So there may still be some pent up move outs in that. All right. So I was just wondering if you could talk the expense side a little bit? Any opportunity to mitigate some cost we should be thinking about and I guess on the other side I guess there isn\u2019t probably on taxes at this point and in terms what's the latest on marketing? I'm guessing that's still the main tool you're going to be using to help drive demand here. So should we expect understand an elevated level or even perhaps increase here in the second quarter?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. if you look at the first quarter and look at which expensive line items were elevated the ones that pop out to your payroll, marketing and then property taxes I think property taxes are pretty close to what we are expecting and we expect them to be somewhat elevated but as if revenues fall then you potentially get some reprieve but that typically lags by as much as a year or two. In terms of payroll part of the reason it is elevated in Q1 this year is it's a tough comp. Q1 last year we actually had negative 4% payroll growth and so very difficult comp. We would expect payroll to continue to be elevated more at inflationary call at 3% to 4% but not necessarily at that 7% range. We did not see a benefit from lower staffing or anything of the sort in the first quarter as we continued to pay our employees as our stores were open. The last one is really marketing and our marketing expense in the first quarter is elevated partly due to a tough comp from last year. So we started increasing our marketing spend in the second quarter of last year and it was elevated throughout the year and we continued spending at that elevated level into the Q1 of this year. So Q1 of this year had a very tough comp from last year and we expect to continue to use marketing this year but I don't think you'll see the elevated spent quarter over quarter for the remainder of the year that you saw in Q1 of this year.\nJeremy Metz: Okay. And then last one Joe, you guys have always been pretty acquisitive and on the on your opening remarks you mentioned being positioned to be opportunistic. I guess opportunities arise, I guess when we look at supply that's in the markets already been weighing on fundamental before they should look at the potential drag here from the pandemic into the busy season. I guess how big is your actual appetite to take on additional lease-up in the form of potential distress opportunities?\nJoe Margolis: So we are lucky in that we are not constrained by capital. So between internal capital sources and partners capital we can take advantage of any opportunity that makes sense. So the limiting factor in my mind is going to be are there good deals that we can appropriately understand the risks and get rewarded for it. If we can identify those deals we have various sources of capital to execute on them and not limited by some target number\nJeremy Metz: All right. Thanks for the time.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you Jeremy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. \nTodd Thomas: Thank you. First question, just following up on the comments made around rentals in the 25 markets where you're seeing improvements sites. I think your comment was that move-ins in the final two weeks of April or higher compared to the prior 30 days so the mid-March to mid-April period. Can you comment on rentals during the last two weeks or 15 days in April and what that was on a year-over-year basis?\nScott Stubbs: I am sorry. I am not sure I followed the question. \nTodd Thomas: I think your comments around rentals improving in 25 of 30 markets you commented that you're seeing improvements. I think that was relative to the prior 30-day period and I'm just curious if you can help us understand how move-ins rentals trended on a year-over-year basis just against the down 35% move-in activity that you saw, that you spoke about just so we can understand sort of the trajectory and kind of the trend and magnitude of rental activity?\nJoe Margolis: Okay. So I apologize for making you repeat that. So I'll give you a couple of examples and maybe that will help you. And if I'm not answering your question let me know. So take San Diego for example. From mid-March to early April San Diego we were down 31% in rentals. In the last two weeks of April we were down 1%. So that's significant improvement. We saw similar improvement in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Dallas and that's encouraging to us. The flip side of that is if you look at Washington DC and that kind of  Washington to Baltimore Corridor we saw no improvement. We had the same experience kind of early in the crisis as we did in the last two weeks of April.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. So in some of the markets those 25 markets or so where you're seeing improvements are in San Diego on a year-over-year basis rentals are almost flat?\nJoe Margolis: San Diego, yes.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Got it. And then look I understand the environment is unpredictable today but normally you'd be gaining occupancy at this point in the peak leasing season and it's falling backwards understandably in March and then at the end of April. Do you think it's possible that you might not see sequential occupancy improvements at all from April levels in May, June or July during this peak leasing season or would you expect to see some occupancy improvements over the course of the next couple of months?\nJoe Margolis: So I think it's important to remember that occupancy is not our goal. Our goal is revenue and occupancy is one tool along with rate and advertising spend and discount and if we can maximize revenue by driving occupancies up then the system can do that. If we can maximize revenue by losing a little occupancy or staying where we are then this system can do that.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And just one last one for Scott. Following up on the existing customer rate increase program if we think back to the original guidance how much of the 0.75% to 1.75% same store revenue growth that you forecasted was attributable to rate increases and I guess some of that growth is really earned in for the year. So customers that received increases in \u201819 and also early this year that do not leave. So how much this year's revenue growth was from the ECRI program and how much of that do you think could be impacted in 2020?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. so I think that's really the difficult question and one of the reasons we pulled guidance is one is the occupancy in the summer as well as how long are we on pause in terms of our existing customer rate increases. In terms of historically how is it added it actually is added between 10 and 30 basis points to our annual growth rate. It's not a significant driver because we do it on a year-over-year basis. Now where it could hurt you this year for instance is if we have to pause these for months on end. Now if this pause happens for a month or two it's obviously impacts us but it's much less than if we pause them for five or six months and so that's obviously one of the big reasons why we elected not to update our guidance and pull our guidance..\nTodd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. I wanted to just ask a couple of quick questions. Scott, I wanted to clarify I think you said that in April rates on new rentals were down 10%. Is that correct?\nScott Stubbs: That is correct.\nSteve Sakwa: And could you just maybe give us some comparison -- maybe what was it in the first quarter and any sense as to how you think that may trend kind of moving forward? Have achieved rates dropped further to create perhaps a bigger gap moving forward or have street rates kind of held firm?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Start of the year we were slightly negative on our achieved rates. By the 1st of March we were slightly positive. So they were trending in the right way before the stay-at-home orders and before the outbreak of the COVID-19. In April, we were negative 10%. I think that we will continue to adjust rates and marketing spend as we look to maximize revenue. So rate is obviously always a factor. We will continue to test to try to figure out the best rate but if rentals stay down, if occupancy stays down and our model shows that rate is the best thing to adjust we will adjust rate.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then maybe a question for you or Joe, just on your kind of lending program, I'm just sort of curious the activity level and opportunity that you see and I guess any distress kind of brewing on kind of lease-ups and when might those manifest themselves in opportunities? \nJoe Margolis: With respect to the lending program we see increase in opportunities, as I guess other for one thing other lenders have gone to the sidelines and more owners are seeking a bridge to better times. So last year we did nine loans for a $104 million gross. This year we closed three and approved 10 for $133 million \u2013 $134 million and we have a very strong pipeline. So we see the loan program is a good growth opportunity for us.\nSteve Sakwa: And then just anything on the distressed side in terms of kind of C/O deals or lease-ups kind of not performing well and do you think that some of those might manifest themselves acquisition opportunities this year? Do you think it kind of holds off into \u201821?\nJoe Margolis: I think we will see those opportunities this year. It's a little early to say that there's been a flood of those but I think there is stress in the market and we are going to see a good number of those opportunities and we'll look at each of them individually and see if we think it makes sense for us.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That's it for me.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Lumb with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.\nRyan Lumb: Hi thanks. Are you able to share what the paid search trends have been like so far in the second quarter all of this sort of assuming that online traffic has fallen in recent weeks? \nA - Joe Margolis: So I would not assume online traffic has fallen in recent weeks. It's actually been pretty steady throughout this and costs have been fairly flat.\nRyan Lumb: Sure. So that to assume that conversion rates have fallen a bit? \nJoe Margolis: Correct.\nRyan Lumb: Interesting. Okay. And then last question, has there any changes been made to compensation for store level employees in light of recent events? \nJoe Margolis: So we have a great team out there and we pay our managers above minimum wage and give them incentives to sign leases and when the crisis hit we first took all necessary steps to keep them safe. We originally closed our stores and we're doing no contact leases. We're in the process of going to kind of phase two of that with Plexiglass protection and being able to open our offices but and we provided paid time for people whose stores were closed by government mandate. We provided some relief pay for employees who were ill or had to take care of loved ones. So we feel we did the right things by our employees. We did not need to pay them more or issue hazard pay or something like that to keep them engaged in working and we've recently done a survey and continued to have over 80% positive engagement stores from our work force. So I think they've done a great job through this and it's been beneficial to us to develop such a great work force and have such great relationships with them and that's benefited us through this crisis.\nRyan Lumb: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. \nTodd Stender: So thanks guys. Hope you're all well. Can you talk about your collection strategy right now? Just under normal conditions, I think the threat of having the tenants property auctioned off pretty quickly keeps tenants in check but without that or if you, I guess if you soften that stance right now, how do you balance that collecting versus showing some degree of flexibility?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. so we obviously are going to try to focus on our customer first and so our decision to do this was very customer focused and recognizing that they're feeling some strain as they're staying at home, as you've had people stick around them a lot of fear and so our decision was to move away from auctions to pause those and then also to move away from collection calls. We did do some reminder calls letting people know but starting the first part of May as things open up we are moving back to auctions. So as States open up following the State mandates we will open up auctions with it if it's allowed. We will try to work first to pay to vacate a unit. So you'll try to work with a customer to take get whatever we can to have them vacate versus moving to auction. It's a better experience and we will now begin more of a collection call versus a collection reminder or a payment reminder where you are calling now and instead of saying your rent is due we saying your rent is due and do you have a credit card. So just a little bit more proactive in that manner.\nTodd Stender: Alright. That's helpful and you're still acquiring C of O deals, some wholly owned, some JV. You probably were using your underwriting methodology as of a couple months ago. So has anything changed? Would you be expecting a longer duration to get to a stabilized occupancy at this point? Any changes on maybe the underwriting?\nJoe Margolis: So we have eight C/Os in our pipeline for to close in 2020 and 2021. Five of those will do in joint ventures which both reduces our exposure and increases our return through management fee and tenant insurance. Our underwriting evolved as the development cycle got deeper and there was more new competition in these markets and certainly if we saw a new deal now we haven't approved one since COVID-19 but certainly if we saw one now I think it would be very hard for us to approve -- underwriting approved but underwriting would change as well.\nTodd Stender: Thank you. \nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thank you Todd.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nMike Mueller: Yes. Hi. Coming back to the April rents being down 10% year-over-year, I just want to clarify that you did say before that at the beginning of the year, they were modestly positive. Is that the right comparison so before this they were mostly positive and now about down 10% in April? Was that correct? \nJoe Margolis: Correct. They were slightly negative at the start of the year. By the 1st of March they were slightly positive and then down about 10% in April.\nMike Mueller: Okay. And how did the actual move-in rate to dollar amount compared to the dollar amount moving out? \nScott Stubbs: So if you look at our current in-place rent versus the rents that are moving in, there is a negative that always depends on the time of year and in the summer months that negative amount is different than in January, February. Now the other thing I would caution you on when you compare those is that assumes that everyone moves out on average whereas we see more churn much -- more churn in our short-term customers. Our median length of stay is about six months versus a average length of stay of everyone that's moved in and moved out of about 16 months. And so if you look at someone who moved in five months ago and they are the ones that move out it is much different than someone that moved in and moved out two years ago or three years ago.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And I guess on the bridge loans can you just talk about the pricing what sort of rates are you achieving on that?\nScott Stubbs: So our whole loans are currently priced LIBOR plus 400 to LIBOR plus 500 with the LIBOR floor I think this smallest floor was 50 to 150 basis points and then the return to Extra Space is based on as we sell or place a piece or the first piece return starts our LIBOR plus 900 plus in addition to that we manage the properties and get tenant insurance.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey just two quick questions for me. One was on sort of the opening comments about sort of the college students in 1Q just curious what percent of the portfolio is exposed sort of those college students then? Is there a way to sort of quantify what that benefit could be 1Q or even in other market they're clearly may be more exposed than others? Any color there would be appreciated. \nJoe Margolis: Yes. So our portfolio has low teens in terms of exposure to college students. So it's 12% to 15%. In terms of the benefit from those students the effective we got an extra month or two from them and you're talking 1/12th or 1/10th of 12%. So it's really not impactful not a big benefit.\nRonald Kamdem: That's helpful and then the second question was just sort of a similar but moving on sort of the small business and the business customer. Just how are they faring? What are you hearing from them? How is this environment sort of impacting them? Thanks so much.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thank you. We really don't have a lot of data to show any difference in behavior in our business tenant. So I think it's just a little too early to tell but so far they seem to be behaving just like our retail tenants.\nMike Mueller: Okay. That's it from me.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Parker Decraene with Citi. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. It's Michael Bilerman again. I guess just taking out in the last comment I'm surprised that there isn't a bigger difference between the business and just the straight customer individual because I would have thought a lot of businesses event people may be storing things. There's no events going on, so then may be the [indiscernible] but I would have thought there would have in a higher level of delinquency and you're maybe business side versus your individual side?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. Michael I can't tell you what we're going to see but we're pretty early in this. We are one or two months in and can the business pay 150 bucks for a month to see if they can hang on or do whatever. So far we haven't seen it. I don't know if we will see it in the future. I don't know if government checks are helping but we just don't see that yet.\nScott Stubbs: They often will be on auto pay also Michael and so it could be later that you see something like that. So we just have not seen it at this level yet. A lot of them are sole proprietors too.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right, and I guess the May collections -- the May has there been any difference in what you're seeing in the first five days of the month versus April?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Ours is a little different Michael in that we're anniversary dates. So we've really only seen five days or a small portion of the month whereas many operators are first a month. So they get a better idea of collections early on. So ours is a very small sample size.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. Now is there anything in that 500 basis points of people who didn't pay? Are you able to break that down by region on the type of unit by whether there was -- how much of it was the lack of being able to do an auction just getting more granular on the people who didn't pay your rent.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. We break it down by 0 to 30, 30 to 60 and 60 and greater and the ones that we typically cracked and we're more aggressive on are 30 plus day one. 0 to 30 most of those pay. We also have been lenient --\nUnidentified Analyst: [indiscernible] where they are right. So of that delinquency was there any regional impact? Was there any type of unit impact large units versus smaller units? Just trying to get more granular on your national portfolio or certain regions like what's going on in California, where the moratoriums, no evictions have told people -- consumer trends not have to pay?\nScott Stubbs: The biggest trend I would tell you would be more cash payments versus credit card payments, meaning a store that is 95% credit card obviously is going to have less delinquencies than somewhere that is 60% cash payments and those typically are, we have obviously fewer of those stores but that's probably the biggest trend I'd point to.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then just thinking about the cadence of same-store NOI in terms of its components of revenue and expenses and I totally understand of why you'd want to pull guidance given you're in a short lease duration sector and there's a lot of uncertainty and you don't want to be too aggressive nor do you want to be too conservative but the industry just from an occupancy perspective is at a very different level because the industry has moved their occupancy levels up higher than they've ever been before, right. And even you go back to the GFC, you guys are running in the mid 80s, low to mid 80s. PSA obviously pursuing a hierarchy strategy was in the low 90s; all industries now in that low 90s and I know part of that's just an operating side of things and all of it was a greater adoption too but there is an element from same-store NOI perspectives, just trying to frame how negative it can be. And so we've been through two recessions in the last 20 years, you were sort of high single digit declines in the early 2000s. It was called mid-single digit declines year-over-year on a quarterly basis, coming out of the GFC. Is there any goalposts that you can share with us especially given the fact that when you came into this you're only thinking same-store NOI is going to be 1% this year or I'm sorry 25 basis points this year and I recognize you did better in the first quarter but are there sort of things you can at least give us some goalposts on how we should be thinking about this?\nScott Stubbs: We can point to the last downturn where we saw 2.9% decrease in same score revenue growth. Our occupancy went down about 270 basis points. There were similarities in that downturn going in you had at we were coming on a supply run. Last time we're on we've had a lot of supply recently. There's also differences. I mean this one going in is much more severe, we stopped I think everybody stopped rate increases very quickly whereas during the last downturn we continue to do rate increases throughout. So there's similarities and differences and it's very difficult to frame and that's why we pulled the guidance.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. This one isn't that question but I know Joe you guys have prided ourselves on your culture and your employee engagement. So it's actually good to see that actually translated into something quantifiable which is typically never quantifiable. And my follow-up question, you guys have typically talked about tenant turnover being about 6% to 7% per month but a lot of times it's the same space turning over. So you can't just take that number times the Street rate but when you take a step back and you account for the same space turning all the time, what is the effective turnover rate in a quarter and what is the kind of effective turnover rate in a year that we could apply the change in Street rates too?\nScott Stubbs: I don't know that we've ever done the effective that math on an entire portfolio and it's going to be very different for a stable property versus a new property. I mean, a new property doesn't have any long-term tenants versus a property that's 20 years old. It could have some tenants that have been in there since day one. So an older property has much lower turnover than new property.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. I see. And can you just talk about the New York City market? How much different was New York City compared to your portfolio average that you saw in April in terms of operating metrics?\nJoe Margolis: So New York City, New York MSA, New York City had negative 1% revenue growth compared to the portfolio of 1.9%. So it has been for several quarters and continues to lag behind the portfolio.\nScott Stubbs: The other thing I would add Ki Bin is they were more severely impacted by the rentals, the decline in rentals as their stay-at-home orders were more strict than some of the more suburban markets that we've seen.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you. Thank you for your comment Kim Bim. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Margolis for any closing remarks.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you all for your interest in Extra Space Storage. I wish everyone and their families well and healthy through this difficult time and I'm sure we'll all talk soon. Thank you again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone and thank you for your interest in Extra Space. Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020 I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that every one of us has had our daily routines interrupted, stress put on our lives and may have dealt with the illness of family and friends. I sympathize with the difficulties everyone has endured and greatly appreciate the professionalism, positive attitudes and support shown by everyone on this call. At times of crisis reveal our true nature and our industry can be very proud of itself. I hope you and your loved ones are well, healthy and managing through this. Secondly, I'm frequently asked what makes Extra Space different or special. In response I describe our portfolio, our operating and technology platforms and most importantly our people. While all of these have performed well during this crisis it is our people, particularly our store managers, who have really stepped up and delivered in an extraordinary manner. All of our employees regardless of role or region of the country have adapted quickly to changing operating procedures and requirements and have gone to great efforts to keep our stores open and our customers safe and all of this was done while they were under the same personal stress and worry that we all are feeling. I could not be prouder of the people who make up Extra Space and feel extremely lucky to be part of such a great team. I know that whatever challenges lie ahead this team will strive to optimize performance while upholding Extra Space's values. With respect to performance, Q1 was a strong quarter. Even with the impact of COVID-19 in the latter part of March property revenue for the quarter was in line with expectations and same-store revenue growth was 1.9%. Core FFO per share growth was 6.9%, $0.04 higher than the top end of our guidance. We continue to see strong external growth through third-party management with 48 stores added to the platform and in bridge loan activity. External growth through acquisitions is currently muted as we patiently wait for opportunities that present attractive risk reward metrics. Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have been in contact with all of our lenders and partners and we are very comfortable to we have sufficient capital options to satisfy upcoming maturities as well as having additional capacity to be opportunistic if attractive investments become available in this unusual environment. We are proud of our strong start to the year and while we are fortunate that we have been able to keep our stores open, execute new leases and continue to provide our customers access to their belongings, we certainly have not been immune to the impacts of COVID-19. The financial impact of the changes to our operations caused by the pandemic such as the decision to pause auctions, temporarily suspend existing customer rent increases and a reduction in rental activity due to stay-at-home orders create a wide range of possible FFO outcomes some of which fall outside of our initial guidance. While we considered simply revising our annual guidance range we recognized that in order to provide accurate guidance one key driver impacting all primary revenue assumptions is the timing of lifting stay-at-home orders across the country and subsequent customer behavior. We are encouraged by the activity we see in markets like Detroit, Salt Lake City and most impactful to our portfolio multiple California markets where rental activity is improving but the uncertainty of when other major markets like New York City will reopen and how customers will respond in such dense urban markets reduces our performance visibility for the balance of the year. Therefore, since these key factors remain unclear and will vary from market to market we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance that would reasonably capture the full span of possibilities. It would also encourage us to produce guidance that may be overly cautious in order to include even remote possibilities. However, we believe it is important to be transparent with the information that we have to help our investors understand our company and the sector so they can make informed decisions. As we provide point-in-time metrics we urge you not to lose sight of the big picture. It is still a very good time to be invested in storage. Demand for our need-based product while temporarily slowed will continue. The life transitions that have made demand so durable in the past will continue. The advantages over smaller operators with our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and top-notch team are still in place. Our balance sheet quality is better than ever and external growth opportunities will likely increase going forward. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of those metrics in more detail. Sure. Thank you for the question. So we had a great first quarter for our third-party management platform. We added 48 stores. We saw 18 stores leave the platform. So a net increase of 30. We added 12 in April. We had scheduled to add 19 but we're seeing some delays and one trend that we are seeing is that we're seeing less interest from new development as new development waned but more interest from owners of existing leased stores. So we expect to continue to grow that platform and have a very positive year. We are proud that we are good allocators of capital and I think you can see that historically if you look at the timing of when we were heavy in the acquisition market, when we participated heavily in new development through C/Os and when we pull back and when we issued equity. Buying back shares is another allocation of capital decision and we will continually consider it in comparison to our other investment options. Thank you. Thank you Michael. So we will resume in and are resuming our existing customer rate increase program market by market as they open up subject to governmental restrictions on that. So whether we can have it fully resumed by the end of the year is totally a function of when markets open up and government activity and frankly it's one reason we don't have enough transparency to give guidance. So we don't have a ton of data and I don't want to give you kind of what I think. So what I can tell you is based on the last two weeks of April. In 25 of our 30 markets we saw improvement in rental activity while vacates stayed flat. Now that's two weeks. We are encouraged by that but we're being patient to see how the situation plays out over time. Thank you Kim No, vacates, there was no change in vacate activity from say mid March to early April as compared to the last two weeks of April where -- if you look at mid March to early April on the rental side to the last two weeks of April there was significant improvement. So it's not year-over-year, it's how things are changing as we get deeper into this situation. So we are lucky in that we are not constrained by capital. So between internal capital sources and partners capital we can take advantage of any opportunity that makes sense. So the limiting factor in my mind is going to be are there good deals that we can appropriately understand the risks and get rewarded for it. If we can identify those deals we have various sources of capital to execute on them and not limited by some target number Thank you Jeremy. Okay. So I apologize for making you repeat that. So I'll give you a couple of examples and maybe that will help you. And if I'm not answering your question let me know. So take San Diego for example. From mid-March to early April San Diego we were down 31% in rentals. In the last two weeks of April we were down 1%. So that's significant improvement. We saw similar improvement in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Dallas and that's encouraging to us. The flip side of that is if you look at Washington DC and that kind of  Washington to Baltimore Corridor we saw no improvement. We had the same experience kind of early in the crisis as we did in the last two weeks of April. San Diego, yes. So I think it's important to remember that occupancy is not our goal. Our goal is revenue and occupancy is one tool along with rate and advertising spend and discount and if we can maximize revenue by driving occupancies up then the system can do that. If we can maximize revenue by losing a little occupancy or staying where we are then this system can do that. With respect to the lending program we see increase in opportunities, as I guess other for one thing other lenders have gone to the sidelines and more owners are seeking a bridge to better times. So last year we did nine loans for a $104 million gross. This year we closed three and approved 10 for $133 million \u2013 $134 million and we have a very strong pipeline. So we see the loan program is a good growth opportunity for us. I think we will see those opportunities this year. It's a little early to say that there's been a flood of those but I think there is stress in the market and we are going to see a good number of those opportunities and we'll look at each of them individually and see if we think it makes sense for us. Thank you. Correct. So we have a great team out there and we pay our managers above minimum wage and give them incentives to sign leases and when the crisis hit we first took all necessary steps to keep them safe. We originally closed our stores and we're doing no contact leases. We're in the process of going to kind of phase two of that with Plexiglass protection and being able to open our offices but and we provided paid time for people whose stores were closed by government mandate. We provided some relief pay for employees who were ill or had to take care of loved ones. So we feel we did the right things by our employees. We did not need to pay them more or issue hazard pay or something like that to keep them engaged in working and we've recently done a survey and continued to have over 80% positive engagement stores from our work force. So I think they've done a great job through this and it's been beneficial to us to develop such a great work force and have such great relationships with them and that's benefited us through this crisis. Thank you. So we have eight C/Os in our pipeline for to close in 2020 and 2021. Five of those will do in joint ventures which both reduces our exposure and increases our return through management fee and tenant insurance. Our underwriting evolved as the development cycle got deeper and there was more new competition in these markets and certainly if we saw a new deal now we haven't approved one since COVID-19 but certainly if we saw one now I think it would be very hard for us to approve -- underwriting approved but underwriting would change as well. Thank you. Correct. They were slightly negative at the start of the year. By the 1st of March they were slightly positive and then down about 10% in April. Thank you Yes. So our portfolio has low teens in terms of exposure to college students. So it's 12% to 15%. In terms of the benefit from those students the effective we got an extra month or two from them and you're talking 1/12th or 1/10th of 12%. So it's really not impactful not a big benefit. Sure. Thank you. We really don't have a lot of data to show any difference in behavior in our business tenant. So I think it's just a little too early to tell but so far they seem to be behaving just like our retail tenants. Yes. Michael I can't tell you what we're going to see but we're pretty early in this. We are one or two months in and can the business pay 150 bucks for a month to see if they can hang on or do whatever. So far we haven't seen it. I don't know if we will see it in the future. I don't know if government checks are helping but we just don't see that yet. So New York City, New York MSA, New York City had negative 1% revenue growth compared to the portfolio of 1.9%. So it has been for several quarters and continues to lag behind the portfolio. Thank you. Thank you for your comment Kim Bim. I appreciate it. Thank you all for your interest in Extra Space Storage. I wish everyone and their families well and healthy through this difficult time and I'm sure we'll all talk soon. Thank you again."

            "content": "Thank You Joe and hello everyone. To understand our current operating trends it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March we further expanded our positive year-over-year occupancy Delta to 90 basis points while also increasing achieved rate. By early March our achieve rate for flat is slightly positive on a year-over-year basis. Beginning in mid-March stay at home orders caused a gradual reduction in rental activity. This was partially offset by increased college student rentals. However, as more orders were issued across the country the reduction in rentals and vacates increased significantly. Rentals were down 35% to 40% for the 30 days from mid-March to mid-April partially offset by vacates which were down approximately 25% during the same period. Over the last 15 days of April, rental velocity improved with 25 of our top 30 markets experiencing an increase in rental velocity compared to the previous 30 days. While rental volume has been down it is primarily due to lower walk-in traffic which is expected. Web traffic remains steady indicating that people are still looking for storage. Occupancy as of April 30th was 91.1% which is 60 basis points lower than this time last year but still very healthy. To give you some context occupancy at the end of the first quarter in 2008 was 84.1%. Our ability to acquire customers is significantly better today than leading up to the financial crisis and we believe we'll be able to continue to drive traffic to our properties and to maximize revenue. In April achieved rate for new rentals were down approximately 10% year-over-year. In March, we postponed sending existing customer rate increases which is having an adverse impact on our revenue growth. As municipalities lift stay-at-home orders we are resuming rate increases market by market. We collected 93% of rent in April and this is down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis for the same store pool due to increased accounts receivable and causing auctions. It is important to note that these levels were attained without making collection calls for aggressive following up with past new accounts from mid-March until the end of April. We have resumed these practices in May and we expect accounts receivable balances to decline. As Joe mentioned while we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent high-level execution and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. With that let's turn it over to Daniel to start our Q&A. Yes. The occupancy as of the end of April does include all tenants that are in our properties and it includes about 20 basis points of occupancy for the month and a half of paused auctions. Yes. So our autopay is about 65% of our tenants so almost two-thirds of our tenants are on autopay. So those continue to pay automatically. It's that other about 90% of our customers pay with a credit card and that other 25% are the ones that typically call in each month with a credit card or we reach out to them. So the month of May as well as question for the month of April we'll start reaching out to those tenants if they have not paid. So we're expecting to collect a large portion of those ARs that are current, 30 days. Yes. if you look at the first quarter and look at which expensive line items were elevated the ones that pop out to your payroll, marketing and then property taxes I think property taxes are pretty close to what we are expecting and we expect them to be somewhat elevated but as if revenues fall then you potentially get some reprieve but that typically lags by as much as a year or two. In terms of payroll part of the reason it is elevated in Q1 this year is it's a tough comp. Q1 last year we actually had negative 4% payroll growth and so very difficult comp. We would expect payroll to continue to be elevated more at inflationary call at 3% to 4% but not necessarily at that 7% range. We did not see a benefit from lower staffing or anything of the sort in the first quarter as we continued to pay our employees as our stores were open. The last one is really marketing and our marketing expense in the first quarter is elevated partly due to a tough comp from last year. So we started increasing our marketing spend in the second quarter of last year and it was elevated throughout the year and we continued spending at that elevated level into the Q1 of this year. So Q1 of this year had a very tough comp from last year and we expect to continue to use marketing this year but I don't think you'll see the elevated spent quarter over quarter for the remainder of the year that you saw in Q1 of this year. I am sorry. I am not sure I followed the question. Yes. so I think that's really the difficult question and one of the reasons we pulled guidance is one is the occupancy in the summer as well as how long are we on pause in terms of our existing customer rate increases. In terms of historically how is it added it actually is added between 10 and 30 basis points to our annual growth rate. It's not a significant driver because we do it on a year-over-year basis. Now where it could hurt you this year for instance is if we have to pause these for months on end. Now if this pause happens for a month or two it's obviously impacts us but it's much less than if we pause them for five or six months and so that's obviously one of the big reasons why we elected not to update our guidance and pull our guidance.. That is correct. Yes. Start of the year we were slightly negative on our achieved rates. By the 1st of March we were slightly positive. So they were trending in the right way before the stay-at-home orders and before the outbreak of the COVID-19. In April, we were negative 10%. I think that we will continue to adjust rates and marketing spend as we look to maximize revenue. So rate is obviously always a factor. We will continue to test to try to figure out the best rate but if rentals stay down, if occupancy stays down and our model shows that rate is the best thing to adjust we will adjust rate. Yes. so we obviously are going to try to focus on our customer first and so our decision to do this was very customer focused and recognizing that they're feeling some strain as they're staying at home, as you've had people stick around them a lot of fear and so our decision was to move away from auctions to pause those and then also to move away from collection calls. We did do some reminder calls letting people know but starting the first part of May as things open up we are moving back to auctions. So as States open up following the State mandates we will open up auctions with it if it's allowed. We will try to work first to pay to vacate a unit. So you'll try to work with a customer to take get whatever we can to have them vacate versus moving to auction. It's a better experience and we will now begin more of a collection call versus a collection reminder or a payment reminder where you are calling now and instead of saying your rent is due we saying your rent is due and do you have a credit card. So just a little bit more proactive in that manner. Thank you Todd. So if you look at our current in-place rent versus the rents that are moving in, there is a negative that always depends on the time of year and in the summer months that negative amount is different than in January, February. Now the other thing I would caution you on when you compare those is that assumes that everyone moves out on average whereas we see more churn much -- more churn in our short-term customers. Our median length of stay is about six months versus a average length of stay of everyone that's moved in and moved out of about 16 months. And so if you look at someone who moved in five months ago and they are the ones that move out it is much different than someone that moved in and moved out two years ago or three years ago. So our whole loans are currently priced LIBOR plus 400 to LIBOR plus 500 with the LIBOR floor I think this smallest floor was 50 to 150 basis points and then the return to Extra Space is based on as we sell or place a piece or the first piece return starts our LIBOR plus 900 plus in addition to that we manage the properties and get tenant insurance. They often will be on auto pay also Michael and so it could be later that you see something like that. So we just have not seen it at this level yet. A lot of them are sole proprietors too. Yes. Ours is a little different Michael in that we're anniversary dates. So we've really only seen five days or a small portion of the month whereas many operators are first a month. So they get a better idea of collections early on. So ours is a very small sample size. Yes. We break it down by 0 to 30, 30 to 60 and 60 and greater and the ones that we typically cracked and we're more aggressive on are 30 plus day one. 0 to 30 most of those pay. We also have been lenient -- The biggest trend I would tell you would be more cash payments versus credit card payments, meaning a store that is 95% credit card obviously is going to have less delinquencies than somewhere that is 60% cash payments and those typically are, we have obviously fewer of those stores but that's probably the biggest trend I'd point to. We can point to the last downturn where we saw 2.9% decrease in same score revenue growth. Our occupancy went down about 270 basis points. There were similarities in that downturn going in you had at we were coming on a supply run. Last time we're on we've had a lot of supply recently. There's also differences. I mean this one going in is much more severe, we stopped I think everybody stopped rate increases very quickly whereas during the last downturn we continue to do rate increases throughout. So there's similarities and differences and it's very difficult to frame and that's why we pulled the guidance. Thanks Michael. I don't know that we've ever done the effective that math on an entire portfolio and it's going to be very different for a stable property versus a new property. I mean, a new property doesn't have any long-term tenants versus a property that's 20 years old. It could have some tenants that have been in there since day one. So an older property has much lower turnover than new property. The other thing I would add Ki Bin is they were more severely impacted by the rentals, the decline in rentals as their stay-at-home orders were more strict than some of the more suburban markets that we've seen."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norman, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Victor. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call.

Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, February 24, 2022. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.  I'd now like to turn the time over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoseph Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. It is incredibly sad to wake up this morning to news of war in Europe. Without ignoring the human loss and suffering this will entail, we are also thinking of how this tragic event will affect economic growth, oil prices, inflation, interest rates and ultimately our business and our company. Events like this certainly give us some perspective on our business and our lives, and in some ways, makes discussing the performance and outlook of our company [less important]. While we don't know how all of this will play out, we do know that historically self-storage has been a needed product in good and bad economic times, that the cash flow we produce is very stable, much more so than many other types of real estate, and that our company and balance sheet are structured and prepared to prosper in all economic conditions. Now turning to results. We had a remarkable, remarkable fourth quarter to cap off another strong year at Extra Space Storage. Property level performance was exceptional across the board. Same-store revenue growth in the quarter was 18.3%. Revenue growth was primarily driven by 2 factors: first, our same-store occupancy of 95.3%, which was a year-end high for Extra Space for the second year in a row. Secondly, strong new and existing customer rate growth. Expense growth remained in check at 2.5%, resulting in same-store NOI growth of 24.2%. We also had significant external growth in the quarter. We acquired 66 stores on a wholly owned basis or in joint ventures for a total investment from Extra Space of approximately $850 million. Total acquisition investment for the full year was $1.3 billion, primarily in relatively small transactions. We also closed $187 million in bridge loans in the quarter, bringing the annual total to $333 million. We continue to execute on our strategy to sell a significant portion of our lower-yielding first mortgage balances to our debt partners. We also continue to acquire properties originally sourced through our lending platform. To date, we have acquired 15 properties sourced through loans for $181 million. We added 69 stores to our management platform in the quarter for a total of 265 stores for the full year. To give context, including acquisitions, we onboarded 1.3 properties per business day in 2021. We experienced higher dispositions with more stores leaving our platform due to third-party owners selling properties, but we were able to buy 58 of these either wholly owned or with one of our joint venture partners. Our property NOI plus our external growth efforts resulted in core FFO growth of 29.1% in the quarter. I am proud of the Extra Space team. There are many contributions to our growth in 2021, and for how they have positioned us for another strong year in 2022. We are also proud to have been recognized not only for our performance, but the sustainable nature of the company we have built. For the second year in a row, we were named one of NAREIT's leaders in the light for our sustainability efforts, and we are proud to be the only storage company to have received this award. Looking forward, industry fundamentals remain very strong. Occupancy levels remained at historically high levels, resulting in elevated pricing power to new and existing customers. Despite very difficult comparables, the strong market fundamentals and our team's ability to execute give us the confidence to guide to double-digit same-store revenue growth again in 2022, and FFO growth of over 13% at the midpoint. In light of this strength, we raised our dividend to $1.50 per share, a 50% increase year-over-year. We are off to a great start in 2022, and we expect another exceptional year for Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of the details of performance in the fourth quarter as well as our 2022 guidance.\nScott Stubbs : Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a great fourth quarter and year with our 2021 core FFO coming in $0.06 above the high end of our guidance. Our outperformance relative to our guidance was driven by the property -- by property performance and higher-than-expected interest income partially offset by higher-than-expected interest expense. Our external growth in the quarter was capitalized by $210 million in sales proceeds from the disposition of 17 stores. We also issued $276 million in OP units, and we drew on our revolving lines of credit. Our balance sheet has never been stronger, and we will term out our revolving balances through future unsecured debt issuances. Currently, only 8% of our debt maturities over the next -- mature over the next 2 years. And our focus will be to lengthen our average debt maturity and to further ladder our maturing balances. Our unencumbered pool is now over $12 billion, and our net debt to trailing 12 EBITDA is at 5x. We continue to have access to many types of capital, giving us significant capacity for future growth. Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2022. Our new same-store pool includes a total of 870 stores, a relatively small net increase from last year with new additions partially offset by sites removed due to disposition or redevelopment. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 10.5% to 12.5% driven primarily by rate growth. Same-store expense growth is expected to be 6% to 7.5%, primarily driven by higher payroll, marketing expense and property tax expense. Our revenue and expense guidance results in a same-store net NOI range of 11.5% to 14.5%. The acquisition market continues to be competitive, and we will remain disciplined but opportunistic. We plan to continue our strategy of looking for off-market opportunities and plan to capitalize a portion of our acquisition volume with joint venture partners. Our guidance assumes $500 million in Extra Space investment, approximately half of which is already closed or under contract. We also expect to close $400 million of bridge loans and plan to retain $120 million in new balances in 2022. We have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders, and we will continue to be creative as we deploy capital in the sector. To support our 2021 and 2022 property growth, we made significant investments in our people, our infrastructure and our technology. This resulted in higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate a higher run rate in 2022. This is primarily driven by payroll and technology R&D, which will advance initiatives that will support our growth for years to come. The return of historical G&A expenses temporarily paused during the pandemic, also contributes to this increase. Our core FFO is estimated to be between $7.70 and $7.95 per share. We anticipate $0.23 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores up $0.12 from 2021 due to the significant acquisition volume of non-stabilized properties in the fourth quarter. Interest income will be somewhat weighted to the first quarter due to the timing of note sales and potential modification of our NexPoint investment. 2021 was a great year for Extra Space, and we are already on our way to another strong year in 2022. With that, let's turn it over to Victor to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question on the line of Elvis Rodriguez from Bank of America.\nElvis Rodriguez: Good morning out there and congrats on the quarter and year. Joe, a quick question on strategy from an acquisitions perspective. I think your -- if I recall correctly, you had about $700 million at the -- in your guidance at the end of 3Q, but did $1.3 billion. What type of opportunities are you seeing -- and have already closed on, call it, $250 million year-to-date. What type of opportunities are you seeing and what gives you sort of some comfort or pause on the $500 million that you shared and maybe being able to do more as the year progresses?\nJoseph Margolis : Great. Thank you, Elvis. So we saw a good number of kind of year-end tax motivated transactions come in the fourth quarter, and we were able to execute on those. Most of them -- almost all of them were single properties or groupings of a very small number of properties. We also were able to do 1 larger portfolio where we were not the high bidder on the portfolio. But through OP units and shares, we were able to offer the seller some tax deferment, which allowed us to capture that transaction as well. Looking forward, our target of 5 -- or guidance of $500 million is an assumption. We're pretty far along the way to getting there. If there are opportunities to do more deals. We certainly have lots and lots of different capital sources and debt capacity to do it, and we'll do it. But what's in our guidance is $500 million.\nElvis Rodriguez : Then just as a follow-up, are you able to share a cap rate on your 4Q acquisitions?\nJoseph Margolis : So almost all of our fourth quarter acquisitions were unstabilized lease-up deals. And on a wholly owned basis, first year yield -- and this is fully loaded. This includes cost to manage, CapEx, tax reassessment, our expense structure was in the was in the low to mid-3s first year. And we stabilized in the mid-5s and a little over little over a year, maybe 15 to 17 months with average stabilization for those deals. When you do those same deals in a joint venture structure, you can add 200 basis points to 225 basis points to those numbers. So first year in the mid-5s and stabilizing in the high 7s.\nElvis Rodriguez : Great. And then for my second question, maybe for Scott, can you talk about the floating rate debt in your portfolio? I know you mentioned potentially doing an unsecured deal sometime this year to term out some of the line of credit debt. But can you talk about the overall variable debt as a part of your structure, and how comfortable you are given the rise in rates?\nScott Stubbs : Yes. I mean obviously, you prefer rates to be falling, but they're rising today. So part of our strategy has always been to have some component of variable rate debt. We typically have operated 20% to 30% variable rate debt. It gets a little higher when we have more drawn on our lines of credit, and we are terming some things out. This year, we have about $535 million drawn at the end of the year. So that caused us to be about 25% variable rate debt. As we look forward in ways that we hedge, one of the natural hedges that we do have is we do loan money. We have these bridge loans and different types of investments that are variable rate instruments. So there is somewhat of a natural hedge on a portion of that, but we also will look to term out our draws on our line of credit this year through the bond market.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted to ask what benefit, if any, is assumed or expected from the lifting of rent [restrictions]? Maybe if you can give us any color on where that represents the most upside?\nJoseph Margolis : Sure, Juan. So the short answer is we believe that the lifting of the state of emergencies in California will give us about 50 basis points across the portfolio in lift. And obviously, there's a lot of assumptions to go into this, primarily what's the length of stay, the future length of stay of the tenants that have gotten these increases. So our guidance assumes 50 basis points.\nJuan Sanabria: And that 50 is revenues, I'm assuming?\nJoseph Margolis : Yes.\nJuan Sanabria : Okay. And then just talking on the expense side, you could flush out a little bit about how much ballpark you're expecting kind of the major line items to move for '22 that's embedded into your guidance?\nScott Stubbs : Juan, our guidance assumes close to 7% on the payroll number, and that is not only wage inflation, but that is operating more closer to fully staffed. Last year, you actually had negative payroll and so it's a really tough comp. And then property taxes, we're assuming about 5.5% growth. And then marketing, about 10% growth.\nJuan Sanabria : Great.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith : You had a very strong 2021, nearly 20% same-store NOI growth, 14% same-store revenue growth -- but wondering how much of the gains from last year is influencing how you guide for the upcoming year? It's been clear from those like you and your peers that have guided, or report at this point that the strength of the performance in 2021 is influencing expectations in 2022. And within that, given your same-store revenue guidance of 10.5% to 12.5%, and the comparisons are considerably harder in the back half, how should we think about the performance in the upcoming year from the first half versus second half?\nJoseph Margolis : Yes. So clearly, a strong 2021 influences performance in 2022 for a number of reasons. One is we have very high occupancy, which gives us pricing power, particularly when we still see a strong demand with no diminution in demand. Secondly, as rates go up and we put new tenants in, that takes a while to flow into -- that rent roll takes a while to flow into performance. So as we put tenants in the later half of 2021, that helps gives us a rise throughout 2022. And then we already mentioned ECRI. But you're right that even with the strong performance that we expect throughout the year, our comps are tougher at the back half of the year. So the rate of growth will moderate even though we should have strong performance throughout the year. Are you able to help kind of frame it? Like do we start the year at kind of the high end of the guidance and at the low end of the guidance or the kind of the difference line in? Or will the difference be greater than that?\nScott Stubbs : Yes. So we obviously finished the fourth quarter really strong. So we would expect the first quarter to be our strongest quarter. We would expect our first quarter to be really good. I mean we don't see it moving down significantly, partly because you had easier comps from last year. And then that rate of growth declines throughout the year as we get tougher comps. We don't expect rates necessarily to go backwards, and we expect to have pricing power but the comp to be more difficult, therefore, the rate of growth to decline as we move through the year.\nMichael Goldsmith : Understood. And as a follow-up, we touched on a little bit on existing customer rent increases. For 2022, is there any change in your approach to them given the environment given the environment, are you looking to push the magnitude of rent increases harder or more frequently or maybe pull some rent increases up prior to the peak leasing season? Just trying to get better understand like the level of confidence surrounding the same-store revenue growth that's driven by the rate piece.\nJoseph Margolis : So with respect to ECRI, we're coming off a period where it was really unusual, where we voluntarily stopped where we were restricted by the government for a long time, where we had outsized rent growth, which increased the gap between what people were paying in current street rate. I would imagine in '22, we would get back to a more normalized protocol for ECRI. What was the second half of the question? Do you remember, Scott? Can you repeat the second half of the question? I'm sorry.\nMichael Goldsmith : Just it was related to the magnitude of rent increases more frequently. Or would you pull some rent increases prior to the peak leasing season to create vacancy to create vacancy when you have like the most -- potential for the most captive audience?\nJoseph Margolis : Yes. So -- and I'm sorry, I made you repeat that question. I think we're always trying to maximize revenue and not bread on the shelf. So I don't think we are planning to create vacancy. So we'll have more vacancy in peak leasing season. We have natural churn every month and the ability to raise existing customers\u2019 rate increase. So we're trying to continuously maximize revenue, and not look at particular months of the year.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Truist.\nKi Bin Kim : So going back to your capital deployment, obviously, you guys had a pretty robust quarter in 4Q. Also just curious, high level, did you just end up seeing more deals fitting your bull's eye? Or did the size of your fully change? And similar question for your C of O deals, I noticed that your C of O pipeline really expanded noticeably, similar question there.\nJoseph Margolis : So I think if you look at the pattern of acquisitions in any year, it's back-end loaded. I think there is a season -- normal seasonality. And it was probably more -- it was more pronounced this year. And we just saw more deals that made sense. We didn't change our underwriting or our discipline. We just happen to be able to capture more opportunities. And we do have more C of Os now. We did see more of those opportunities that made sense for us. But again, nowhere near where we were in '16, '17, '18.\nKi Bin Kim : Got it. And implicit in your 2022 same-store revenue guidance, what are you thinking for street rate growth compared to what it was in 4Q?\nScott Stubbs : So we'll see in terms of street rate growth for the year. I can tell you a little bit about our assumptions, and what we're seeing in the first quarter. So our achieved rates in the first quarter so far have been very similar to the fourth quarter. Our achieved rates were up 20% in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that into this year. We haven't seen significant degradation in occupancy. Our occupancy is slightly below where we were before. Our rate of growth will slow in terms of street rates. And what I mean by that is we pushed rates as much as 20% to 40% depending on the month, depending on the comp from the prior year. We don't expect that in 2022. So we don't necessarily look -- think that we will decrease rates, but we do not expect that kind of growth in 2022.\nKi Bin Kim : If I could pick a little bit more -- try to get a little more out of the answer. Any kind of range you can provide?\nScott Stubbs : They're going to be better in the first quarter than in the back half of the year. I think that's really all we can provide. And part of that has to do with the comp in the front half versus the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Stein from Stifel.\nKevin Stein : I was just wondering, so you sold like $200 million of properties. I was just wondering if the reason for selling them was it just really good pricing. Or was there any strategic reason for that?\nJoseph Margolis : I would say both. I mean we always look to optimize our portfolio and either select markets or individual assets where we prefer to have less exposure. And to do so in a period of time where cap rates are at historic lows is very advantageous. We sold about half of our -- the sales we did last year into a venture where we were able to keep management, and some exposure to those assets. And the other rough half we sold out right, but we're able to keep management of 12 of the 14 properties. So I think it's both strategic play and also happen to be good market timing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas : I was wondering if you could talk about the contribution to FFO that's embedded in the guidance from non-same-store growth in '22? And can you share how much of an NOI yield, the increase that you're anticipating on the non-same-store?\nScott Stubbs : So make sure I understand the question. You're trying to understand where in addition to the property NOI, where the growth is coming from. Is that -- for the contribution outside of non same-store or the property?\nTodd Thomas : Yes. Outside of the -- so outside of the same-store, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned sort of a mid-3 initial yield stabilizing in the mid-5s on what was acquired during the full year, plus some other non-same-store assets, C of O deals, et cetera. What's sort of embedded in the guidance for NOI -- for the NOI yield uptick that you're anticipating on the non-same-store in \u201822?\nScott Stubbs : Yes. Maybe the best way to think of it, Todd, is if you take the same-store performance, which we've given and look at your NOI there, you're at the midpoint, your 13 -- and then you look at the FFO growth and our FFO growth is slightly higher than that. So effectively, all of the non-same-store properties are contributing to the level that the G&A is going up, that your interest expense is going up. So it's effectively a wash. So the non-same store is awash in terms of offsetting the other increases. So you have several other increases happening here. You have G&A going up. You have interest expense going up, and then you have an additional amount of dilution from some of the lease-up stores that we bought at the end of last year. We have $0.23 this year versus our dilution from last year.\nTodd Thomas : Okay. And on -- for the management fee and tenant reinsurance income growth, the guidance there. What's that based on in terms of net growth to the third-party management platform? I mean how many ads are you anticipating throughout the year?\nScott Stubbs : So management fees and tenant insurance both increased by the increase in joint ventures from last year as well as an additional 100 stores net is what our guidance assumes for next year.\nTodd Thomas : Okay. So up 100 stores net in '22. Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, I think, Scott, you mentioned when you were talking about where achieved rates were year-to-date and similar to the fourth quarter, I think you mentioned that occupancy slipped just a little bit here to start the year. Can you just tell us where occupancy is today and what that year-over-year spread looks like?\nScott Stubbs : Your spread, it's slightly negative. I'm trying to -- the best way to explain it, we have 2 different numbers. You have a -- you're about negative 40 bps year-over-year, but you're also comparing a new same-store pool. So just want to make sure we're not solving for the exact amount. And again, we're not solving for occupancy. And so we view this as still being in a really good spot. But when we're at 94.6% today, and we're pushing rates as hard as we are -- occupancy is 1 component of this.\nTodd Thomas : Okay. Okay. So 94.6% is for the new same-store that's occupancy as of today?\nScott Stubbs : That's correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal from Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: Scott, just on the occupancy question. I mean, what are you baking in sort of in the second half of the year, sort of that summer peak to end of the year decline?\nScott Stubbs : Yes. So without giving exact occupancy, I can maybe just give you a little bit of input. We're not assuming that we get a benefit from occupancy in 2022. Last year, in 2021, I think we got 250 basis points of benefit from occupancy. And then I believe we're ending the year slightly negative to where we're starting -- where we ended the year this year. But again, no benefit that we experienced in 2021. And so we do see occupancy is still being strong in 2022.\nSamir Khanal : Okay. And then I guess on the guidance for G&A, I mean it did go up. I think it was about $20 million. Just trying to see if there's anything sort of onetime in nature there? I know you talked about payroll and kind of return to normal. But -- and I know you talked about investments in technology as well. So is there anything kind of onetime in nature that we need to think about as we think about sort of '23?\nJoseph Margolis : I'm not sure if they're onetime in nature, but we're certainly making longer-term investments that don't have an immediate payoff. So our company is growing very fast. And we're making investments in infrastructure that will facilitate continued growth at the pace that we want. And we're also making certain technology and R&D investments that won't add anything in 2022. It will be long-term beneficial and accretive. The flip side, which I don't think is temporary or -- is the increasing payroll. I think we're just in a new payroll environment, and that's going to be ongoing in my opinion.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi.\nSmedes Rose : I just wanted to ask a little more on the acquisitions outlook, and you and others are seeing a pretty -- market slowdown from last year's elevated activity. I'm wondering, is it -- anything you're seeing on the sort of the quality of the assets are there for sale? Is there just less stuff for sale? Is it a purposeful sort of pullback on your part? Or maybe you could just talk just a little bit more about what you're seeing, maybe what's changed since last year?\nJoseph Margolis : Smedes, as I said earlier, I think there's a seasonality to this, and there's a natural slowdown early in the year. We are still the market for sale. I don't think quality is very different than it was last year and prior years. There's some stuff of good quality and some stuff of less quality. But I think your overall thesis is right. It's hard to imagine that the volume in 2022 will match 2021. That was just an enormous year in number of transactions. I'm talking about the industry, not necessarily for us.\nSmedes Rose : Right. Right. And then could you just update us on what's been happening with the length of stay? Where is it now? And maybe where was it pre-pandemic as a reminder?\nJoseph Margolis : Sure. So length of stay has steadily increased from the beginning of the pandemic to now -- we're now at about 2/3 of our customers have been with than 1 year, and maybe 42% or 43% of our have been with us longer than 2 years, and those are absolute all-time highs. We've never had that level of long-term customers in the portfolio. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows : Maybe just a question on supply. Wondering if you guys could go through your current expectation for supply in '22 and maybe even '23? And how much visibility you think you have at this point? And what's shaping those views?\nJoseph Margolis : So we continue to see a moderation in supply. We look at store -- new deliveries that affect our stores. So we're not national statistics or markets that we're not in. And if you look over the last 3 years and into 2022, it's kind of been a steady moderation. 28% of our stores were affected by new supply in 2019; 23% in 2020; 20% in 2021. And our best projection is about 18% in 2022. So new supply hasn't gone away. Stores are still being delivered. We get the opportunity to manage an awful lot of those, which is a good thing for us. But it is moderating.  2023, I don't have any predictions for, yet. I am concerned that given the tremendous performance in the asset class and the amount of capital seeking exposure to storage that we'll see an uptick in new development. And we know how to manage through that. We've done that before, and will provide opportunities for us, either to manage stores or participate like our C of O deals or make bridge loans. But I would not at all be surprised to see this pattern of moderation of deliveries reverse itself in 2023.\nCaitlin Burrows : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just following up on some prior points. I know you mentioned you don't expect the same amount of rent growth in '22 as '21. But with such high occupancy and rents, what are you currently seeing in terms of price sensitivity of customers? And maybe how that ends up impacting whether they decide to stay or go?\nJoseph Margolis : Well, we certainly track folks who vacate after they get rent increase notices from us, and that has increased over time. So as we have sent out these notices, we see more tenants vacating because of that. But that's not problematic for us because it's not to a number yet that it doesn't make sense to hand out the rate increases. And demand is so strong. We're very easily able to backfill those tenants.\nCaitlin Burrows : At those higher rates? Or I guess, what ends up being that spread then between the new person and that proposed rent increase?\nJoseph Margolis : Yes. At those higher rates.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Balaguer from Green Street.\nDavid Balaguer: Just wanted to touch on interest rates and cap rates. The market is certainly expecting a number of rate hikes this year. I imagine you haven't seen that bleed in the transaction market just yet. But how quickly would you expect cap rates to rise in a rising rate environment, just given as you mentioned before, there is a lot of new capital that's seeking storage exposure. .\nJoseph Margolis : Well, it's the right question, right? And traditionally, as interest rates go up, cap rates go up. But the fact that you mentioned that there's so much capital line to invest in self-storage may cause that to lag, may cause rates to go up and cap rates not to react immediately. But it's an unknown, and a very important question.\nDavid Balaguer: And to that extent, if we were to see cap rates rise and perhaps your cost of equity capital mostly unchanged, would that entice you to be a little bit more aggressive on the acquisition front?\nJoseph Margolis : Sure. If our cost of capital was the same and cap rates went up, that would spur us to be more active.\nDavid Balaguer: Got it. And one last question real quick on migratory patterns and just national mobility is sort of a number of market participants cite that as a demand driver in the last several quarters. There also seems to be some data out there from the residential side that seems to suggest that moving activity really hasn't materially changed since pre-COVID levels. Is there something specifically sensitive was brought on about moving activity that has led to customers being a little bit stickier than they have in the past?\nJoseph Margolis : So I would pause it, the stickier customers are not the moving customers. The customers where we've seen length of stay increase the most are the customers that cite lack of space as a reason for storing, not those who cite moving. So kind of a simple example is the individual who turned the extra bedroom into a home office or room for kids to go to school, and tend to be slower to turn that back to what it was. If they do it at all, then someone who's moving and at some point, move and don't need the storage anymore.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem : Most of my questions have been asked, but I just wanted to go back to the comment on sort of the expiration and the contribution to same-store revenue. I think you talked about 50 basis points. Hoping we can get a little bit more color. Is that mostly L.A.? And maybe what do you think is sort of the mark-to-market on that part of the business with these expirations?\nJoseph Margolis : Yes. That was -- I'm sorry if I wasn't clear that, that was -- the 50 basis points was as a result of California, which is mostly L.A. for us, lifting their state of emergencies.\nRonald Kamdem : Got it. And then so any sense of what -- that seems a little -- trying to get a sense of the conservatism baked into that. Any idea of what the mark-to-market could be on that portfolio, and how that compares to the rest?\nJoseph Margolis : The mark-to-market being the gap between in-place and what we're raising people to?\nRonald Kamdem : Exactly.\nJoseph Margolis : So we sent out rate increase notices for those tenants. And we obviously know what that all adds up but it's not a number we're revealing this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller : Yes. Just a couple of quick ones here. First of all, I know you talked about yields on fourth quarter acquisitions, but what was the average occupancy for what you acquired in the fourth quarter? And then is the focus in '22 to buy assets with a lot of lease-up potential as well?\nJoseph Margolis : So I'll answer those in reverse questions. Yes. I think most of our opportunities in 2022 will continue to be stores that have some lease-up, some value-add. Average occupancy -- I'll try to look up real quickly. But I don't think it's going to be a very meaningful number. Because many times, you have stores that are at high occupancies that look like they're close to stabilize, but they're not an economic stabilization, right? You've gotten to that high occupancy by leasing it up below market. So the uplift is in moving rates to market, not necessarily in gaining a lot of occupancy.\nMike Mueller : Got it. That makes sense. And then, I guess, just one other question. In terms of returns, when you're sitting there and looking at a C of O deal, how different is that target of return versus what may be a typical -- if there is a typical operating property that you would come across that has a decent amount of lease-up potential?\nJoseph Margolis : So it kind of depends on time, right? So if you are looking at a C of O property that you think is going to stabilize 3 years out, just to be simplistic, and you compare that to a lease-up property that stabilizes 24 months out or lease-up properties that stabilizes 12 months out. Obviously, for each of those, you want to be compensated a little bit more for the additional time that it takes you to get there. So your yield will be highest on the CO and lowest on the property that stabilizes in 9 months or 6 months. And then the other factor is our view of the risk of achieving those numbers and other maybe strategic factors to buy in the store or not by this.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Keegan Carl from Berenberg.\nKeegan Carl : Just wondering if we could dive in a little bit more of the R&D expense side of things for tech. Can you some more color on the investment, how it's being allocated and maybe how it compares to your historical average?\nJoseph Margolis : Could you ask that question again, please?\nKeegan Carl : Yes. So with regards to your tech spending on R&D, just kind of curious if you can give us any color on how it's being allocated and how it relates to your historical average.\nScott Stubbs : So I would say it is higher than it has been historically. And in terms of getting into the details of what we're investing in things like that, we feel like it's probably not something we'd talk about on a public call because we feel like it's something that gives us a potentially competitive advantage.\nKeegan Carl : Got it. I guess just from our seat then, I mean is it fair to assume that maybe some of these investments over the longer term can sort of mitigate and offset some of your future payroll expenses that you're expecting to be permanent?\nJoseph Margolis : So I would say that's a part of it. We certainly are looking to become more efficient and have the right amount of staffing at various stores. But in no way are we giving up on store managers or don't value our store managers or understand the importance they have on the revenue line item, and what they add in terms of increased revenue at the store and taking care of the store, et cetera. I would also say that's probably a minority of what we're focused on in terms of kind of innovative ways to participate in this business.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Elvis Rodriguez from Bank of America.\nElvis Rodriguez : Scott, just a quick follow-up on the marketing spend. You said plus 10% year-over-year. Can you share how the impact of the privacy changes that are happening with cookies, et cetera, are impacting sort of your online word search spend?\nScott Stubbs : Yes. It's not impacting us as of now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this moment. I'd like to turn the call back over to speakers for any closing remarks.\nJoseph Margolis : Great. I want to thank everyone for your interest in Extra Space, and for your good questions today. Clearly, we are in a very healthy business. We're set up very well for 2022. And we're excited to talk to you about our performance throughout the year. Thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Joseph Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. It is incredibly sad to wake up this morning to news of war in Europe. Without ignoring the human loss and suffering this will entail, we are also thinking of how this tragic event will affect economic growth, oil prices, inflation, interest rates and ultimately our business and our company. Events like this certainly give us some perspective on our business and our lives, and in some ways, makes discussing the performance and outlook of our company [less important]. While we don't know how all of this will play out, we do know that historically self-storage has been a needed product in good and bad economic times, that the cash flow we produce is very stable, much more so than many other types of real estate, and that our company and balance sheet are structured and prepared to prosper in all economic conditions. Now turning to results. We had a remarkable, remarkable fourth quarter to cap off another strong year at Extra Space Storage. Property level performance was exceptional across the board. Same-store revenue growth in the quarter was 18.3%. Revenue growth was primarily driven by 2 factors: first, our same-store occupancy of 95.3%, which was a year-end high for Extra Space for the second year in a row. Secondly, strong new and existing customer rate growth. Expense growth remained in check at 2.5%, resulting in same-store NOI growth of 24.2%. We also had significant external growth in the quarter. We acquired 66 stores on a wholly owned basis or in joint ventures for a total investment from Extra Space of approximately $850 million. Total acquisition investment for the full year was $1.3 billion, primarily in relatively small transactions. We also closed $187 million in bridge loans in the quarter, bringing the annual total to $333 million. We continue to execute on our strategy to sell a significant portion of our lower-yielding first mortgage balances to our debt partners. We also continue to acquire properties originally sourced through our lending platform. To date, we have acquired 15 properties sourced through loans for $181 million. We added 69 stores to our management platform in the quarter for a total of 265 stores for the full year. To give context, including acquisitions, we onboarded 1.3 properties per business day in 2021. We experienced higher dispositions with more stores leaving our platform due to third-party owners selling properties, but we were able to buy 58 of these either wholly owned or with one of our joint venture partners. Our property NOI plus our external growth efforts resulted in core FFO growth of 29.1% in the quarter. I am proud of the Extra Space team. There are many contributions to our growth in 2021, and for how they have positioned us for another strong year in 2022. We are also proud to have been recognized not only for our performance, but the sustainable nature of the company we have built. For the second year in a row, we were named one of NAREIT's leaders in the light for our sustainability efforts, and we are proud to be the only storage company to have received this award. Looking forward, industry fundamentals remain very strong. Occupancy levels remained at historically high levels, resulting in elevated pricing power to new and existing customers. Despite very difficult comparables, the strong market fundamentals and our team's ability to execute give us the confidence to guide to double-digit same-store revenue growth again in 2022, and FFO growth of over 13% at the midpoint. In light of this strength, we raised our dividend to $1.50 per share, a 50% increase year-over-year. We are off to a great start in 2022, and we expect another exceptional year for Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of the details of performance in the fourth quarter as well as our 2022 guidance. Great. Thank you, Elvis. So we saw a good number of kind of year-end tax motivated transactions come in the fourth quarter, and we were able to execute on those. Most of them -- almost all of them were single properties or groupings of a very small number of properties. We also were able to do 1 larger portfolio where we were not the high bidder on the portfolio. But through OP units and shares, we were able to offer the seller some tax deferment, which allowed us to capture that transaction as well. Looking forward, our target of 5 -- or guidance of $500 million is an assumption. We're pretty far along the way to getting there. If there are opportunities to do more deals. We certainly have lots and lots of different capital sources and debt capacity to do it, and we'll do it. But what's in our guidance is $500 million. So almost all of our fourth quarter acquisitions were unstabilized lease-up deals. And on a wholly owned basis, first year yield -- and this is fully loaded. This includes cost to manage, CapEx, tax reassessment, our expense structure was in the was in the low to mid-3s first year. And we stabilized in the mid-5s and a little over little over a year, maybe 15 to 17 months with average stabilization for those deals. When you do those same deals in a joint venture structure, you can add 200 basis points to 225 basis points to those numbers. So first year in the mid-5s and stabilizing in the high 7s. Sure, Juan. So the short answer is we believe that the lifting of the state of emergencies in California will give us about 50 basis points across the portfolio in lift. And obviously, there's a lot of assumptions to go into this, primarily what's the length of stay, the future length of stay of the tenants that have gotten these increases. So our guidance assumes 50 basis points. Yes. Yes. So clearly, a strong 2021 influences performance in 2022 for a number of reasons. One is we have very high occupancy, which gives us pricing power, particularly when we still see a strong demand with no diminution in demand. Secondly, as rates go up and we put new tenants in, that takes a while to flow into -- that rent roll takes a while to flow into performance. So as we put tenants in the later half of 2021, that helps gives us a rise throughout 2022. And then we already mentioned ECRI. But you're right that even with the strong performance that we expect throughout the year, our comps are tougher at the back half of the year. So the rate of growth will moderate even though we should have strong performance throughout the year. Are you able to help kind of frame it? Like do we start the year at kind of the high end of the guidance and at the low end of the guidance or the kind of the difference line in? Or will the difference be greater than that? So with respect to ECRI, we're coming off a period where it was really unusual, where we voluntarily stopped where we were restricted by the government for a long time, where we had outsized rent growth, which increased the gap between what people were paying in current street rate. I would imagine in '22, we would get back to a more normalized protocol for ECRI. What was the second half of the question? Do you remember, Scott? Can you repeat the second half of the question? I'm sorry. Yes. So -- and I'm sorry, I made you repeat that question. I think we're always trying to maximize revenue and not bread on the shelf. So I don't think we are planning to create vacancy. So we'll have more vacancy in peak leasing season. We have natural churn every month and the ability to raise existing customers' rate increase. So we're trying to continuously maximize revenue, and not look at particular months of the year. So I think if you look at the pattern of acquisitions in any year, it's back-end loaded. I think there is a season -- normal seasonality. And it was probably more -- it was more pronounced this year. And we just saw more deals that made sense. We didn't change our underwriting or our discipline. We just happen to be able to capture more opportunities. And we do have more C of Os now. We did see more of those opportunities that made sense for us. But again, nowhere near where we were in '16, '17, '18. I would say both. I mean we always look to optimize our portfolio and either select markets or individual assets where we prefer to have less exposure. And to do so in a period of time where cap rates are at historic lows is very advantageous. We sold about half of our -- the sales we did last year into a venture where we were able to keep management, and some exposure to those assets. And the other rough half we sold out right, but we're able to keep management of 12 of the 14 properties. So I think it's both strategic play and also happen to be good market timing. I'm not sure if they're onetime in nature, but we're certainly making longer-term investments that don't have an immediate payoff. So our company is growing very fast. And we're making investments in infrastructure that will facilitate continued growth at the pace that we want. And we're also making certain technology and R&D investments that won't add anything in 2022. It will be long-term beneficial and accretive. The flip side, which I don't think is temporary or -- is the increasing payroll. I think we're just in a new payroll environment, and that's going to be ongoing in my opinion. Smedes, as I said earlier, I think there's a seasonality to this, and there's a natural slowdown early in the year. We are still the market for sale. I don't think quality is very different than it was last year and prior years. There's some stuff of good quality and some stuff of less quality. But I think your overall thesis is right. It's hard to imagine that the volume in 2022 will match 2021. That was just an enormous year in number of transactions. I'm talking about the industry, not necessarily for us. Sure. So length of stay has steadily increased from the beginning of the pandemic to now -- we're now at about 2/3 of our customers have been with than 1 year, and maybe 42% or 43% of our have been with us longer than 2 years, and those are absolute all-time highs. We've never had that level of long-term customers in the portfolio. . So we continue to see a moderation in supply. We look at store -- new deliveries that affect our stores. So we're not national statistics or markets that we're not in. And if you look over the last 3 years and into 2022, it's kind of been a steady moderation. 28% of our stores were affected by new supply in 2019; 23% in 2020; 20% in 2021. And our best projection is about 18% in 2022. So new supply hasn't gone away. Stores are still being delivered. We get the opportunity to manage an awful lot of those, which is a good thing for us. But it is moderating.  2023, I don't have any predictions for, yet. I am concerned that given the tremendous performance in the asset class and the amount of capital seeking exposure to storage that we'll see an uptick in new development. And we know how to manage through that. We've done that before, and will provide opportunities for us, either to manage stores or participate like our C of O deals or make bridge loans. But I would not at all be surprised to see this pattern of moderation of deliveries reverse itself in 2023. Well, we certainly track folks who vacate after they get rent increase notices from us, and that has increased over time.

Our outperformance relative to our guidance was driven by the property -- by property performance and higher-than-expected interest income partially offset by higher-than-expected interest expense. Our external growth in the quarter was capitalized by $210 million in sales proceeds from the disposition of 17 stores. We also issued $276 million in OP units, and we drew on our revolving lines of credit. Our balance sheet has never been stronger, and we will term out our revolving balances through future unsecured debt issuances. Currently, only 8% of our debt maturities over the next -- mature over the next 2 years. And our focus will be to lengthen our average debt maturity and to further ladder our maturing balances. Our unencumbered pool is now over $12 billion, and our net debt to trailing 12 EBITDA is at 5x. We continue to have access to many types of capital, giving us significant capacity for future growth. Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2022. Our new same-store pool includes a total of 870 stores, a relatively small net increase from last year with new additions partially offset by sites removed due to disposition or redevelopment. Same-store revenue is expected to increase 10.5% to 12.5% driven primarily by rate growth. Same-store expense growth is expected to be 6% to 7.5%, primarily driven by higher payroll, marketing expense and property tax expense. Our revenue and expense guidance results in a same-store net NOI range of 11.5% to 14.5%. The acquisition market continues to be competitive, and we will remain disciplined but opportunistic. We plan to continue our strategy of looking for off-market opportunities and plan to capitalize a portion of our acquisition volume with joint venture partners. Our guidance assumes $500 million in Extra Space investment, approximately half of which is already closed or under contract. We also expect to close $400 million of bridge loans and plan to retain $120 million in new balances in 2022. We have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders, and we will continue to be creative as we deploy capital in the sector. To support our 2021 and 2022 property growth, we made significant investments in our people, our infrastructure and our technology. This resulted in higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate a higher run rate in 2022. This is primarily driven by payroll and technology R&D, which will advance initiatives that will support our growth for years to come. The return of historical G&A expenses temporarily paused during the pandemic, also contributes to this increase. Our core FFO is estimated to be between $7.70 and $7.95 per share. We anticipate $0.23 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores up $0.12 from 2021 due to the significant acquisition volume of non-stabilized properties in the fourth quarter. Interest income will be somewhat weighted to the first quarter due to the timing of note sales and potential modification of our NexPoint investment. 2021 was a great year for Extra Space, and we are already on our way to another strong year in 2022. With that, let's turn it over to Victor to start our Q&A. Yes. I mean obviously, you prefer rates to be falling, but they're rising today. So part of our strategy has always been to have some component of variable rate debt. We typically have operated 20% to 30% variable rate debt. It gets a little higher when we have more drawn on our lines of credit, and we are terming some things out. This year, we have about $535 million drawn at the end of the year. So that caused us to be about 25% variable rate debt. As we look forward in ways that we hedge, one of the natural hedges that we do have is we do loan money. We have these bridge loans and different types of investments that are variable rate instruments. So there is somewhat of a natural hedge on a portion of that, but we also will look to term out our draws on our line of credit this year through the bond market. Juan, our guidance assumes close to 7% on the payroll number, and that is not only wage inflation, but that is operating more closer to fully staffed. Last year, you actually had negative payroll and so it's a really tough comp. And then property taxes, we're assuming about 5.5% growth. And then marketing, about 10% growth. Yes. So we obviously finished the fourth quarter really strong. So we would expect the first quarter to be our strongest quarter. We would expect our first quarter to be really good. I mean we don't see it moving down significantly, partly because you had easier comps from last year. And then that rate of growth declines throughout the year as we get tougher comps. We don't expect rates necessarily to go backwards, and we expect to have pricing power but the comp to be more difficult, therefore, the rate of growth to decline as we move through the year. So we'll see in terms of street rate growth for the year. I can tell you a little bit about our assumptions, and what we're seeing in the first quarter. So our achieved rates in the first quarter so far have been very similar to the fourth quarter. Our achieved rates were up 20% in the fourth quarter. We're seeing that into this year. We haven't seen significant degradation in occupancy. Our occupancy is slightly below where we were before. Our rate of growth will slow in terms of street rates. And what I mean by that is we pushed rates as much as 20% to 40% depending on the month, depending on the comp from the prior year. We don't expect that in 2022. So we don't necessarily look -- think that we will decrease rates, but we do not expect that kind of growth in 2022. They're going to be better in the first quarter than in the back half of the year. I think that's really all we can provide. And part of that has to do with the comp in the front half versus the back half of the year. So make sure I understand the question. You're trying to understand where in addition to the property NOI, where the growth is coming from. Is that -- for the contribution outside of non same-store or the property? Yes. Maybe the best way to think of it, Todd, is if you take the same-store performance, which we've given and look at your NOI there, you're at the midpoint, your 13 -- and then you look at the FFO growth and our FFO growth is slightly higher than that. So effectively, all of the non-same-store properties are contributing to the level that the G&A is going up, that your interest expense is going up. So it's effectively a wash. So the non-same store is awash in terms of offsetting the other increases. So you have several other increases happening here. You have G&A going up. You have interest expense going up, and then you have an additional amount of dilution from some of the lease-up stores that we bought at the end of last year. We have $0.23 this year versus our dilution from last year. So management fees and tenant insurance both increased by the increase in joint ventures from last year as well as an additional 100 stores net is what our guidance assumes for next year. Your spread, it's slightly negative. I'm trying to -- the best way to explain it, we have 2 different numbers. You have a -- you're about negative 40 bps year-over-year, but you're also comparing a new same-store pool. So just want to make sure we're not solving for the exact amount. And again, we're not solving for occupancy. And so we view this as still being in a really good spot. But when we're at 94.6% today, and we're pushing rates as hard as we are -- occupancy is 1 component of this. That's correct. Yes. So without giving exact occupancy, I can maybe just give you a little bit of input. We're not assuming that we get a benefit from occupancy in 2022. Last year, in 2021, I think we got 250 basis points of benefit from occupancy. And then I believe we're ending the year slightly negative to where we're starting -- where we ended the year this year. But again, no benefit that we experienced in 2021. And so we do see occupancy is still being strong in 2022. So I would say it is higher than it has been historically. And in terms of getting into the details of what we're investing in things like that, we feel like it's probably not something we'd talk about on a public call because we feel like it's something that gives us a potentially competitive advantage. Yes. It's not impacting us as of now."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Norman, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Sir the floor is yours.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Juana. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's third quarter 2021 earnings call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Well, we had an exciting quarter. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Among other accomplishments we celebrated the addition of store number 2,000 to our portfolio. We were recognized by Inside Self Storage as the Best Third-Party Management Company in the industry. And we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company's history. Same-store occupancy once again, reached a new all-time high during the quarter at over 97%, with vacates continuing at lower than historic levels. Our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power. Achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43% higher than 2020 levels and 41% greater than 2019 levels. In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continue to be lifted throughout the country. Other income improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. We had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates, but their impact was offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 18.4% up 480 basis point acceleration from Q2. And same-store NOI growth of 27.8% an acceleration of 760 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool resulting in FFO growth of 41.2%. Turning to external growth, the acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view. Our investment team has never been busier and we have found the most success acquiring lease-up properties and/or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner. While most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites the total is adding up, allowing us to increase our investment guidance to $700 million for the year. Also, our approach has resulted in better than market average yields. But we are much more focused on FFO per share accretion than total acquisition volume. And we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment. We continue to look at all material transactions in the market, and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. We had an incredibly strong quarter on the third-party management front, adding 96 stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. It is worth mentioning that oftentimes we are the buyer of these properties and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another. In the quarter we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the REIT or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third-party platform through September. Fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook, allowing us to raise our annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint. While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation, it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer's peak. Our revised guidance now assumes 200 basis point moderation, which would result in 2021 year-end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020. We expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe. And hello everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. Core FFO for the quarter was a $1.85 per share a year-over-year increase of 41.2%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. As a result of our strong FFO growth, our Board of Directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25% after already raising it 11% earlier this year, a total increase of 38.9% over the third quarter 2020 dividend. We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter, including a 3% savings in payroll, 42% savings in marketing and a 4% decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals. Despite the payroll savings we've enjoyed this year, like most companies, we have felt material wage pressure across all markets, including our corporate office. Some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time required to fill vacant positions. We will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022, as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry. This will also impact our G&A expense. In the second quarter, we completed our inaugural investment grade public bond offering, and we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter, issuing another $600 million, 10-year bond at a rate of 2.35%. We also refiled our ATM in the quarter and we have $800 million in availability. Our access to capital has never been stronger. And between net operating income and disposition proceeds, our leverage continues to be reduced. Our quarter-end net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.5 times giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings. Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 12.5% to 13.5%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to negative 1% to zero, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 18% to 19.5%. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better than expected rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.75 to $6.85 per share, due to stronger lease-up performance we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.12 to $0.11. Even after adding a number of additional lease-up properties to our acquisition pipeline, we're excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio. As we often say, it's a great time to be in storage. With that, let's turn it over to Joanna to start our Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Given the strength in the \u2013 that you've had year-to-date and exceeding expectations. Just curious if you could speak to the earn-in as we start to think about 2022 if you assume kind of occupancy hold steady versus what you've achieved year-to-date and/or how did you guys think about that?\nJoe Margolis: So it's always important to remember and we've talked about this before that occupancy is just one metric. So if occupancy does better than what we've assumed for our guidance, I assume we'd also have good rate pressure or rate power and we would be set up to have a strong 2022.\nJuan Sanabria: But is there any way to estimate given the results you've had to-date and how much of the portfolio has had the rate increases in given average length of stay? What's kind of locked in to start the year next year, given results to-date?\nJoe Margolis: So, I mean, we'll certainly make all of those estimates and come up with guidance for 2022. And talk about that early in the first quarter next year.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And then just a more strategic big picture question. You guys talked about the acquisitions environment being very heady at this point and prefer to do kind of singles and doubles and working with joint venture partners, but given the scale, you're now 2000 stores, any interest in pursuing development on balance sheet and building out the capabilities in-house?\nJoe Margolis: So yes, to the first part of that question, we're not adverse to pursuing development on balance sheet. We have a very small number of developments underway or that we're committed. Two, we believe for us. And I know other companies executed a different way, which makes sense for them. The best way for us to do development is with joint venture partners, where we can be the partner with the best local or regional developer who brings their particular local skills and something that we don't have across the country. And the other advantage that gives us is through structure. We can allocate the specific risks of development entitlement risk, cost risk, delay risk, completion risk, fairly between the development partner, not in ours. So we don't take all of those risks when those are frankly, more in the development partner\u2019s control. So we believe development is a great way to make money in any real estate business. We believe if it's structured, right, you can control the risk and we believe it's very important to make sure you're in the right time in the market cycle to be heavy in the development business.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks Joe.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Your line is open. Michael, if you are on mute, please unmute. Your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Same-store revenue growth for the year is now expecting to be 12.5%, 13.5%. That implies something in the fourth quarter. That's above what you saw in the first half of the year, but maybe you slower than the third quarter. So the comparison from last year and the fourth quarter may be 400 basis points for difficult. So how much of the implied slowdown in same-store revenue growth is a reflection of starting to lap more difficult comparisons compared to underlying trends and how much of an impact should this more difficult comparison to have going forward?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So you hit it right on the head in that the fourth quarter is a much more difficult comp. If you look at where \u2013 if you're looking back to 2020, I mean second quarter, we had negative rates. Third quarter, we moved to low to mid single-digit, achieved rate growth. In the third quarter, we had close to double-digit rate growth. And in the fourth quarter, we really started moving rates significantly, so much more difficult comp in the fourth quarter. In addition, some of the occupancy goes away, the occupancy benefit we're expecting occupancy at the end of the year to be flat, but to still have a positive occupancy benefit, but not as strong and \u2013 as what we had in the second and third quarter. But most of it is from rate and to comp.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And how much of your portfolio now is up near these kind of new market rates of set another way, like how much upside is last from passing along ECRI is when marking your existing customer portfolio up to these market rates?\nJoe Margolis: Okay. So I think we\u2019ve made up most of the room. There\u2019s still some states where we\u2019re limited. And as rates go up, the gap continues, but I would say most of it\u2019s in the rear view mirror.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And if we could just touch on costs for a second, the costs were well contained in the quarter, same-store expenses were down 4%. Those of the decline was driven primarily by lower marketing like as we look forward, are there any expense items that could pressure the business? You mentioned payroll insurance was a big, can you kind of walk through kind of where you see expense fresher and kind of to the extent that you can talk about the magnitude of that, that\u2019d be extremely helpful.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Let me maybe start with property taxes. I mean, we had a negative quarterly comp and that\u2019s not going to continue. Property taxes we would expect to grow in the 5% to 6% range. As we continue to see pressure and I think that\u2019s partly with lower cap rates, higher valuations. We would expect municipalities to continue to assess. We would expect that to continue into next year. We \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re not ready to give guidance on property taxes, but that will continue. The second one I would point to is marketing. We wouldn\u2019t expect it to be down 40% again this year. We would expect next year to maybe be a little bit more normal and it\u2019s a lever we will use as we see opportunities to grow our revenues by using marketing. The third one, I would point to just because of the size of the expenses payroll. So this year we\u2019ve had a negative payroll comp and it\u2019s been by us being proactive, partly so we\u2019ve done things to decrease hours to optimize our payroll, but we\u2019ve also had some what I would call a negative benefit. And what I mean by that is we\u2019ve seen our payroll go down, because we\u2019ve had higher turnover and we\u2019ve had longer time to fill. So not necessarily a good thing. We\u2019ve had lower payroll as a result of that. We continue to see pressure on wages. So that\u2019s at the stores, that\u2019s in our corporate office and we would expect that to be \u2013 we would expect that to continue into next year. I think every company in America is experiencing that. The other thing I would point to on the expense side is it\u2019s a good thing to be in storage. And what I mean by that is we\u2019re in a high margin business. So payroll, for instance, even if we see significant payroll and payroll pressure, you\u2019re still sub 6% as a percentage of revenues. And so if you\u2019re an inflationary market, we do have the ability to push our rates as their month-to-month leases.\nMichael Goldsmith: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question is from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Just the first question following-up on rates, in place versus street. Joe, you said your efforts in the quarter on rate increases helped to bring in place customer ends closer to street. What\u2019s the spread look like today? And can you remind us what that spread between in place and street rates looked like sort of back in 2019, maybe before the pandemic or maybe on average over the shorter the tenure period perhaps heading into the pandemic?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So it\u2019s seasonal as you know, and it\u2019s our spread is the highest in the summer. I think it was the high teens when we had our last call. It\u2019s closer to flat to slightly positive 1% now. And if you look historically, we would be negative now.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And right, so you\u2019ve \u2013 historically, you\u2019ve increased in place customer rents above street rates. And so where did that sort of peak in the prior cycle?\nJoe Margolis: Todd, would you just repeat that please? You\u2019re saying\u2026\nTodd Thomas: So you\u2019ve increased in place customer rent above street historically, right and which resulted in the negative spread that you\u2019ve historically had. What was that spread like in sort of when \u2013 where did that spread peak in the prior cycle? I guess I\u2019m trying to understand how much room you might have on the in place customer rent increase program to take contractual rents higher, even if asking rents are sort of flattish from here on a seasonally adjusted basis.\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So I think the other factor you may not be picking up is street rates can go down. So it\u2019s not on the increasing existing customers that causes the gap. It\u2019s street rates are the highest in the summer and they have a seasonal decline. And that, that causes some of the gaps. Scott, do you know off the top of your head, the percentage that he\u2019s looking for in prior years?\nScott Stubbs: Don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a number we\u2019ve ever given, Todd. We\u2019ve always referred to in place versus street. We\u2019ve talked how they\u2019re \u2013 they go in a cycle where you peak in the summer in terms of that gap. It\u2019s typically high-single digits in the summer that gap, and then it goes maybe high-single digits in the winter. So you peak in July, you bought them out in February. This year we peaked 19%, as Joe mentioned, we\u2019re typically starting to go negative now. We have as our street rates are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. All right. And then just with regards to the in place customer rent increases that you\u2019re passing through, can you talk about the magnitude or rate growth that you\u2019re pushing through to customers and whether you\u2019ve changed the frequency of those rent increases that eligible customers are receiving? I think it historically has been sort of month five, and then maybe every nine months thereafter or something to that extent. Is that still the schedule or has that changed at all?\nJoe Margolis: Yes, so we\u2019re very unusual times, right. We had significantly discounted rates during the height of COVID and brought in people at some really low rates. And then we had government restrictions that prevented us from moving those folks through, where we thought they should be. And the third factor is we had really impressive street rate growth. So that caused us to have some customers that had very, very large gaps between where they were at what street rate was. And we\u2019ve been trying to move those customers more towards street rate. And as I said, in the earlier question, we\u2019ve done a lot of that. Most of that is in the rear view mirror. But that\u2019s kind of led us to have experience and numbers that are very different than our historical practice, because we\u2019re not in normal times.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Tood.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, good morning team. I guess, first with rent per square foot continuing to rise. How price sensitive are you finding customers? And do you have an idea, what portion of move-outs today are due to price and how that compares versus history? Just wondering if it\u2019s gone up at all as rates have also increased.\nJoe Margolis: Yes. Very, very, very modestly. We track move out of customers who didn\u2019t \u2013 did not receive rate increase notices. And as you can tell by our occupancy, the customers are not very price sensitive and those are \u2013 who are, we\u2019re able to backfill very, very quickly.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then on the cash flow growth side, it\u2019s obviously been very strong, which has reduced your leverage. And you guys mentioned earlier that it\u2019s now 4.5 times. So what\u2019s your view on being able to kind of redeploy capital in an attractive way, of course, to get leverage above five times? Is that something that you want to do?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I would love to be able to invest more and increase our leverage back towards our targeted rate, but \u2013 our targeted range, but not at the expense of doing deals that we don\u2019t think are good on long-term deals for our investors. So we\u2019re going to remain discipline. We look at everything out there. Our investment teams, as I said, are really busy. We have a lot of exciting things, where we\u2019re playing with. But we\u2019re not going to invest just to get our leverage up. We\u2019re only going to invest, when we think the risk reward is attracted to us.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. I guess, that\u2019s a good position to be in. Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is open.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the acquisition volumes, and obviously, they\u2019ve come up a lot as we\u2019ve \u2013 from what your expectations were coming into the year. And we\u2019ve seen that across the industry in general. And I mean, besides favorable pricing for sellers, what do you think are a few things that are kind of driving more folks to come to market? Is there any sort of theme that you\u2019re seeing when we talk to the sellers?\nJoe Margolis: Well, clearly the first and most important is what you mentioned is, very favorable pricing, very low cap rates that brings people out of the woodwork wanting to sell. I think there\u2019s also some concern that the tax regime is going to change. And that maybe it\u2019s better to pay your taxes now than in the future.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. So just those, I mean, okay, nothing else in particular. I was just wondering, if you felt like independence or losing their \u2013 the competitive advantages of these larger portfolios that they get bigger and bigger as maybe impacting, but you think it\u2019s probably more sort of tax and pricing that\u2019s driving that.\nJoe Margolis: I do, Smedes.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And I wanted to ask you as well, just in terms of given that fundamentals are so strong. Has it changed at all, sort of level of inbound inquiries into bringing you on as a third party manager? I mean, there are other folks that are not part of these larger systems doing sort of similarly as well and are maybe not as inclined to come to you for management or how \u2013 are there any changes there, I guess?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I mean, Smedes, doing it right on the head. If you look at the consolidation in the industry, four or five years ago versus now, it\u2019s up almost 50%, maybe from the low-20s to the low-30s percent of stores in the country are owned or managed by the big public companies. And we\u2019ve seen that significantly and we brought on 96 stores in our third-party management platform in the third quarter, 196 through the year. There\u2019s been a lot of sales of which we bought a bunch, but we\u2019re still over 100 net growth in our third-party management platform. And that\u2019s a mix of the single one-off owner, who wants professional management or more quasi institutional partners, who we have good relations with and keep growing their portfolio. So it\u2019s the growth in that business across all types of owners has been really, really strong and I expect it to continue to be so.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then just final question from us. You mentioned your guidance underwrites about 200 basis points of occupancy declines through the fall, I think, or the winter. Have you started to see that moderation in October, so far to-date?\nJoe Margolis: So today we\u2019re sitting at 96.7% occupancy. So we\u2019ve had pretty modest vacates or decline in occupancy since June 30, but \u2013 or September 30th. So that\u2019s where we are today.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Samir Khanal of Evercore. Your line is open.\nSamir Khanal: Hey, good afternoon. So when I look at your occupancy for some of the major gateway markets, it has not been impacted at the end of September. What sort of the return to work factor in place. I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that dynamic of return to office and the impact it can have in your portfolio in some of the major markets, whether it\u2019s New York or Boston or even kind of the LA area, maybe in 4Q and into next year.\nJoe Margolis: So I think it\u2019s a little early to really call that. I mean, the first thing I think it\u2019s important for everyone to remember is all our markets are doing phenomenally well. If you look at our bottom five markets for revenue growth, they\u2019re all above 13%. So there\u2019s no market that\u2019s really struggling. But our bottom markets do include New York and Boston and L.A. and San Francisco. And there\u2019s a lot of variables I think, between the stronger markets and the weaker markets. A couple of things that we think are consistent is markets that had state of emergencies in place longer, and they\u2019re just coming out are performing a less well than other markets.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. And then I guess, my second question is, Joe, given the \u2013 given where you are from an occupancy standpoint. I mean, it\u2019s sort of that 96%, 97%, how are you thinking about your strategy in terms of pricing, let\u2019s say going into the next six months, right? Or how are you managing the business differently, given the level of occupancy today versus sort of pre-COVID here?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So we don\u2019t really look six months out, our models, our pricing units in stores every day and we\u2019ll react on a daily basis to not only what\u2019s going on, but what is projected to go on. So clearly in an environment where we\u2019re 96.7%, we\u2019re going to reduce marketing expenses and we\u2019re going to keep the gas pressed on rates.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. So when you look at where your rates are versus your micro sub-market, your first your competitors, where are you today versus your competitors and how has that changed a whole lot over the past year or so?\nScott Stubbs: I think everybody has higher rates today. We\u2019re on the higher end. When we look at them compared to 2019, as Joe mentioned, our rates are up 40%, our achieved rates in the third quarter were 40% above where they were in 2019. So, I think everybody\u2019s pushing rates, we are pushing rates as our occupancy stays strong and as that demand stays strong.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. And going back to the topic about submarket performance. I know you mentioned some locations that had to stay at \u2013 the kind of governmental orders that restrict the rent growth having a different impact on these markets. But how much of the performance difference between submarket is being driven by simply population migration? And do those markets \u2013 I saw an influx in population, do they just have a longer tail than the New York Times or Cisco\u2019s?\nJoe Margolis: Yes, it\u2019s really hard for us to divide performance to disaggregate performance between population movement and stay-at-home orders and new \u2013 effective new supply. It\u2019s really hard to figure out how much each of those variables and many, many other variables contribute to the performance of different markets.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Got it. And I got to squeeze on a quick third one. You\u2019re talking about the payroll increases that we should expect going forward. Like what kind of magnitude were you thinking?\nJoe Margolis: So I would say greater than inflation.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nKi Bin Kim: I won\u2019t give you a specific number because that\u2019s the Ray Scott will then ask for.\nOperator: Your next question is from Elvis Rodriguez of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nElvis Rodriguez: Hi, and thank you for taking the questions. Congratulations on the quarter. What\u2019s your update on the supply outlook in your markets through 2022 now that we\u2019re an extra quarter from your last update?\nJoe Margolis: So our projections for 2021 from our last update is actually slightly higher. I think the last quarter we said three-year rolling 2019 to 2021 was about 70% of our same-store pool is going to be effected or our stores. And that\u2019s up to about 73%. So a little bit of an increase. 2022 we see a larger decline three-year roll in 2021 and 2022, we think about 64.5% of our stores are going to be affected. And we\u2019ll continue to gather that data and get better. But we do see moderation in 2022. My concern is given the great, great performance of the sector, the amount of capital that wants exposure to storage, low interest rates, that we are going to get ourselves back into a development cycle. And the line will start to go in the other direction maybe in 2023 and beyond. Now that\u2019s not all bad, right? Development creates bridge loan and management and acquisition and development participation opportunities for us. But it\u2019s also a challenge for the stores that have new supply coming in their trade area. And we\u2019ll manage through that just like we manage through the last cycle.\nElvis Rodriguez: Great. And then just a follow-up question on the bond deals. So you\u2019ve got better pricing and longer-term this time around, your leverage is also lower quarter-over-quarter. How are you thinking about funding your business going forward? You didn\u2019t issue any equity in the quarter. So just curious on how you think about using those levers specifically since you started using the bond market this year. Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. We\u2019re kind of in a unique market where we have a lot of good options. You have cheap debt, you have a stock price that\u2019s holding up and we\u2019ve always said we\u2019d use equity if we have a place to put it in the near-term. So far this year, we haven\u2019t had a great place to put equity and we\u2019ve been de-levering as our NOI has grown and as we had some sales into joint ventures or outright sales. So, I think, equity is always an option, but I think we\u2019ll look to the debt markets first.\nElvis Rodriguez: Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Spenser Allaway of Green Street. Your line is open.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. In terms of the occupancy losses that you\u2019re assuming for the full year, can you just talk about which consumer segments you expect could drive this? For instance, I know that college students have recently contributed to occupancy moves. So, I\u2019m just curious if you have a view on what might cause some of deterioration moving forward?\nJoe Margolis: So, clearly as was mentioned earlier, if a return to work, picks up people come back to the major cities that could cause some loss in occupancy. I don\u2019t think that everyone who established a home office or an extra room is going to automatically reverse that. So, I think it will be gradual. Other than that, I think it\u2019s kind of a normal churn of storage, right? The most of our customers are somewhere in the moving process. And when, at some point after they\u2019re done moving, they don\u2019t need storage anymore. They eventually get around tempting their stuff up. So other than that kind of returned to office, returned to the big city. I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be anything unusual.\nJeff Norman: Spencer, the other thing I would maybe add is, we have a 200 basis point assumption in there, that\u2019s based somewhat off historical trends. We\u2019re kind of in an odd year this year. It seems like everything that\u2019s happened in the past hasn\u2019t necessarily happened this year. So it\u2019s a number, it\u2019s our assumption, I think that we\u2019ll see how it plays out.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thank you. And then just given residential space is the closest substitute to storage from a consumer standpoint, do you think that rising residential prices have contributed to your pricing power? I\u2019m just curious if this is something that you guys pay attention to or have absorbed over the years?\nJoe Margolis: So, I think the theory is sound right. If it gets more expensive to rent a larger apartment, people may rent a smaller apartment, and use storage, it makes sense and we see anecdotal evidence of it. We don\u2019t have a whole lot of data where we can correlate, rising real estate pricing and demand for storage. And I think we need more time and more data before we be real specific about that.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay, thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller: Yes. Hi, thanks. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s the pace of lease up that you\u2019re seeing in your C of O properties and when you\u2019re underwriting new transactions today, for those types of deals, what sort of yields are you underwriting to?\nJoe Margolis: So the pace of lease up is faster. I mean, one of the things we pointed to in my comments was that we have less dilution this year than we originally forecasted. That\u2019s largely to do with the pace lease up. It also has to do with rates being higher. We continue to look at C of O. I think that those very wildly by market and by how far out they are. Yes, some of the recent things that we\u2019ve approved this year have been 7.5 range, but I think that we are also looking at where we are in a cycle and trying to make sure that we risk adjust for that too.\nMike Mueller: Got it. So back to the pace, so for thinking about underwriting to a stabilization, is it around a four-year timeframe you\u2019re thinking about, and you\u2019re seeing?\nJoe Margolis: We haven\u2019t changed our assumptions in terms of lease up. So even though we\u2019ve benefited from shorter lease up, we recognize that that can change. It can also change depending on new supply in the market. We try to look at what\u2019s coming in the specific market we\u2019re looking at, but the markets are dynamic and so we assume historical norms in terms of lease up of those properties.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rob Simone of Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is open.\nRob Simone: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Hope all as well. I had a question about the management platform to the degree, you\u2019re able to answer it. So, you guys are over 800, I have some place close to 830 strictly third-party managed stores now and close to 1,100 in total, I guess, what is the long-term target if there is one and what\u2019s kind of the path to get there. And the reason why I asked that if I look at your property management fees, as a percentage of your G&A, it\u2019s starting to trend back up over a longer timeframe towards like the 70% range, meaning you\u2019re getting closer to effectively paying for your corporate layer with fees. And I guess, from like a structural premium standpoint, even though you guys had already had one, I\u2019m curious, like how you guys think about like getting to that number or eclipsing it. I think it\u2019s like $63 million on a $100 million now. And kind of how could that gap narrow over time?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So good question. Thank you. So, we don\u2019t target a number of stores. We\u2019re not trying to get to a 1000 or 2000 or whatever number you want to think of. What\u2019s important for us is, we maintain our profitability by we can get a lot more stores if we reduced our fees, but we want to maintain our profitability. And we also want to have the right stores, right. A store with an owner that plans to hold for 10 years is of much more value to us than a store where it\u2019s a developer and they\u2019re going to build it and flip it. A store in a $40 market is much more valuable to us than a store in a $9 market. So, we\u2019re really focused on the economics and the relationships that this business brings to us, as opposed to the outright number of stores. And if keeping within that discipline of maintaining our margins, we can grow the management fee revenue that it covers our G&A, or more than covers our G&A. We\u2019re going to grow it as big as we can.\nRob Simone: Yes. So it\u2019s kind of like a lifetime value of the customer concept as opposed to just straight growing the top line. That's I think that's what you're saying. \nJoe Margolis: That's it.\nRob Simone: Got it. Okay. Yes, it makes sense. And I don't know, is there a time to ask one more? I don't want to take too much of your guys' time.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nRob Simone: Okay. Sure. Yeah. So I guess as it relates to an earlier question, so with, I mean your rental rates are flying off the page here, right? It's obvious to everybody, I guess, how do you guys internally think about your customers, \u201clike propensity\u201d or where with all to pay? I mean, I know it's spread over thousands of leases or, tens of thousands of leases even, but do you guys look at like, how income to rent eight ratios change, or I'm just curious how you guys think about that. Like, in terms of what's like the upside and longer customers where with all to like continue paying higher rates.\nJoe Margolis: So a couple of things, one is we have over 1.2 million customers, so we're highly, highly granular on this topic. Secondly, when storage gets more expensive and our tenants complain, they can't afford our store managers are really good about talking to them about, do you really need a 10/10? Or can we get you into a 10/5 or maybe a unit that's upstairs further away. So we can have other tools to solve their problems. Third is if it does get more expensive and they move out, that's not a problem for us today. We have plenty of demand to backfill their space. And then lastly, most of our customers don't think they're staying very long. Now they end up staying about 50% longer than they think they're staying. But most of them that added cost they believe is temporary and they can swallow hard. It's only those real long, long-term tenants that you have that more of that problem.\nRob Simone: Got it. Okay. Thanks, I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kevin Stein of Stifel. Your line is open.\nKevin Stein: Hey, good morning guys. So revenue accelerated in the same store quite a bit since 2Q and I was just wondering if there's any maybe like new demand drivers, or if it's just, the existing demand drivers that are increasing, or if it's just more of your confidence in being able to increase rental rates more. Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So I would tell you, it's steady demand combined with low vacate. So people are staying longer today. The people that have rented with us have been sticky. So I think we did see an increase in demand last year. We saw, if we look, ask our customers why they said they were out of space, if you ask them today, that's moved back more towards I'm moving. So, those are kind of the reasons they give for moving or for storing with us and vacate throughout this entire period have been very, very low. So we have less units that need to be rented each month because people are staying longer and vacating less today.\nKevin Stein: Okay. Do you have a sense of, so I guess like I'm not sure what your average wanting to stay, but for the industry is maybe like 15, 16 months. So I guess that imply like roughly 7% of customers will be moving out on average. Do you know, like how many, or do you give a number on how many or what percentage of your portfolio turns over in a month?\nJoe Margolis: We haven't, and that's going to vary by property type. So what I mean by that is a new property is going to have a much shorter length of stay than a property that's 30 years old. You have more and more long-term customers of that, a much lower churn. What we have seen is churn has gone down through COVID so that, if you're referring to 7%, it's lower than that. And it continues to go lower as the vacates are lower.\nKevin Stein: Okay, thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just a quick question on just E-rentals. Can you just remind us what percentage is coming through that channel and maybe have you seen anything different from that customer relative to the rest of the portfolio? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So we're at about 25% today. We were, I think, 20 or 21 at our last cost. So we've seen a slight increase in customer's use of that channel customers report very high satisfaction rates with it. So that's good for us. And there's really not a very meaningful difference in the customer that I could describe to you.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. That's all my questions. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks.\nJeff Norman: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Hey, one more for me, you're going to get a $100 million back of your preferred investment from JCAP, maybe as early as next week, how you go about replacing the investments 4% return. And what do you plan on doing with the funds?\nScott Stubbs: Yeah, so we are going to continue doing what we've been doing, which we'll continue to look for are a Bridge loan opportunities, will continue to invest both on a wholly owned and a joint venture basis. And when unique opportunities come up like that, a preferred investment we'll consider those as well.\nMichael Goldsmith: Great. Thank you guys\nOperator: Speakers, I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thank you everyone for participating today, we appreciate your interest in Extra Space Storage. We're really happy to report the results that we've been able to report this quarter. And the only reason we can do it is because of the hard work of all the folks at Extra Space, starting with the folks in the store who deal with the customers every day, but also all the people in the call center and here in the corporate office, I'm extraordinarily proud of them and their dedication and hard work. So thank you. I hope you and all your families are well, take care.\nOperator: Thank you, Speakers. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Well, we had an exciting quarter. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Among other accomplishments we celebrated the addition of store number 2,000 to our portfolio. We were recognized by Inside Self Storage as the Best Third-Party Management Company in the industry. And we achieved some of the strongest operating results in our company's history. Same-store occupancy once again, reached a new all-time high during the quarter at over 97%, with vacates continuing at lower than historic levels. Our strong occupancy resulted in exceptional pricing power. Achieved rates to new customers in the quarter were 43% higher than 2020 levels and 41% greater than 2019 levels. In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as state of emergency rate restrictions continue to be lifted throughout the country. Other income improved significantly year-over-year, primarily due to increased late fees contributing 30 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. We had modestly higher discounts due to higher street rates, but their impact was offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 18.4% up 480 basis point acceleration from Q2. And same-store NOI growth of 27.8% an acceleration of 760 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool resulting in FFO growth of 41.2%. Turning to external growth, the acquisition market remains very active but expensive in our view. Our investment team has never been busier and we have found the most success acquiring lease-up properties and/or acquiring stores with the joint venture partner. While most of our transactions have been in relatively small bites the total is adding up, allowing us to increase our investment guidance to $700 million for the year. Also, our approach has resulted in better than market average yields. But we are much more focused on FFO per share accretion than total acquisition volume. And we plan to continue to be selective in the current environment. We continue to look at all material transactions in the market, and we have plenty of capital to invest when we find opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. We had an incredibly strong quarter on the third-party management front, adding 96 stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. It is worth mentioning that oftentimes we are the buyer of these properties and they are simply moving from one ownership category to another. In the quarter we purchased 11 of our managed stores in the REIT or in a joint venture for a total of 30 stores purchased from our third-party platform through September. Fundamentals have remained even stronger than our already positive outlook, allowing us to raise our annual FFO guidance by $0.28 at the midpoint. While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation, it has been less than our initial estimate of 300 basis points from this summer's peak. Our revised guidance now assumes 200 basis point moderation, which would result in 2021 year-end occupancy generally similar to that of 2020. We expect continued strong growth in the fourth quarter to cap off what has been an incredible year for Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. So it's always important to remember and we've talked about this before that occupancy is just one metric. So if occupancy does better than what we've assumed for our guidance, I assume we'd also have good rate pressure or rate power and we would be set up to have a strong 2022. So, I mean, we'll certainly make all of those estimates and come up with guidance for 2022. And talk about that early in the first quarter next year. So yes, to the first part of that question, we're not adverse to pursuing development on balance sheet. We have a very small number of developments underway or that we're committed. Two, we believe for us. And I know other companies executed a different way, which makes sense for them. The best way for us to do development is with joint venture partners, where we can be the partner with the best local or regional developer who brings their particular local skills and something that we don't have across the country. And the other advantage that gives us is through structure. We can allocate the specific risks of development entitlement risk, cost risk, delay risk, completion risk, fairly between the development partner, not in ours. So we don't take all of those risks when those are frankly, more in the development partner's control. So we believe development is a great way to make money in any real estate business. We believe if it's structured, right, you can control the risk and we believe it's very important to make sure you're in the right time in the market cycle to be heavy in the development business. Thank you. Yes. So you hit it right on the head in that the fourth quarter is a much more difficult comp. If you look at where \u2013 if you're looking back to 2020, I mean second quarter, we had negative rates. Third quarter, we moved to low to mid single-digit, achieved rate growth. In the third quarter, we had close to double-digit rate growth. And in the fourth quarter, we really started moving rates significantly, so much more difficult comp in the fourth quarter. In addition, some of the occupancy goes away, the occupancy benefit we're expecting occupancy at the end of the year to be flat, but to still have a positive occupancy benefit, but not as strong and \u2013 as what we had in the second and third quarter. But most of it is from rate and to comp. Okay. So I think we've made up most of the room. There's still some states where we're limited. And as rates go up, the gap continues, but I would say most of it's in the rear view mirror. Thanks, Michael. Sure. So it's seasonal as you know, and it's our spread is the highest in the summer. I think it was the high teens when we had our last call. It's closer to flat to slightly positive 1% now. And if you look historically, we would be negative now. Todd, would you just repeat that please? You're saying... Yes. So I think the other factor you may not be picking up is street rates can go down. So it's not on the increasing existing customers that causes the gap. It's street rates are the highest in the summer and they have a seasonal decline. And that, that causes some of the gaps. Scott, do you know off the top of your head, the percentage that he's looking for in prior years? Yes, so we're very unusual times, right. We had significantly discounted rates during the height of COVID and brought in people at some really low rates. And then we had government restrictions that prevented us from moving those folks through, where we thought they should be. And the third factor is we had really impressive street rate growth. So that caused us to have some customers that had very, very large gaps between where they were at what street rate was. And we've been trying to move those customers more towards street rate. And as I said, in the earlier question, we've done a lot of that. Most of that is in the rear view mirror. But that's kind of led us to have experience and numbers that are very different than our historical practice, because we're not in normal times. Thanks, Tood. Yes. Very, very, very modestly. We track move out of customers who didn't \u2013 did not receive rate increase notices. And as you can tell by our occupancy, the customers are not very price sensitive and those are \u2013 who are, we're able to backfill very, very quickly. Yes. I would love to be able to invest more and increase our leverage back towards our targeted rate, but \u2013 our targeted range, but not at the expense of doing deals that we don't think are good on long-term deals for our investors. So we're going to remain discipline. We look at everything out there. Our investment teams, as I said, are really busy. We have a lot of exciting things, where we're playing with. But we're not going to invest just to get our leverage up. We're only going to invest, when we think the risk reward is attracted to us. Thank you. Well, clearly the first and most important is what you mentioned is, very favorable pricing, very low cap rates that brings people out of the woodwork wanting to sell. I think there's also some concern that the tax regime is going to change. And that maybe it's better to pay your taxes now than in the future. I do, Smedes. Yes. I mean, Smedes, doing it right on the head. If you look at the consolidation in the industry, four or five years ago versus now, it's up almost 50%, maybe from the low-20s to the low-30s percent of stores in the country are owned or managed by the big public companies. And we've seen that significantly and we brought on 96 stores in our third-party management platform in the third quarter, 196 through the year. There's been a lot of sales of which we bought a bunch, but we're still over 100 net growth in our third-party management platform. And that's a mix of the single one-off owner, who wants professional management or more quasi institutional partners, who we have good relations with and keep growing their portfolio. So it's the growth in that business across all types of owners has been really, really strong and I expect it to continue to be so. So today we're sitting at 96.7% occupancy. So we've had pretty modest vacates or decline in occupancy since June 30, but \u2013 or September 30th. So that's where we are today. So I think it's a little early to really call that. I mean, the first thing I think it's important for everyone to remember is all our markets are doing phenomenally well. If you look at our bottom five markets for revenue growth, they're all above 13%. So there's no market that's really struggling. But our bottom markets do include New York and Boston and L.A. and San Francisco. And there's a lot of variables I think, between the stronger markets and the weaker markets. A couple of things that we think are consistent is markets that had state of emergencies in place longer, and they're just coming out are performing a less well than other markets. Yes. So we don't really look six months out, our models, our pricing units in stores every day and we'll react on a daily basis to not only what's going on, but what is projected to go on. So clearly in an environment where we're 96.7%, we're going to reduce marketing expenses and we're going to keep the gas pressed on rates. Yes, it's really hard for us to divide performance to disaggregate performance between population movement and stay-at-home orders and new \u2013 effective new supply. It's really hard to figure out how much each of those variables and many, many other variables contribute to the performance of different markets. So I would say greater than inflation. So our projections for 2021 from our last update is actually slightly higher. I think the last quarter we said three-year rolling 2019 to 2021 was about 70% of our same-store pool is going to be effected or our stores. And that's up to about 73%. So a little bit of an increase. 2022 we see a larger decline three-year roll in 2021 and 2022, we think about 64.5% of our stores are going to be affected. And we'll continue to gather that data and get better. But we do see moderation in 2022. My concern is given the great, great performance of the sector, the amount of capital that wants exposure to storage, low interest rates, that we are going to get ourselves back into a development cycle. And the line will start to go in the other direction maybe in 2023 and beyond. Now that's not all bad, right? Development creates bridge loan and management and acquisition and development participation opportunities for us. But it's also a challenge for the stores that have new supply coming in their trade area. And we'll manage through that just like we manage through the last cycle. Thanks. So, clearly as was mentioned earlier, if a return to work, picks up people come back to the major cities that could cause some loss in occupancy. I don't think that everyone who established a home office or an extra room is going to automatically reverse that. So, I think it will be gradual. Other than that, I think it's kind of a normal churn of storage, right? The most of our customers are somewhere in the moving process. And when, at some point after they're done moving, they don't need storage anymore. They eventually get around tempting their stuff up. So other than that kind of returned to office, returned to the big city. I don't think there'll be anything unusual. So, I think the theory is sound right. If it gets more expensive to rent a larger apartment, people may rent a smaller apartment, and use storage, it makes sense and we see anecdotal evidence of it. We don't have a whole lot of data where we can correlate, rising real estate pricing and demand for storage. And I think we need more time and more data before we be real specific about that. Sure. So the pace of lease up is faster. I mean, one of the things we pointed to in my comments was that we have less dilution this year than we originally forecasted. That's largely to do with the pace lease up. It also has to do with rates being higher. We continue to look at C of O. I think that those very wildly by market and by how far out they are. Yes, some of the recent things that we've approved this year have been 7.5 range, but I think that we are also looking at where we are in a cycle and trying to make sure that we risk adjust for that too. We haven't changed our assumptions in terms of lease up. So even though we've benefited from shorter lease up, we recognize that that can change. It can also change depending on new supply in the market. We try to look at what's coming in the specific market we're looking at, but the markets are dynamic and so we assume historical norms in terms of lease up of those properties. Thank you. Yes. So good question. Thank you. So, we don't target a number of stores. We're not trying to get to a 1000 or 2000 or whatever number you want to think of. What's important for us is, we maintain our profitability by we can get a lot more stores if we reduced our fees, but we want to maintain our profitability. And we also want to have the right stores, right. A store with an owner that plans to hold for 10 years is of much more value to us than a store where it's a developer and they're going to build it and flip it. A store in a $40 market is much more valuable to us than a store in a $9 market. So, we're really focused on the economics and the relationships that this business brings to us, as opposed to the outright number of stores. And if keeping within that discipline of maintaining our margins, we can grow the management fee revenue that it covers our G&A, or more than covers our G&A. We're going to grow it as big as we can. That's it. Sure. So a couple of things, one is we have over 1.2 million customers, so we're highly, highly granular on this topic. Secondly, when storage gets more expensive and our tenants complain, they can't afford our store managers are really good about talking to them about, do you really need a 10/10? Or can we get you into a 10/5 or maybe a unit that's upstairs further away. So we can have other tools to solve their problems. Third is if it does get more expensive and they move out, that's not a problem for us today. We have plenty of demand to backfill their space. And then lastly, most of our customers don't think they're staying very long. Now they end up staying about 50% longer than they think they're staying. But most of them that added cost they believe is temporary and they can swallow hard. It's only those real long, long-term tenants that you have that more of that problem. Sure. Thanks, Rob. So I would tell you, it's steady demand combined with low vacate. So people are staying longer today. The people that have rented with us have been sticky. So I think we did see an increase in demand last year. We saw, if we look, ask our customers why they said they were out of space, if you ask them today, that's moved back more towards I'm moving. So, those are kind of the reasons they give for moving or for storing with us and vacate throughout this entire period have been very, very low. So we have less units that need to be rented each month because people are staying longer and vacating less today. We haven't, and that's going to vary by property type. So what I mean by that is a new property is going to have a much shorter length of stay than a property that's 30 years old. You have more and more long-term customers of that, a much lower churn. What we have seen is churn has gone down through COVID so that, if you're referring to 7%, it's lower than that. And it continues to go lower as the vacates are lower. Thanks, Kevin. So we're at about 25% today. We were, I think, 20 or 21 at our last cost. So we've seen a slight increase in customer's use of that channel customers report very high satisfaction rates with it. So that's good for us. And there's really not a very meaningful difference in the customer that I could describe to you. Thanks. Great. Thank you everyone for participating today, we appreciate your interest in Extra Space Storage. We're really happy to report the results that we've been able to report this quarter. And the only reason we can do it is because of the hard work of all the folks at Extra Space, starting with the folks in the store who deal with the customers every day, but also all the people in the call center and here in the corporate office, I'm extraordinarily proud of them and their dedication and hard work. So thank you. I hope you and all your families are well, take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe. And hello everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. Core FFO for the quarter was a $1.85 per share a year-over-year increase of 41.2%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. As a result of our strong FFO growth, our Board of Directors raised our third quarter dividend an additional 25% after already raising it 11% earlier this year, a total increase of 38.9% over the third quarter 2020 dividend. We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter, including a 3% savings in payroll, 42% savings in marketing and a 4% decrease in property taxes due to some successful appeals. Despite the payroll savings we've enjoyed this year, like most companies, we have felt material wage pressure across all markets, including our corporate office. Some of the payroll reduction has been the result of higher turnover and longer time required to fill vacant positions. We will experience continued payroll pressure in 2022, as we have raised wages to retain and recruit the best team in the storage industry. This will also impact our G&A expense. In the second quarter, we completed our inaugural investment grade public bond offering, and we completed a successful second offering in the third quarter, issuing another $600 million, 10-year bond at a rate of 2.35%. We also refiled our ATM in the quarter and we have $800 million in availability. Our access to capital has never been stronger. And between net operating income and disposition proceeds, our leverage continues to be reduced. Our quarter-end net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.5 times giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities while maintaining our credit ratings. Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 12.5% to 13.5%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to negative 1% to zero, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 18% to 19.5%. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better than expected rates, higher occupancy and lower payroll and marketing expense. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $6.75 to $6.85 per share, due to stronger lease-up performance we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.12 to $0.11. Even after adding a number of additional lease-up properties to our acquisition pipeline, we're excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our team driving our growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio. As we often say, it's a great time to be in storage. With that, let's turn it over to Joanna to start our Q&A. Yes. Let me maybe start with property taxes. I mean, we had a negative quarterly comp and that's not going to continue. Property taxes we would expect to grow in the 5% to 6% range. As we continue to see pressure and I think that's partly with lower cap rates, higher valuations. We would expect municipalities to continue to assess. We would expect that to continue into next year. We \u2013 obviously, we're not ready to give guidance on property taxes, but that will continue. The second one I would point to is marketing. We wouldn't expect it to be down 40% again this year. We would expect next year to maybe be a little bit more normal and it's a lever we will use as we see opportunities to grow our revenues by using marketing. The third one, I would point to just because of the size of the expenses payroll. So this year we've had a negative payroll comp and it's been by us being proactive, partly so we've done things to decrease hours to optimize our payroll, but we've also had some what I would call a negative benefit. And what I mean by that is we've seen our payroll go down, because we've had higher turnover and we've had longer time to fill. So not necessarily a good thing. We've had lower payroll as a result of that. We continue to see pressure on wages. So that's at the stores, that's in our corporate office and we would expect that to be \u2013 we would expect that to continue into next year. I think every company in America is experiencing that. The other thing I would point to on the expense side is it's a good thing to be in storage. And what I mean by that is we're in a high margin business. So payroll, for instance, even if we see significant payroll and payroll pressure, you're still sub 6% as a percentage of revenues. And so if you're an inflationary market, we do have the ability to push our rates as their month-to-month leases. Don't know that it's a number we've ever given, Todd. We've always referred to in place versus street. We've talked how they're \u2013 they go in a cycle where you peak in the summer in terms of that gap. It's typically high-single digits in the summer that gap, and then it goes maybe high-single digits in the winter. So you peak in July, you bought them out in February. This year we peaked 19%, as Joe mentioned, we're typically starting to go negative now. We have as our street rates are as strong as they've ever been. I think everybody has higher rates today. We're on the higher end. When we look at them compared to 2019, as Joe mentioned, our rates are up 40%, our achieved rates in the third quarter were 40% above where they were in 2019. So, I think everybody's pushing rates, we are pushing rates as our occupancy stays strong and as that demand stays strong. Yes. We're kind of in a unique market where we have a lot of good options. You have cheap debt, you have a stock price that's holding up and we've always said we'd use equity if we have a place to put it in the near-term. So far this year, we haven't had a great place to put equity and we've been de-levering as our NOI has grown and as we had some sales into joint ventures or outright sales. So, I think, equity is always an option, but I think we'll look to the debt markets first. Yeah, so we are going to continue doing what we've been doing, which we'll continue to look for are a Bridge loan opportunities, will continue to invest both on a wholly owned and a joint venture basis. And when unique opportunities come up like that, a preferred investment we'll consider those as well."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets, Jeff Norman. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Norman: Thank you, Latif. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unSed supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, July 28, 2021. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoseph Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Before I turn to the results, I want to take a moment and congratulate the entire Extra Space team. One of our goals for this year was to get to 2021 stores in the year 2021. And we've achieved that, which is a great thing. When I first started with Extra Space, we had 12 stores and it's incredible to see the exceptional growth of this company, the value we've created for our shareholders. So, I want to thank all the folks at Extra Space who contributed to our achieving that goal. I'm also happy to announce that we recently published our 2020 sustainability report with disclosures and information related to the company's environmental, social, and governance initiatives. I invite our listeners to review the report on the Sustainability page of our Investor Relations website. Heading into this quarter -- I'm sorry, heading into the second quarter, our management team had high expectations due to our record high occupancy levels, significant pricing power, and a relatively easy 2020 comparable and actual performance far exceeded these elevated expectations. Same-store occupancy set another new high watermark at the end of June at 97%, which is incredible, as you consider the diversification of our national portfolio. The elevated occupancy led to exceptional pricing power with achieved rates to new customers in the quarter over 60% higher than 2020 levels. While this is inflated by an artificially low prior year comp, achieve rates were over 30% greater than 2019 levels and accelerated through the quarter. In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as more of the state of emergency rate restrictions are lifted throughout the country. Other income is no longer a drag on revenue due to late fees improving year-over-year and actually contributed 20 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. And finally, higher discounts, primarily due to higher rates were offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 13.6%, a 900 basis point acceleration from Q1, and same-store NOI growth of 20.2%, an acceleration of over 1,300 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 33.3%. Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be, in our view, expensive. Given the pricing we are seeing in the market, we have listed an additional 17 stores for outright disposition, which we expect to close during the back half of 2021. We continue to be actively engaged in acquisitions, but we remain disciplined. Year-to-date, we have been able to close or put under contract acquisitions totaling $400 million of Extra Space investment. These are primarily lease-up properties and several of the properties came from our Bridge Loan Program. We have increased our 2021 acquisition guidance to $500 million in Extra Space investments. Looking forward, many of our acquisitions will be completed in joint ventures, and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. We were active on the third-party management front, adding 39 stores in the quarter and a total of 100 stores through the first six months. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. In the quarter, we purchased 11 of these stores in the REIT or in one of our joint ventures. Our first half outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improved outlook for the second half of 2021 allowed us to increase our annual FFO guidance by $0.50 or 8.3% at the midpoint. While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation of approximately 300 basis points from this summer's peak to the winter trough, the moderation will begin from a higher starting point than we previously expected. As a result, we assume minimal impact on revenue growth from the negative occupancy delta in the back half of the year. Our guidance assumes moderating but still strong rate growth for the duration of 2021, which should result in another great year for Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.64 per share, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution coming from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. Despite property tax increases of 6%, we delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter. These increases were offset primarily by 13% savings in payroll and 31% savings in marketing. Our guidance assumes payroll savings will continue throughout the year, however, at lower levels due to wage pressure across the U.S. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue, but it should also remain down for the year. In May, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering issuing $450 million in 10-year bonds at 2.55%. Access to the investment-grade bond market provides another deep capital source at low rates and will allow us to further extend our average maturities. Our year-to-date dispositions, equity issuances, and NOI have resulted in a reduction in our leverage. Our quarter-end net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.8x, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities since we generally target a range of 5.5x to 6x on this metric. Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 10% to 11%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 0% to 1%, resulting in same-store NOI growth of 13.5% to 15.5%, a 750-basis-point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected achieved rates, higher occupancy, and lower payroll and marketing expense. We raised our full-year core FFO range to be $6.45 to $6.60 per share, a $0.50 or 8.3% increase at the midpoint. Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.14 to $0.12. We're excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our customer acquisition, revenue management, operational and growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio. With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: Congratulations on the quarter. Joe, my first question is on the point you discussed on seasonal occupancy and the moderation. You're still building into guidance of 300 basis points. Are there any signposts right now pointing to that or to be fair, would you say that there's still some conservatism here?\nJoseph Margolis: Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question and for your kind words. So far, we don't see any signs of it, and we are actually over 97% occupied in July. So, we're still waiting for that moderation to begin, but we do believe that slowly over time, customer behavior will revert to normal.\nJeffrey Spector: Okay. I guess let's flip the question then on the other side in customer acquisition. I mean where are the surprises coming from because we've been talking about the moderation. And of course, this past year has been much stronger than expected. I guess let's talk about customer acquisitions. Is it particular regions? Where are they coming from? Any changes? What are the nice surprises you've seen just even in, let's say, the last quarter or last month?\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. It's really on the vacate side, I would say. Our Q2 vacates were 10% below 2019 vacates, right? They used -- 2020 as a comp doesn't really help. So, we still see people staying in the units and gives us fewer units to rent up and more pricing power, and it's all good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping we could touch on rate growth. How are you guys thinking about that growth going forward? The year-over-year comps have been clearly impacted by COVID discounting, but your in-place rents are at record levels, near $18 a square foot. If we look back to 2015, 2016, you had kind of 2 years of rate growth of about 6.5%. Do you think we could see something similar in terms of the quantum and duration of the year-over-year growth in in-place rates?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Juan, I can maybe walk you through some of our assumptions, and I'm not sure I can tell you exactly what's going to happen. I think that's the big question here. We've seen very good rate growth. If you look at our rates year-over-year, we mentioned that we're 60% ahead of where we were last year. Last year was an odd comp. If you look at it compared to 2019, you're 30% ahead. So, we continue to push our street rates, and the expectation is that we will continue to push them through the year. We do come up against a more difficult comp at the end of this year as we started pushing rates at the end of last year. So, that is one thing that we're looking at as we move into the fall. A couple of other maybe data points, discounts are up slightly in the quarter, mainly due to rates being higher. Our discounting strategy hasn't changed significantly. We'll continue to use them as a tool, but we'll continue to monitor those also. Our existing customer rate increases are running above where they've historically been, and part of that is an odd comp again from last year where last year you had many state of emergencies where we paused rate increases. And so, from a year-over-year perspective, those existing customer rate increases are contributing more than they were last year.\nJuan Sanabria: And if you guys just look at the net street rates for new customers, have you seen any sequential deceleration in the pace of that growth through July?\nScott Stubbs: No significant change in July from what we've seen in June.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: In terms of the revised guidance, and Joe I appreciate the comments around revenue growth in the back half of the year, but I'm just curious and maybe Scott can chime in here, but what are you anticipating for same-store revenue and same-store NOI growth as you exit the year? If you can maybe provide some detail around the trajectory throughout the balance of the year based on what's implied by the revised guidance that would be helpful.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Without providing exact kind of monthly sequential here, I'll just give you a few data points. We are seeing rate contributing more in terms of the overall percentage as the occupancy delta wears off. By the end of the year, occupancy won't be benefiting us, and it's all coming from rate, but we do not expect it to accelerate significantly through the rest of the year, but we also contribute through the remainder of the year as we come up against these tougher comps.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And what's the spread right now between rates for customers moving out and the achieved rates on customers moving in?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, the disclosure we've given may be a little bit different than that. What we've typically disclosed is our in-place rents compared to our new move-ins, and that right now is high teens, which I would tell you right now is exceptional. And typically in the summer months, it's flat to slightly positive, meaning customers moving in pay slightly more than our in-place rents. And this year, it's high teens which is as good as we've seen.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And just last question for Joe. Your comments on investments. I think you mentioned -- you characterized the market as expensive and said that you would look to do more investments through joint ventures. And the joint venture platform used to be a bit bigger, and you've been acquiring assets from within the JV platform. With all the capital looking to invest in storage, would you look to do something of size and maybe generate premium returns and backfill the pipeline a bit at the same time?\nJoseph Margolis: So, we are kind of governor of what we're willing to do, isn't how big or small it is. It\u2019s what we view the risk-adjusted returns to be. So we'll do as big a deal, and we have capital to do as big a deal as necessary or is available, provided the risk-adjusted returns are good or we'll buy one-off storage, and historically we've done both, and we're not focused on what's too big or what's too small, we\u2019re just fully focused on what we believe the risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders are.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Should we expect investments going forward to be primarily weighted towards joint ventures versus on-balance sheet investments?\nJoseph Margolis: I think that's a fair assumption given where pricing is today. We can significantly improve the price -- the returns to our shareholders by investing in the joint venture structure, which makes deals that we would look at as dilutive on a wholly-owned basis being accretive to us in a joint venture structure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I was just wondering you mentioned existing customers are coming closer to kind of overall market levels, assuming so what sort of percent, I guess, of the portfolio maybe -- will still be subject to more rent increases, I guess, maybe as restrictions come off? Or is that pretty much behind you now?\nScott Stubbs: So we only have a few markets that have restrictions in place. So they're very limited to a few specific California markets that have restrictions that go back to buyers from several years ago. You have a few others across the U.S. that are between 10% and 20%. So the majority of the portfolio is open to rate increases. There are a few that still have some limit.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then [indiscernible], could you talk just a little bit more about what you're seeing on the labor side? You mentioned some of the savings -- sort of updated what you're seeing there. But I mean are you having to pay people more? Are you having trouble staffing? Or how are you -- just a little more color around how that's working out.\nJoseph Margolis: Yes, it's a significant issue that we're working with. We have fewer applicants for open spots. It takes longer to fill and it's more expensive. So we're working real hard to try to be appropriately staffed with quality people. We do see that as supplemental unemployment insurance burns off in certain states, the problem gets better. So -- I'm sorry, the problem ameliorates. So we're hoping that, that pattern continues, but we absolutely are aware that there's wage pressure, we're feeling it, and it's going to be an issue we're going to have to deal with.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Okay. And then just last question, I was just interested to see that you did not re-up your ATM in the second quarter, and you mentioned that you would do it in the third quarter. Was there a reason for not doing it during the second quarter?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, we were focused on getting our inaugural bond offering done. We then turned to recasting our credit facility. Both projects were done during the quarter. We feel like we had a great quarter of getting those done, and then we'll refile the ATM as we finish the quarter and file the Q.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: How are you thinking about managing the interplay between occupancy and rate? I understand the goal is to maximize revenue. But like how are your models thinking about pushing rate maybe at the expense of occupancy in this environment?\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So it's a great question, and you're right to focus on the different levers that lead to maximizing revenue. But I would suggest there's many others. It's not just occupancy and rate, it's marketing spend, it's discounting, it's days you allow customers to reserve a unit. There's many other tools we can use to maximize revenue. And the data scientists and the algorithms take all of these factors into play in setting daily pricing and occupancy targets to try to maximize revenue.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And what are you seeing on the supply front. Given the strength of trends and they've remained strong, does supply pressure inevitably come back? And if so, how far away are we from that?\nJoseph Margolis: Really good question. So based on what we see on the ground that affects our same-store pool, so not national statistics, things we care about. We continue to believe that there is going to be some moderation of deliveries in 2021 from 2020, just like there was from 2019 to 2020. But that being said, I think we're going to see more development in the future. Just this week, I talked to 2 developers who had projects that did not hit underwriting, they were making no money and they're selling them and they're getting bailed out by current pricing. And I asked both of them what they're going to do with the proceeds, and they said, we're going to go stick shovels in the ground. So between great fundamentals, low interest rates, lots of capital floating into the space, albeit I get that costs are higher. I think we're going to continue to see development, and it's going to be something we're going to have to deal with just like we've been dealing with for the past 4 or 5 years, no difference. And that being said, I'd point out that one of the advantages of having a broadly diversified portfolio like Extra Space is we have exposures to many, many different markets, some of which are heading into a development cycle, some of which are coming out of a development cycle, some of which have never been affected by development. And all those markets are in some different stage. And because of that diversification, our returns are smoothed out.\nMichael Goldsmith: Very helpful. And just if I can squeeze one last in. On the acquisition front, has there been any change in market conditions from the first to the second quarter? And are you seeing any new bidders?\nJoseph Margolis: I'm not sure there's new bidders from the first to the second quarter. I mean there's certainly a lot of new entrants in the market. It's hard for me on the top of my head to think about one that appeared in the second quarter. I don't see any material change. I think there's a lot of capital, interest rates are low, and self-storage has proven itself to be a great investment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: I guess just sticking on supply, I mean, are there any -- just to elaborate a little bit more on maybe the markets that are a bit -- any indication or initial kind of concerns that you're seeing in any markets to call out?\nJoseph Margolis: I think our list of markets is pretty similar to the list of markets we've had in the past. The boroughs of New York, we continue to be concerned about. And we continue because of that new development have results there that are below our portfolio average. Northern New Jersey, Atlanta, Vegas maybe a new market on the list we're starting to watch. Philadelphia also maybe a new market. Those are, I would say, the markets that where we have significant exposure that we're focused on right now.\nSamir Khanal: And I guess my second question is really around -- on the disposition side. I mean could you see yourself bring more assets to market considering how strong pricing has been here?\nJoseph Margolis: So we closed the disposition of 16 assets into a joint venture. And we expect to close the second half of that transaction shortly to reduce our interest in the venture further. We have another 17 assets on the market now for outright sale. We have a couple ordinance that we're working on to get in a position to sell, but nothing major. And we're constantly looking at the portfolio and trying to decide what moves would be optimal to rebalance to have the right amount of exposure in different markets. So we'll always consider it, but that's what we have on the plate now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Maybe just a question on the Bridge Loan Program. The guidance now assumes that you retain $100 million of Bridge loans this year, but it seems like you're running below that pace considering what you've closed and sold so far this year. So wondering if you can go through the outlook there and what visibility you have to activity in the second half?\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. That's a great question. So yes, we are behind initial projections in terms of timing. We are confident we're going to achieve our guidance. It is going to be more back-end loaded. We currently have $200 million worth of loans with signed term sheets and deposits to close in the back half of this year and the beginning of next year. So nothing is guaranteed, but I'm pretty comfortable we will get to our guidance.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of the customers, I know you mentioned that you're finding that there's lower vacates than you've had in the past. But just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the new interest that you're seeing for space that's helping that occupancy too. Do you have any insight into what's driving customer storage needs this year and how that compares to the past?\nJoseph Margolis: So this is more of a longer-term answer, not just this year. But we saw during the pandemic the reasons people gave us for storage. Traditionally, the #1 reason has been they're somewhere in the moving process. And then that declined and what increased during the pandemic was lack of space, and that became the #1 reason for a while. Those lines have since crossed again. But we interpret lack of space as I'm at home and I need a bedroom to -- for in-home school or in-home office or a workout room or I'm going to find a cleaner garage or whatever. And those customers tend to stay longer than customers who give the reason of staying is moving. So I would point to that as why we're seeing currently declining vacates. And I don't think all of those customers eventually take their stuff out of storage and convert the home office back to a bedroom or whatever. I think some of -- not all of them, but I think some portion of them will be longer-term customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway of Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Just going back to the transaction market once more. Have you guys observed any shift in pricing spreads just in terms of quality or any notable outliers in terms of geography?\nJoseph Margolis: So we're not very, very active in tertiary markets. So it's hard for me to comment about that. I would tell you that for good stores in primary and secondary markets, there's very, very little spread in pricing.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And then just in terms of your inaugural public bond offering, what role should we anticipate the unsecured market playing for you guys in terms of its source of funds moving forward?\nScott Stubbs: So I think that you'll see us be a repeat issuer going forward. There's 2 or 3 things driving that. I mean, obviously, you're always looking at the rate, and you're trying to get the lowest rate possible. I think that we're looking to extend the tenure of our debt. And then we want to have as many capital sources as possible. So we are going to access the capital source that we feel like is the most advantageous to us at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: You talked about buying lease-up assets. So I was curious for the $500 million that's baked into acquisition guidance. Can you give us a sense as to what an average going-in cap rate or average occupancy would be?\nJoseph Margolis: So I'll talk about our recent deals because I think to talk about deals that we signed up last year that closed this year is probably not indicative of current pricing. So our -- for the wholly owned lease-up deals, we have recently approved, our first year yield is 3.1%, low 3s with an average 17 months to stabilization at an average stabilized cap of 6%. So we're happy to accept or willing to accept that initial dilution because we have confidence in our ability to underwrite lease-up and get to those accretive returns. For the deals we've done in ventures, the first year yield to Extra Space, not at the deal level, is 7.2%, 13 months average to stabilization and a stabilized yield of almost 11%. So you can see how the venture structure significantly helps our returns.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. Got it. And is that -- what's the typical occupancy on the wholly owned where you're getting that 3% initial versus the 7% for the JV? Is it comparable -- it's not a comparable -- going-in occupancy, would it be?\nJoseph Margolis: So the occupancies were higher than you would imagine. A lot of them were in the 60s or 80s. But that's physical occupancy, and we look at stabilization when you get to both physical occupancy and rate stabilization, right? We have one that's -- or a couple there in the 90s physical occupancies, but have significant rate growth before they get to economic stabilization. Does that make sense, did I explain that correctly?\nMichael Mueller: I think so, I think so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just going back to the ECRI questions that was asked earlier. Maybe thinking about the entire portfolio, number one, just what percentage does still have some sort of restrictions on it? Is it sort of 5%? Is it 10%? And the second question is, are you able to sort of charge even higher ECRI than you have historically given the rate environment?\nScott Stubbs: I don't have the exact percent in front of me, but it's a small percent, a very low percent. So even in California, it's not a majority.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. And then on the ability to push the rate increases, are you seeing sort of an ability to do it at a higher and faster level than historical, given sort of the record rate environment?\nScott Stubbs: That is what we are currently doing. We're pushing things more towards street rate today, and part of that has to do with the fact that sometimes you've had rate caps in place or state of emergencies that have been in place that have hindered our ability to raise rates for the past 12 to 18 months depending on the location. And so we have brought them up more significantly as well as the fact that many of these customers moved in very steep discounts that were unprecedented also.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. Makes sense. And then my last question was just on the preferred investments. Is there anything that changed? Or is there any call risk with sort of the pricing environment that you're seeing today on those preferreds? Or are they sort of [indiscernible] maturity?\nJoseph Margolis: So one of the things we've changed in our guidance this year is there is a $100 million piece of the preferred to JCAP that opens in the end of October, I believe. And our initial guidance had assumed that was outstanding for the entire year. And given how well the properties are doing, the company is doing, we have changed our assumption that, that gets paid off prior to year-end, reducing our dividend income from that. So I think it's a safe assumption that, that company will want to retire 12% money as soon as it can.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have a follow-up question from Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Just two more quick ones. The first one, I wanted to ask you, it looked like the third-party managed platform, the number of assets under management declined sequentially on a net basis. And I was just wondering, is that just -- you just see that as a normal ebb and flow of business? Or is there anything in particular that went on during the quarter? And then the second question was, could you just talk about length of stay? I think last -- on your last call, you mentioned that length of stay had shortened a little bit. And I was just wondering, is it returning back to maybe what you've seen historically?\nJoseph Margolis: So Smedes, I think you're right to observe that we have a lot of churn in our management platform. A lot of people are taking advantage of pricing in the market and selling. But even given that churn, we continue to grow that platform. We ended the year at 724 properties. We ended the first quarter at 763. We ended the second quarter at 768. And that includes 19 properties that left the platform that we bought. So we continue to grow that. We have a very, very healthy pipeline. We project to add net 100 to 130 properties this year. It's not guaranteed. We don't know what else is going to sell. But we continue to grow that quarter after quarter and expect to continue to do that.\nScott Stubbs: Smedes, I think that also might be a little confusing when you look at the buckets. We're moving sometimes between buckets. And so when you take the total of JV and third party, it actually did move slightly as we had some JV partners sell some of the assets in the quarter. But the third-party management business, just the third-party management actually saw a net increase. And then the second question, Smedes, on the length of stay. Our length of stay is now back up. We saw a tick down slightly and then it's back up today.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital.\nJuan Sanabria: Just a follow-up on the balance sheet, which you noted is in a very strong position, 4.8x at the end of June. How should we expect that to trend? And where do you see capital going? And as a kind of a side question, how much in proceeds should we expect from the 17 assets that are now being marketed for disposition?\nScott Stubbs: So the 17 assets that are being marketed for disposition are over $200 million. In terms of where we expect to spend our next dollar or where we expect to borrow, I think it will depend on the opportunities to invest. I think that we'll look at the cheapest cost of capital, whether that's debt. I think that we typically want to operate in that 5.5 to 6x. Today, we're sub-5. So we do have a lot of capacity there. And I think depending on the size of the deal, you would also consider equity at times. But right now, we do have a leverage capacity.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. But the focus for incremental spend sounds like it's on acquisitions via the joint ventures, there's not necessarily new investments that could be used as you think about kind of taking the balance sheet to where you want to from a target leverage perspective?\nJoseph Margolis: So with the exception of the second half of the joint venture sale, that recapitalization, if you will, that I mentioned earlier, we believe future joint venture acquisitions will not be out of our portfolio, they'll be from the market. So it won't produce additional investable dollars for us. We'll invest a portion of the acquisition price.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Stein of Stifel.\nKevin Stein: I was just wondering on the expense side. I know marketing and payroll expenses were down. I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that and how sustainable that is going forward?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. On the expense side, we mentioned we had an increase of property taxes. Our property taxes are running about 6% year-over-year. On the payroll side, we have seen a decrease. That's driven by a couple of things. One is a year-over-year comparable that is quite easy from last year. Last year, first half of the year, you were essentially fully staffed, and we were providing some -- we were generous in the COVID benefits, making sure that our employees were taken care of. In terms of going forward and the -- how sustainable that decline in payroll is, I think it's to be seen. We expect some benefit, but not necessarily to the degree we saw in the first and second quarter as we are expecting some wage pressure, and we have more difficult comps in the back half of the year. In terms of the marketing, we are expecting a benefit. But again, if that's always the wildcard to some degree in that -- if we do see an opportunity to spend on marketing, we will use that if we feel like we can get higher rate and higher occupancy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: I had a follow-up question again on the acquisitions. You guys gave some detail earlier about how in the, I think, wholly owned properties you were looking at the initial yield was 3.1%, stabilized was 6%, and then in the JV properties, it was 7.2% initial and stabilized almost 11%. I was just wondering if there was any real detail you could give us into what's driving that difference? Is it just fees that you earn in the joint venture or something else?\nJoseph Margolis: So the primary driver is we collect the management fee from the joint venture, and we retain 100% of that tenant insurance income. So we're retaining all of that income against a much smaller capital investment versus 100% capital investment. In some of our ventures, we do get acquisition fees or other fees. We also have the opportunity to earn promotes, and in some of our older ventures, we are earning promoted -- cash flow promotes, but that's not assumed in any of these numbers.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then just maybe obvious, but in raising the acquisition guidance to the $500 million, then that just means that this year volume of transaction will be that much higher, just your portion is going to be $500 million. Is that it?\nJoseph Margolis: Correct. That's correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Two quick follow-ups here. First, I think the comments from earlier were that rate growth does not accelerate in the second half of the year, but the revenue growth for guidance for the second half of the year implies an increase versus the first half. And you talked about the contribution from occupancy gains diminishing as we move further into the back half of the year. So it would seem that rate growth is expected to accelerate. Can you just clarify those comments, or perhaps I misheard?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So I think really what you're -- what I'm saying is Q3 is better than Q1. So Q1 is dragging it down, Q3 will bring it up. Q4 will also be better than Q1. But I'm saying they're not accelerating from where they are today in June and into July.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Okay. And then seasonally, what's typically the beginning of the off-peak season for you where move-outs are higher than move-ins? And are you expecting anything different from a seasonality standpoint this year with schools and return to schools relative to last year?\nScott Stubbs: Peak occupancy from a month-end perspective is July. From an actual -- when it peaks, it's mid-August, but then you do see some decline as students move out, and we are expecting some of those students to move out and typical student volatility.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And that begins -- that coincides with that mid-August timing?\nScott Stubbs: Correct.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Joe Margolis for closing remarks. Sir?\nJoseph Margolis: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call and your interest and support of Extra Space. I mean, obviously, we're having a fantastic year. We have all-time high occupancy, exceptional new customer rate growth. We're continuing our innovative external growth strategies as well as innovating at the store level, and we expect to have a very strong same-store and core FFO growth this year. Thank you again, and have a good day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Before I turn to the results, I want to take a moment and congratulate the entire Extra Space team. One of our goals for this year was to get to 2021 stores in the year 2021. And we've achieved that, which is a great thing. When I first started with Extra Space, we had 12 stores and it's incredible to see the exceptional growth of this company, the value we've created for our shareholders. So, I want to thank all the folks at Extra Space who contributed to our achieving that goal. I'm also happy to announce that we recently published our 2020 sustainability report with disclosures and information related to the company's environmental, social, and governance initiatives. I invite our listeners to review the report on the Sustainability page of our Investor Relations website. Heading into this quarter -- I'm sorry, heading into the second quarter, our management team had high expectations due to our record high occupancy levels, significant pricing power, and a relatively easy 2020 comparable and actual performance far exceeded these elevated expectations. Same-store occupancy set another new high watermark at the end of June at 97%, which is incredible, as you consider the diversification of our national portfolio. The elevated occupancy led to exceptional pricing power with achieved rates to new customers in the quarter over 60% higher than 2020 levels. While this is inflated by an artificially low prior year comp, achieve rates were over 30% greater than 2019 levels and accelerated through the quarter. In addition to the benefit from new customer rates, we have continued to bring existing customers closer to current street rates as more of the state of emergency rate restrictions are lifted throughout the country. Other income is no longer a drag on revenue due to late fees improving year-over-year and actually contributed 20 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter. And finally, higher discounts, primarily due to higher rates were offset by lower bad debt. These drivers produced same-store revenue growth of 13.6%, a 900 basis point acceleration from Q1, and same-store NOI growth of 20.2%, an acceleration of over 1,300 basis points. In addition, our external growth initiatives produced steady returns outside of the same-store pool, resulting in FFO growth of 33.3%. Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be, in our view, expensive. Given the pricing we are seeing in the market, we have listed an additional 17 stores for outright disposition, which we expect to close during the back half of 2021. We continue to be actively engaged in acquisitions, but we remain disciplined. Year-to-date, we have been able to close or put under contract acquisitions totaling $400 million of Extra Space investment. These are primarily lease-up properties and several of the properties came from our Bridge Loan Program. We have increased our 2021 acquisition guidance to $500 million in Extra Space investments. Looking forward, many of our acquisitions will be completed in joint ventures, and we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. We were active on the third-party management front, adding 39 stores in the quarter and a total of 100 stores through the first six months. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions where owners sold their properties. In the quarter, we purchased 11 of these stores in the REIT or in one of our joint ventures. Our first half outperformance coupled with steady external growth and the improved outlook for the second half of 2021 allowed us to increase our annual FFO guidance by $0.50 or 8.3% at the midpoint. While we still assume a seasonal occupancy moderation of approximately 300 basis points from this summer's peak to the winter trough, the moderation will begin from a higher starting point than we previously expected. As a result, we assume minimal impact on revenue growth from the negative occupancy delta in the back half of the year. Our guidance assumes moderating but still strong rate growth for the duration of 2021, which should result in another great year for Extra Space Storage. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question and for your kind words. So far, we don't see any signs of it, and we are actually over 97% occupied in July. So, we're still waiting for that moderation to begin, but we do believe that slowly over time, customer behavior will revert to normal. Yes. It's really on the vacate side, I would say. Our Q2 vacates were 10% below 2019 vacates, right? They used -- 2020 as a comp doesn't really help. So, we still see people staying in the units and gives us fewer units to rent up and more pricing power, and it's all good. So, we are kind of governor of what we're willing to do, isn't how big or small it is. It's what we view the risk-adjusted returns to be. So we'll do as big a deal, and we have capital to do as big a deal as necessary or is available, provided the risk-adjusted returns are good or we'll buy one-off storage, and historically we've done both, and we're not focused on what's too big or what's too small, we're just fully focused on what we believe the risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders are. I think that's a fair assumption given where pricing is today. We can significantly improve the price -- the returns to our shareholders by investing in the joint venture structure, which makes deals that we would look at as dilutive on a wholly-owned basis being accretive to us in a joint venture structure. Yes, it's a significant issue that we're working with. We have fewer applicants for open spots. It takes longer to fill and it's more expensive. So we're working real hard to try to be appropriately staffed with quality people. We do see that as supplemental unemployment insurance burns off in certain states, the problem gets better. So -- I'm sorry, the problem ameliorates. So we're hoping that, that pattern continues, but we absolutely are aware that there's wage pressure, we're feeling it, and it's going to be an issue we're going to have to deal with. Yes. So it's a great question, and you're right to focus on the different levers that lead to maximizing revenue. But I would suggest there's many others. It's not just occupancy and rate, it's marketing spend, it's discounting, it's days you allow customers to reserve a unit. There's many other tools we can use to maximize revenue. And the data scientists and the algorithms take all of these factors into play in setting daily pricing and occupancy targets to try to maximize revenue. Really good question. So based on what we see on the ground that affects our same-store pool, so not national statistics, things we care about. We continue to believe that there is going to be some moderation of deliveries in 2021 from 2020, just like there was from 2019 to 2020. But that being said, I think we're going to see more development in the future. Just this week, I talked to 2 developers who had projects that did not hit underwriting, they were making no money and they're selling them and they're getting bailed out by current pricing. And I asked both of them what they're going to do with the proceeds, and they said, we're going to go stick shovels in the ground. So between great fundamentals, low interest rates, lots of capital floating into the space, albeit I get that costs are higher. I think we're going to continue to see development, and it's going to be something we're going to have to deal with just like we've been dealing with for the past 4 or 5 years, no difference. And that being said, I'd point out that one of the advantages of having a broadly diversified portfolio like Extra Space is we have exposures to many, many different markets, some of which are heading into a development cycle, some of which are coming out of a development cycle, some of which have never been affected by development. And all those markets are in some different stage. And because of that diversification, our returns are smoothed out. I'm not sure there's new bidders from the first to the second quarter. I mean there's certainly a lot of new entrants in the market. It's hard for me on the top of my head to think about one that appeared in the second quarter. I don't see any material change. I think there's a lot of capital, interest rates are low, and self-storage has proven itself to be a great investment. I think our list of markets is pretty similar to the list of markets we've had in the past. The boroughs of New York, we continue to be concerned about. And we continue because of that new development have results there that are below our portfolio average. Northern New Jersey, Atlanta, Vegas maybe a new market on the list we're starting to watch. Philadelphia also maybe a new market. Those are, I would say, the markets that where we have significant exposure that we're focused on right now. So we closed the disposition of 16 assets into a joint venture. And we expect to close the second half of that transaction shortly to reduce our interest in the venture further. We have another 17 assets on the market now for outright sale. We have a couple ordinance that we're working on to get in a position to sell, but nothing major. And we're constantly looking at the portfolio and trying to decide what moves would be optimal to rebalance to have the right amount of exposure in different markets. So we'll always consider it, but that's what we have on the plate now. Yes. That's a great question. So yes, we are behind initial projections in terms of timing. We are confident we're going to achieve our guidance. It is going to be more back-end loaded. We currently have $200 million worth of loans with signed term sheets and deposits to close in the back half of this year and the beginning of next year. So nothing is guaranteed, but I'm pretty comfortable we will get to our guidance. So this is more of a longer-term answer, not just this year. But we saw during the pandemic the reasons people gave us for storage. Traditionally, the #1 reason has been they're somewhere in the moving process. And then that declined and what increased during the pandemic was lack of space, and that became the #1 reason for a while. Those lines have since crossed again. But we interpret lack of space as I'm at home and I need a bedroom to -- for in-home school or in-home office or a workout room or I'm going to find a cleaner garage or whatever. And those customers tend to stay longer than customers who give the reason of staying is moving. So I would point to that as why we're seeing currently declining vacates. And I don't think all of those customers eventually take their stuff out of storage and convert the home office back to a bedroom or whatever. I think some of -- not all of them, but I think some portion of them will be longer-term customers. So we're not very, very active in tertiary markets. So it's hard for me to comment about that. I would tell you that for good stores in primary and secondary markets, there's very, very little spread in pricing. So I'll talk about our recent deals because I think to talk about deals that we signed up last year that closed this year is probably not indicative of current pricing. So our -- for the wholly owned lease-up deals, we have recently approved, our first year yield is 3.1%, low 3s with an average 17 months to stabilization at an average stabilized cap of 6%. So we're happy to accept or willing to accept that initial dilution because we have confidence in our ability to underwrite lease-up and get to those accretive returns. For the deals we've done in ventures, the first year yield to Extra Space, not at the deal level, is 7.2%, 13 months average to stabilization and a stabilized yield of almost 11%. So you can see how the venture structure significantly helps our returns. So the occupancies were higher than you would imagine. A lot of them were in the 60s or 80s. But that's physical occupancy, and we look at stabilization when you get to both physical occupancy and rate stabilization, right? We have one that's -- or a couple there in the 90s physical occupancies, but have significant rate growth before they get to economic stabilization. Does that make sense, did I explain that correctly? So one of the things we've changed in our guidance this year is there is a $100 million piece of the preferred to JCAP that opens in the end of October, I believe. And our initial guidance had assumed that was outstanding for the entire year. And given how well the properties are doing, the company is doing, we have changed our assumption that, that gets paid off prior to year-end, reducing our dividend income from that. So I think it's a safe assumption that, that company will want to retire 12% money as soon as it can. So Smedes, I think you're right to observe that we have a lot of churn in our management platform. A lot of people are taking advantage of pricing in the market and selling. But even given that churn, we continue to grow that platform. We ended the year at 724 properties. We ended the first quarter at 763. We ended the second quarter at 768. And that includes 19 properties that left the platform that we bought. So we continue to grow that. We have a very, very healthy pipeline. We project to add net 100 to 130 properties this year. It's not guaranteed. We don't know what else is going to sell. But we continue to grow that quarter after quarter and expect to continue to do that. So with the exception of the second half of the joint venture sale, that recapitalization, if you will, that I mentioned earlier, we believe future joint venture acquisitions will not be out of our portfolio, they'll be from the market. So it won't produce additional investable dollars for us. We'll invest a portion of the acquisition price. So the primary driver is we collect the management fee from the joint venture, and we retain 100% of that tenant insurance income. So we're retaining all of that income against a much smaller capital investment versus 100% capital investment. In some of our ventures, we do get acquisition fees or other fees. We also have the opportunity to earn promotes, and in some of our older ventures, we are earning promoted -- cash flow promotes, but that's not assumed in any of these numbers. Correct. That's correct. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call and your interest and support of Extra Space. I mean, obviously, we're having a fantastic year. We have all-time high occupancy, exceptional new customer rate growth. We're continuing our innovative external growth strategies as well as innovating at the store level, and we expect to have a very strong same-store and core FFO growth this year. Thank you again, and have a good day."

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new and existing customers. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.64 per share, a year-over-year increase of 33.3%. Property performance was the primary driver of the beat with additional contribution coming from growth in tenant insurance income and management fees. Despite property tax increases of 6%, we delivered a reduction in same-store expenses in the quarter. These increases were offset primarily by 13% savings in payroll and 31% savings in marketing. Our guidance assumes payroll savings will continue throughout the year, however, at lower levels due to wage pressure across the U.S. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue, but it should also remain down for the year. In May, we completed our inaugural investment-grade public bond offering issuing $450 million in 10-year bonds at 2.55%. Access to the investment-grade bond market provides another deep capital source at low rates and will allow us to further extend our average maturities. Our year-to-date dispositions, equity issuances, and NOI have resulted in a reduction in our leverage. Our quarter-end net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.8x, giving us significant dry powder for investment opportunities since we generally target a range of 5.5x to 6x on this metric. Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 10% to 11%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 0% to 1%, resulting in same-store NOI growth of 13.5% to 15.5%, a 750-basis-point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected achieved rates, higher occupancy, and lower payroll and marketing expense. We raised our full-year core FFO range to be $6.45 to $6.60 per share, a $0.50 or 8.3% increase at the midpoint. Due to stronger lease-up performance, we dropped our anticipated dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores from $0.14 to $0.12. We're excited by our strong performance year-to-date and the success of our customer acquisition, revenue management, operational and growth strategies across our highly diversified portfolio. With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A. Yes. Juan, I can maybe walk you through some of our assumptions, and I'm not sure I can tell you exactly what's going to happen. I think that's the big question here. We've seen very good rate growth. If you look at our rates year-over-year, we mentioned that we're 60% ahead of where we were last year. Last year was an odd comp. If you look at it compared to 2019, you're 30% ahead. So, we continue to push our street rates, and the expectation is that we will continue to push them through the year. We do come up against a more difficult comp at the end of this year as we started pushing rates at the end of last year. So, that is one thing that we're looking at as we move into the fall. A couple of other maybe data points, discounts are up slightly in the quarter, mainly due to rates being higher. Our discounting strategy hasn't changed significantly. We'll continue to use them as a tool, but we'll continue to monitor those also. Our existing customer rate increases are running above where they've historically been, and part of that is an odd comp again from last year where last year you had many state of emergencies where we paused rate increases. And so, from a year-over-year perspective, those existing customer rate increases are contributing more than they were last year. No significant change in July from what we've seen in June. Yes. Without providing exact kind of monthly sequential here, I'll just give you a few data points. We are seeing rate contributing more in terms of the overall percentage as the occupancy delta wears off. By the end of the year, occupancy won't be benefiting us, and it's all coming from rate, but we do not expect it to accelerate significantly through the rest of the year, but we also contribute through the remainder of the year as we come up against these tougher comps. Yes, the disclosure we've given may be a little bit different than that. What we've typically disclosed is our in-place rents compared to our new move-ins, and that right now is high teens, which I would tell you right now is exceptional. And typically in the summer months, it's flat to slightly positive, meaning customers moving in pay slightly more than our in-place rents. And this year, it's high teens which is as good as we've seen. So we only have a few markets that have restrictions in place. So they're very limited to a few specific California markets that have restrictions that go back to buyers from several years ago. You have a few others across the U.S. that are between 10% and 20%. So the majority of the portfolio is open to rate increases. There are a few that still have some limit. Yes, we were focused on getting our inaugural bond offering done. We then turned to recasting our credit facility. Both projects were done during the quarter. We feel like we had a great quarter of getting those done, and then we'll refile the ATM as we finish the quarter and file the Q. So I think that you'll see us be a repeat issuer going forward. There's 2 or 3 things driving that. I mean, obviously, you're always looking at the rate, and you're trying to get the lowest rate possible. I think that we're looking to extend the tenure of our debt. And then we want to have as many capital sources as possible. So we are going to access the capital source that we feel like is the most advantageous to us at this time. I don't have the exact percent in front of me, but it's a small percent, a very low percent. So even in California, it's not a majority. That is what we are currently doing. We're pushing things more towards street rate today, and part of that has to do with the fact that sometimes you've had rate caps in place or state of emergencies that have been in place that have hindered our ability to raise rates for the past 12 to 18 months depending on the location. And so we have brought them up more significantly as well as the fact that many of these customers moved in very steep discounts that were unprecedented also. Smedes, I think that also might be a little confusing when you look at the buckets. We're moving sometimes between buckets. And so when you take the total of JV and third party, it actually did move slightly as we had some JV partners sell some of the assets in the quarter. But the third-party management business, just the third-party management actually saw a net increase. And then the second question, Smedes, on the length of stay. Our length of stay is now back up. We saw a tick down slightly and then it's back up today. So the 17 assets that are being marketed for disposition are over $200 million. In terms of where we expect to spend our next dollar or where we expect to borrow, I think it will depend on the opportunities to invest. I think that we'll look at the cheapest cost of capital, whether that's debt. I think that we typically want to operate in that 5.5 to 6x. Today, we're sub-5. So we do have a lot of capacity there. And I think depending on the size of the deal, you would also consider equity at times. But right now, we do have a leverage capacity. Yes. On the expense side, we mentioned we had an increase of property taxes. Our property taxes are running about 6% year-over-year. On the payroll side, we have seen a decrease. That's driven by a couple of things. One is a year-over-year comparable that is quite easy from last year. Last year, first half of the year, you were essentially fully staffed, and we were providing some -- we were generous in the COVID benefits, making sure that our employees were taken care of. In terms of going forward and the -- how sustainable that decline in payroll is, I think it's to be seen. We expect some benefit, but not necessarily to the degree we saw in the first and second quarter as we are expecting some wage pressure, and we have more difficult comps in the back half of the year. In terms of the marketing, we are expecting a benefit. But again, if that's always the wildcard to some degree in that -- if we do see an opportunity to spend on marketing, we will use that if we feel like we can get higher rate and higher occupancy. Yes. So I think really what you're -- what I'm saying is Q3 is better than Q1. So Q1 is dragging it down, Q3 will bring it up. Q4 will also be better than Q1. But I'm saying they're not accelerating from where they are today in June and into July. Peak occupancy from a month-end perspective is July. From an actual -- when it peaks, it's mid-August, but then you do see some decline as students move out, and we are expecting some of those students to move out and typical student volatility. Correct."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Vice President, Capital Markets, Jeff Norman. Please go ahead.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Latif.

I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thank you everyone for joining today\u2019s call. We are off to a great start in 2021. The strong fundamentals we discussed on our fourth quarter call not only continued, but actually accelerated as we move through the first 3 months of the year. Same-store occupancy remained at all time highs for Extra Space with sequential growth in January and February at a time of the year when occupancy normally declines. Occupancy increased further in March, ending the quarter with a year-over-year positive delta of 480 basis points. Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which has also accelerated during the quarter with achieved rates increasing from 10% in January to well into the teens by the end of March. These trends fueled same-store revenue growth of 4.6% despite 110 basis point drag on revenue growth from lower year-over-year late fees. We had excellent expense control with a 0.2% decrease in same-store expenses. The result was same-store NOI growth of 6.5%, a sequential acceleration of 310 basis points from Q4 and year-over-year core FFO growth of 21%. With fundamentals holding and performance comps becoming much easier in the upcoming months, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth through the second quarter. Our concern of a dramatic increase in vacates have not materialized and now we are into our busy leasing season when demand is typically strongest. We believe that vacate risk to our elevated occupancy has likely been postponed until the end of the summer, or even into the fall. Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be expensive, and we remain disciplined, but opportunistic. Year-to-date, we've been able to close or put under contract a little over $300 million in acquisitions. These are primarily lease up properties, and several of the properties came from our bridge lending program. Looking forward, we anticipate the majority of additional acquisitions to be completed in joint ventures. And we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. We were very active in Q1 on the third-party management front adding 61 stores in the quarter, which include the previously announced JCAP stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions were only sold to other operators at prices we viewed as unattractive to the REIT. While this trend presents a headwind, we still expect solid growth in our third-party management platform for the year. As I said on our last call, we are mindful of the risks we face. These include difficult fourth quarter operational comps, a tight labor market and new supply and state of emergency orders in certain markets. That said, current fundamentals are the strongest we have seen in some time, and our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance. Our first quarter outperformance coupled with steady external growth, the improving 2021 outlook allow us to increase our industry leading annual guidance $0.075 at the midpoint. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers. Late fees and other income continue to be down and partially offset rental income. But we will lap this comp in the second quarter, which one has same-store revenue growth. Existing customer rent increases will also provide a tailwind in the second quarter since they were paused during much of Q2 2020. We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses despite property tax increases of 6.9% and repairs and maintenance increases of 20% due to higher year-over-year snow removal costs. These increases were offset primarily by savings in payroll and marketing. We believe payroll savings will continue throughout the year, albeit perhaps at lower levels due to wage pressure in certain markets. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue growth, but it should also remain down for the year. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, a year-over-year increase of 21%. Same-store property performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth and tenant insurance income and management fees. As we announced during the quarter, Moody's issued Extra Space a Baa2 credit rating, our second investment grade credit rating, now providing us access to the public bond market. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter through ATM activity and an overnight offering which combined for net proceeds of $274 million. We sold 16 stores into a joint venture and obtained debt for that venture resulting in cash proceeds to Extra Space of $132 million and an ownership interest of 55%. We plan to add a third partner to this venture in the second quarter, which will reduce our ownership interest to 16%. Our equity and disposition proceeds reduced revolving balances, and we ended the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 5.1x lower than our long-term debt target of 5.5x to 6x. Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 5% to 6%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 2% to 3%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 6% to 8%, a 175 basis point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected first quarter performance, relaxed legislative restrictions in certain markets, and better-than-expected resilience and storage fundamentals as the vaccine rolls out. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $5.95 to $6.10 per share, a $0.075 increase at the midpoint. We anticipate $0.14 of dilution from value add acquisitions and C of O stores, $0.02 less than previously reported due to improved property performance. We are excited by the strong performance year-to-date as well as the acceleration we see heading into the second quarter. With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Your question please.\nJeff Spector: Great, thank you. Good afternoon. My first question was just a follow-up on Joe's initial comments on accelerating trends that succeeded I think everyone's expectations. Can you comment a little bit more, Joe, on that, like what are you seeing into the quarter? And is this something we should expect going forward?\nJoe Margolis: So, I think the most exciting, accelerating trend we see is in rental rate growth, which has increased every month this year. Certainly, in the second quarter, we're going to have very easy comps and we're going to see some numbers that are eye popping. But with very high occupancy, muted vacates, we've been a lot -- we're allowed to -- we've been allowed to be aggressive on rate.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. And then can you comment a little bit more on the third-party management business and the opportunities that you're seeing?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. We have a very full pipeline in that area of our business and we're onboarding an awful lot of stores. We are very confident that it will achieve our original projections for growth in that business. What we're seeing that challenges where pricing is in the market, a certain number of our owners want to start -- want to take advantage of where pricing is. And we can't always -- as we look at the pricing, it's achieved, we choose not to match it and not to acquire the store. We always get that opportunity. But at some pricing levels, we just don't feel it's appropriate for the REIT to buy those stores. So I think you're going to see in 2021 a lot more on boards, also a lot more dispositions, but a very positive net increase in stores in our management platform.\nJeff Spector: Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Just hoping you could help us get a sense of what it means to be able to turn on the ECRI lever here in '21 relative to the easy comp you mentioned in '20, like any contextualization for what that could mean to same-store revenue having that back on versus not last year?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, so well one last year we paused the existing customer rate increases for the months of April. Part of March, April, May we turn some of them back on in May, which meant the rent increase became effective in June and most of them were on by September. So between June and September, we basically started our existing customer rate increases. So easy comp for the months of April, May, June gets a little harder. And by the time you get to August, it becomes much more difficult in terms of a comp because you -- some of those were catching up for multiple months. So you had multiple waves of rate -- existing customer rate increases happening in August.\nJoe Margolis: I would add one is our guidance anticipates that the restrictions that are in place currently remain in place for the remainder of the year. So to the extent any of those are lifted earlier, that could provide some uplift to us.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And just maybe a bit of an unusual question, but just with the tenant reinsurance business, we've had a lot of REITs comments about insurance premiums going up pretty dramatically given higher casualty events and other issues. Is the profitability at all changing for that business, given weather events seem to becoming more common to some extent, or how are you guys thinking about that that risk in underwriting?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, so we've not seen significant increases in claims. Now that's partly due to how we've handled certain things. Obviously, you can't control the weather, but some of our claims come from things like broken pipes, that various things in tenant reinsurance. So we have tried to be proactive in terms of more video monitoring at our stores, more proactive in terms of pest control, more proactive in terms of doing things so that our pipes don't freeze. So while claims may be higher due to natural disasters, we're able to offset some of that by being proactive on managing our claims.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Juan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thank you. First question in terms of the updated guidance, Joe, Scott, you both commented that the quarter outperformed relative to expectations. Does the revised guidance include any changes to the outlook and your assumptions for the balance of the year? Was it predominantly related to the first quarter outperformance? Any color there would be appreciated.\nJoe Margolis: So it's a little bit of both. So occupancy was better in the first quarter, rate played out similar to what we expected. And then moving forward, we're assuming some of that occupancy benefit moves forward. And then that we have a little bit more rate power. So it's a little bit of both.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And what are you anticipating in terms of occupancy in the back half of the year? Can you share sort of your forecast for sort of third quarter, fourth quarter, year-over-year comps? What's embedded in the guidance?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, so we're assuming that occupancy peaks in the summer at levels higher than they've been in the past, higher than historical norms. And then we're assuming that occupancy starts to move down in a more seasonal way in September, so you peak higher and then you end higher than a normal historical year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. So your year-over-year occupancy spread would still be higher, it still be positive towards the end of the year. Is that the right way to [multiple speakers] that?\nScott Stubbs: Higher than -- yes, higher than a normal year, but lower than last year. So last year was exceptionally high.\nTodd Thomas: Okay, got it. And then I just had a question with regards to the new joint venture that you formed with the asset sales this quarter. Is there a growth mandate at all for that venture? Or will this be it?\nJoe Margolis: So there's not a growth mandate for that venture. These are partners that we've formed previous ventures for, they have a growth mandate. So to the extent there's another portfolio, we would form a third venture with these partners and grow that way. We don't grow, we typically do it that way with the number of our partners, because we want to segregate the promotes and the performance of the stores and where you add additional stores to a venture, I guess you could account for them separately, but it's [technical difficulty] separate ventures.\nTodd Thomas: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Does that answer the question? Okay, great. Thank you.\nTodd Thomas: Yes.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Todd.\nTodd Thomas: Yes, it did. All right. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Your line is open.\nSmedes Rose: [Technical difficulty] if you could just maybe give some updated commentary around what you're seeing on the supply front. It seems, I mean, obviously, just operating metrics are really strong. But then we keep hearing that construction costs are going up and not sure what you're seeing on the bank lending side. So just kind of any sort of thoughts you have there would be of interest?\nJoe Margolis: Sure, Smedes. So, this supply environment doesn't change that much quarter-to-quarter. So we can give you some observations, but I caution that was just one quarter. I do see some indications of increased supply. So last quarter on the call, I related that in our management plus pipeline, we had switched to a majority existing stores and a minority of the pipeline was developing, which has been -- that has been the first time in a long time. Well, we've now switched back this quarter. So more development. It's one quarter, but it is a data point. Also, as we update stores that new developments that compete with our stores, we saw a slight tick up of a couple of percentage points this quarter. Now it may be that stuff that was delayed or postponed from last year because there was a bunch of that now being into the pipeline. But overall, I think we're going to see continued development, right? Self-storage is performing very well. If you're a developer and you're trying to calculate your development yield, you can probably use a 3.6 exit cap and see if someone's going to accept that. So there's a lot of reasons people would want to get into this business. As you point out costs are going up, lending is still challenging, but I think we're going to see development. I don't think the process [ph] is going to get shut off all the way.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, thank you. And I just wanted to ask you with your -- as you form these joint ventures and you mentioned probably doing more going forward, are you changing the structure of them at all in terms of your ability to exit or to buy off? Or is that kind of the same terms that you typically had in the past?\nJoe Margolis: No, I think we've had very sophisticated terms in the past in terms of our ability to exit, our ability to crystallize promote periodically on these ventures that are forever, which is very important. I think we had really state-of-the-art terms. So we don't need a lot of improvement. To the extent the market changes and the level of fees you can get differs or other things will certainly be at the front end of the market, but there's no significant change in terms of our ventures.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Smedes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning out there. So when you look at your move-in activity and move-out activity, I mean, the move-outs are down 10%, but there's still a decent level of move-out. Is there any discernible trends and types of customers using self-storage or types of customers designed to move-out, albeit at a lower rate?\nJoe Margolis: I don't think there's any very meaningful trends in that area. We really -- we don't see a lot of differences in move-outs in customers in different markets, which might be an indication to us, open versus closed markets. So we really don't see significant changes in that regard.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. And in terms of your new joint venture, I'm curious what's the higher level thought process there because EXR [ph] joint ventures 10 years ago had a smaller company base and trying to optimize return on equity, like I get that math EXR today and much bigger cost of debt, cost of equity is all there for you [indiscernible], it just feels like maybe there's something more thinking behind it, or more rationale behind it?\nJoe Margolis: So our use of joint ventures serves a number of purposes. A primary one is it enhances our returns. So in an environment where we think our view is if the market is expensive, it allows us to continue to grow and make good returns to our investors. So let me give you an example. We've approved so far this year 12 wholly-owned acquisitions, and they are all lease up stores. The first year yield is in the mid 3s and the stabilized yield is about 6, 16-month average stabilization. We've also approved 5 joint venture deals also lease up 12 months to stabilization, but the first year yield is 6.9 and stabilized yield is 9.9. So there's a meaningful difference to our returns when you transact in a joint venture. Now you get less money out the door, so there's constantly the discussion about do we invest more money at a lower return or less money at a higher return, but the impact to the returns to our investors is meaningful. We also on top of that get the opportunity [indiscernible] promote. None of those numbers include the promote and right now we're in the cash flow promote on a number of our ventures. And we've also realized back end promotes a number of times. The other thing it helps us do is derisk transactions, right? These debt that we invest less money in a transaction, we are balancing our portfolio in an interesting way. And then lastly, I'll say we have really good smart partners and they -- having another set of eyes on a deal or a market or an opportunity is never a bad thing.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Ki Bin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller: Yes, hi. I guess when you're thinking about rate increases that you see heading out to customers over the next couple of quarters, how do you think those increases will compare prior to pre-pandemic increases?\nJoe Margolis: So we're going to have a period of time where we have customers who came in during kind of the height of the pandemic at very, very discounted rates. And I would expect to see their rate increases be substantially higher than kind of our normal pre-pandemic rates. Once you get to a more normalized operating environment, we're going to do what we always do, which is we're going to optimize revenue by giving different customers different rate increases, depending on where they compare to market rate, or how the property is performing, various other factors. So I don't think we're going to change our approach in all in trying to balance not raising them so high that you pushing customers out the door, but also optimizing revenue.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And in terms of thinking about customer length this day, I know it's only been a year or so ago, but how has the average length of stay changed even in that short period of time?\nScott Stubbs: So early on we actually saw decreased length of stay, and throughout the pandemic it continued to increase. And it is still slightly below our historical average of where it was, call it a year-ago, but it is continuing to increase.\nMike Mueller: Okay. That was it. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nTodd Stender: Thanks. Just on the bridge loan looks like you sold some or one. We don't usually see that it's usually the borrower refi that of it at a lower rate, but maybe just some context around the sale.\nJoe Margolis: So when we started the bridge loan program, we would simultaneously close the loans in where we would keep the mezz position and the first mortgage would add closing go to a debt partner. We found that a better execution was for us to close the loan, close both pieces of the loans on our balance sheet, package up a bunch of the firsts and then sell them to one of our debt partners. We now have two debt partners who buy firsts from us. So in the first quarter, we sold $82 million of first loans that we had previously closed and kept the mezz position.\nTodd Stender: Okay, got it. Thank you, Joe.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nTodd Stender: Just switching gears, maybe could we hear some comments on the state as a third-party management platform. Certainly developers and new owners would need you guys on the front end to lease the properties. Should we expect that pace to slow at all as new supply maybe comes in a little bit, maybe just kind of comment on the competitive environment.\nJoe Margolis: I think this is a business that has a lot of runway to grow through all market environments, through periods where things are going very well when periods are going down, development cycles. I think that the advantage professional management brings to the store is so compelling that there will be continued consolidation and we should continue to grow this business year-after-year.\nTodd Stender: Great, thank you.\nJoe Margolis: You\u2019re welcome.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: [Technical difficulty] to the joint, the JV, the 16 assets any color on where those assets are located? Did they come to you? How'd you select the assets that were picked and any cap rate color would also be helpful.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So we are constantly looking at our portfolio and trying to optimize it. And that would include outright sales of assets that we feel will not contribute to the portfolio one term and where we can reinvest the money in better performing assets, and then also reducing our exposure to certain assets or markets by selling to a JV. So these were assets that we selected where we wanted to reduce our exposure, and we felt we could reinvest the money and produce a better overall portfolio. I can't really -- given our agreements with our partners, I can't give you specifics on cap rate, [indiscernible] to say, no, it's a market deal.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. Just switching gears, just on the expenses really nice controls this quarter. Just trying to get a sense of how much of the expense savings are a function of just the COVID, the post-COVID operating environment and opportunity to save, and how much of the cost savings are sort of things that would have happened anyway. I don't know if that makes sense, but asked another way, and when you're thinking about sort of this post-COVID operating environment, how much more sort of expense saving opportunities are there, above and beyond just what normally you would have done.\nScott Stubbs: So if you look at our COVID savings, I would tell you, it's more G&A related. So for instance, travels way down, you do have some benefit in the store. If you look at our savings at the property, we did have an easier comp in the first quarter of last year when payroll would maybe a little higher as we started going into the COVID lockdown. Second quarter, same thing, it'll be an easier comp, but we're also being proactive on ours. And so we are looking to make sure that we have the right number of hours at our stores where our store managers are one of our biggest assets. And so we want to make sure we maximize their time in front of the customers. But with that easy comp, we're expecting it to be a savings. And then we're also adjusting up slightly for the fact that we are having a bit of a -- it's a tough -- it's a tight labor market right now. So we want to make sure that we recognize the fact that it might cost us a little more for new people coming in the door, or we may have to be more -- a little more competitive on our labor there. The third area is really marketing. And marketing we view as one of the levers we use as we have opportunities to use it to maximize rate. We will spend marketing dollars, we have had an opportunity so far this year to spend that -- we've actually decreased our marketing spend year-over-year. And we hope that trend continues, but it's something that we'll look at on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nRonald Kamdem: Helpful color. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Ronald.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Joe Margolis for close -- closing remarks. Sir?\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thanks everyone for spending your time and your interest in Extra Space. We're obviously off to a great start this year. Occupancy is at an all-time high. We have exceptional new customer rate growth. We continue smart, careful external growth. And all of this leads to exceptional both same-store and double-digit core FFO growth. And all of this is due to the extraordinarily hard work, dedication and focus of over 4,000 employees at Extra Space. And I want to acknowledge their work and thank them for what they've produced for our shareholders. I hope everyone has a great day. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thank you everyone for joining today's call. We are off to a great start in 2021. The strong fundamentals we discussed on our fourth quarter call not only continued, but actually accelerated as we move through the first 3 months of the year. Same-store occupancy remained at all time highs for Extra Space with sequential growth in January and February at a time of the year when occupancy normally declines. Occupancy increased further in March, ending the quarter with a year-over-year positive delta of 480 basis points. Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which has also accelerated during the quarter with achieved rates increasing from 10% in January to well into the teens by the end of March. These trends fueled same-store revenue growth of 4.6% despite 110 basis point drag on revenue growth from lower year-over-year late fees. We had excellent expense control with a 0.2% decrease in same-store expenses. The result was same-store NOI growth of 6.5%, a sequential acceleration of 310 basis points from Q4 and year-over-year core FFO growth of 21%. With fundamentals holding and performance comps becoming much easier in the upcoming months, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth through the second quarter. Our concern of a dramatic increase in vacates have not materialized and now we are into our busy leasing season when demand is typically strongest. We believe that vacate risk to our elevated occupancy has likely been postponed until the end of the summer, or even into the fall. Turning to external growth. The acquisition market continues to be expensive, and we remain disciplined, but opportunistic. Year-to-date, we've been able to close or put under contract a little over $300 million in acquisitions. These are primarily lease up properties, and several of the properties came from our bridge lending program. Looking forward, we anticipate the majority of additional acquisitions to be completed in joint ventures. And we have plenty of capital to invest if we find additional opportunities that create long-term value for our shareholders. We were very active in Q1 on the third-party management front adding 61 stores in the quarter, which include the previously announced JCAP stores. Our growth was partially offset by dispositions were only sold to other operators at prices we viewed as unattractive to the REIT. While this trend presents a headwind, we still expect solid growth in our third-party management platform for the year. As I said on our last call, we are mindful of the risks we face. These include difficult fourth quarter operational comps, a tight labor market and new supply and state of emergency orders in certain markets. That said, current fundamentals are the strongest we have seen in some time, and our team is prepared to use all our available tools to optimize performance. Our first quarter outperformance coupled with steady external growth, the improving 2021 outlook allow us to increase our industry leading annual guidance $0.075 at the midpoint. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. So, I think the most exciting, accelerating trend we see is in rental rate growth, which has increased every month this year. Certainly, in the second quarter, we're going to have very easy comps and we're going to see some numbers that are eye popping. But with very high occupancy, muted vacates, we've been a lot -- we're allowed to -- we've been allowed to be aggressive on rate. Sure. We have a very full pipeline in that area of our business and we're onboarding an awful lot of stores. We are very confident that it will achieve our original projections for growth in that business. What we're seeing that challenges where pricing is in the market, a certain number of our owners want to start -- want to take advantage of where pricing is. And we can't always -- as we look at the pricing, it's achieved, we choose not to match it and not to acquire the store. We always get that opportunity. But at some pricing levels, we just don't feel it's appropriate for the REIT to buy those stores. So I think you're going to see in 2021 a lot more on boards, also a lot more dispositions, but a very positive net increase in stores in our management platform. Thanks, Jeff. I would add one is our guidance anticipates that the restrictions that are in place currently remain in place for the remainder of the year. So to the extent any of those are lifted earlier, that could provide some uplift to us. Thanks, Juan. So it's a little bit of both. So occupancy was better in the first quarter, rate played out similar to what we expected. And then moving forward, we're assuming some of that occupancy benefit moves forward. And then that we have a little bit more rate power. So it's a little bit of both. So there's not a growth mandate for that venture. These are partners that we've formed previous ventures for, they have a growth mandate. So to the extent there's another portfolio, we would form a third venture with these partners and grow that way. We don't grow, we typically do it that way with the number of our partners, because we want to segregate the promotes and the performance of the stores and where you add additional stores to a venture, I guess you could account for them separately, but it's [technical difficulty] separate ventures. Does that answer the question? Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. Sure, Smedes. So, this supply environment doesn't change that much quarter-to-quarter. So we can give you some observations, but I caution that was just one quarter. I do see some indications of increased supply. So last quarter on the call, I related that in our management plus pipeline, we had switched to a majority existing stores and a minority of the pipeline was developing, which has been -- that has been the first time in a long time. Well, we've now switched back this quarter. So more development. It's one quarter, but it is a data point. Also, as we update stores that new developments that compete with our stores, we saw a slight tick up of a couple of percentage points this quarter. Now it may be that stuff that was delayed or postponed from last year because there was a bunch of that now being into the pipeline. But overall, I think we're going to see continued development, right? Self-storage is performing very well. If you're a developer and you're trying to calculate your development yield, you can probably use a 3.6 exit cap and see if someone's going to accept that. So there's a lot of reasons people would want to get into this business. As you point out costs are going up, lending is still challenging, but I think we're going to see development. I don't think the process [ph] is going to get shut off all the way. No, I think we've had very sophisticated terms in the past in terms of our ability to exit, our ability to crystallize promote periodically on these ventures that are forever, which is very important. I think we had really state-of-the-art terms. So we don't need a lot of improvement. To the extent the market changes and the level of fees you can get differs or other things will certainly be at the front end of the market, but there's no significant change in terms of our ventures. I don't think there's any very meaningful trends in that area. We really -- we don't see a lot of differences in move-outs in customers in different markets, which might be an indication to us, open versus closed markets. So we really don't see significant changes in that regard. So our use of joint ventures serves a number of purposes. A primary one is it enhances our returns. So in an environment where we think our view is if the market is expensive, it allows us to continue to grow and make good returns to our investors. So let me give you an example. We've approved so far this year 12 wholly-owned acquisitions, and they are all lease up stores. The first year yield is in the mid 3s and the stabilized yield is about 6, 16-month average stabilization. We've also approved 5 joint venture deals also lease up 12 months to stabilization, but the first year yield is 6.9 and stabilized yield is 9.9. So there's a meaningful difference to our returns when you transact in a joint venture. Now you get less money out the door, so there's constantly the discussion about do we invest more money at a lower return or less money at a higher return, but the impact to the returns to our investors is meaningful. We also on top of that get the opportunity [indiscernible] promote. None of those numbers include the promote and right now we're in the cash flow promote on a number of our ventures. And we've also realized back end promotes a number of times. The other thing it helps us do is derisk transactions, right? These debt that we invest less money in a transaction, we are balancing our portfolio in an interesting way. And then lastly, I'll say we have really good smart partners and they -- having another set of eyes on a deal or a market or an opportunity is never a bad thing. Thanks, Ki Bin. So we're going to have a period of time where we have customers who came in during kind of the height of the pandemic at very, very discounted rates. And I would expect to see their rate increases be substantially higher than kind of our normal pre-pandemic rates. Once you get to a more normalized operating environment, we're going to do what we always do, which is we're going to optimize revenue by giving different customers different rate increases, depending on where they compare to market rate, or how the property is performing, various other factors. So I don't think we're going to change our approach in all in trying to balance not raising them so high that you pushing customers out the door, but also optimizing revenue. So when we started the bridge loan program, we would simultaneously close the loans in where we would keep the mezz position and the first mortgage would add closing go to a debt partner. We found that a better execution was for us to close the loan, close both pieces of the loans on our balance sheet, package up a bunch of the firsts and then sell them to one of our debt partners. We now have two debt partners who buy firsts from us. So in the first quarter, we sold $82 million of first loans that we had previously closed and kept the mezz position. Sure. I think this is a business that has a lot of runway to grow through all market environments, through periods where things are going very well when periods are going down, development cycles. I think that the advantage professional management brings to the store is so compelling that there will be continued consolidation and we should continue to grow this business year-after-year. You're welcome. Sure. So we are constantly looking at our portfolio and trying to optimize it. And that would include outright sales of assets that we feel will not contribute to the portfolio one term and where we can reinvest the money in better performing assets, and then also reducing our exposure to certain assets or markets by selling to a JV. So these were assets that we selected where we wanted to reduce our exposure, and we felt we could reinvest the money and produce a better overall portfolio. I can't really -- given our agreements with our partners, I can't give you specifics on cap rate, [indiscernible] to say, no, it's a market deal. Thanks, Ronald. Great. Thanks everyone for spending your time and your interest in Extra Space. We're obviously off to a great start this year. Occupancy is at an all-time high. We have exceptional new customer rate growth. We continue smart, careful external growth. And all of this leads to exceptional both same-store and double-digit core FFO growth. And all of this is due to the extraordinarily hard work, dedication and focus of over 4,000 employees at Extra Space. And I want to acknowledge their work and thank them for what they've produced for our shareholders. I hope everyone has a great day. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a good first quarter with accelerating same-store revenue growth driven by all-time high occupancy and strong rental rate growth to new customers. Late fees and other income continue to be down and partially offset rental income. But we will lap this comp in the second quarter, which one has same-store revenue growth. Existing customer rent increases will also provide a tailwind in the second quarter since they were paused during much of Q2 2020. We delivered a reduction in same-store expenses despite property tax increases of 6.9% and repairs and maintenance increases of 20% due to higher year-over-year snow removal costs. These increases were offset primarily by savings in payroll and marketing. We believe payroll savings will continue throughout the year, albeit perhaps at lower levels due to wage pressure in certain markets. Marketing spend will depend on our use of this lever to drive top line revenue growth, but it should also remain down for the year. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, a year-over-year increase of 21%. Same-store property performance was the primary driver of the outperformance with additional contribution from growth and tenant insurance income and management fees. As we announced during the quarter, Moody's issued Extra Space a Baa2 credit rating, our second investment grade credit rating, now providing us access to the public bond market. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter through ATM activity and an overnight offering which combined for net proceeds of $274 million. We sold 16 stores into a joint venture and obtained debt for that venture resulting in cash proceeds to Extra Space of $132 million and an ownership interest of 55%. We plan to add a third partner to this venture in the second quarter, which will reduce our ownership interest to 16%. Our equity and disposition proceeds reduced revolving balances, and we ended the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 5.1x lower than our long-term debt target of 5.5x to 6x. Last night, we revised our 2021 guidance and annual assumptions. We raised our same-store revenue range to 5% to 6%. Same-store expense growth was reduced to 2% to 3%, resulting in same-store NOI growth range of 6% to 8%, a 175 basis point increase at the midpoint. These improvements in our same-store expectations are due to better-than-expected first quarter performance, relaxed legislative restrictions in certain markets, and better-than-expected resilience and storage fundamentals as the vaccine rolls out. We raised our full year core FFO range to be $5.95 to $6.10 per share, a $0.075 increase at the midpoint. We anticipate $0.14 of dilution from value add acquisitions and C of O stores, $0.02 less than previously reported due to improved property performance. We are excited by the strong performance year-to-date as well as the acceleration we see heading into the second quarter. With that, let's turn it over to Latif to start our Q&A. Yes, so well one last year we paused the existing customer rate increases for the months of April. Part of March, April, May we turn some of them back on in May, which meant the rent increase became effective in June and most of them were on by September. So between June and September, we basically started our existing customer rate increases. So easy comp for the months of April, May, June gets a little harder. And by the time you get to August, it becomes much more difficult in terms of a comp because you -- some of those were catching up for multiple months. So you had multiple waves of rate -- existing customer rate increases happening in August. Yes, so we've not seen significant increases in claims. Now that's partly due to how we've handled certain things. Obviously, you can't control the weather, but some of our claims come from things like broken pipes, that various things in tenant reinsurance. So we have tried to be proactive in terms of more video monitoring at our stores, more proactive in terms of pest control, more proactive in terms of doing things so that our pipes don't freeze. So while claims may be higher due to natural disasters, we're able to offset some of that by being proactive on managing our claims. Yes, so we're assuming that occupancy peaks in the summer at levels higher than they've been in the past, higher than historical norms. And then we're assuming that occupancy starts to move down in a more seasonal way in September, so you peak higher and then you end higher than a normal historical year. Higher than -- yes, higher than a normal year, but lower than last year. So last year was exceptionally high. Thanks, Todd. Thanks, Smedes. So early on we actually saw decreased length of stay, and throughout the pandemic it continued to increase. And it is still slightly below our historical average of where it was, call it a year-ago, but it is continuing to increase. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Todd. So if you look at our COVID savings, I would tell you, it's more G&A related. So for instance, travels way down, you do have some benefit in the store. If you look at our savings at the property, we did have an easier comp in the first quarter of last year when payroll would maybe a little higher as we started going into the COVID lockdown. Second quarter, same thing, it'll be an easier comp, but we're also being proactive on ours. And so we are looking to make sure that we have the right number of hours at our stores where our store managers are one of our biggest assets. And so we want to make sure we maximize their time in front of the customers. But with that easy comp, we're expecting it to be a savings. And then we're also adjusting up slightly for the fact that we are having a bit of a -- it's a tough -- it's a tight labor market right now. So we want to make sure that we recognize the fact that it might cost us a little more for new people coming in the door, or we may have to be more -- a little more competitive on our labor there. The third area is really marketing. And marketing we view as one of the levers we use as we have opportunities to use it to maximize rate. We will spend marketing dollars, we have had an opportunity so far this year to spend that -- we've actually decreased our marketing spend year-over-year. And we hope that trend continues, but it's something that we'll look at on a quarter-by-quarter basis."

I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff. And thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We had another strong quarter to cap off an exceptional year. Our 2022 same store revenue growth of 17.4% is the highest in our company's history and for the second consecutive year, core FFO growth was above 20%. I am proud of the Extra Space team for another year of strong performance across all aspects of the business. Now speaking to the fourth quarter, despite difficult comps and the return of seasonality, same store revenue growth was ahead of our expectations at 11.8%. Vacates continued to normalize during the quarter and demand remained seasonally steady, leading to strong same store occupancy levels ending the year at 94.2%. Our high occupancy allowed us to maximize revenue and grow customer rates across the portfolio. Despite offering lower rates to new customers, total net rent per square foot increased 12.8% year-over-year. We experienced expense pressure across many line items with same store expense growth of 6.7%, resulting in same store NOI growth of 13.4%. We were busy on the external growth front, acquiring 10 stores in the REIT or in joint ventures, adding 46 stores gross to our third party management platform and closing over $250 million in bridge loans. We were also very focused on integrating our 2022 strategic acquisitions, including the Storage Express portfolio, which is already slightly ahead of our underwriting. We anticipate full integration of the properties onto our platform by the end of the second quarter, which will provide additional digital marketing, revenue management and operational efficiencies. We have also started to test new operational strategies at both Storage Express and Extra Space stores and we are beginning to see some early external growth opportunities in new and existing markets for Storage Express. Our strong property NOI, plus our external growth efforts, resulted in core FFO growth of 9.4% in the quarter and 22.1% for the year. This allowed our Board of Directors to increase our first quarter dividend by 8%, contributing to a total five year increase of 108%. As we look forward to 2023, we are encouraged by the fundamentals of the business. New supply continues to moderate from 2018, 2019 peaks, and we expect even lower competition from new supply in our markets in 2023. Customer demand has been steady, occupancy has remained high and same store revenue growth remained above 10% through December. Our strong occupancy has allowed us to sequentially increase rates month over month to new customers since November. And we believe elevated occupancy will give us greater pricing power with new and existing customers as we move through the leasing season. We expect to face continued expense pressures but at lower levels than experienced in 2022, resulting in same store NOI guidance of 3% to 5.5%. While this level of growth represents moderation from 2022 levels, it is in line with historical norms and we believe it will compare well to other asset classes in the current environment. Our investment strategy is long term focused and we have made strategic decisions we believe will result in solid long term returns for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we modified the term of our $300 million preferred investment in NexPoint, trading yields for longer duration and additional managed properties. We also continued our acquisition strategy which focuses on asset light structures, non-stabilized stores or acquisitions with long term strategic implications, including Storage Express. While some of these initiatives caused short term dilution, we believe they provide more total value for our shareholders over time and unlock additional growth channels for years to come. Before handing the time over to Scott, I would also like to congratulate the Extra Space team for receiving our third consecutive Leader in the Light Award, NAREIT's highest ESG and sustainability honor for real estate companies. We are proud to be recognized as a REIT that delivers strong financial results and has also created a sustainable portfolio and company that is positioned to continue providing results for the long haul. I'll turn the time over to Scott now.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter, beating the high end of our FFO range by $0.04, driven by better property net operating income. Total same store expense growth improved from third quarter levels due to lower repairs and maintenance expense and success with property tax appeals. Payroll expense growth, while still high, improved quarter-over-quarter, a trend that we expect to continue into 2023. Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we swapped a total of $400 million of our variable rate debt, reducing our floating interest rate exposure to under 29% of total debt net of variable rate bridge loan receivables. We will continue to take steps to reduce our variable rate debt and we will be methodical in our approach, recognizing that forward interest rate curves signal lower rates in the future. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $335 million unsecured term loan and used the proceeds to pay down our revolving balances. We have no material maturities in 2023 and we will likely to access the investment grade bond market for growth capital needs assuming it remains orderly. Last night, we released our 2023 guidance. Like last year, we have provided wider same store revenue and NOI ranges to capture the different scenarios that we believe are possible given the unusual 2022 comparable. Our guidance assumes positive same store revenue growth for the full year. However, the pattern maybe a little different than prior periods. Our guidance assumes the growth rate will moderate more quickly in the first half of the year due to the exceptionally difficult first half comps, trough in the summer and modestly reaccelerate late in the year. Same store expenses have improved from 2022 levels at 5% to 6%, resulting in projected same store NOI of 3% to 5.5%. Our 2023 core FFO range is $8.30 to $8.60 per share. Much of our NOI growth is offset by the first year headwind of our investment in non-stabilized properties, which carry approximately $0.25 of dilution, the modification of the NexPoint preferred and higher interest rates. While each of these headwinds slows our 2023 growth, we believe they will result in stronger long term growth rates over a multiyear period for our shareholders. Our guidance includes relatively modest investment in acquisitions of $250 million due to current market conditions. Third party management increase have been stronger than normal at this time of year and we believe most of our 2023 growth will be through capital light channels. That said, we have plenty of dry powder, and we will be opportunistic if we identify accretive ways to expand our portfolio and investments to maximize FFO growth. We are off to a great start in 2023 and we are confident in our ability to maintain healthy growth through the year as we see storage fundamentals normalizing to historical levels. We believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in both inflationary and recessionary environments and that our highly diversified portfolio is well positioned for another solid year. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Scott, you talked a little bit about the cadence through '23 that you expect same store revenue growth rate will moderate, or quickly trough in the summer and then modestly reaccelerate late in the year. So I guess my question is, as we think about the exit rate for the year, does that -- I guess, that implies kind of like a mid high single digit growth rate in the first half and then kind of in the low mid single digit in the back half? Is that the right way to think about it? And then is that kind of like -- does that back half implications mean you kind of return to what is considered like a steady state or normal growth rate for the industry?\nScott Stubbs: So I think it's hard to speak for the industry. I think we're obviously speaking for us. I think that your assumptions are correct based on the comments we've given in our prepared remarks. I think one point I'd maybe make is it does not assume that we go negative versus zero at any point in the year.\nMichael Goldsmith: And then my follow-up question is just kind of on the components that get you there. Like what are the expectations around occupancy, street rate and your ability to pass along continued elevated ECRI that's going to allow you to generate this? And then, I guess, does that also imply that kind of some of the benefit from a lot of the elevated street rates and ECRI that you've experienced over the last couple of years, is that kind of burning off through the first half of this year?\nScott Stubbs: So obviously, we're always solving for revenue. So maybe some of the -- a little more detail on those. If you're on the high end of the range, it assumes that we have more pricing power. The low end would imply that maybe you have less pricing power. It also assumes that we continue to have the ability to raise existing customer rates. And we would assume that we would be operating throughout the year at a slight negative occupancy delta. But other than that, we're solving more for revenue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeffrey Spector with BofA Securities.\nJeffrey Spector: First question, I feel like I need to ask. Are you happy with your scale today? And on the acquisition front continuing to hit kind of, let's say, singles and doubles to increase that scale. And Joe, as you talked about, you've really added on some new technology initiatives or new programs that you can use throughout your portfolio at some point.\nJoe Margolis: So scale is important in this business, and we have sufficient scale in almost every market we operate in and we're happy to gain more scale, but not at any cost, right? We want to be smart in our growth and we want to make sure that we are making long term accretive investments. And frequently, we use structure to do so. Our strategic investment, for example, in Storage Express will open up new acquisition channels for us, some new markets, but a lot in our existing markets, and we expect we'll gain some scale through that.\nJeffrey Spector: And then [Multiple Speakers] is there something else?\nJoe Margolis: No, I was just saying -- I was acknowledging your thank you and saying thank you to you again.\nJeffrey Spector: If I can ask a second on operations, just so we can compare to your peer that's already reported, provided guidance, so it's apples-to-apples. And your guidance, the bottom, the lower end of the range, does that specifically reflect, let's say, a recession hard landing versus the upper end of the range of soft landing? And if not, how would you describe your guidance?\nJoe Margolis: I mean, it's hard to say what constitutes a recession, what constitutes a soft landing. Clearly, the lower end of our guidance reflects more economic weakness that gives us less pricing power, as Scott said, and the upper end of the guidance is -- and I'm talking about same store guidance now, is more reflective of the stronger consumer and the stronger economy.\nJeffrey Spector: I'm sorry, can I just ask one follow-up? I don't know if there's a limit.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nJeffrey Spector: So then I guess my follow-up is, again, I'm just trying to put in -- think about how the year ended, what we've heard so far, again, given your competitor -- and we all knew that the first half is tough comps. I guess what are we looking for in terms of upside to the -- where peak leasing would be stronger than expected, maybe stronger than the midpoint is? Are we focusing more on occupancy, street rate? Like what are some of the things we should be focusing on?\nJoe Margolis: So again, I'll reference Scott's thing. We're going to focus on revenue and whatever tools we can use be that occupancy, or discounts, or marketing spend, or all the different tools we can use to maximize revenue. We'll clearly be looking at top of the funnel demand, which is very indicative of what we can eventually charge our conversion rate through different channels. But at the end of the day, we're solving for revenue and we'll use the various components as best we see fit to maximize long term revenue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: First question, I guess, just following up on the guidance a little bit. I guess, maybe first, what are you seeing in terms of occupancy trends today, where is occupancy, what does that look like year-over-year? And then, Scott, you mentioned in terms of the guidance that you're expecting occupancy to be lower year-over-year. But consistent with what you said about the sort of cadence of revenue growth, do you expect occupancy to be sort of flat or higher year-over-year in the second half of '23?\nScott Stubbs: So one thing I'd point to on occupancy, we have a really tough comp early on last year. Now that being said, we're happy with where we are today. Today, we're still -- we're at 93.5%. We've actually closed our gap slightly since we started the year. And so we're happy with where we are. I think that when we look at our guidance and the opportunity here, it's going to be in rate. If you look at how our rates have done more recently, we've actually raised them month over month starting in November, which is odd for this time of the year. Normally, you're lowering rates November, December, January, February. February, you bottom out and this has been odd in that we've raised them each month since November.\nTodd Thomas: And then what is the guidance for tenant reinsurance income and management fee income growth. What does that assume in terms of net growth to the third party management platform during the year?\nScott Stubbs: So we are continuing to add properties. The one thing that we have is it's a bit of a weird comp with last year where we lost some stores that were stabilized. And so you have the full revenue impact last year, and we're assuming we replace them more with lease-up stores. And so a lease-up store obviously has very low tenant insurance penetration, some of them are actually at our management fee minimums. So that should grow throughout the year. In addition, we bought several properties out of our third party management and those properties, if they are wholly owned, we no longer collect management fees on those. I believe we bought 16 properties out of that pool this year.\nJoe Margolis: 39.\nScott Stubbs: 39 total, but 16 were wholly owned.\nJoe Margolis: 16 into JVs.\nTodd Thomas: But does the guidance assume net growth to the third party management platform during the year or sort of unchanged relative to where you ended the year?\nJoe Margolis: So we have modeled in our guidance pretty modest growth in the third party management business, and that's because a lot of the growth tends to be from transactions. And the transaction market is muted at least in the start of the year. Now that being said, for the first two months of the year, we've experienced much better demand and much better action in the third party management than has modeled, and we'll see if that continues for the rest of the year.\nTodd Thomas: And then if I could just sneak in one more here also. Just Joe, back to investments. You talked about investments you're making that often are dilutive upfront, but there's really good attractive long term value creation in the future. Does that strategy change at all today, just given maybe the current outlook, a little bit more uncertainty, perhaps you dial back on investments that aren't stabilized and that are at lower initial yields, or do you sort of keep feeding that pipeline? And is that strategy different for single asset acquisitions versus larger portfolios, larger scale transactions, or do you view them similarly?\nJoe Margolis: So I don't think we dialed back in the sense if we see what we believe is a long term attractive investment that we want to acquire it. I would think we might do more in joint ventures to mute or avoid that initial dilution than we have in the past, right? Last year for the REIT, we bought -- almost everything we bought was lease-up value add and we increased our dilution from $0.20 to $0.25, which is a little bit of a headwind. Given our pipeline, and I don't know what the rest of the year is going to bring, but at least as we stand today, I think we'll likely go in the other direction next year and realize a bunch of that $0.25.\nTodd Thomas: And then any thought on how you think about that between single asset deals or larger scale transactions, would that be the same response?\nJoe Margolis: The variables when we look at a single asset versus a large transaction include availability of our capital, availability of joint venture capital; how we feel about the deal. Timing, sometimes timing forces you in one direction. So we'll look at every opportunity in and of itself, and the unique characteristics of that opportunity will lead us to what we feel would be the best execution for our shareholders.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.\nKeegan Carl: I know this was kind of touched on first, but maybe just a little bit more information. So your interest expense is obviously going to grow significantly year-over-year. How much of a change in your view long term does this have regarding floating rate debt? I know you obviously said you're looking at the forward curve, but things changed. So just kind of curious here.\nScott Stubbs: So our guidance, obviously, we took a point in time with that interest rate curve, it moves almost every single day. It depends a little bit on what the Fed does, how they speak on conference calls, things like that. So it's our best guess today. It also -- it takes our current portfolio as it is today and applies that curve is basically what we're doing, Keegan.\nKeegan Carl: But I mean that's not going to change. Like you're still -- I know in the past, you mentioned 20% to 30% is your ideal range for floating rate debt. That's still the case, is that?\nScott Stubbs: I think you'll see us look to work that down, but we do believe in some variable rate debt -- and I think that we're a little higher today than we would like to be. And so you'll see us look to term some of that out either through the bond market or use swaps to move that to be more fixed going forward.\nKeegan Carl: And second one here. Just kind of given what's going on with the broader peer group, and you guys alluding earlier that you're interested in possible scale. Would you guys be interested in getting involved at all at the current potential deal out there?\nJoe Margolis: So we're not going to comment on deals that are in the market.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to maybe get a little more color around the expense components. Maybe just how -- what are you seeing in terms of payroll and benefits and maybe how are you thinking about marketing costs, which I know pretty probably relatively low last year, but I see that they're going to go up some. But maybe just a little bit of detail around those?\nScott Stubbs: I\u2019d probably just give you some color around what our guidance assumes this next year. So our guidance for the year, we gave 5% to 6%. Let's start maybe with a couple of big items that are below that number. So payroll assumes 4% growth. Our property taxes are about 4% growth. Marketing is slightly higher. It's more in the 10% range and then the other one is -- we're expecting it to be a difficult property in casualty market. And so we're expecting to see that grow more. We also are seeing things grow like electricity and gas. Those are more in the high single digits, but we have done some things to offset that with our solar program. I mean, over 50% of our stores have solar. So while it's a high percentage, it's not a huge number.\nSmedes Rose: And then I was just wondering, you modified the NexPoint relationship. Was there any particular reason to do that now? Just kind of wondering if you could maybe provide a little more detail around that and you got the right -- I guess the right approach refusal?\nJoe Margolis: So pre-modification, there were two instruments, the $100 million preferred and the $200 million preferred. The $100 million was open for prepayment, that's probably a dead way to say it, but whatever the equivalent is in preferred equity and the $200 million would open this year. So we're in a situation where they could have paid off those instruments and we would have no investment. So we felt it was better to extend the terms, reduce the rate, which is costly to us this year, but long term we're getting a very accretive rate on those dollars. And we picked up 11 management stores initially, an agreement that we will manage everything for them in the future. The management contracts run three years past the payoff of the preferred. So they're very long term management contracts. And as you point out, a right of first offer, not a right of first refusal on the assets.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This next question comes from Spenser Allaway of Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Maybe just another one on capital deployment. You mentioned the focus on asset light channels. But can you maybe more specifically walk us through your capital allocation priority list, where are you seeing the best return on investment right now as you look across those various asset light avenues of growth?\nJoe Margolis: So redevelopment of existing properties is very relatively safe on the risk reward profile. We have the asset, we know the market, we've run the store for some period of time. So building on excess land, building on RV lots, taking single story, turning it into multistory, that is relatively asset light, right? We already own the land, we already have a lot of the infrastructure and as returns 8.5% to 10%. So we'll continue to do that and in fact, we'll ramp that up over the next few years, that we'll continue to do. The bridge loan program is -- we're seeing much stronger demand than that than we thought. You saw our numbers for the fourth quarter, we're really happy with that. We expect to have a very strong year then. The benefits of that include the economics of managing the stores. The ability -- the opportunity to buy many of them, we bought a good number of them over time. And then, of course, the economics of the loan itself. And we can make that capital light because we retain the option at any time and have been selling eight pieces. Our management business, which we expect another strong year is a very, very capital light option and we'll absolutely prioritize that with the other two. Joint ventures, we're a little quieter in the fourth quarter. And in the first quarter this year than we were for the first two quarters of last year as our joint venture partners have some of the capital issues that we know those types of private equity funds are having now, but I expect them to be back sometime in the year and then we'll pick up on the joint venture program. And we're always in discussions with folks about innovative and unique structures and we hope to do some of those as well.\nSpenser Allaway: And then as move-out activity has accelerated with the return of seasonality, are there any markets or regions that stand out with greater move-out activity or to the contrary have been stickier than others?\nScott Stubbs: Some of the markets that have been a little softer for us, Sacramento is probably the most difficult one for us, Phoenix has slowed and Las Vegas, are really the three that I would point to is maybe really below the average.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just two quick ones. Going back to the comments on sort of the rent growth. I think you mentioned you've been able to sort of push rents since November, which is unusual for this time of the year and for the past couple of months. Just maybe a little bit more details around that, particularly interested in the ECRI and what the intensity is today versus maybe the peak of COVID and what the guidance assumes?\nJoe Margolis: So ECRI during the peak of COVID was very constrained by governmental regulations. And then as those regulations dropped off kind of state by state, we had kind of catch-up ECRI, where we had greater than normal, if you will, rent increases because we have this wider than normal gap between what customers were paying and what was street rate. As we look forward into 2023, we expect ECRI to continue to be an important tool for us. Customers are reacting the same way to ECRI notices as they have in the past. In fact, the incremental move-out from ECRI has trended down and is heading towards -- isn't there yet, but it's heading towards more historical norm levels. So I don't think we'll have the same kind of outsized ECRI that we did at the -- when the rent restrictions were first lifted and the gaps were extra large, but our ECRI will be important, particularly as we're giving up some rate now to get customers in. So they're coming in at a discounted rate and we'll have the opportunity to get them to market rate at the appropriate time.\nRonald Kamdem: And then maybe just a bigger picture question about sort of top of the funnel demand. You hear a lot about sort of the economy slowing down, housing activity has slowed, people are presumably moving less than they were during the pandemic. But it sounds like what you're seeing on the ground is that top of the funnel demand, I think you mentioned just as good as you've seen it. So trying to get a sense of what in your minds and what do you think is driving that, what are you hearing from customers on the top of the funnel?\nJoe Margolis: So I think we have systems and methods to capture the demand that's out there that gives us a competitive advantage. Certainly, a competitive advantage over the smaller operators. And I hope and we certainly strive to have a competitive advantage over our public peers as well. So our ability to capture the demand that's out there and then convert a high percentage of it is really, really crucial and important to driving our success, particularly where demand does soften a little, and demand has softened from the peaks of cover, it's just back to more historical levels.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping, Joe, maybe you could extend a little bit upon some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks at the outset about testing new strategies and opportunities in both new and existing markets with regards to what you acquired in Storage Express and in your own existing portfolio. What that means and what we could see opened up here going forward?\nJoe Margolis: I can give you an example of that. So we have this year converted two existing Storage Express stores to Extra Space stores, put in a manager, and we'll run them at our typical model. And we're in the process of converting five Extra Space stores to the Storage Express method of operation and three of those are in our primary markets, Chicago, Seattle and Vegas. So we're really interested in seeing how these two different operating models work in different markets and learn what type of store market situation characteristic the more remote managed model works and where we can maximize performance with the manager in the store. And I think this will allow us not only to optimize our current portfolio but to grow in our current markets using two different operating styles.\nJuan Sanabria: And is the brand the same across both of those or is that kind of a separate point altogether? Just wanted to make sure I understood that piece.\nJoe Margolis: So we are running two brands. We have Extra Space and Storage Express, and that is something we'll learn more about over time, and we'll see where it takes us.\nJuan Sanabria: And then just curious on the transactions market, where you see the stabilized cap rates that you're searching for today, given the changes in cost of capital and how that's evolved over the last, I guess, 12 months as rates have kind of moved higher. So just curious on what stabilized cap rates are, I guess?\nJoe Margolis: So they're higher. I mean, I think it's very difficult to say given the paucity of transactions. And each transaction is sort of -- that sort of is unique and has its own characteristics. If you put a gun to my head, I would say stabilized cap rates are in the low 5s, but it depends a lot on the individual deal. And given our cost of capital, that doesn't work for us on a wholly owned basis.\nJuan Sanabria: And then just one more, if you wouldn't mind. What's the street rates that you kind of exited the year end, what are you experiencing in January on a year-over-year basis?\nScott Stubbs: So today, we are -- it's really that time of year when you're really at the bottom. If you look at our churn where -- our move-out rates compared to our move-ins, we're about a negative churn of about 23%, which is slightly more than it was in prior years. But again, this is the worst time of the year, it should start getting better in March.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Scott, I just wanted to come back to the comment and maybe the one Joe made about kind of the first half, second half, and just to make sure I didn\u2019t misunderstand when -- I know you've got very tough comps certainly in the first half. But are you suggesting that like the Q4 same store revenue growth will be above the first quarter same store revenue growth and that you'll be accelerating into '24? I just want to make sure when I think about the cadence of same store revenue growth throughout the year properly.\nScott Stubbs: Maybe just help you get a little bit more of a reference point. We ended last year double digit, so we are coming down from there. And what we're suggesting is with the difficult comps, it obviously is decelerating more quickly because of those comps. But the first quarter -- the implication is that the first quarter will be your best. You then trough in that mid part of the year and then a slight reacceleration in the back half. I wouldn't put it in anything other than a slight reacceleration from that trough, from the midpoint, the mid part of the year.\nSteve Sakwa: And then I just wanted to clarify on the kind of the loan book, because I've seen some different numbers. I think on the guidance page, you said that the loan book would have about $650 million of outstanding balance. If I look back at, I guess, the notes receivable page in the supplemental, I'm just trying to square up kind of the notes receivable balances at the end of the year. I guess, things that are slated to close, it sounds like this year, almost seem like they're above the $650 million. Now maybe you're not keeping all of that and some of those will be sold. But I was just trying to broadly thinking how much new money is going out, what's getting repaid, what's the net investment in the loan book this year?\nScott Stubbs: So maybe a little difference in how we were doing guidance this year versus last year. This year, what we guided to was the average balance outstanding. So that's a little different than what we were showing in prior years. I think we were showing more loan closings and it was getting difficult to do with sales and things like that. We ended the year at $490 million or just above $490 million in terms of outstanding balances. So that average of $650 million implies that many of the loans that we're closing in the first half of the year, we carry throughout the year, but we will continue to sell some loans. We'll still continue to sell some of those eight pieces.\nSteve Sakwa: And just as a quick follow-up. Is that about the level that you think that business will be running at on a go forward basis, or could you see that number scaling up? I guess, Joe's comment suggest that there's a lot of activity out there, but I didn't know how large you wanted to make that business as a percentage of FFO going forward?\nJoe Margolis: The business has so many benefits to us. I'd be happy to continue to grow it, particularly with our ability to sell A notes and manage the amount of capital we have committed to it. But it is somewhat of a treadmill, right? We are going to get to a point where these loans start to mature. We don't have a lot of maturities this year, but starting next year. And that will kind of naturally constrain the growth, if you know what I mean.\nSteve Sakwa: So you think like $650 million is a reasonable balance to try and keep with things coming in and out going forward?\nJoe Margolis: I don't want to agree or disagree with that, because we may have opportunities to grow it past that or we may buy a bunch of the collateral and bring it below that. So I know you're looking for me to give you a spot number, but I really can't.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Just going back to the move-in rate question or achieved rates. What was it year-over-year in fourth quarter and on a year-over-year basis, how has that trended into February? And broadly speaking, what's assumed at the midpoint of guidance for '23?\nScott Stubbs: The negative churn -- so let's just go to our achieved rate. Our achieved rate in the fourth quarter was just over 15% negative. It troughed in November and continue to get better through February, that year-over-year delta. So in February, we're about negative 11%. And also, I'd point to the fact that these are really difficult comps in 2021. Those were the highest rates we've ever experienced. So while they are negative, just I think it's relevant to point out that comp in the prior year.\nKi Bin Kim: And did you want to -- could you comment on what's implicit in guidance?\nScott Stubbs: So guidance, we focus more on the growth month-over-month. If you look back to last year, we actually started experiencing negative achieved rate growth in June. And so our rates were negative in June, and the assumption is as they start to move positive and have that pricing power as we move into rental season.\nKi Bin Kim: And one of the wildcards is what's happening with the housing market and how that might be impacted in terms of people moving, downsizing or upsizing that might use storage. I guess how are you thinking about that wildcard as we head into 2023, and if you're assuming that is more of a normal type of environment or does the state kind of challenging?\nScott Stubbs: So I think our assumption is that we -- none of us feel like the economy is really, really good today. I think that's most people here would tell you that. But the assumption is, as it continues like it is today, we have not guided or anything, and our guidance implies a severe recession or a big downturn. Clearly, we think a healthy housing market is better for self storage, but self storage does well in good times as well as bad. So it impacts it but maybe not as negatively as other parts of the economy.\nKi Bin Kim: And if I can squeeze a quick third one here. In your guidance, in your share count, you're assuming all the OP is converted to common stock. Can you just touch on that?\nScott Stubbs: Our share counts have always assumed the as-if converted.\nKi Bin Kim: So it's not actual conversion? Okay, got it\u2026\nScott Stubbs: No. It's no change, correct. It's the as-if converted method.\nOperator: And thank you for your questions. That completes our Q&A segment. At this time, I'll turn it back over to Joe Margolis and team for any closing remarks.\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Extra Space Storage. I hope we've communicated that we are really well positioned to have a solid year in 2023. And we're fortunate to be in an asset class that will succeed in whatever economic climate we face. And I feel lucky to have the best team and operating platform that will set us up for success in 2023 and the years to come. Thank you very much, everyone. Have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you for your participation in today's conference. That does conclude the program. You all may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. And thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We had another strong quarter to cap off an exceptional year. Our 2022 same store revenue growth of 17.4% is the highest in our company's history and for the second consecutive year, core FFO growth was above 20%. I am proud of the Extra Space team for another year of strong performance across all aspects of the business. Now speaking to the fourth quarter, despite difficult comps and the return of seasonality, same store revenue growth was ahead of our expectations at 11.8%. Vacates continued to normalize during the quarter and demand remained seasonally steady, leading to strong same store occupancy levels ending the year at 94.2%. Our high occupancy allowed us to maximize revenue and grow customer rates across the portfolio. Despite offering lower rates to new customers, total net rent per square foot increased 12.8% year-over-year. We experienced expense pressure across many line items with same store expense growth of 6.7%, resulting in same store NOI growth of 13.4%. We were busy on the external growth front, acquiring 10 stores in the REIT or in joint ventures, adding 46 stores gross to our third party management platform and closing over $250 million in bridge loans. We were also very focused on integrating our 2022 strategic acquisitions, including the Storage Express portfolio, which is already slightly ahead of our underwriting. We anticipate full integration of the properties onto our platform by the end of the second quarter, which will provide additional digital marketing, revenue management and operational efficiencies. We have also started to test new operational strategies at both Storage Express and Extra Space stores and we are beginning to see some early external growth opportunities in new and existing markets for Storage Express. Our strong property NOI, plus our external growth efforts, resulted in core FFO growth of 9.4% in the quarter and 22.1% for the year. This allowed our Board of Directors to increase our first quarter dividend by 8%, contributing to a total five year increase of 108%. As we look forward to 2023, we are encouraged by the fundamentals of the business. New supply continues to moderate from 2018, 2019 peaks, and we expect even lower competition from new supply in our markets in 2023. Customer demand has been steady, occupancy has remained high and same store revenue growth remained above 10% through December. Our strong occupancy has allowed us to sequentially increase rates month over month to new customers since November. And we believe elevated occupancy will give us greater pricing power with new and existing customers as we move through the leasing season. We expect to face continued expense pressures but at lower levels than experienced in 2022, resulting in same store NOI guidance of 3% to 5.5%. While this level of growth represents moderation from 2022 levels, it is in line with historical norms and we believe it will compare well to other asset classes in the current environment. Our investment strategy is long term focused and we have made strategic decisions we believe will result in solid long term returns for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we modified the term of our $300 million preferred investment in NexPoint, trading yields for longer duration and additional managed properties. We also continued our acquisition strategy which focuses on asset light structures, non-stabilized stores or acquisitions with long term strategic implications, including Storage Express. While some of these initiatives caused short term dilution, we believe they provide more total value for our shareholders over time and unlock additional growth channels for years to come. Before handing the time over to Scott, I would also like to congratulate the Extra Space team for receiving our third consecutive Leader in the Light Award, NAREIT's highest ESG and sustainability honor for real estate companies. We are proud to be recognized as a REIT that delivers strong financial results and has also created a sustainable portfolio and company that is positioned to continue providing results for the long haul. I'll turn the time over to Scott now. So scale is important in this business, and we have sufficient scale in almost every market we operate in and we're happy to gain more scale, but not at any cost, right? We want to be smart in our growth and we want to make sure that we are making long term accretive investments. And frequently, we use structure to do so. Our strategic investment, for example, in Storage Express will open up new acquisition channels for us, some new markets, but a lot in our existing markets, and we expect we'll gain some scale through that. No, I was just saying -- I was acknowledging your thank you and saying thank you to you again. I mean, it's hard to say what constitutes a recession, what constitutes a soft landing. Clearly, the lower end of our guidance reflects more economic weakness that gives us less pricing power, as Scott said, and the upper end of the guidance is -- and I'm talking about same store guidance now, is more reflective of the stronger consumer and the stronger economy. Sure. So again, I'll reference Scott's thing. We're going to focus on revenue and whatever tools we can use be that occupancy, or discounts, or marketing spend, or all the different tools we can use to maximize revenue. We'll clearly be looking at top of the funnel demand, which is very indicative of what we can eventually charge our conversion rate through different channels. But at the end of the day, we're solving for revenue and we'll use the various components as best we see fit to maximize long term revenue. 39. 16 into JVs. So we have modeled in our guidance pretty modest growth in the third party management business, and that's because a lot of the growth tends to be from transactions. And the transaction market is muted at least in the start of the year. Now that being said, for the first two months of the year, we've experienced much better demand and much better action in the third party management than has modeled, and we'll see if that continues for the rest of the year. So I don't think we dialed back in the sense if we see what we believe is a long term attractive investment that we want to acquire it. I would think we might do more in joint ventures to mute or avoid that initial dilution than we have in the past, right? Last year for the REIT, we bought -- almost everything we bought was lease-up value add and we increased our dilution from $0.20 to $0.25, which is a little bit of a headwind. Given our pipeline, and I don't know what the rest of the year is going to bring, but at least as we stand today, I think we'll likely go in the other direction next year and realize a bunch of that $0.25. The variables when we look at a single asset versus a large transaction include availability of our capital, availability of joint venture capital; how we feel about the deal. Timing, sometimes timing forces you in one direction. So we'll look at every opportunity in and of itself, and the unique characteristics of that opportunity will lead us to what we feel would be the best execution for our shareholders. So we're not going to comment on deals that are in the market. So pre-modification, there were two instruments, the $100 million preferred and the $200 million preferred. The $100 million was open for prepayment, that's probably a dead way to say it, but whatever the equivalent is in preferred equity and the $200 million would open this year. So we're in a situation where they could have paid off those instruments and we would have no investment. So we felt it was better to extend the terms, reduce the rate, which is costly to us this year, but long term we're getting a very accretive rate on those dollars. And we picked up 11 management stores initially, an agreement that we will manage everything for them in the future. The management contracts run three years past the payoff of the preferred. So they're very long term management contracts. And as you point out, a right of first offer, not a right of first refusal on the assets. So redevelopment of existing properties is very relatively safe on the risk reward profile. We have the asset, we know the market, we've run the store for some period of time.

And we're always in discussions with folks about innovative and unique structures and we hope to do some of those as well. So ECRI during the peak of COVID was very constrained by governmental regulations. And then as those regulations dropped off kind of state by state, we had kind of catch-up ECRI, where we had greater than normal, if you will, rent increases because we have this wider than normal gap between what customers were paying and what was street rate. As we look forward into 2023, we expect ECRI to continue to be an important tool for us. Customers are reacting the same way to ECRI notices as they have in the past. In fact, the incremental move-out from ECRI has trended down and is heading towards -- isn't there yet, but it's heading towards more historical norm levels. So I don't think we'll have the same kind of outsized ECRI that we did at the -- when the rent restrictions were first lifted and the gaps were extra large, but our ECRI will be important, particularly as we're giving up some rate now to get customers in. So they're coming in at a discounted rate and we'll have the opportunity to get them to market rate at the appropriate time. So I think we have systems and methods to capture the demand that's out there that gives us a competitive advantage. Certainly, a competitive advantage over the smaller operators. And I hope and we certainly strive to have a competitive advantage over our public peers as well. So our ability to capture the demand that's out there and then convert a high percentage of it is really, really crucial and important to driving our success, particularly where demand does soften a little, and demand has softened from the peaks of cover, it's just back to more historical levels. I can give you an example of that. So we have this year converted two existing Storage Express stores to Extra Space stores, put in a manager, and we'll run them at our typical model. And we're in the process of converting five Extra Space stores to the Storage Express method of operation and three of those are in our primary markets, Chicago, Seattle and Vegas. So we're really interested in seeing how these two different operating models work in different markets and learn what type of store market situation characteristic the more remote managed model works and where we can maximize performance with the manager in the store. And I think this will allow us not only to optimize our current portfolio but to grow in our current markets using two different operating styles. So we are running two brands. We have Extra Space and Storage Express, and that is something we'll learn more about over time, and we'll see where it takes us. So they're higher. I mean, I think it's very difficult to say given the paucity of transactions. And each transaction is sort of -- that sort of is unique and has its own characteristics. If you put a gun to my head, I would say stabilized cap rates are in the low 5s, but it depends a lot on the individual deal. And given our cost of capital, that doesn't work for us on a wholly owned basis. The business has so many benefits to us. I'd be happy to continue to grow it, particularly with our ability to sell A notes and manage the amount of capital we have committed to it. But it is somewhat of a treadmill, right? We are going to get to a point where these loans start to mature. We don't have a lot of maturities this year, but starting next year. And that will kind of naturally constrain the growth, if you know what I mean. I don't want to agree or disagree with that, because we may have opportunities to grow it past that or we may buy a bunch of the collateral and bring it below that. So I know you're looking for me to give you a spot number, but I really can't. Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Extra Space Storage. I hope we've communicated that we are really well positioned to have a solid year in 2023. And we're fortunate to be in an asset class that will succeed in whatever economic climate we face. And I feel lucky to have the best team and operating platform that will set us up for success in 2023 and the years to come. Thank you very much, everyone. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter, beating the high end of our FFO range by $0.04, driven by better property net operating income. Total same store expense growth improved from third quarter levels due to lower repairs and maintenance expense and success with property tax appeals. Payroll expense growth, while still high, improved quarter-over-quarter, a trend that we expect to continue into 2023. Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we swapped a total of $400 million of our variable rate debt, reducing our floating interest rate exposure to under 29% of total debt net of variable rate bridge loan receivables. We will continue to take steps to reduce our variable rate debt and we will be methodical in our approach, recognizing that forward interest rate curves signal lower rates in the future. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $335 million unsecured term loan and used the proceeds to pay down our revolving balances. We have no material maturities in 2023 and we will likely to access the investment grade bond market for growth capital needs assuming it remains orderly. Last night, we released our 2023 guidance. Like last year, we have provided wider same store revenue and NOI ranges to capture the different scenarios that we believe are possible given the unusual 2022 comparable. Our guidance assumes positive same store revenue growth for the full year. However, the pattern maybe a little different than prior periods. Our guidance assumes the growth rate will moderate more quickly in the first half of the year due to the exceptionally difficult first half comps, trough in the summer and modestly reaccelerate late in the year. Same store expenses have improved from 2022 levels at 5% to 6%, resulting in projected same store NOI of 3% to 5.5%. Our 2023 core FFO range is $8.30 to $8.60 per share. Much of our NOI growth is offset by the first year headwind of our investment in non-stabilized properties, which carry approximately $0.25 of dilution, the modification of the NexPoint preferred and higher interest rates. While each of these headwinds slows our 2023 growth, we believe they will result in stronger long term growth rates over a multiyear period for our shareholders. Our guidance includes relatively modest investment in acquisitions of $250 million due to current market conditions. Third party management increase have been stronger than normal at this time of year and we believe most of our 2023 growth will be through capital light channels. That said, we have plenty of dry powder, and we will be opportunistic if we identify accretive ways to expand our portfolio and investments to maximize FFO growth. We are off to a great start in 2023 and we are confident in our ability to maintain healthy growth through the year as we see storage fundamentals normalizing to historical levels. We believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in both inflationary and recessionary environments and that our highly diversified portfolio is well positioned for another solid year. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. So I think it's hard to speak for the industry. I think we're obviously speaking for us. I think that your assumptions are correct based on the comments we've given in our prepared remarks. I think one point I'd maybe make is it does not assume that we go negative versus zero at any point in the year. So obviously, we're always solving for revenue. So maybe some of the -- a little more detail on those. If you're on the high end of the range, it assumes that we have more pricing power. The low end would imply that maybe you have less pricing power. It also assumes that we continue to have the ability to raise existing customer rates. And we would assume that we would be operating throughout the year at a slight negative occupancy delta. But other than that, we're solving more for revenue. So one thing I'd point to on occupancy, we have a really tough comp early on last year. Now that being said, we're happy with where we are today. Today, we're still -- we're at 93.5%. We've actually closed our gap slightly since we started the year. And so we're happy with where we are. I think that when we look at our guidance and the opportunity here, it's going to be in rate. If you look at how our rates have done more recently, we've actually raised them month over month starting in November, which is odd for this time of the year. Normally, you're lowering rates November, December, January, February. February, you bottom out and this has been odd in that we've raised them each month since November. So we are continuing to add properties. The one thing that we have is it's a bit of a weird comp with last year where we lost some stores that were stabilized. And so you have the full revenue impact last year, and we're assuming we replace them more with lease-up stores. And so a lease-up store obviously has very low tenant insurance penetration, some of them are actually at our management fee minimums. So that should grow throughout the year. In addition, we bought several properties out of our third party management and those properties, if they are wholly owned, we no longer collect management fees on those. I believe we bought 16 properties out of that pool this year. 39 total, but 16 were wholly owned. So our guidance, obviously, we took a point in time with that interest rate curve, it moves almost every single day. It depends a little bit on what the Fed does, how they speak on conference calls, things like that. So it's our best guess today. It also -- it takes our current portfolio as it is today and applies that curve is basically what we're doing, Keegan. I think you'll see us look to work that down, but we do believe in some variable rate debt -- and I think that we're a little higher today than we would like to be. And so you'll see us look to term some of that out either through the bond market or use swaps to move that to be more fixed going forward. I'd probably just give you some color around what our guidance assumes this next year. So our guidance for the year, we gave 5% to 6%. Let's start maybe with a couple of big items that are below that number. So payroll assumes 4% growth. Our property taxes are about 4% growth. Marketing is slightly higher. It's more in the 10% range and then the other one is -- we're expecting it to be a difficult property in casualty market. And so we're expecting to see that grow more. We also are seeing things grow like electricity and gas. Those are more in the high single digits, but we have done some things to offset that with our solar program. I mean, over 50% of our stores have solar. So while it's a high percentage, it's not a huge number. Some of the markets that have been a little softer for us, Sacramento is probably the most difficult one for us, Phoenix has slowed and Las Vegas, are really the three that I would point to is maybe really below the average. So today, we are -- it's really that time of year when you're really at the bottom. If you look at our churn where -- our move-out rates compared to our move-ins, we're about a negative churn of about 23%, which is slightly more than it was in prior years. But again, this is the worst time of the year, it should start getting better in March. Maybe just help you get a little bit more of a reference point. We ended last year double digit, so we are coming down from there. And what we're suggesting is with the difficult comps, it obviously is decelerating more quickly because of those comps. But the first quarter -- the implication is that the first quarter will be your best. You then trough in that mid part of the year and then a slight reacceleration in the back half. I wouldn't put it in anything other than a slight reacceleration from that trough, from the midpoint, the mid part of the year. So maybe a little difference in how we were doing guidance this year versus last year. This year, what we guided to was the average balance outstanding. So that's a little different than what we were showing in prior years. I think we were showing more loan closings and it was getting difficult to do with sales and things like that. We ended the year at $490 million or just above $490 million in terms of outstanding balances. So that average of $650 million implies that many of the loans that we're closing in the first half of the year, we carry throughout the year, but we will continue to sell some loans. We'll still continue to sell some of those eight pieces. The negative churn -- so let's just go to our achieved rate. Our achieved rate in the fourth quarter was just over 15% negative. It troughed in November and continue to get better through February, that year-over-year delta. So in February, we're about negative 11%. And also, I'd point to the fact that these are really difficult comps in 2021. Those were the highest rates we've ever experienced. So while they are negative, just I think it's relevant to point out that comp in the prior year. So guidance, we focus more on the growth month-over-month. If you look back to last year, we actually started experiencing negative achieved rate growth in June. And so our rates were negative in June, and the assumption is as they start to move positive and have that pricing power as we move into rental season. So I think our assumption is that we -- none of us feel like the economy is really, really good today. I think that's most people here would tell you that. But the assumption is, as it continues like it is today, we have not guided or anything, and our guidance implies a severe recession or a big downturn. Clearly, we think a healthy housing market is better for self storage, but self storage does well in good times as well as bad. So it impacts it but maybe not as negatively as other parts of the economy. Our share counts have always assumed the as-if converted. No. It's no change, correct. It's the as-if converted method."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Jeff Norman, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Hope. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call.

The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. With that, I\u2019d like to now turn it over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff and thank you everyone for joining today\u2019s call. We had another strong quarter with same-store revenue growth of 15.5%, driven by strong rental rate growth, partially offset by lower year-over-year occupancy. We felt expense pressure across many line items, resulting in total same-store expense growth of 12.6% and same-store NOI growth of 16.4%. We continue to be busy on the external growth front, adding 40 stores gross to our third-party management platform, closing over $100 million in bridge loans in closing a number of acquisitions, most notably the purchase of Storage Express. We view Storage Express as a strategic opportunity to acquire not only an attractive portfolio with operational upside, but a remote storage platform. We believe this will unlock an additional growth channel for Extra Space to acquire and integrate smaller properties that lend themselves to a remotely managed model. Our strong property NOI plus our external growth efforts resulted in core FFO growth of 19.5%. Core FFO includes an add-back of $0.05 per share for estimated property damage and tenant insurance claims related to Hurricane Ian. We are happy to report that all of our people remain safe during the storm and we are proud of the way our team has rallied around our employees and our customers in Southwest Florida to assist them with cleanup and restoration efforts. Core FFO in the quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations driven by stronger-than-anticipated interest income and non-same-store NOI partially offset by lower-than-expected same-store NOI. In September, we started to experience a return of seasonality, putting some pressure on occupancy and new customer rates, which were both modestly lower than our third quarter forecast. As we evaluate our standard metrics to measure demand, we see the moderation we have typically expected in the fall that did not occur in 2021. While traffic is lower year-over-year, demand is in line with pre-COVID levels. Fundamentals remain strong, just not as off the chart strong as they have been in the last six quarters. As a result, we have tightened our same-store revenue, NOI and core FFO guidance ranges, eliminating scenarios that assumed only minor seasonality on the top end of the range as well as more bare scenarios, which we do not believe will materialize. This revision results in a $0.05 or a 60 basis point decrease at the midpoint of our FFO range. We never liked the idea of having to reduce our outlook, but we are also careful to maintain perspective. Our 2022 implied same-store revenue growth is the highest in the history of our company. And this is on the back of 2021, which was our second highest revenue growth year. Our implied 2022 FFO growth at the midpoint is 21%. Our balance sheet is healthy. We have access to capital and our external growth platforms are positioned to grow on an asset-light basis. As we contemplate future potential economic landscapes, including additional inflation and/or recession, we are well-positioned to continue to produce solid results due to our resilient need-based asset class, diversified portfolio and best-in-class team and platform. We are having a great year and we look forward to finishing strong in the fourth quarter. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe and hello everyone. We had a strong third quarter, $0.01 ahead of our own internal FFO projections. While same-store revenue was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter, we did have higher than expected bad debt expense. The bad debt increase was primarily driven by lower collections from auctions. In other words, our customers\u2019 ability to pay for storage doesn\u2019t appear to have changed as much as an auction buyer\u2019s willingness to pay for auctioned goods. We experienced outsized year-over-year growth in most of our expense line items. And I think some additional detail may provide helpful context. In the third quarter of 2021, we had same-store payroll expense of negative 9% and property tax growth of negative 4.5%, which drove total Q3 2021 expense growth of negative 4%. If we evaluate our third quarter expenses on a 2-year stack, average payroll expense growth was approximately 5.2%, average property tax expense growth was 3.1%, and total \u2013 and average total annual same-store expense grew 4.2% a year. Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter, we completed an accordion transaction in our credit facility, adding $600 million of unsecured debt across two tranches. We capitalized the Storage Express transaction with $125 million in OP units at an average price per share of $201.84, with the remainder drawn on the revolving credit facility. This resulted in a net debt to EBITDA of 4.6x at the end of the quarter without the benefit of the additional EBITDA from Storage Express given the late quarter close. The revolver draws caused our variable rate debt to exceed our typical range of 20% to 30% of total debt at quarter end. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we swapped $200 million of our variable rate debt to reduce our floating interest rate exposure to approximately 35%. Additionally, our bridge loan balances provide a hedge against increases in variable rate debt effectively reducing the percentage to approximately 31% of total debt. We will continue to take steps to reduce our variable rate debt further. Our commitment to the investment grade bond market has not changed and we expect to utilize this market again once conditions normalize. As Joe mentioned, we tightened our 2022 guidance. Given the outsized growth and unique customer trends we have experienced over the past 2 years, we have had a wider-than-normal guidance range throughout the year to capture all of the different scenarios that we believe were possible. As we have moved through the fall, the moderation has been more pronounced than we projected at the high end. However, it was also not as severe on the low end, resulting in the tighter range. The reduction in same-store NOI guidance is partially offset by higher-than-expected interest income due to larger bridge loan balances and higher interest rates as well as an expected later modification date of the NexPoint preferred investment. We have also increased our forecast for management fees and other income. Interest expense estimates have increased due to debt associated with Storage Express, other acquisitions, additional bridge loans and an increase in benchmark rates. Given our total investment activity year-to-date, we have increased our acquisition investment guidance to $1.65 billion, all of which is closed or under contract. After these adjustments, we have tightened our core FFO range, which is now estimated to be between $8.30 and $8.40 per share and implied increase of approximately 21% year-over-year. We still anticipate $0.20 of dilution from value-add acquisitions in C of O stores in line with last quarter\u2019s estimate. We are having a great year and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to maintain healthy growth in 2023 as we see storage fundamentals normalizing to historical levels. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff, your line is open.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on just some of the comments on seasonality, right? I guess, Joe, can you provide any other stats or any other details to give investors comfort that again this is just normal seasonality, especially given you are right, your team normally forecast really well. So clearly, the market is somewhat surprised by the decrease at the top end of the guidance?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Well, thank you for the compliment. We do normally take pride in our forecast. I think it\u2019s important to understand we were in an environment where customer behavior is very different. We have no history of data about how customers react, coming out of a pandemic and therefore, we gave wider-than-normal ranges, because we had less confidence in our ability to exactly predict how customers would perform. What we see on fundamentals though, we do see slowing in demand in rates, in other metrics compared to the last six quarters or so. But if you look at pre-pandemic numbers, things look very strong and we are very comfortable with the state of the business.\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Jeff. Maybe just to clarify one point, the slowing in demand is year-over-year. It\u2019s very clear that it is still as good as it was pre-pandemic and very consistent with historical norms at this time of the year in terms of searches on our website calls that we are receiving at the stores and our rentals on a monthly basis.\nJeff Spector: And to confirm this is through October?\nScott Stubbs: So what we have in October, maybe just to give a bit of an update for October. Our October numbers, our occupancy is down about 30 bps from September, so not significantly different from the end of September and our rates have been steady through the month of October.\nJeff Spector: Thanks. And then my second question is do you still stand by your comment that you are ending \u201822 strong, which bodes well as we enter \u201823 or again, to confirm, are you seeing any negative signposts that would change that comment?\nJoe Margolis: No, I think if you look at our guidance range that will give you an indication of the range of where we believe we will end 2022. Anywhere in that range is better than long-term historical storage averages. So we still believe we\u2019re going to end the year strong and be set up well for 2023.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael, your line is open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon, and good morning. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. From our work, your exercise of web asking rates or street rates, have been down year-over-year through the quarter. At the same time, your occupancy rate maybe hasn\u2019t had as much pressure as others. So clearly, the goal here is that you\u2019re looking to maximize revenue. But how do you think about managing the pieces, occupancy, street rates and ECRIs? And how does your current position and strategy allow you to maximize revenues kind of through this normal seasonality into next year?\nJoe Margolis: So your statements are correct, right? We\u2019re trying to maximize revenue by using all the tools available, whether that\u2019s occupancy rate, discount, marketing expense, days to reserve, all the different levers we can do and it\u2019s done on a unit size in each store basis, not on a portfolio basis or a market basis. So we\u2019re trying to maximize revenue for whatever unit type and whatever store giving the performance and data we have on that particular unit type in the store. When you roll all of that up together onto a portfolio basis, we are certainly now favoring occupancy at the expense of rate. So we\u2019re giving up a little bit of rate to have a little higher occupancy because we believe in the long-term that will create the best long-term revenue growth for the portfolio.\nMichael Goldsmith: And by creating long-term revenue growth, you mean bring people in, get them into the system and get them on the ECRI program. Is that correct?\nJoe Margolis: Certainly, ECRI is a very important factor there, and it\u2019s also trying to attract as many longer-term customers who have a longer lifetime value than a customer who\u2019s going to come in maybe at a higher rate, but spin out after 2 or 3 months.\nMichael Goldsmith: That\u2019s helpful. And then as my follow-up question, housing turnover has been under pressure for a number of different reasons. Did you see any impact of the housing market on your results? Were the increase in interest from renters? And then does the impact of kind of housing turnover in the housing market? Is that \u2013 does that have as much of an impact now or will that have a larger impact kind of during peak leasing season when people kind of start moving up again? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Overall, a strong housing market is beneficial to self storage, and we would prefer a strong housing market than a weak housing market. That being said, there is lots of different drivers of demand for storage, and we see solid demand in good and bad housing markets. And the best example of that is during the great financial crisis where the housing market was arguably in much worse shape than it is now, and we didn\u2019t see any drop in demand because we had demand from other types of transitions, other movements that made up for the slowdown in housing transitions.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Todd, your line is open.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thank you. First, I just wanted to follow-up on the outlook and the reforecast here for the balance of the year. Can you talk about the occupancy decrease, it sounded like that fell short in the third quarter relative to what you had budgeted previously. It looked like average occupancy increased from 2Q to 3Q, which I think a typical seasonally. So where was the shortfall specifically, I guess, what fell short of budget? And then within the quarter, when did you start experiencing some of the softness that you\u2019re starting to see?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Todd, it\u2019s Scott. So I would tell you it\u2019s later in the third quarter. Certainly, post Labor Day, July and August were good for us of our forecast. Post Labor Day, I think what changed is I think you saw that seasonal occupancy go back more to the norm than what we\u2019ve seen in the last 2 years. And we\u2019ve been saying this was a possibility for 2 years. I think it came a little quicker than we were expecting when it did come, and as a result, it impacted rates. So I think the thing that\u2019s impacted us most is the rate that we are going to charge new customers and the impact on the fourth quarter. So, not necessarily occupancy but much more new customer rate coming in and seeing a little bit of deceleration there in terms of our rate.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then in terms of the sort of heightened focus on occupancy relative to rate, is there still \u2013 are you still sort of throttling back on move-in rates and increasing promotions in order to stimulate demand or has some of that stabilized?\nScott Stubbs: So our promotions year-over-year were actually down slightly in the third quarter, and we\u2019re not using promotions right now. We\u2019ve used rate more as the conversion tool. And our rates in October were flat to slightly up from where they were in September. So continues to be what we\u2019re seeing in September.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could just ask about Storage Express and the growth opportunity that you see by way of making acquisitions through that platform. What\u2019s the \u2013 I guess a couple of questions. One, what\u2019s the time frame to begin capitalizing on growth through new investments? Is it something that you \u2013 that we might expect to see you capitalize on in the near-term? And then as we think about that remote storage model, how much of EXR\u2019s portfolio today do you see the potential to roll that out across?\nJoe Margolis: So I would say the growth opportunity \u2013 the external growth opportunity in Storage Express is not in the near-term. What\u2019s in the near-term, I think, is internal growth by getting them or getting Storage Express, I shouldn\u2019t say them onto the Extra Space, pricing ECRI, customer acquisition platform, and we think we can improve the existing assets performance. That is nearer term. Until we can do that, get them on our platforms, we won\u2019t aggressively pursue external growth. So that\u2019s more of a second stage. And I think that there is a small number of Extra Space Storage that mostly things we run as Annex is now that we may be able to improve the performance of using the Storage Express model. What may be more interesting is the ability to look at modest-sized stores within our existing footprint that we don\u2019t really look at now.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Great, thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, Juan.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, thank you. Maybe just following up on Todd\u2019s question on Storage Express, it definitely seems like you\u2019ve talked to you in your opening remarks about the strategic opportunity to widen the opportunity set and maybe acquire assets that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. But to what extent, I guess, do you weigh more secondary tertiary locations where you can remote manage them and cut operating overhead to do so, but manage that against maybe weaker demographics that are in place for your existing portfolio?\nJoe Margolis: So, weaker demographic than our existing portfolio, we wouldn\u2019t expect to have similar demographics in more secondary or tertiary markets. We wouldn\u2019t expect to have the same rate growth, but we wouldn\u2019t expect to pay the same amount on a price per pound for the asset. So, it\u2019s all about proper underwriting, getting compensated for the risk you\u2019re taking and understanding. We look at our portfolio, which is about 10% in tertiary markets now. We look at the performance of primary, secondary, tertiary market, how their CAGRs compare over rolling 10-year periods every year. And we understand that tertiary markets can be more volatile, but they also can provide very good returns. So I think it\u2019s about investing at the right basis making sure you\u2019re underwriting each deal properly, understanding that in many of those markets, you\u2019re the only REIT that \u2013 we could be the only REIT that operates, which gives you somewhat of an advantage.\nScott Stubbs: Juan, the other thing I would emphasize is some of these remote assets will be in our core markets. So it\u2019s not just a tertiary market strategy here. This is expanding our existing footprint in what we kind of operate today as an annex and then running those much more efficiently.\nJuan Sanabria: And then just \u2013 any comments on supply, I mean I would assume that you\u2019ve seen delivery delays this year and maybe the \u2013 what\u2019s coming on next year may be coming down as well. But just a view, again, going back to Storage Express between what the pipeline looks like in some of these secondary or tertiary markets that have been arguably some of the hottest housing markets in some cases and maybe getting outsized attention relative to history? How that risk reward is between the primary versus secondary and tertiary from a supply perspective?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So the first part of the question, overall, we don\u2019t have any new information or data or view is still that storage deliveries are moderating, not going to zero, not dropping off the cliff, but they are moderating that there are continuing headwinds in terms of costs and interest rates and entitlement issues and the availability of debt, and that\u2019s going to be good for the industry. We have not done a \u2013 we study supply in the markets that we\u2019re active. We have not yet done a tertiary market supply analysis. We\u2019re just not at that stage yet. When we\u2019re ready to start growing this platform, we will find the right markets. We will have our guys do all the research they always do, and we will make sure we understand all the dynamics of the market before we put our investors\u2019 dollars into that market.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. If I can sneak in one quick one on the third quarter new customer rate, how did that trend throughout the quarter? And if you could just give us the year-over-year changes to where to speed on what changed and kind of what pace throughout the third quarter?\nScott Stubbs: So, in July, we saw rates down about 7% \u2013 or achieved rates. This has achieved rates on new rentals. They were down about 7%, 8% in August and then low double digits in September. So, we averaged about negative \u2013 just about 10% negative in the third quarter.\nJuan Sanabria: That\u2019s great.\nScott Stubbs: Next one.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Spenser, your line is open.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. I just wanted to go back to the topic of demand for a second. So, you mentioned that demand is roughly in line with pre-COVID levels. But given that work from home or the de-cluttering cohort is a relatively new demand driver for the sector, this would seem to imply that the other more traditional demand drivers are contributing less than average. Am I thinking about that the right way?\nJoe Margolis: So, the kind of work-from-home de-cluttering demand, that was more of a 2020 \u2013 December 2020 into 2021, maybe experience. We are back to more \u2013 today, we are back to more traditional demand drivers for new demand.\nSpenser Allaway: For new demand, correct, yes. But I am just thinking, so as we \u2013 because I am just looking at occupancy right across the sector, and we are starting to see occupancy return closer to the historic average that we have seen within the REIT portfolios for some time. And that would seem to suggest that, that work-from-home customer has decided to re-clutter their house, right? So, I understand that it might not be contributing to new demand. But as we think about where occupancy is trending, there is arguably a new user base, right, within your portfolio. So, I am just wondering how you guys kind of think about the different demand, I guess currently?\nJoe Margolis: So, I think you are only partially right. I think some of those work-from-home folks have stopped using storage. But I think there is a cohort of them that continues to use storage, and you can see that in our length-of-stay statistics, where during COVID, we had a real sharp increase in customers in our stores who have been with us for more than a year, more than 2 years. Lately, we have seen that decline a little bit, but we are still at above historic averages. So, that is telling us that some of those customers just like some of every customer that comes in some small percentage of them become that kind of permanent or quasi-permanent customer. And I think that happened during COVID as well.\nSpenser Allaway: Yes. No, that\u2019s what I am saying, I guess. What I am saying is I think we are saying the same thing, so that a portion of that new customer base, right, work-from-home is staying, which I think most of us would agree that that\u2019s the case. Then my point is that we shouldn\u2019t see occupancy fall back to the historic average, but should be somewhat elevated? And I was just curious if you guys agree that moving forward, occupancy would be perhaps slightly higher than your historic average because of that new cohort using your facilities?\nJoe Margolis: Sorry if I misunderstood, but you are saying good. I am glad we are on the same page. So, I think we can operate our stores or whatever occupancy we want, right. We can adjust the other metrics to get there. And \u2013 but I do agree with you. I think we learned during COVID that we can maximize revenue by operating stores at incrementally higher occupancy than we have historically.\nSpenser Allaway: Great. Thank you, guys.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Please standby for the next question. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little more, and I am sorry, maybe I misunderstood this, but in your core FFO, where you added back I think $0.05 or $0.06 associated primarily with Hurricane Ian and the uptick in tenant reinsurance or the claims. Will you in turn, get paid back for those claims, or is that sort of add back to get to your core FFO? I mean is there like basically a claim on those earnings and you won\u2019t be recouping them? I just wanted to understand that a little bit better.\nScott Stubbs: So, $3 million of that is losses from tenant reinsurance. So, those are claims made by our customers that we will be paying out. We are not getting it back. We add it back because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s part of the core number. And again, that\u2019s an estimate based on the data we had. Obviously, all those claims have not been filed. People are still kind of digging out down there. The other piece of the loss, the $3.2 million, that is for property loss and our loss number is actually higher than that because that is net of the estimated \u2013 the property insurance proceeds that we think we will receive. And again, those numbers are the best guess to-date. Go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: I guess I mean why would you include the \u2013 I guess the profits from the tenant reinsurance program, but you wouldn\u2019t include the subsequent claims from that piece of business? I mean isn\u2019t that just part of your business? I mean it\u2019s unusual, right? But I am just \u2013 I don\u2019t really get the add-back from that portion.\nScott Stubbs: Just we didn\u2019t view it as core. We didn\u2019t view it. We viewed it as non-recurring, much more one-time is the way we viewed it.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then you talked about leverage being like a little skewed just because you have capitalized the Storage Express transaction, but we don\u2019t have the earnings from it. Have you guys talked about what you expect the first year\u2019s contribution to be on that acquisition?\nScott Stubbs: We haven\u2019t publicly. We have said that it was a market cap rate that going in was going to be lower. We felt like it was stabilized around a $6 million and the first year, obviously, lower than that, but stabilizing around $6 million.\nSmedes Rose: And is that stabilization timeframe like 2 years to 3 years, or what\u2019s the typical?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. It\u2019s in between 2 years and 3 years. And it\u2019s an interesting one conceptually for me to try to understand yield, right. Because what we are doing is taking the cost for an entire business platform, software, people, trucks and office buildings, etcetera, etcetera, and saying the existing stores produce a return on all of that. And obviously, we didn\u2019t buy it for that. We bought it for a strategic reason because that platform can produce what we believe is future growth for us. So, that\u2019s how we came up with those numbers. I wouldn\u2019t compare it to the acquisition of a building that produces a yield because we are really buying more than just 106, 107 buildings.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Thanks Semdes.\nOperator: Please standby for the next question. Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Samir, your line is open.\nSamir Khanal: Thank you. Hey Scott, sorry if I missed this, but maybe talk about sort of changes in the average length of stay that you may be seeing at this point here as we think about the ability to push rates onto the existing customers?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. We saw similar to what I think most storage operators saw and that is our average length of stay has gotten longer. If you look at our tenants in our properties today, you are 35-ish \u2013 34 months, 35 months in terms of customers that are in there today. If you look at the tenants that have been in our properties over 2 years, that number continues to grow. It\u2019s north of 60%. So, people continue to stay longer.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Got it. And then just shifting to the I don\u2019t think we have talked about the transaction market, but maybe talk about sort of unlevered IRRs and targets and how much maybe cap rates have moved, given higher interest rates? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So, the transaction market has certainly changed. Cap rates are expanding as interest rates rise, which is natural. There is fewer participants. We see lots and lots of deals that are not getting closed, including us. We have walked from over $526 million of deals that we had under LOI based on what we thought new pricing should be. I don\u2019t think there is really any way to say with any precision what new cap rates are, how much cap rates have expanded. We \u2013 it\u2019s very deal dependent. You need to wait for a lot of transaction just not occurring. We need to wait and see how it shakes out. But certainly, the direction is clear.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you, Samir.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Please hold for our next question. Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald, your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones. You talked about sort of the pricing that achieved pricing in 3Q and so forth, which was helpful. I would love to move over to sort of the ECRI. Maybe can you comment on what you guys are seeing there? Are you still pushing it as aggressively as you were historically what the tenant feedback has been? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So, COVID and the restrictions the states put on our ability to increase rents, coupled with the rise in Street rates created that unusual situation of an extra large gap between what Street rates were and what people were paying. And we have largely made up that gap. So, we will not see \u2013 well, we still will see attractive ECRI going forward. We are not going to see those outsized increases that we experienced over the last year or so.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then going back \u2013 Sorry, did I get you all.\nJoe Margolis: Nope, not at all.\nRonald Kamdem: Going back to the guidance, I think your opening comments, I think you talked about sort of the ranges, bull case off the table. But just sort of wondering because it\u2019s pretty unusual for you guys to do that. What changed, right, over the past three months and so forth? Was there anything specific to cause the bull case to be off the table? Just trying to figure out what changed when you were redoing the numbers? A little bit more color there would be helpful.\nJoe Margolis: And I think Scott referenced earlier that after Labor Day, we saw somewhat of a change in customer behavior and a return to seasonality. And our kind of wider-than-normal guidance at the top end, at the bottom end, had different assumptions about where that will occur. And now that we have seen it begin to occur, we can narrow that guidance with more comfort that we know how customers are behaving.\nRonald Kamdem: Right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks Ron.\nOperator: At this time, I would now like to turn it back to Joe Margolis, CEO, for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJoe Margolis: Thank you and thank you everyone for your time today and your interest in Extra Space. If I could leave you with a couple of thoughts, it\u2019s that 2022 is going to be another exceptional year. Even with slowing growth in rates and very difficult comps, revenue growth is very strong, and we expect it to be solid in 2023 as well. Storage is better positioned than most, if not all asset classes to endure future inflation or test or whatever type of economic slowdown we face. So, we are very excited and confident about it heading into \u201823.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff and thank you everyone for joining today's call. We had another strong quarter with same-store revenue growth of 15.5%, driven by strong rental rate growth, partially offset by lower year-over-year occupancy. We felt expense pressure across many line items, resulting in total same-store expense growth of 12.6% and same-store NOI growth of 16.4%. We continue to be busy on the external growth front, adding 40 stores gross to our third-party management platform, closing over $100 million in bridge loans in closing a number of acquisitions, most notably the purchase of Storage Express. We view Storage Express as a strategic opportunity to acquire not only an attractive portfolio with operational upside, but a remote storage platform. We believe this will unlock an additional growth channel for Extra Space to acquire and integrate smaller properties that lend themselves to a remotely managed model. Our strong property NOI plus our external growth efforts resulted in core FFO growth of 19.5%. Core FFO includes an add-back of $0.05 per share for estimated property damage and tenant insurance claims related to Hurricane Ian. We are happy to report that all of our people remain safe during the storm and we are proud of the way our team has rallied around our employees and our customers in Southwest Florida to assist them with cleanup and restoration efforts. Core FFO in the quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations driven by stronger-than-anticipated interest income and non-same-store NOI partially offset by lower-than-expected same-store NOI. In September, we started to experience a return of seasonality, putting some pressure on occupancy and new customer rates, which were both modestly lower than our third quarter forecast. As we evaluate our standard metrics to measure demand, we see the moderation we have typically expected in the fall that did not occur in 2021. While traffic is lower year-over-year, demand is in line with pre-COVID levels. Fundamentals remain strong, just not as off the chart strong as they have been in the last six quarters. As a result, we have tightened our same-store revenue, NOI and core FFO guidance ranges, eliminating scenarios that assumed only minor seasonality on the top end of the range as well as more bare scenarios, which we do not believe will materialize. This revision results in a $0.05 or a 60 basis point decrease at the midpoint of our FFO range. We never liked the idea of having to reduce our outlook, but we are also careful to maintain perspective. Our 2022 implied same-store revenue growth is the highest in the history of our company. And this is on the back of 2021, which was our second highest revenue growth year. Our implied 2022 FFO growth at the midpoint is 21%. Our balance sheet is healthy. We have access to capital and our external growth platforms are positioned to grow on an asset-light basis. As we contemplate future potential economic landscapes, including additional inflation and/or recession, we are well-positioned to continue to produce solid results due to our resilient need-based asset class, diversified portfolio and best-in-class team and platform. We are having a great year and we look forward to finishing strong in the fourth quarter. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. Sure. Well, thank you for the compliment. We do normally take pride in our forecast. I think it's important to understand we were in an environment where customer behavior is very different. We have no history of data about how customers react, coming out of a pandemic and therefore, we gave wider-than-normal ranges, because we had less confidence in our ability to exactly predict how customers would perform. What we see on fundamentals though, we do see slowing in demand in rates, in other metrics compared to the last six quarters or so. But if you look at pre-pandemic numbers, things look very strong and we are very comfortable with the state of the business. No, I think if you look at our guidance range that will give you an indication of the range of where we believe we will end 2022. Anywhere in that range is better than long-term historical storage averages. So we still believe we're going to end the year strong and be set up well for 2023. Thank you, Jeff. So your statements are correct, right? We're trying to maximize revenue by using all the tools available, whether that's occupancy rate, discount, marketing expense, days to reserve, all the different levers we can do and it's done on a unit size in each store basis, not on a portfolio basis or a market basis. So we're trying to maximize revenue for whatever unit type and whatever store giving the performance and data we have on that particular unit type in the store. When you roll all of that up together onto a portfolio basis, we are certainly now favoring occupancy at the expense of rate. So we're giving up a little bit of rate to have a little higher occupancy because we believe in the long-term that will create the best long-term revenue growth for the portfolio. Certainly, ECRI is a very important factor there, and it's also trying to attract as many longer-term customers who have a longer lifetime value than a customer who's going to come in maybe at a higher rate, but spin out after 2 or 3 months. Overall, a strong housing market is beneficial to self storage, and we would prefer a strong housing market than a weak housing market. That being said, there is lots of different drivers of demand for storage, and we see solid demand in good and bad housing markets. And the best example of that is during the great financial crisis where the housing market was arguably in much worse shape than it is now, and we didn't see any drop in demand because we had demand from other types of transitions, other movements that made up for the slowdown in housing transitions. Thanks, Michael. So I would say the growth opportunity \u2013 the external growth opportunity in Storage Express is not in the near-term. What's in the near-term, I think, is internal growth by getting them or getting Storage Express, I shouldn't say them onto the Extra Space, pricing ECRI, customer acquisition platform, and we think we can improve the existing assets performance. That is nearer term. Until we can do that, get them on our platforms, we won't aggressively pursue external growth. So that's more of a second stage. And I think that there is a small number of Extra Space Storage that mostly things we run as Annex is now that we may be able to improve the performance of using the Storage Express model. What may be more interesting is the ability to look at modest-sized stores within our existing footprint that we don't really look at now. Sure. So, weaker demographic than our existing portfolio, we wouldn't expect to have similar demographics in more secondary or tertiary markets. We wouldn't expect to have the same rate growth, but we wouldn't expect to pay the same amount on a price per pound for the asset. So, it's all about proper underwriting, getting compensated for the risk you're taking and understanding. We look at our portfolio, which is about 10% in tertiary markets now. We look at the performance of primary, secondary, tertiary market, how their CAGRs compare over rolling 10-year periods every year. And we understand that tertiary markets can be more volatile, but they also can provide very good returns. So I think it's about investing at the right basis making sure you're underwriting each deal properly, understanding that in many of those markets, you're the only REIT that \u2013 we could be the only REIT that operates, which gives you somewhat of an advantage. Yes. So the first part of the question, overall, we don't have any new information or data or view is still that storage deliveries are moderating, not going to zero, not dropping off the cliff, but they are moderating that there are continuing headwinds in terms of costs and interest rates and entitlement issues and the availability of debt, and that's going to be good for the industry. We have not done a \u2013 we study supply in the markets that we're active. We have not yet done a tertiary market supply analysis. We're just not at that stage yet. When we're ready to start growing this platform, we will find the right markets. We will have our guys do all the research they always do, and we will make sure we understand all the dynamics of the market before we put our investors' dollars into that market. So, the kind of work-from-home de-cluttering demand, that was more of a 2020 \u2013 December 2020 into 2021, maybe experience. We are back to more \u2013 today, we are back to more traditional demand drivers for new demand. So, I think you are only partially right. I think some of those work-from-home folks have stopped using storage. But I think there is a cohort of them that continues to use storage, and you can see that in our length-of-stay statistics, where during COVID, we had a real sharp increase in customers in our stores who have been with us for more than a year, more than 2 years. Lately, we have seen that decline a little bit, but we are still at above historic averages. So, that is telling us that some of those customers just like some of every customer that comes in some small percentage of them become that kind of permanent or quasi-permanent customer. And I think that happened during COVID as well. Sorry if I misunderstood, but you are saying good. I am glad we are on the same page. So, I think we can operate our stores or whatever occupancy we want, right. We can adjust the other metrics to get there. And \u2013 but I do agree with you. I think we learned during COVID that we can maximize revenue by operating stores at incrementally higher occupancy than we have historically. Sure. Thanks. Yes. It's in between 2 years and 3 years. And it's an interesting one conceptually for me to try to understand yield, right. Because what we are doing is taking the cost for an entire business platform, software, people, trucks and office buildings, etcetera, etcetera, and saying the existing stores produce a return on all of that.

I wouldn't compare it to the acquisition of a building that produces a yield because we are really buying more than just 106, 107 buildings. Sure. Thanks Semdes. So, the transaction market has certainly changed. Cap rates are expanding as interest rates rise, which is natural. There is fewer participants. We see lots and lots of deals that are not getting closed, including us. We have walked from over $526 million of deals that we had under LOI based on what we thought new pricing should be. I don't think there is really any way to say with any precision what new cap rates are, how much cap rates have expanded. We \u2013 it's very deal dependent. You need to wait for a lot of transaction just not occurring. We need to wait and see how it shakes out. But certainly, the direction is clear. Thank you, Samir. So, COVID and the restrictions the states put on our ability to increase rents, coupled with the rise in Street rates created that unusual situation of an extra large gap between what Street rates were and what people were paying. And we have largely made up that gap. So, we will not see \u2013 well, we still will see attractive ECRI going forward. We are not going to see those outsized increases that we experienced over the last year or so. Nope, not at all. And I think Scott referenced earlier that after Labor Day, we saw somewhat of a change in customer behavior and a return to seasonality. And our kind of wider-than-normal guidance at the top end, at the bottom end, had different assumptions about where that will occur.

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe and hello everyone. We had a strong third quarter, $0.01 ahead of our own internal FFO projections. While same-store revenue was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter, we did have higher than expected bad debt expense. The bad debt increase was primarily driven by lower collections from auctions. In other words, our customers' ability to pay for storage doesn't appear to have changed as much as an auction buyer's willingness to pay for auctioned goods. We experienced outsized year-over-year growth in most of our expense line items. And I think some additional detail may provide helpful context. In the third quarter of 2021, we had same-store payroll expense of negative 9% and property tax growth of negative 4.5%, which drove total Q3 2021 expense growth of negative 4%. If we evaluate our third quarter expenses on a 2-year stack, average payroll expense growth was approximately 5.2%, average property tax expense growth was 3.1%, and total \u2013 and average total annual same-store expense grew 4.2% a year. Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter, we completed an accordion transaction in our credit facility, adding $600 million of unsecured debt across two tranches. We capitalized the Storage Express transaction with $125 million in OP units at an average price per share of $201.84, with the remainder drawn on the revolving credit facility. This resulted in a net debt to EBITDA of 4.6x at the end of the quarter without the benefit of the additional EBITDA from Storage Express given the late quarter close. The revolver draws caused our variable rate debt to exceed our typical range of 20% to 30% of total debt at quarter end. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we swapped $200 million of our variable rate debt to reduce our floating interest rate exposure to approximately 35%. Additionally, our bridge loan balances provide a hedge against increases in variable rate debt effectively reducing the percentage to approximately 31% of total debt. We will continue to take steps to reduce our variable rate debt further. Our commitment to the investment grade bond market has not changed and we expect to utilize this market again once conditions normalize. As Joe mentioned, we tightened our 2022 guidance. Given the outsized growth and unique customer trends we have experienced over the past 2 years, we have had a wider-than-normal guidance range throughout the year to capture all of the different scenarios that we believe were possible. As we have moved through the fall, the moderation has been more pronounced than we projected at the high end. However, it was also not as severe on the low end, resulting in the tighter range. The reduction in same-store NOI guidance is partially offset by higher-than-expected interest income due to larger bridge loan balances and higher interest rates as well as an expected later modification date of the NexPoint preferred investment. We have also increased our forecast for management fees and other income. Interest expense estimates have increased due to debt associated with Storage Express, other acquisitions, additional bridge loans and an increase in benchmark rates. Given our total investment activity year-to-date, we have increased our acquisition investment guidance to $1.65 billion, all of which is closed or under contract. After these adjustments, we have tightened our core FFO range, which is now estimated to be between $8.30 and $8.40 per share and implied increase of approximately 21% year-over-year. We still anticipate $0.20 of dilution from value-add acquisitions in C of O stores in line with last quarter's estimate. We are having a great year and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to maintain healthy growth in 2023 as we see storage fundamentals normalizing to historical levels. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes, Jeff. Maybe just to clarify one point, the slowing in demand is year-over-year. It's very clear that it is still as good as it was pre-pandemic and very consistent with historical norms at this time of the year in terms of searches on our website calls that we are receiving at the stores and our rentals on a monthly basis. So what we have in October, maybe just to give a bit of an update for October. Our October numbers, our occupancy is down about 30 bps from September, so not significantly different from the end of September and our rates have been steady through the month of October. Yes, Todd, it's Scott. So I would tell you it's later in the third quarter. Certainly, post Labor Day, July and August were good for us of our forecast. Post Labor Day, I think what changed is I think you saw that seasonal occupancy go back more to the norm than what we've seen in the last 2 years. And we've been saying this was a possibility for 2 years. I think it came a little quicker than we were expecting when it did come, and as a result, it impacted rates. So I think the thing that's impacted us most is the rate that we are going to charge new customers and the impact on the fourth quarter. So, not necessarily occupancy but much more new customer rate coming in and seeing a little bit of deceleration there in terms of our rate. So our promotions year-over-year were actually down slightly in the third quarter, and we're not using promotions right now. We've used rate more as the conversion tool. And our rates in October were flat to slightly up from where they were in September. So continues to be what we're seeing in September. Juan, the other thing I would emphasize is some of these remote assets will be in our core markets. So it's not just a tertiary market strategy here. This is expanding our existing footprint in what we kind of operate today as an annex and then running those much more efficiently. So, in July, we saw rates down about 7% \u2013 or achieved rates. This has achieved rates on new rentals. They were down about 7%, 8% in August and then low double digits in September. So, we averaged about negative \u2013 just about 10% negative in the third quarter. Next one. So, $3 million of that is losses from tenant reinsurance. So, those are claims made by our customers that we will be paying out. We are not getting it back. We add it back because we don't think it's part of the core number. And again, that's an estimate based on the data we had. Obviously, all those claims have not been filed. People are still kind of digging out down there. The other piece of the loss, the $3.2 million, that is for property loss and our loss number is actually higher than that because that is net of the estimated \u2013 the property insurance proceeds that we think we will receive. And again, those numbers are the best guess to-date. Go ahead. Just we didn't view it as core. We didn't view it. We viewed it as non-recurring, much more one-time is the way we viewed it. We haven't publicly. We have said that it was a market cap rate that going in was going to be lower. We felt like it was stabilized around a $6 million and the first year, obviously, lower than that, but stabilizing around $6 million. Yes. We saw similar to what I think most storage operators saw and that is our average length of stay has gotten longer. If you look at our tenants in our properties today, you are 35-ish \u2013 34 months, 35 months in terms of customers that are in there today. If you look at the tenants that have been in our properties over 2 years, that number continues to grow. It's north of 60%. So, people continue to stay longer."

Before I report on our performance, I am happy to announce that we recently published our Annual Sustainability Report. We are proud to be a sector leader, not only operationally, but also in sustainability. I encourage you to review our report, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.  Turning to results. The strong trends we experienced in the first quarter continued into the leasing season. Year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the quarter was 21.7%, matching our first quarter growth rate. This is an all-time high for Extra Space Storage. Despite expense pressure on several line items, NOI growth remained very strong at 26%. This was achieved primarily through year-over-year rental rate growth, partially offset by a modest decrease in year-over-year occupancy due to elevated vacate activity.  With manageable new supply and durable customer demand, we continue to operate at high occupancy with strong rates. Despite inflation and the potential effects of recession, we believe we are well positioned to continue to produce strong results due to our resilient need-based asset class, diversified portfolio, strong balance sheet and best-in-class team and platform.  We were active in each of our external growth channels. During the quarter, we invested $289 million in property acquisitions and we invested an additional $92 million in July, bringing year-to-date totals to $610 million. We have continued to focus on acquiring nonstabilized properties and, as we outlined last quarter, have started closing more transactions in joint venture structures.  We started to see the market shift late in the quarter with increasing interest rates, reducing the number of bidders at the table and the bid-ask spread widening between buyers and sellers. We are being selective with our acquisitions, and we are focused on transactions and structures that will be accretive for our shareholders.  In the quarter, we closed $70 million in bridge loans, and we added 40 additional stores gross to our management platform. We also made a creative storage investment, purchasing an existing storage company named Bargold Storage solutions. This company has a different model than traditional storage. It is focused on leasing space and apartment buildings, primarily in New York and subleasing storage spaces to residential tenants.  The acquisition of Bargold added over 17,000 units to our portfolio with an occupancy rate over 97%. Due to the unique nature of its operations, we have retained their team and are keeping the entity running as a separate organization. We view this transaction as another creative investment in the storage sector which came to us through deep industry relationships.  Our strong property NOI, plus our external growth efforts, resulted in core FFO growth of 29.9%. Our growth allowed us to raise our annual FFO guidance for the second time this year. It has been another great quarter, and we are well on our way to another strong year. Storage fundamentals remain solid. While we expect our rate of growth to moderate in the back half of the year due to very difficult comps, we expect it to remain well over historical averages, with modeled year-over-year revenue growth remaining in the double digits through 2022.  I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, ahead of our own internal projections. Our outperformance was driven primarily by strong property performance, which benefited the same-store pool, joint ventures and management fees.  As Joe mentioned, we were active on the external growth front. Our investments were capitalized primarily by draws on our revolving lines of credit. We issued $22 million in operating partnership units as part of the Bargold transaction, bringing year-to-date issuance of equity to approximately $60 million. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $63 million of shares -- in shares at an average price of $165 per share.  Due to the wide spreads in the investment-grade bond market, we've been active with our banking relationships. Last week, we completed an accordion transaction in our credit facility, adding $600 million of unsecured debt within the facility across 2 tranches. Our plan to term out debt using the investment-grade bond market has not changed, and we expect to utilize this market again once conditions normalize.  Our leverage remains low, with net debt to EBITDA of 4.4x, and our unencumbered pool is over $13 billion. We continue to have access to many types of capital, and we have significant debt capacity to support future growth and maturities, albeit at higher interest rates.  Due to our year-to-date outperformance and improved outlook for the second half of the year, we updated our 2022 full year guidance. We've increased our same-store revenue guidance to 16% to 18%, driven primarily by rental rate growth. We strive to be efficient with expenses, and we believe our continued investment in our people and our properties are contributing to our top line growth. Consequently, we experienced same-store expense increases across several line items, and we have increased our expense guidance to 7.5% to 9% for the full year.  Our increased revenue far outweighs our increased expenses given our high-margin business. As a result, our same-store NOI growth range increased to 18.5% to 21.5%, the highest NOI growth guidance in our history.  Given our total investment activity year-to-date of $790 million, we have increased our acquisition investment guidance to $1.2 billion, only $250 million of which is unidentified. Our preferred investment in NexPoint remains in place and Bridge Loan volume and interest rates are higher than anticipated. As a result, we have increased our interest income guidance by approximately $3 million.  Due to the increase in interest rates as well as our higher acquisition volume, we've increased our interest expense guidance by $13 million at the midpoint. The sum of these adjustments result in an increase in core FFO, which is now estimated to be between $8.30 and $8.50 per share. We anticipate $0.20 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores, in line with last quarter's estimate. we're having a great year, and we are positioned for continued steady growth.  And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: The first -- I had a couple of questions, I guess, on the Bargold acquisition. I was wondering if you were able to share sort of the initial yield on that $180 million investment or put some parameters around the anticipated return that you're expecting on your investment?\nJoseph Margolis: Sure, Todd, and thanks for your clever title to know, we all got to chuckle out of that. So we underwrote the existing business. We didn't underwrite any extraordinary growth. We didn't underwrite any synergies. We fill our G&A on top of it. And just underwriting what exists today, the first year yields in the low 4s and it grows to the mid- to upper 5s. So kind of similar to urban property investments, I would say.  And then our hope is, of course, we're going to first try to institutionalize the business, introduce things that they haven't done. In terms of technology, they don't charge administration fees, they don't offer insurance. And that's kind of the first step of the plan is to institutionalize it and bring some Extra Space's, expertise and procedures, processes to it. And then we'll see Bar growing it. We'll try to grow it in New York City. And if that works, then we'll take it outside of New York City. But it's kind of one step at a time for us.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And can you speak to some of the -- I mean, you characterized it as a creative investment. But can you speak to some of the fundamental differences in that business maybe compared to the traditional storage business whether price increases and maybe restrictions around raising rents to customers and the magnitude and frequency of increases and things of that nature as you have continued to potentially roll this out and look to grow the platform?\nJoseph Margolis: Sure. Great question. So the business is leasing space in apartment buildings, and it's primarily basements and garages, building those spaces out. So if you walked into them, they would look exactly like the interior of one of our modern self-storage facilities and then leasing that only to tenants in the apartment buildings. So because of that, your customer acquisition and marketing costs are almost nothing.  It's a -- your incremental cost to grow the business is very, very small because you're not buying any real estate. It's all leases. So we bought the business, we bought the platform, and now it's capital light going forward. And the tenants are different. They stay for a long time. The average length of stay of in-place customers in this portfolio is 8 years. The churn is less than 0.5% a month compared to our churn of 6% to 7%. So it's incredibly stable.  They operate at occupancy of over 97%, and they have over 1,000 people on the waiting list. So that's a good example of synergies that we're going to experiment with is do we get those people on the waiting list into an Extra Space store until a unit opens up for them? It also tells me their pricing might not have been sophisticated as ours is. But you are right. The rate increases are limited in some instances and coordinated with the landlord because the landlord doesn't want a tenant to be unhappy or be using money he could for increased apartment rent, for increased storage rent. So there is a difference there as well.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. And then one last question, if I could just switch over towards -- to the leasing environment and rental activity. Occupancy is at a very healthy level, but rentals were up pretty big year-over-year. And we've seen the housing market cool off a bit. And I wouldn't have thought that there'd be significant incremental demand, I guess, from some of the pandemic drivers that we saw earlier during the latter part of '20 and 2021.  Any sense where the demand is coming from today? And it seems to be fairly strong, perhaps stronger than expected. So just curious if you have any sort of information around where the customers are coming from and where the demand is really coming from?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Todd, if you look at kind of our surveys and the questionnaires we give our customers, it's come back to pre-COVID answers. It's largely coming from people moving, lack of space obviously is needed, but not what it was in COVID.  Our rentals and vacates have moved much more to pre-COVID numbers. Our vacates are elevated slightly now, partly due to the existing customer rate increases that have gone through over the last year as we move people quickly to street rates because these state of emergencies have been removed. So while vacates have been elevated slightly, rental activity has been really good. It's been strong. So we've been able to backfill those. So we have moved people quickly to street rate.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors.\nSpenser Allaway: Maybe just 1 or 2 more just on the Bargold topic. I know you mentioned the 97% occupancy. Just curious, is this kind of in line with historic norms for this company? Or is this kind of like a peak occupancy level? And then also, are there other operators doing the same thing that you're aware of? And if so, are they potential consolidation targets down the line?\nJoseph Margolis: This company has historically operated at, what we would consider, very, very high occupancy levels. So over 97% would be a normal occupancy level for Bargold. I do not know of any other company that does this on the scale that Bargold does. And it's one reason that is exciting to us is the potential growth without a lot of competitors.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one more, just on the leasing front. We've recently heard from market participants that there's been a pull forward of peak leasing season. Just curious if that was consistent with what you've seen in the portfolio?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, I'm not sure I fully understand the question, a pull-forward?\nJoseph Margolis: So I'm not sure you know that until the future, right? I mean, yes, leasing has been strong and demand has been strong, but we haven't seen it diminish to the extent we could say it's leasing from a future period that's been pulled forward. So that seems very theoretical.\nSpenser Allaway: Yes. No, that kind of answers the question, right, exactly. If you guys aren't seeing a deceleration -- that's material, then that kind of answers the question. We've recently attended a conference, in which there was anecdotes in which, some market participants have been seeing such deceleration. So the fact that you guys have not, answers my question, like you said.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping we could double it on to the expectations built into occupancy. What's assumed in the second half in terms of occupancy declines with seasonality eventually waning and how is that compared to history?  And Joe, maybe what's the exit run rate we should be thinking about with an eye towards the starting point for 2023? And do you see any changes in the consumer behavior to make you think differently about how you're feeling about '23 relative to where you were maybe NAREIT a couple of months ago?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Juan, this is Scott. Our occupancy has been pretty consistent over the last 4 months where we've run 1% to 1.2% below prior year. And we would expect that to continue throughout the remainder of the year and maybe fall off slightly more than that as we get towards the end of the year. So we expect to be below where we finished 2021 by 1% to 1.5%.\nJoseph Margolis: I think your second question was on revenue growth pattern. And we do anticipate moderation, as Scott said in his remarks. But if you look at our guidance, we'll end the year in low teens positive revenue growth, which is just a fantastic number. It sets us up really, really well ahead into 2023.\nJuan Sanabria: And then just the second question on expenses. Normally, the point of contention, and the point of stress is taxes, but that's actually a bright spot relative to some of the other increases. But just curious how you're thinking about various kind of more meaningful expense line items? And how sticky those could be into '23? And are you seeing any changes or differences across the regions maybe more cost pressure in the Sunbelt versus the coastal market? Just curious on a little more color on expenses.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So first on taxes. I mean, taxes, we are seeing things get reassessed in that 5% to 7% higher. We have been the beneficiary of some appeals, which has offset some of that increase. So overall, we're seeing increases, but the appeals are clearly benefiting us. Those are more onetime.  In terms of payroll, we continue to see wage pressure. Our payroll wages are up as much as 10% and our hours are up this year year-over-year. So that is somewhat a comp from last year. So last year, we had negative expense growth in the first half of the year. So as we resume more to normal hours, as more normal staffing, that is an increase year-over-year that we would not expect to go into next year. We would expect some wage pressure, but not the hour adjustment.  In terms of other things, we also continue to see pressure -- inflationary pressure on utilities, on repairs and maintenance. And as your revenues grow, your credit card fees grow. But this is the beauty of being in self-storage. It's such a high-margin business. So while inflation does impact your expenses, you also have some opportunities on the revenue front with month-to-month leases and that shorter-term lease really is a benefit to us.\nJuan Sanabria: And if maybe I could sneak in a super quick one. What's the average lease duration that Bargold has with the multifamily landlords to actually get the space?\nJoseph Margolis: So the initial lease terms are between 10 and 15 years.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And next, we have Jeff Spector of Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: And congratulations on the quarter. Joe, I just -- I think I heard you comment quickly on -- looks like a good set up for '23. And interestingly, that's kind of been the a key debate I've had today with some incoming calls, again, strong results. Lots of skeptics that there are concerns still about weakening demand coming. I think it's interesting that I hear you -- the guidance if you achieve the second half, I guess, can you talk about then that setup into '23, which I think I heard you maybe comment on?\nJoseph Margolis: Sure. So if we end the year at low teens revenue growth and knowing how increases and decreases take time to roll through the rent roll in storage, it takes a while for any weakness if we see that, if you're looking for a downside scenario to roll into results. So pick an ending point, right? I mean storage has only gone negative in revenues during the Great Financial Crisis and barely 0.1% during 2020. So pick whatever ending point you want for revenue and I think you will end up in 2023. I'm not giving guidance. I'm just doing math, above long-term historical averages in revenue growth.  And expenses, we'll continue to try to manage as well as we can. But we're going to have -- we have really hard comps this year, we're going to have fairly easy comps next year. And moving out of the store arena, everything else is growing really rapidly. Our Bridge Loan Program is growing rapidly. Our management business is growing rapidly. As the transaction market gets tougher, people tend to seek other solutions and sale, which are both -- which could be Bridge Loans. We're seeing less exits from our management business due to sales. Some of our other things that we do or seem to be shaping up and hopefully, we'll talk more about that later. So I'm pretty excited about 2023.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Very helpful. And is it fair to say that the trends you've seen in the first half of the year continued through July into August?\nScott Stubbs: The amount of August has past? Yes. July continued from June rates were reasonably flat, June to July. Last year, like I mentioned, the rates really peaked in June, July of last year. So as last year's rate comp becomes easier, we hope that August continues to go well. But 2 days into August, it's all looking good still.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. And then my last question, just to confirm, again, are there any signposted issues? It seems like you're very comfortable continuing to push rate on the customer, the customer is taking it. But any signposts any of any issues and maybe in any markets?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So when we talk about the health of the customer, we get a lot of questions about this. We look at things like bad debt, your accounts receivable, you look at rates where they are today versus where they were.  In terms of accounts receivable, they're pretty consistent with where they were last year with the historical norms. Bad debt is very close to the historical average. Haven't seen those elevated over the past quarter.  In terms of rate, we compared to 2019, our in-place rents are up 26%, 27%. So while year-over-year looks really big, like a really big jump. When you go back a few years, it's more affordable and maybe it doesn't -- not as extreme as people would think on the surface.\nJoseph Margolis: Jeff, I would add, we have stronger markets and we have markets that are less strong. And we're always looking where performance isn't as good as elsewhere and seeing what tools we can use to try to help those markets. And it may be submarkets or individual stores where we have to do certain things with marketing spend or different things. And we always trying to maximize performance. So not everything is as strong as the best performing assets in the company. But everything is good. And we have the tools to address individual areas or stores or markets of weakness, and we feel lucky to have a really broadly diversified portfolio.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And next, we have Keegan Carl of Berenberg Capital Markets.\nKeegan Carl: I know this is addressed a bit early on in the call, but acquisition guidance is obviously raised again. Just curious if you could give us a little bit more color on how much competition you're truly seeing for these assets, that's over the last quarter? And kind of any sort of color on cap rates is really helpful?\nJoseph Margolis: So I think we're seeing less competition. I think there are fewer bidders. Folks who rely on leverage really heavily, have -- many of them have gone through the sidelines, but there's still bidders. And so transactions are getting done. So it's not an open playing field by any means. And cap rates is always a hard thing to tell, right, because it's -- the data lags and each transaction is kind of unique, its own. But I would say we have seen an expansion of cap rates.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. And as we think about plus with the year, right, I mean, what percentage of the portfolio do you anticipate spending another rate increase to? And how does that compare to years prior?\nJoseph Margolis: So we haven't made any change in what percent of the portfolio we send a rate increase to. Every customer is eligible for a rate increase after a certain amount of time. I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly, but...\nKeegan Carl: Yes, just before like the cadence of increases, right? Like you tended to increase that. I'm just kind of curious, like at this point last year, what percentage of your portfolio would do another increase? And how does that compare to this year?\nJoseph Margolis: Okay. Yes. So, I misunderstood the question. So I don't think we can make good year-over-year comparisons. Because last year, we were so constricted by government regulations where we couldn't -- even if we wanted to, we couldn't send rate increase notices.  What I would say is that pre-COVID, we had a pretty formulaic approach in terms of cadence and amount of rate increase we sent to customers. And during COVID -- during the period of time we voluntarily didn't send out rate increase notices, and then when the governments of the various states told us we couldn't, we kind of kicked off with that formulaic approach. And we have not gone back to it. We are much more tailored now and designed in terms of both cadence and amount of rate increase that will send.\nScott Stubbs: Keegan, about 63% of our tenants today are below street rate. So obviously, they're eligible. We actually push people above street rates. So it's a large percentage. That 63% is actually higher than it's been in the past.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And next, we have Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to just come back on to the acquisition activity for a moment. You mentioned in your opening remarks a continued focus on nonstabilized assets and also working with joint ventures. Are you working kind of consistently with the same joint venture partners? Or are you finding new capital that wants to come into the space so you can forge new relationships or just kind of interested in how that's going?\nJoseph Margolis: Sure, Smedes. Thanks for the question. So we have 2 new joint venture partners this year in 2022. We also are working with some of our older joint venture partners and the phone rings a lot. There's lots and lots of people who would like to be our partners in self-storage.\nSmedes Rose: On the nonstabilized assets, I'm just wondering, are more folks coming to market because they're just like where the pricing is now? Or are you seeing deals where they're sort of unable maybe to get permanent financing or kind of their underwater logic, their initial underwriting, kind of what's bringing those assets to market in this environment?\nJoseph Margolis: It's certainly asset specific. But I would say before the interest rate increases happen, pricing was so strong -- well, first, let's back up a little bit. 2021, you had strong pricing, you had fear of capital gains, tax increase. You feared 1031 going away. Getting into 2022, you had strong pricing and low interest rates. Now I think you have some people fearing increased interest rates and further cap rate compression in the future so time to get out. And then you always have the asset-specific thing. It's a fund that's coming to the end of the life. It's a family where there's been an issue or a death in the family. But I think those reasons probably wrap up most of the situations.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI.\nSamir Khanal: Scott, just curious on the New York MSA. I mean the region is holding up quite well. I'm looking at the numbers, I think revenue growth even accelerated meaningfully kind of in the second quarter. Maybe talk around some of the drivers of that? I'm trying to figure out if it's sort of -- because the New York MSA will include New Jersey, maybe there's some restrictions being lifted on the rent side. And maybe if there's a way to even sort of look at New York boroughs, Brooklyn and Bronx kind of what are you seeing in that sort of areas as well?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So when we break it out between the boroughs in New Jersey, our Northern New Jersey stores are performing better than our boroughs. Now we don't have a huge number of stores in the boroughs, so it might not be a great comparable. But both markets are performing below the average of the portfolio, but New Jersey is definitely performing better than New York. We did see rate increases. The state of emergencies lifted late last year. And so that has benefited us throughout this year.  I think November -- December is when most of those went out. So that's when you'll have a tougher comp. But we did implement many rate increases late last year that have benefited us this year in New Jersey.\nSamir Khanal: And I guess, at this point, there's no more rent restrictions sort of in the portfolio, it remains to be lifted, correct? Or is there any more sort of opportunities there as well?\nScott Stubbs: Not material -- not material state of emergencies in effect anywhere.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. And I guess, Joe, just maybe as a second question, just provide maybe an updated view on kind of the supply picture, kind of what your most recent thoughts are?\nJoseph Margolis: Sure. Pretty similar, very similar to what we talked about last quarter. We continue to see and expect a moderation of new supply. There's certainly headwinds in terms of interest rates, cost, entitlements but it's not going to 0. There's still is new supply being delivered, and there's still an awful lot of interest in people wanting to build new self-storage. I'll give you a stats that is interesting.  Our management plus team underwrites about 215 deals a quarter for potential management contracts. 75% of those this year have been development. So there's still a lot of people out there interested in building self-storage. And you can understand why. The results of the asset class have been phenomenal.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Hong Liang Zhang of Citi.\nHong Liang Zhang: Of JPMorgan, but first just have to say, as a current Bargold consumer, I'm pretty excited for the opportunity presents you all, but I'm also a little apprehensive about what my monthly rent is going to look like going forward? But I guess on the topic of rent increases, would you be able to share what the average magnitude of rent increases you're currently pushing in your portfolio and how that's changed compared to the first quarter?\nJoseph Margolis: So as I said, tried to reference earlier, it's all over the board, right? Because we have this weird situation, a unique situation, excuse me, of folks whose rent was artificially suppressed by government regulation at a time when street rate was increasing. So we had some larger the normal gaps between what people are paying a street rates, and we were trying to catch up. So there's a wide variation in the amount of rent increase customers are getting, and I'm not sure an average is meaningful because of that.\nHong Liang Zhang: Got it. But it sounds like there's no significant areas where the MSA -- the rent and the MSA is materially lower than kind of the average?\nJoseph Margolis: No.\nScott Stubbs: No. I think you saw some that were larger than the average as rate restrictions were lifted, and we moved them quickly to the current market rates. And that benefit as you move throughout this year, obviously, decreases because you were doing many of those late last year and early this year.\nHong Liang Zhang: Got it. And then on the expense side, how should we think about, I guess, expense growth in personnel and property operating on a sequential basis? Is kind of the level of spend in the second quarter representative of what it's going to look like for us over the year? Or is there a little bit more further to go from here?\nScott Stubbs: So the wage pressure has obviously -- will be consistent throughout the year. So you're probably around 10% wage inflation year-over-year. Hours should get better as we move throughout the year. So towards the end of last year, we were more appropriately staffed and second quarter was -- and into the third quarter was kind of the low point in terms of staffing hours and being understaffed due to turnover.\nHong Liang Zhang: And if I could sneak one last question in. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about potentially cross-selling between Bargold users and your current Extra Space units. Is that -- should we take that as a sign that you'd be looking to expand further into Manhattan and the New York MSA?\nJoseph Margolis: So the -- we have lots of ideas for Bargold. Well, the first thing we're going to do is absorb the existing business. One of the ideas, you're right, is they have such a long waiting list is could we provide some option for the Bargold tenants on the waiting lists to store their stuff in Extra Space units and then maybe give them a priority to get into a Bargold unit would that -- would not help Extra Space. We have not instituted that yet. That's just one of many ideas that we're excited to get to.  And yes, we -- once we digest Bargold, and we feel we have it rhyme the way we want, absolutely, we're going to try to expand it first in Manhattan and other parts of New York and possibly then afterwards to other major cities in the country.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: A couple of quick ones for me. Just going back to some of the breadcrumbs on the same-store growth, talking about the exit rate for 2023 or for 2022 and thinking about that as a starting point for 2023. I think the earlier comments you -- was suggested that it could be in sort of the double digits for second half of this year, therefore, 2023 double digits on the table. I just want to make sure I understood that correctly? Or is there anything about the comp that we should be thinking about?\nJoseph Margolis: So I apologize if I implied that because we're going to end the year in double digits in revenue growth. That means it's going to be double-digit revenue growth throughout 2023. I think it means we're going to start 2023 with double digits. And then everyone can have their own view of the market and how that will moderate or not operate throughout the balance of the year.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. That's pretty clear. My second question was just on the marking the -- some of the jurisdictions that have been under state of emergencies like LA and so forth. When you think about sort of the same-store revenue growth year-to-date, is there any way to quantify how much contribution came from marking those jurisdictions to market just from a high level?\nJoseph Margolis: So I think last quarter, we said we expected lifting of the California state emergencies to add 50 basis points to the same-store portfolio. We now think that's more like 70 basis points. And the reason for the difference is we were only conservative in our length of stay assumptions. We thought that when we increased rates to street rates, we would push more people out the door. But in fact, we've been conservative in that assumption. So 70 basis points is the answer to your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my last one is just on Bargold, if I could sneak it in. Just you talked about a little bit of the business and the potential growth opportunity. Maybe how much more -- when you're thinking of the growth opportunity, how much more capital over time did you provide to the company? Or is the capital commitment pretty much done from the standpoint?\nJoseph Margolis: So the capital to grow the business, and I don't want to get in front of ourselves, right? I don't want to promise huge growth. We're taking this one step at a time. And the first thing is to absorb what we have. But we did buy this with the expectation that we will get to a growth phase. The -- because these are leases and the rent is just a percentage of revenue, there's no fixed rent in these leases. It's very capital light. You just have to build out the space. That's your capital.  Now there also may be capital expended in terms of systems. We -- our systems are better than theirs, and I'm not saying anything negative about the company. It's a very successful, well-run family company, it was, but we have more capabilities than them. We have better systems. And so we may also put some capital in there. But it's not a lot. This should be generally capital-light going forward.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And next, we have Joab Dempsey of Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: It's actually Ki Bin. Just a couple of follow-ups here. On the Bargold, can you talk a little bit more about how that business is actually run in terms of like how many units per apartment building is the average? What happens when a tenant doesn't or losing vow. Like do you -- does the building manager handle it? Or do you have to handle it some of more of a kind of practical elements of running the type of business?\nJoseph Margolis: Sure. So the average number of units in the building is 25, but there's a pretty wide range of that. I think the largest building is 800 units, which is kind of similar to a store, but there's also buildings that just have a handful of units. The reason kind of boards or call-up boards building owners would do this, and so they don't have to handle it. So Bargold, now Extra Space handles getting the -- through in the unit, dealing with payments, dealing with nonpayments and auctioning the units. Out of their 17,000 -- over 17,000 units, they auctioned about 20 a month last year. So the rate is very, very small. And it's storage. It works just the -- laws are the same, and it works just like storage.\nKi Bin Kim: And what was the cadence of their revenue growth over the past year? I'm just trying to get a sense of, if this is a -- this was a hyper growth type of company or more static that you're trying to improve? Any kind of color you can provide around that?\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. I would say it was neither static nor hyper growth that they were a steady growth company growing in the single digits every year.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And just last question on moving rate. I think you mentioned it was flat in July year-over-year. It does get tricky looking at these kind of statistics because you have such a tough comp from last year, and it's not like everyone moves in. You reprice everything off of -- in a single month. So just curious, given your commentary about moving rates, where is it in-place versus move-in today? And as we get past these tough comp period, is your expectation that market rent growth as we get into the second half is still goes back to positive year-over-year?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Let me clarify one thing first, Ki Bin. So the month of July, we were about 5% to 7% negative in our achieved rate growth and that's year-over-year. So if you compare to where tenants were moving in last year versus this year, we were slightly negative. Now we forecast all of that. We expected that. And so we're not surprised.  In terms of the roll down, our in-place leases today -- our achieved rates are about 7% below where they were where our achieved rate is today -- I'm sorry, they're above. Our in-place rents are higher by about 7% than our achieved rents. And normally, at this time of the year, they're flat. Now in terms of cadence of where we expect our rates to go. Last year, they peaked in June and July, and they came down in August. So depending on what happens in August with our current rates, those could be flat again at the end of August.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we have a follow-up question from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: All right. Just a couple of follow-ups. Just on Ki Bin's question on the in-place -- or sorry, the achieved rates, I apologize. Could you just give us a sense of how that trended throughout the quarter? Quarter, I know you get the July figures. But is the sense of how that trended in -- would be helpful?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So April, May, they were slightly positive. June, down about 6%. Average about negative 3% for the quarter. July, you were down that 5% to 7% range again. So that's year-over-year. And again, last year, you were pushing rates in June and July pretty hard.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the relative to your expectations. Any markets you call out as the largest source of upside this quarter versus expectations?\nScott Stubbs: So things have performed pretty close to our expectations. I mean, the list of properties in what markets are outperforming, Atlantic continues to be a standout market for us. Most of the Sunbelt continues to be strong with South Florida, Miami being exceptionally strong in the Sunbelt, Miami and Atlanta.\nJoseph Margolis: It's a small market, but Charleston is one that has kind of jumped up and was -- had a bunch of supply and wasn't on our list earlier.\nJuan Sanabria: And then one last quick one, an incoming question. Can you estimate the impact to same-store revenue, I guess, year-to-date? Like you did for California, you said the rent restrictions coming off or 70 bps to given the higher length of stay for California, any estimate for what the impact or benefit was from New Jersey restrictions rolling off?\nJoseph Margolis: I don't have that number, Scott.\nScott Stubbs: No. We don't have it.\nJoseph Margolis: Can we get that back to you once...\nJuan Sanabria: Of course.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We also have a follow-up from Smedes Rose of Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here for Smedes. Joe, so 2 topics. The first was just on length of stay. And you had a really nice slide at NAREIT, which broke out length of stay between those greater than 12 months and those greater than 24 months. And that showed you know the data, but -- so that you're up to 66% greater than 12 months and up to 48% for greater than 24%, up from about 60% and 40%, respectively, pre-COVID.  As you dive into those numbers, is there anything that's changed over the last couple of months with those length of stays? And is there anything on a regional basis from a market perspective that's telling you anything or a customer perspective, just as you sort of disaggregate that aggregate data?\nJoseph Margolis: So we've had elevated vacates in response to our increased rent increases to existing customers. And we track that really carefully with every month control group. So we know exactly what percent increase in vacates being caused by our ECRI rent increase program. And that has caused a very slight moderation or dip in those numbers that you referenced in terms of long-term stay, but they're still very high and elevated from any historical period.\nMichael Bilerman: Does it reflect, Joe, do you think all those where you had a significant number of new customers that came to storage, I think over COVID, it was like 50% of the customers were new. Is that potential to driving the higher length of stay? And is there anything on a regional basis that would be different?\nJoseph Margolis: So I guess in reverse order, we don't see anything on a regional basis. It's pretty consistent across all markets. And our theory, which I think you're referencing here, theory, that the customers who came to us in COVID for lack of space because they were doing a home office or whatever. Those are the longer stay customers and we do lose some percentage of those. They don't all stay forever, but many of them are sticky.\nMichael Bilerman: And then are you seeing at all with, obviously, where rents -- apartment rents have gone, but also threats of a recession where typically, you'd see people start to double up or move back home, which would then increase your storage needs, right? The recession is not necessarily totally bad for your business. Have you started to see that in any of the markets where you're starting to see some of that demand at all?\nJoseph Margolis: So I don't know if we can say yes or no to that yet. Some of that data is hard to collect and you need a good period of time before you can be confident with it.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. I just want know if there was any early reads that your excellent property managers are seeing from those that are walking in the door, the type of uses that they're bringing in, if anything has changed more recently?\nJoseph Margolis: I mean there's always anecdotes, but I don't think I would be comfortable saying that we see a trend or a movement or anything like that.\nMichael Bilerman: And then just wrapping up on Bargold. You said the average lease length that Bargold has, it was 10 to 15 years. How much remaining lease term on average do they have with those 17,000 units? And I would assume there's some extension options? Or I guess if the co-op or condo, rental Board decides and Bargold just removes all the equipment that they installed just to better understand sort of what happens upon lease end?\nJoseph Margolis: So on lease end, there are several options very, very rare does the building owner ask for this deal to be removed. They can purchase it or more frequently lease it. So there's a revenue kind of -- a residual revenue stream at the end of the lease term for the leasing of the steel.  A portion at the end of the lease term, they automatically convert to month-to-month leases. And they have a portion of the -- we have a portion of the leases that are in that month-to-month category. And in looking at the portfolio, we really -- we're looking it hard at what is the churn rate? And how long do those last? And when do they get -- how often do they get terminated and took that into account in our underwriting?\nMichael Bilerman: And do you sort of see, Joe, this business as being -- it's hard to probably compare, but do you want to put this into more owned like co-op condo buildings or you sort of see this more as a rental building product? And do you see it cannibalizing if you're able to do exactly what you want to do and grow this business nationally and leverage all the tools and skill sets of Extra Space, does it become a competitive storage product? And I can understand at the same time with the waiting list that this company has. It could also provide you lower customer acquisition costs, too. But what is your sort of mindset about where this product potentially could go?\nJoseph Margolis: So I think we have a lot to learn. And one of the things we need to learn is exactly what's the optimal building. And is it -- what are the differences between putting it in an own building or a rental building? They have both. It works well in both. And how many units per apartment unit is optimal? And what's the best unit mix? We will tend to take a very data-oriented approach to that, probably more so than the prior quarter. So a lot of the questions that you have are the questions that we have, and we're going to learn about it.  On the best case where we can grow this thing, gigantic scale and it's lots of apartment buildings, then that does become a competitor for traditional urban self-storage. But if that's the case, I want to be the one to be the first mover in that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we have a follow-up. Next, we have Jeff Spector of Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: Promise, just one follow-up. Can you just confirm, in-place for us to achieve difference and how you reconcile that with earlier, I believe you commented 60-plus percent of the leases are below street rate, please?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So our average in-place rent is about 7% above where our achieved rents are today. Now that's on average. That's just comparing your average versus what the move-in is today. So while you could still have slightly negative rents and you push tenants up. . Now the one thing that we always look to is you're churning 5% of your customers every month. So a portion of that may move in at slightly lower rents. We then move our existing customers up fairly quickly. So we're probably one of the more consistent in our rate increases and how we do that more programmatic than others.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we have a follow-up from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: I appreciate taking the follow-up, hopefully, quick here also. In terms of street rates, can you talk about those trends during the quarter by month, perhaps and into July, Scott, like you provided on the achieved rates?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Street rates are not that different in terms of year-over-year growth or where they were than our achieved rates. Achieved your difference that is which channel they came from and that type of thing or discounts offered. So fairly similar trend to our achieved rates.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then on that 63% of customers, though, that are currently paying a rate below street rate today. You said that, that is higher than it has been historically. What's more typical for that metric?\nScott Stubbs: We went incrementally higher. I think it was low 60s earlier this year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. If you look back, though, over the last, say, 10 years, where has that been generally?\nScott Stubbs: I actually don't have this right -- we don't have it in front of us, Todd, just more of the recent numbers.\nOperator: And this ends the Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to the CEO, Joe Margolis for closing remarks.\nJoseph Margolis: Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your time and interest in Extra Space. If I take a big step back and kind of look at how the company is going -- it's really a good time here at Extra Space. Everything is clicking on all cylinders. The growth front, as we talked about, is really strong. We have a number of technological innovations underway that we're excited about. We just got back engagement surveys. Our scores are up very, very much this year. We are in great shape with our employee report. Thank you. [indiscernible] from the operations there. As my kids would say they're stupid good. So it's just a great time for us at Extra Space, and we appreciate everyone's support. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. Before I report on our performance, I am happy to announce that we recently published our Annual Sustainability Report. We are proud to be a sector leader, not only operationally, but also in sustainability. I encourage you to review our report, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.  Turning to results. The strong trends we experienced in the first quarter continued into the leasing season. Year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the quarter was 21.7%, matching our first quarter growth rate. This is an all-time high for Extra Space Storage. Despite expense pressure on several line items, NOI growth remained very strong at 26%. This was achieved primarily through year-over-year rental rate growth, partially offset by a modest decrease in year-over-year occupancy due to elevated vacate activity.  With manageable new supply and durable customer demand, we continue to operate at high occupancy with strong rates. Despite inflation and the potential effects of recession, we believe we are well positioned to continue to produce strong results due to our resilient need-based asset class, diversified portfolio, strong balance sheet and best-in-class team and platform.  We were active in each of our external growth channels. During the quarter, we invested $289 million in property acquisitions and we invested an additional $92 million in July, bringing year-to-date totals to $610 million. We have continued to focus on acquiring nonstabilized properties and, as we outlined last quarter, have started closing more transactions in joint venture structures.  We started to see the market shift late in the quarter with increasing interest rates, reducing the number of bidders at the table and the bid-ask spread widening between buyers and sellers. We are being selective with our acquisitions, and we are focused on transactions and structures that will be accretive for our shareholders.  In the quarter, we closed $70 million in bridge loans, and we added 40 additional stores gross to our management platform. We also made a creative storage investment, purchasing an existing storage company named Bargold Storage solutions. This company has a different model than traditional storage. It is focused on leasing space and apartment buildings, primarily in New York and subleasing storage spaces to residential tenants.  The acquisition of Bargold added over 17,000 units to our portfolio with an occupancy rate over 97%. Due to the unique nature of its operations, we have retained their team and are keeping the entity running as a separate organization. We view this transaction as another creative investment in the storage sector which came to us through deep industry relationships.  Our strong property NOI, plus our external growth efforts, resulted in core FFO growth of 29.9%. Our growth allowed us to raise our annual FFO guidance for the second time this year. It has been another great quarter, and we are well on our way to another strong year. Storage fundamentals remain solid. While we expect our rate of growth to moderate in the back half of the year due to very difficult comps, we expect it to remain well over historical averages, with modeled year-over-year revenue growth remaining in the double digits through 2022.  I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. Sure, Todd, and thanks for your clever title to know, we all got to chuckle out of that. So we underwrote the existing business. We didn't underwrite any extraordinary growth. We didn't underwrite any synergies. We fill our G&A on top of it. And just underwriting what exists today, the first year yields in the low 4s and it grows to the mid- to upper 5s. So kind of similar to urban property investments, I would say.  And then our hope is, of course, we're going to first try to institutionalize the business, introduce things that they haven't done. In terms of technology, they don't charge administration fees, they don't offer insurance. And that's kind of the first step of the plan is to institutionalize it and bring some Extra Space's, expertise and procedures, processes to it. And then we'll see Bar growing it. We'll try to grow it in New York City. And if that works, then we'll take it outside of New York City. But it's kind of one step at a time for us. Sure. Great question. So the business is leasing space in apartment buildings, and it's primarily basements and garages, building those spaces out. So if you walked into them, they would look exactly like the interior of one of our modern self-storage facilities and then leasing that only to tenants in the apartment buildings. So because of that, your customer acquisition and marketing costs are almost nothing.  It's a -- your incremental cost to grow the business is very, very small because you're not buying any real estate. It's all leases. So we bought the business, we bought the platform, and now it's capital light going forward. And the tenants are different. They stay for a long time. The average length of stay of in-place customers in this portfolio is 8 years. The churn is less than 0.5% a month compared to our churn of 6% to 7%. So it's incredibly stable.  They operate at occupancy of over 97%, and they have over 1,000 people on the waiting list. So that's a good example of synergies that we're going to experiment with is do we get those people on the waiting list into an Extra Space store until a unit opens up for them? It also tells me their pricing might not have been sophisticated as ours is. But you are right. The rate increases are limited in some instances and coordinated with the landlord because the landlord doesn't want a tenant to be unhappy or be using money he could for increased apartment rent, for increased storage rent. So there is a difference there as well. This company has historically operated at, what we would consider, very, very high occupancy levels. So over 97% would be a normal occupancy level for Bargold. I do not know of any other company that does this on the scale that Bargold does. And it's one reason that is exciting to us is the potential growth without a lot of competitors. So I'm not sure you know that until the future, right? I mean, yes, leasing has been strong and demand has been strong, but we haven't seen it diminish to the extent we could say it's leasing from a future period that's been pulled forward. So that seems very theoretical. I think your second question was on revenue growth pattern. And we do anticipate moderation, as Scott said in his remarks. But if you look at our guidance, we'll end the year in low teens positive revenue growth, which is just a fantastic number. It sets us up really, really well ahead into 2023. So the initial lease terms are between 10 and 15 years. Sure. So if we end the year at low teens revenue growth and knowing how increases and decreases take time to roll through the rent roll in storage, it takes a while for any weakness if we see that, if you're looking for a downside scenario to roll into results. So pick an ending point, right? I mean storage has only gone negative in revenues during the Great Financial Crisis and barely 0.1% during 2020. So pick whatever ending point you want for revenue and I think you will end up in 2023. I'm not giving guidance. I'm just doing math, above long-term historical averages in revenue growth.  And expenses, we'll continue to try to manage as well as we can. But we're going to have -- we have really hard comps this year, we're going to have fairly easy comps next year. And moving out of the store arena, everything else is growing really rapidly. Our Bridge Loan Program is growing rapidly. Our management business is growing rapidly. As the transaction market gets tougher, people tend to seek other solutions and sale, which are both -- which could be Bridge Loans. We're seeing less exits from our management business due to sales. Some of our other things that we do or seem to be shaping up and hopefully, we'll talk more about that later. So I'm pretty excited about 2023. Jeff, I would add, we have stronger markets and we have markets that are less strong. And we're always looking where performance isn't as good as elsewhere and seeing what tools we can use to try to help those markets. And it may be submarkets or individual stores where we have to do certain things with marketing spend or different things. And we always trying to maximize performance. So not everything is as strong as the best performing assets in the company. But everything is good. And we have the tools to address individual areas or stores or markets of weakness, and we feel lucky to have a really broadly diversified portfolio. So I think we're seeing less competition. I think there are fewer bidders. Folks who rely on leverage really heavily, have -- many of them have gone through the sidelines, but there's still bidders. And so transactions are getting done. So it's not an open playing field by any means. And cap rates is always a hard thing to tell, right, because it's -- the data lags and each transaction is kind of unique, its own. But I would say we have seen an expansion of cap rates. So we haven't made any change in what percent of the portfolio we send a rate increase to. Every customer is eligible for a rate increase after a certain amount of time. I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly, but... Okay. Yes. So, I misunderstood the question. So I don't think we can make good year-over-year comparisons. Because last year, we were so constricted by government regulations where we couldn't -- even if we wanted to, we couldn't send rate increase notices.  What I would say is that pre-COVID, we had a pretty formulaic approach in terms of cadence and amount of rate increase we sent to customers. And during COVID -- during the period of time we voluntarily didn't send out rate increase notices, and then when the governments of the various states told us we couldn't, we kind of kicked off with that formulaic approach. And we have not gone back to it. We are much more tailored now and designed in terms of both cadence and amount of rate increase that will send. Sure, Smedes. Thanks for the question. So we have 2 new joint venture partners this year in 2022. We also are working with some of our older joint venture partners and the phone rings a lot. There's lots and lots of people who would like to be our partners in self-storage. It's certainly asset specific. But I would say before the interest rate increases happen, pricing was so strong -- well, first, let's back up a little bit. 2021, you had strong pricing, you had fear of capital gains, tax increase. You feared 1031 going away. Getting into 2022, you had strong pricing and low interest rates. Now I think you have some people fearing increased interest rates and further cap rate compression in the future so time to get out. And then you always have the asset-specific thing. It's a fund that's coming to the end of the life. It's a family where there's been an issue or a death in the family. But I think those reasons probably wrap up most of the situations. Sure. Pretty similar, very similar to what we talked about last quarter. We continue to see and expect a moderation of new supply. There's certainly headwinds in terms of interest rates, cost, entitlements but it's not going to 0. There's still is new supply being delivered, and there's still an awful lot of interest in people wanting to build new self-storage. I'll give you a stats that is interesting.  Our management plus team underwrites about 215 deals a quarter for potential management contracts. 75% of those this year have been development. So there's still a lot of people out there interested in building self-storage. And you can understand why. The results of the asset class have been phenomenal. So as I said, tried to reference earlier, it's all over the board, right? Because we have this weird situation, a unique situation, excuse me, of folks whose rent was artificially suppressed by government regulation at a time when street rate was increasing. So we had some larger the normal gaps between what people are paying a street rates, and we were trying to catch up. So there's a wide variation in the amount of rent increase customers are getting, and I'm not sure an average is meaningful because of that. No. So the -- we have lots of ideas for Bargold. Well, the first thing we're going to do is absorb the existing business. One of the ideas, you're right, is they have such a long waiting list is could we provide some option for the Bargold tenants on the waiting lists to store their stuff in Extra Space units and then maybe give them a priority to get into a Bargold unit would that -- would not help Extra Space. We have not instituted that yet. That's just one of many ideas that we're excited to get to.  And yes, we -- once we digest Bargold, and we feel we have it rhyme the way we want, absolutely, we're going to try to expand it first in Manhattan and other parts of New York and possibly then afterwards to other major cities in the country. So I apologize if I implied that because we're going to end the year in double digits in revenue growth. That means it's going to be double-digit revenue growth throughout 2023. I think it means we're going to start 2023 with double digits. And then everyone can have their own view of the market and how that will moderate or not operate throughout the balance of the year. So I think last quarter, we said we expected lifting of the California state emergencies to add 50 basis points to the same-store portfolio. We now think that's more like 70 basis points. And the reason for the difference is we were only conservative in our length of stay assumptions. We thought that when we increased rates to street rates, we would push more people out the door. But in fact, we've been conservative in that assumption. So 70 basis points is the answer to your question. So the capital to grow the business, and I don't want to get in front of ourselves, right? I don't want to promise huge growth. We're taking this one step at a time. And the first thing is to absorb what we have. But we did buy this with the expectation that we will get to a growth phase. The -- because these are leases and the rent is just a percentage of revenue, there's no fixed rent in these leases. It's very capital light. You just have to build out the space. That's your capital.  Now there also may be capital expended in terms of systems. We -- our systems are better than theirs, and I'm not saying anything negative about the company. It's a very successful, well-run family company, it was, but we have more capabilities than them. We have better systems. And so we may also put some capital in there. But it's not a lot. This should be generally capital-light going forward. Sure. So the average number of units in the building is 25, but there's a pretty wide range of that. I think the largest building is 800 units, which is kind of similar to a store, but there's also buildings that just have a handful of units. The reason kind of boards or call-up boards building owners would do this, and so they don't have to handle it. So Bargold, now Extra Space handles getting the -- through in the unit, dealing with payments, dealing with nonpayments and auctioning the units. Out of their 17,000 -- over 17,000 units, they auctioned about 20 a month last year. So the rate is very, very small. And it's storage. It works just the -- laws are the same, and it works just like storage. Yes. I would say it was neither static nor hyper growth that they were a steady growth company growing in the single digits every year. It's a small market, but Charleston is one that has kind of jumped up and was -- had a bunch of supply and wasn't on our list earlier. I don't have that number, Scott. Can we get that back to you once... So we've had elevated vacates in response to our increased rent increases to existing customers. And we track that really carefully with every month control group. So we know exactly what percent increase in vacates being caused by our ECRI rent increase program. And that has caused a very slight moderation or dip in those numbers that you referenced in terms of long-term stay, but they're still very high and elevated from any historical period. So I guess in reverse order, we don't see anything on a regional basis. It's pretty consistent across all markets. And our theory, which I think you're referencing here, theory, that the customers who came to us in COVID for lack of space because they were doing a home office or whatever. Those are the longer stay customers and we do lose some percentage of those. They don't all stay forever, but many of them are sticky. So I don't know if we can say yes or no to that yet. Some of that data is hard to collect and you need a good period of time before you can be confident with it. I mean there's always anecdotes, but I don't think I would be comfortable saying that we see a trend or a movement or anything like that. So on lease end, there are several options very, very rare does the building owner ask for this deal to be removed. They can purchase it or more frequently lease it. So there's a revenue kind of -- a residual revenue stream at the end of the lease term for the leasing of the steel.  A portion at the end of the lease term, they automatically convert to month-to-month leases. And they have a portion of the -- we have a portion of the leases that are in that month-to-month category. And in looking at the portfolio, we really -- we're looking it hard at what is the churn rate? And how long do those last? And when do they get -- how often do they get terminated and took that into account in our underwriting? So I think we have a lot to learn. And one of the things we need to learn is exactly what's the optimal building. And is it -- what are the differences between putting it in an own building or a rental building? They have both. It works well in both. And how many units per apartment unit is optimal? And what's the best unit mix? We will tend to take a very data-oriented approach to that, probably more so than the prior quarter. So a lot of the questions that you have are the questions that we have, and we're going to learn about it.  On the best case where we can grow this thing, gigantic scale and it's lots of apartment buildings, then that does become a competitor for traditional urban self-storage. But if that's the case, I want to be the one to be the first mover in that. Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your time and interest in Extra Space. If I take a big step back and kind of look at how the company is going -- it's really a good time here at Extra Space. Everything is clicking on all cylinders. The growth front, as we talked about, is really strong. We have a number of technological innovations underway that we're excited about. We just got back engagement surveys. Our scores are up very, very much this year. We are in great shape with our employee report. Thank you. [indiscernible] from the operations there. As my kids would say they're stupid good. So it's just a great time for us at Extra Space, and we appreciate everyone's support. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, ahead of our own internal projections. Our outperformance was driven primarily by strong property performance, which benefited the same-store pool, joint ventures and management fees.  As Joe mentioned, we were active on the external growth front. Our investments were capitalized primarily by draws on our revolving lines of credit. We issued $22 million in operating partnership units as part of the Bargold transaction, bringing year-to-date issuance of equity to approximately $60 million. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $63 million of shares -- in shares at an average price of $165 per share.  Due to the wide spreads in the investment-grade bond market, we've been active with our banking relationships. Last week, we completed an accordion transaction in our credit facility, adding $600 million of unsecured debt within the facility across 2 tranches. Our plan to term out debt using the investment-grade bond market has not changed, and we expect to utilize this market again once conditions normalize.  Our leverage remains low, with net debt to EBITDA of 4.4x, and our unencumbered pool is over $13 billion. We continue to have access to many types of capital, and we have significant debt capacity to support future growth and maturities, albeit at higher interest rates.  Due to our year-to-date outperformance and improved outlook for the second half of the year, we updated our 2022 full year guidance. We've increased our same-store revenue guidance to 16% to 18%, driven primarily by rental rate growth. We strive to be efficient with expenses, and we believe our continued investment in our people and our properties are contributing to our top line growth. Consequently, we experienced same-store expense increases across several line items, and we have increased our expense guidance to 7.5% to 9% for the full year.  Our increased revenue far outweighs our increased expenses given our high-margin business. As a result, our same-store NOI growth range increased to 18.5% to 21.5%, the highest NOI growth guidance in our history.  Given our total investment activity year-to-date of $790 million, we have increased our acquisition investment guidance to $1.2 billion, only $250 million of which is unidentified. Our preferred investment in NexPoint remains in place and Bridge Loan volume and interest rates are higher than anticipated. As a result, we have increased our interest income guidance by approximately $3 million.  Due to the increase in interest rates as well as our higher acquisition volume, we've increased our interest expense guidance by $13 million at the midpoint. The sum of these adjustments result in an increase in core FFO, which is now estimated to be between $8.30 and $8.50 per share. We anticipate $0.20 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores, in line with last quarter's estimate. we're having a great year, and we are positioned for continued steady growth.  And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes, Todd, if you look at kind of our surveys and the questionnaires we give our customers, it's come back to pre-COVID answers. It's largely coming from people moving, lack of space obviously is needed, but not what it was in COVID.  Our rentals and vacates have moved much more to pre-COVID numbers. Our vacates are elevated slightly now, partly due to the existing customer rate increases that have gone through over the last year as we move people quickly to street rates because these state of emergencies have been removed. So while vacates have been elevated slightly, rental activity has been really good. It's been strong. So we've been able to backfill those. So we have moved people quickly to street rate. Yes, I'm not sure I fully understand the question, a pull-forward? Yes. Juan, this is Scott. Our occupancy has been pretty consistent over the last 4 months where we've run 1% to 1.2% below prior year. And we would expect that to continue throughout the remainder of the year and maybe fall off slightly more than that as we get towards the end of the year. So we expect to be below where we finished 2021 by 1% to 1.5%. Yes. So first on taxes. I mean, taxes, we are seeing things get reassessed in that 5% to 7% higher. We have been the beneficiary of some appeals, which has offset some of that increase. So overall, we're seeing increases, but the appeals are clearly benefiting us. Those are more onetime.  In terms of payroll, we continue to see wage pressure. Our payroll wages are up as much as 10% and our hours are up this year year-over-year. So that is somewhat a comp from last year. So last year, we had negative expense growth in the first half of the year. So as we resume more to normal hours, as more normal staffing, that is an increase year-over-year that we would not expect to go into next year. We would expect some wage pressure, but not the hour adjustment.  In terms of other things, we also continue to see pressure -- inflationary pressure on utilities, on repairs and maintenance. And as your revenues grow, your credit card fees grow. But this is the beauty of being in self-storage. It's such a high-margin business. So while inflation does impact your expenses, you also have some opportunities on the revenue front with month-to-month leases and that shorter-term lease really is a benefit to us. The amount of August has past? Yes. July continued from June rates were reasonably flat, June to July. Last year, like I mentioned, the rates really peaked in June, July of last year. So as last year's rate comp becomes easier, we hope that August continues to go well. But 2 days into August, it's all looking good still. Yes. So when we talk about the health of the customer, we get a lot of questions about this. We look at things like bad debt, your accounts receivable, you look at rates where they are today versus where they were.  In terms of accounts receivable, they're pretty consistent with where they were last year with the historical norms. Bad debt is very close to the historical average. Haven't seen those elevated over the past quarter.  In terms of rate, we compared to 2019, our in-place rents are up 26%, 27%. So while year-over-year looks really big, like a really big jump. When you go back a few years, it's more affordable and maybe it doesn't -- not as extreme as people would think on the surface. Keegan, about 63% of our tenants today are below street rate. So obviously, they're eligible. We actually push people above street rates. So it's a large percentage. That 63% is actually higher than it's been in the past. Yes. So when we break it out between the boroughs in New Jersey, our Northern New Jersey stores are performing better than our boroughs. Now we don't have a huge number of stores in the boroughs, so it might not be a great comparable. But both markets are performing below the average of the portfolio, but New Jersey is definitely performing better than New York. We did see rate increases. The state of emergencies lifted late last year. And so that has benefited us throughout this year.  I think November -- December is when most of those went out. So that's when you'll have a tougher comp. But we did implement many rate increases late last year that have benefited us this year in New Jersey. Not material -- not material state of emergencies in effect anywhere. No. I think you saw some that were larger than the average as rate restrictions were lifted, and we moved them quickly to the current market rates. And that benefit as you move throughout this year, obviously, decreases because you were doing many of those late last year and early this year. So the wage pressure has obviously -- will be consistent throughout the year. So you're probably around 10% wage inflation year-over-year. Hours should get better as we move throughout the year. So towards the end of last year, we were more appropriately staffed and second quarter was -- and into the third quarter was kind of the low point in terms of staffing hours and being understaffed due to turnover. Yes. Let me clarify one thing first, Ki Bin. So the month of July, we were about 5% to 7% negative in our achieved rate growth and that's year-over-year. So if you compare to where tenants were moving in last year versus this year, we were slightly negative. Now we forecast all of that. We expected that. And so we're not surprised.  In terms of the roll down, our in-place leases today -- our achieved rates are about 7% below where they were where our achieved rate is today -- I'm sorry, they're above. Our in-place rents are higher by about 7% than our achieved rents. And normally, at this time of the year, they're flat. Now in terms of cadence of where we expect our rates to go. Last year, they peaked in June and July, and they came down in August. So depending on what happens in August with our current rates, those could be flat again at the end of August. Yes. So April, May, they were slightly positive. June, down about 6%. Average about negative 3% for the quarter. July, you were down that 5% to 7% range again. So that's year-over-year. And again, last year, you were pushing rates in June and July pretty hard. So things have performed pretty close to our expectations. I mean, the list of properties in what markets are outperforming, Atlantic continues to be a standout market for us. Most of the Sunbelt continues to be strong with South Florida, Miami being exceptionally strong in the Sunbelt, Miami and Atlanta. No. We don't have it. Yes. So our average in-place rent is about 7% above where our achieved rents are today. Now that's on average. That's just comparing your average versus what the move-in is today. So while you could still have slightly negative rents and you push tenants up. . Now the one thing that we always look to is you're churning 5% of your customers every month. So a portion of that may move in at slightly lower rents. We then move our existing customers up fairly quickly. So we're probably one of the more consistent in our rate increases and how we do that more programmatic than others. Yes. Street rates are not that different in terms of year-over-year growth or where they were than our achieved rates. Achieved your difference that is which channel they came from and that type of thing or discounts offered. So fairly similar trend to our achieved rates. We went incrementally higher. I think it was low 60s earlier this year. I actually don't have this right -- we don't have it in front of us, Todd, just more of the recent numbers."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Jeff Norman, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Ashley.

Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, May 4, 2022. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoseph Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone for joining today's call. We are off to a great start in 2022. Year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the quarter was 21.7%, a new all time high for Extra Space driving same-store NOI growth of 27.6%. This was achieved primarily through year-over-year rental rate growth, partially offset by a modest decrease in year-over-year occupancy. Industry fundamentals continue to be strong, operational performance has been exceptional in all markets and we are well positioned for another strong summer leasing season. A few weeks ago, we met with over 220 of our third-party management and joint venture partners in Austin, Texas for a few days of company updates and industry news. Most importantly, it provided a form to explore opportunities for Extra Space and our great partners to grow together. These partnerships and relationships continue to be an important part of our external growth strategy as shown in our first quarter results. Like last year, most of our acquisition activity consisted of non-stabilized stores acquired from existing relationships. Total first quarter investment by Extra Space was ahead of our expectations at $229 million. We also closed $138 million in bridge loans and we added 37 additional stores gross to our management platform. All of our various internal and external growth channels are working. We continue to find opportunities despite the competitive market, and we have strong pipelines for each of these platforms. Our property NOI plus our external growth efforts resulted in core FFO growth of 34%, which allowed our Board to increase our first quarter dividend to $1.50 a share, 20% over the previous quarter\u2019s dividend and 50% over the first quarter 2021 dividend. It continues to be a great time for the storage sector and particularly for Extra Space. All aspects of the machine are working really well, and we are looking forward to a very successful 2022. I'll now turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a great first quarter with our same-store performance and FFO, both coming in above our expectations. Our outperformance relative to our guidance was driven by stronger property performance and higher than expected interest income. Our external growth in the quarter was capitalized by draws on our revolving lines of credit and we issued $41 million in common stock as part of an acquisition. During the quarter, we termed out 400 million of revolving balances through our third public bond offering, further laddering our debt maturities and freeing up additional revolver capacity. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. Our unencumbered pool is now approximately $13 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA is 4.4x. We have access to many types of capital and we have significant debt capacity to support future growth. In addition to our first quarter results, we also updated our 2022 full-year guidance. We have increased our same-store revenue and NOI forecast based on our first quarter outperformance and improved outlook heading into the summer leasing season. Same-store revenue guidance increased to 13% to 15% driven primarily by rental rate growth. Same-store expense increases in the quarter were driven primarily by payroll, credit card fees and snow removal. As a result, we have increased our expense guidance to 6.5% to 8% for the full-year. Our revenue and expense guidance results in a same-store NOI growth range of 15% to 18%. As Joe mentioned, acquisition activity in the sector remains elevated and we are ahead of our original guidance for both year-end closings as well as our full-year pipeline. While still competitive, it appears that a number of bidders pursuing any given deal is lower potentially due to the increasing interest rates. As a result, our capture rate has improved, especially on non-stabilized one-off stores.  We expect to continue to acquire through joint venture partnerships and we have increased our 2022 guidance to $800 million in Extra Space investment. We also expect higher bridge loan activity, and we have increased guidance to $150 million in retain new balances in 2022. We have increased our interest income guidance by approximately $7 million since our preferred investment in NexPoint remains in place and due to higher bridge loan volume and interest rates. Due to the increase in interest rates as well as higher acquisition volume, we have increased our interest expense guidance by $13 million at the midpoint. The sum of these adjustments results in an increase in core FFO, which is now estimated to be between $8.05 and $8.30 per share. We anticipate $0.20 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores, down $0.03 from our original guidance due to stronger than expected performance at these properties. We are having a great year and we look forward to another great leasing season. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the quarter. I know, Joe, I consider you to be conservative in your opening remarks. I feel like we're \u2013 maybe the most positive opening remarks I've heard in all these years. I guess what's the \u2013 if there was a number one or two big surprise versus what you were thinking last year. How would you describe the environment, I guess, what's turned more positive in your view or what's been the upside surprise?\nJoseph Margolis: Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate the comment. I think the customer has behaved differently than we've projected when we did our initial guidance, both in terms of elongated lengths of stay and the move out rate in response to ECRI to existing customer rate increase notices, both of those things have been better than expected and helped us both achieve better than predictive results and increase our forecast for the entire year. \nJeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you. And then just to confirm, I guess if you can characterize the customer. I mean, I think the numbers sum it up, but so I assume at this point, I think the comment was all the regions or markets are performing well sort of confirm you're not seeing push back on the rental increases you are sending out, including, I guess at this point to April?\nJoseph Margolis: So I won't say we're not seeing pushback from the rental rates we're sending out. Our vacate activity in response to rate increases is probably double what it normally is, but demand is so strong and our ability to backfill those tenants is consistent across the country, that it hasn\u2019t affected us in terms of results, in terms of performance.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you.\nJoseph Margolis: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Sticking with the topic of ECRIs. Relative to your peers, I think your occupancy took a little bit more of a hit, but you saw your rent growth accelerate further. So I guess the question is, did you push harder on ECRIs than you had in the past and then, which is generating the greater revenue growth. And then as you think of kind of as you head into this period with tougher comparisons, does that change how hard you can push on the ECRIs?\nJoseph Margolis: So we're in a unusual unprecedented situation where we've had several years where we've been restricted in many, many jurisdictions from how much we can increase rates and how much we can built to existing customers and to new customers. The last two of those restrictions in California were just lifted in February. So we had a greater gap between what many customers were paying and what the market price for our product was. And we've tried to make progress towards closing that gap. In the future, I don't expect that gap to be as large. And consequently, ECRIs won't be as large. So it's fair to say that the \u2013 maybe the acceleration is just, is primarily driven by a step-up just based on how you process ECRIs in California rather than a change in \u2013 like the overall program. Is that fair? I mean, the increase, the restrictions were lifted in New York and New Jersey in the fourth quarter of 2021. And that takes a while to roll through to the rent roll. So it's not all California, but your general statement is true.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's helpful. And as my follow-up, you took your guidance up for acquisitions. I think in the past you had talked about doing more deals within the JV, and it seems like the transactions being or being wholly-owned. So I'd like to kind of dig into kind of what you're seeing in the acquisition markets, the competitive nature of it, and I guess the impact of rising interest rates and how that has impacted other potential buyers of self storage properties and portfolios. Thank you.\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. All great questions. So it is true. We have found more properties than we anticipated that met our return requirements for wholly-owned properties. So we have been more active on the wholly-owned side. Those are almost exclusively unstabilized lease up stores where we're looking at a fairly low initial yield, but we think long-term will be very accretive. We are also very busy on the joint venture side. Well, we only close two in the first quarter. We've closed one since the end of the first quarter and have 12 scheduled to close for the rest of the year in joint venture. If you look at what's been approved in our committee for the first quarter, we've approved 2021 deals in joint ventures versus 2018 wholly-owned deals. So we're active on both sides. Turning to your pricing question, it's been a little bit of a surprise for us as interest rates go up, we would have expected cap rates to also go up. We have not seen a lot of evidence of that yet. I think it's because there is so much pent-up demand for self-storage so much capital from many, many different sources trying to get exposure to this property type. What we have seen though is either fewer initial bidders or as the process goes on, the leverage buyers seem to drop out. But there's enough other buyers that there's still a lot of interest in the properties. Prices are pretty consistent with what they've been towards the end of last year. And there's a lot of volume, there's just a lot on the market. We don't see the big mega portfolios, but absent that it's as busy as it's ever been in the first quarter.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the second quarter.\nJoseph Margolis: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Just hoping you could give an update on any trends you can share on April, whether it be occupancy or move in rates. And if you can comment on move in rates, how that trend compares relative to what you saw through the first quarter?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Juan, so occupancy at the end of April is just over a 100 basis points lower than where it was last year. So down slightly from the end of March, but not anything unexpected. In terms of rate, in the first quarter, we averaged about 15%. Our achieved rate for new customers was 15% ahead of where it was last year. Today in the last 15 to 30 days, it's been \u2013 or in the last two weeks, it's been moderating to where it's about mid-single digits today \u2013 low-to-mid single digits.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. Great. And then just curious on the rate restrictions coming off, if there's any change to the quantum or the size of impact to same-store revenue guidance, as you've been able to maybe capture some of that sooner, given how strong the market's been. Has that changed at all, given the first quarter and what you've seen to date in the second?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. I think you'll see that change in our increased guidance.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. Is the impact, I guess, just isolating the rent restrictions rolling off the 50 bps you talked about at the fourth quarter, when you set guidance, is that now 100 basis points or is it still kind of\u2026\nJoseph Margolis: Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question. So we thought that on a portfolio wide basis, we would get a 200 basis point of boost from ECRI, and that's probably now closer to 400 basis points. In California, we set 50 basis points. And as I said earlier, underestimated both the move out rate in response to that, and then the length of stay of tenants who get it, and \u2013 so that's considerably higher also.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you. So just to tie two ends there. The 2x move out rate that you noted on to Jeff's earlier question, is that more tied to California? Because that sounded a little alarming just in a vacuum, but is that just as a result of California and moving people closer to market, and that really a warning sign?\nJoseph Margolis: No. It's a function of everywhere where we have moved people to market, there's two factors. One is the rate restriction, which keeps the existing rate down, but the other is the large increase in Street rates. So if someone comes in at an Internet special rate and they're paying 15%, just as an example below Street rate on day one and rates are going up, Scott said 15% in the first quarter achieved rates. You have a pretty big gap there even in a state without rate restriction. So we are also experiencing the type of behavior that I described in those states.\nScott Stubbs: And Juan, maybe to clarify this isn't a new trend. We saw this in the last year. We saw higher move outs as we executed on higher rate \u2013 larger rate increases.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks for that, Scott. I appreciate the time guys.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Juan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. First question, Joe or Scott, I guess, back to investments. Can you comment on whether EXR changed its return hurdles at all going forward as you underwrite new deal? And I realize you increased your guidance for acquisitions by $300 million, but just curious, I guess if your appetite from here has really changed at all, just given the increase in debt and equity costs for the company or perhaps in response to your view around the economic growth outlook?\nJoseph Margolis: So we haven't changed our underwriting discipline, our processes in any way. As you point out, our average cost of debt has increased slightly. Our cost of equity has increased slightly. So our weighted average cost of capital, the hurdle we have to jump over has gone up, but we've still been able to find deals either through a wholly-owned basis or structured through a joint venture to enhance those returns. That makes sense for our shareholders.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And it sounds like you talked about utilizing joint venture capital perhaps a little bit more here in the near-term, what's the appetite like from your joint venture partners and are they \u2013 is there appetite for new deals pretty steady here? Or are you seeing them sort of pull back a little bit and perhaps change their return hurdles and expectations?\nJoseph Margolis: No. We have great joint venture partners who have significant capital resources and appetite for storage exposure. And in the event we ever got to the point where they were full or wanted to take a pause, there's plenty of folks out there who would be really happy to partner with Extra Space Storage. So we're in a great position now where we have plenty of access to joint venture capital. We have plenty of access to all different types of debt capital. We feel the restricting metric on our growth is availability of good deals. It's not finding the appropriate type of capital to capitalize them with.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And just last question, Scott, within the guidance revision, and sorry if I missed this, but can you speak to the increases in interest income and also, JV income? What the drivers, the primary drivers are behind the increases in those assumptions, which totaled about $0.10 or so?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So in the interest income, it's a couple of things. One is the bridge loan program is just really doing well. It's been successful. We're placing lots of bridge loans. We're keeping more on balance and it's taking maybe a little more time to sell the A piece of that. So the assumption is higher from that aspect. It also is higher because of the JCAP assumption. So we are assuming now that we keep that through May and then do a blend and extend after May, and then that \u2013 in addition to that you have higher interest rates. And so the bridge loans are more profitable as interest rates go up. So that's kind of what's in the next three quarters. In the first quarter, we did have the benefit of some one-time type transactions where we sold the $103 million note. We unwound an unamortized premium that benefited us. And so we had more \u2013 first quarter was higher than the remainder of the year will be.\nTodd Thomas: And then the second one about the\u2026\nScott Stubbs: Yes. The equity and earnings piece is primarily getting into the [promote] on some of the JVs with the performance of the properties. It is going to move us into the promote or some of those \u2013 those JV budgets were done late \u2013 earlier than the wholly-owned properties. And as we've gone back through and looked at the performance of those, we feel like they should outperform, where we originally estimated.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.\nSamir Khanal: Hey, Scott, you talked about sort of the length of stay continuing to expand here. Can you remind us where that is today and versus, let's say even a year ago, or even, what's been the trend on that?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So our trend continues to extend. If you look at customers that are in our properties today, length of stay is about 42 months. It's just over 40 months. It depends on the period. That has gone up through COVID. If you look at our customers that have moved in and moved out, the average length to stay there is about 16 months. I think that you're probably up as much as 10% over the last two years.\nSamir Khanal: Got it. And then Joe, I just want to get your thoughts on sort of the business customer. I mean, has there been any shift in demand from that segment? I mean, there's clearly been talk about sort of that last mile delivery. I mean, are you seeing sort of that segment or increased demand pickup at all?\nJoseph Margolis: The last mile delivery is not a significant part of our business at all. I think that's kind of interesting talk, but realistically that's not meaningful to us.\nSamir Khanal: And what about the business customer in general? Have you seen sort of the pickup in demand from that segment generally?\nJoseph Margolis: I think the business demand is steady. I wouldn't say we've seen pickup in it. It's an increasingly smaller piece of our business because as we grow the portfolio and add more stores that are current generation storage, that are multi-story, the percentage of units that most business customers seek, right, large outside access units is a much smaller percentage of our portfolio. So therefore that customer becomes a much smaller piece of our business. But in terms of demand and behavior, there's really been no change.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keegan Carl with Berenberg.\nKeegan Carl: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. So just first, in order to needs based business, but how much of an impact from the current inflationary pressures are you factoring into your price increases going out?\nScott Stubbs: So with the ability to adjust rates month-to-month, I mean, I'm guessing some of our rate increases in the overall economy is going to be attributable to inflation, but ours is more demand based and so as demand increases, you have the ability to move up your street rates and move up your existing customer rates. So it's really difficult to attribute what amount is to inflation versus demand.\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. We don't do very much forward price predicting because we change the rates on every unit every day based on data that has come in as to what happened. So it really doesn't help us to try to figure out what a 10 by 10 is going to be priced 30 days from now, the machine and the algorithms and the people who work on that are going to adjust prices constantly to try to optimize revenue.\nKeegan Carl: I think I asked that [indiscernible]. I guess something more, the economy could become more challenge given what's going on with inflation. So I mean, how sensitive are you in factoring what that's going to do to potential consumer balance sheets when you're sending out these price increases?\nJoseph Margolis: So every time we send out price increases, we keep back a control group. So for example, if we send out 100,000 price increases a month, we'll keep back 1500 or 2000 folks who should have gotten a price increase, and then we'll track their move out rate versus the folks who did get the price increase notice. And that's the way we can constantly check to see if we are pushing too hard and actually harming the business. Does that helpful? \nKeegan Carl: Yes. That makes sense. So I guess shifting gears here, I mean, obviously your third party management platforms, strong and growing. So how much of an appetite are you truly seeing for that? What sort of conversion rate are you having on its pipeline versus what you're actually closing on?\nJoseph Margolis: So last year was an unusual year, right, because we added 104 properties net. We bought 58 properties off the portfolio too, but we added 104 net, including a large 59 or 60 property portfolio. So if you look at our activities today versus historically without that large portfolio, we're right on track, we did 187 new property projections in the first quarter and approved 52 new contracts. That's right in line with our averages over the last couple years, excluding that large portfolio. In the first quarter, we added 19 stores net. We bought six, and added 19 net. So that's what a run rate of 76 properties. That's a good \u2013 if we can grow this business by 75 to 100 properties net a year, that's pretty consistent with what we've done in the past and pretty strong.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Thanks for the time guys.\nJoseph Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, there. Maybe just a question on the demand side. I feel like there's a thought out there that just with the amount of life change that's happened over the past two plus years with COVID that there's no way it can kind of stay this elevated. So I was just wondering maybe if you could give your thoughts on why demand is so high maybe why it can or can't stay so elevated and just where we go from here?\nJoseph Margolis: So I think demand can stay elevated in a changing economic environment, which is, I think what you're asking is because the drivers of demand, there's some drivers that occur in all economic situations, right. People still get married, they still have babies et cetera. And then there's drivers that occur in bad economic conditions where I can't afford my apartment, I need to move back in with my parents. I have to downsize my business. So because of the diverse demand drivers, I think we can maintain healthy demand through all economic cycles. And that's not just the theory, right. We saw in 2008, 2009 that we didn't really have a demand problem. We had a vacate problem. And there's been consistent demand through that period. There's been consistent demand through 2020 and 2021. So we're bullish on the demand side.\nCaitlin Burrows: I guess, just as a follow-up on that vacate issue that was seen in the past. Would you say then that your kind of systems have improved that much since then so you would be better positioned to address it? Or how could that play out differently going forward?\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. I couldn't have said it any better. We try to sharpen the tools every day and become a little bit better at optimizing performance in response to what's happening. So I think you're absolutely right.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. And then maybe just one on the higher bridge loan activity. I think you've mentioned a few times it was higher in the quarter than you were expecting and seems like it could remain high. Wondering if there was any specific reasons you could give that might be driving it and how sustainable that is?\nJoseph Margolis: I don't think there's a specific reason. I think it's just largely a relationship business and as our relationships grow and as we do repeat business with borrowers, it's like a snowball rolling down a hill. It just tends to increase. And we've seen that. We've really started this business in 2019. We only did nine loans and we did 27 in the next year and 34 last year. And we're on track to continue to just increase this business. So I don't think it's a change in the market. It's just a natural growth in the business and relationships and repeat borrowers.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nJoseph Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the comments about the mid single-digit rate increase in April. I was just curious if it's taking more marketing dollars or promotions to keep that, or is that pretty apples-to-apples, in terms of pricing power indications?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Ki Bin, our demand has been strong enough that our marketing is actually down. So it's encouraging that we're able to increase rates demands so good. And the customer rate increases are sticking, so. \nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And in terms of your balance sheet, your variable rate debt represents about 25% of your debt spec. Now I don't want to miss the big picture. That's been a winning formula for the past. I'll say forever, and this may be the first year that may not be a winning formula. So I was just curious if you have any kind of larger picture thoughts on what you intend to do with that variable rate debt?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Our variable rate debt has been something that we've had for a long time. We've typically managed that 20% to 30%. It gives us the flexibility to buy things. Typically what we'll do is we'll draw on the line of credit is, we have acquisition opportunities, and then we'll look to term that out. You saw us do that earlier this year. Clearly, like variable rate debt more when interest rates are falling than when they're rising, but, we'll continue to manage that. We do have a bit of a natural hedge with our bridge loan program, where those are also variable rate, loans go in the other direction.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thank you, Ki Bi.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Apologies, if I missed this, but can you comment on how your expectations for supply pressure have changed or not since last quarter? It seems as though the increasing pressure on construction financing coupled with permitting backlogs, et cetera, continue to push deliveries out, but just want to get your updated thoughts on what you guys are seeing on the ground?\nJoseph Margolis: Yes. We have seen a moderation in our expectations of new deliveries. When we look at our same-store pool and what's going to be delivered this year, our estimate now is below 20% of our new \u2013 of our same-store pool is going to have new deliveries. And that's down somewhat from last quarter is we see some of the things you mentioned is delays and project's not going forward. So supply is certainly moderating. It's not a non-issue, there are still things being delivered. We have a very diverse portfolio, so we'll be able to manage through it as we'll have some properties having to deal with new supply, which we know how to do and in other markets not. But I still believe even with cost increases and more difficulty in entitlements that we are going to see more development in the future. The performance of the product is very strong. It's just too good. The amount of capital is unprecedented and people are going to find ways to build, and it may take longer, but I think it's going to happen. And we know this because, I mentioned we did 187 new property projections in the first quarter on the management side, 74 of those were for new development. So people are trying to get it done and hopefully the industry as a whole will be smart about it. \nSpenser Allaway: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nJoseph Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you on the joint venture opportunities, you talked about increasing your activity there. Are you generally working with the same partners and pools of capital? Are you bringing in new folks, you mentioned a lot of pent-up demand and a lot of capital up there?\nJoseph Margolis: We do have two new joint venture partners that we have, or will close ventures with this year. I guess one is closed, one is about to close. It's a juggling act, right because we want to be a good partner and be able to satisfy everyone's needs, but we never want to run out of joint venture capital. So we're always trying to have sufficient capital, but not have too many mouths to feed.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then, I mean, just on that, do you \u2013 I mean, when you go into the joint ventures, is it your view that you just sort of stay joint venture partners kind of toward some very long timeline or do you set up agreements where each can have the opportunity to potentially exit or just, I'm just trying to think about, I guess, the timeline for the joint ventures, or maybe there's not one?\nJoseph Margolis: It's a great question. And it's something we focus on a lot. It's one of the most important things. The table stakes to form a joint venture partner is that we have similar investment criteria. So our joint venture partners are general accounts of insurance companies, odyssey, core odyssey funds that have kind of unlimited lives and unlimited holding periods. We don't want IRR driven partners that are going to want to pull the sale button in three years. We're looking for people who are looking at these assets, just like we are as quasi-permanent holds for cash flow that we can grow year after year after year. Now that being said, no one can promise they're going too hold forever. At some point, our partners do want to sell, we have rights in all of our joint venture partners upon exit to have an opportunity to purchase, but much more important than what's in the legal document is that we partner with people who are like-minded with us and have similar investment goals.\nSmedes Rose: Got it. Thank you.\nJoseph Margolis: Sure, Smedes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: Yes. Hi. Two quick ones and I apologize if I missed these before. But did you comment on what move in versus move out rates were in the first quarter. And then for the operating properties that were acquired in the first quarter, what was the average occupancy? \nScott Stubbs: Yes. So move-in rates versus move-out rates, we're about 10% below. Our move-in rates were 10% below our existing customers, which is very typical for this kind of year. So no concerns there. And then our average occupancy we're pulling.\nJoseph Margolis: I got it. The average occupancy on the wholly-owned stores was 76% with the projected 13 months to stabilization. And that's economic stabilization not physical occupancy stabilization. The joint ventures were higher on in occupancy. \nMichael Mueller: Okay. That was it. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Two, quick ones. First on expenses, just looking at property taxes were up 1%. And payroll, I see 8%. Just can you comment on both of those line items on the property taxes front and how payrolls are trending?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Property taxes were maybe a little lower than maybe some people expected, that has more to do with timing of appeals than you'd like to think you're doing some type of Jedi mind trick or something to keep those rates low, but I don't think that it's, anything other than those appeals coming through when they did. In terms of payroll, we did increase rates for our employees by about 8% at the end of last year, when you take their annual rate increase as well as a one-time adjustment. And then our staffing has largely returned to normal. So those are \u2013 that's a little bit more clarity on those two items. \nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was just trying to understand, how to think about looking at the entire portfolio? And what the mark-to-market is today. You made some comments earlier that people are moving in maybe 10% below portfolio rents, which is helpful. But if I take a step back and try to get it that calculation where rents are in the portfolio today, where versus the market, how should we think about that?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So that 10% number obviously a time of year type of thing. So you have a customer that moves in last summer at a higher rate. Typically you do see street rates go down in the fall and through the winter and then they go back up in the summer. Those existing customers that moved in last summer, last fall are going to be getting rate increases. So that's going to contribute to your growth going forward. So not uncommon, all part of the kind of the rate cycle.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thanks so much.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Joe Margolis, CEO.\nJoseph Margolis: Great. Thank you, everyone for taking the time to listen. Thank you for your interest in Extra Space. We're really happy to be able to deliver these types of results for our shareholders. But it happens because there's over 4,000 people at Extra Space, who are working really hard every day in the stores to the data science folks, to the accountants, to all the investment people, but the entire team just works hard and works well together, and they need a lot of credit and shout out for the results they're delivering. Thanks, everyone. I hope you have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joseph Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone for joining today's call. We are off to a great start in 2022. Year-over-year same-store revenue growth in the quarter was 21.7%, a new all time high for Extra Space driving same-store NOI growth of 27.6%. This was achieved primarily through year-over-year rental rate growth, partially offset by a modest decrease in year-over-year occupancy. Industry fundamentals continue to be strong, operational performance has been exceptional in all markets and we are well positioned for another strong summer leasing season. A few weeks ago, we met with over 220 of our third-party management and joint venture partners in Austin, Texas for a few days of company updates and industry news. Most importantly, it provided a form to explore opportunities for Extra Space and our great partners to grow together. These partnerships and relationships continue to be an important part of our external growth strategy as shown in our first quarter results. Like last year, most of our acquisition activity consisted of non-stabilized stores acquired from existing relationships. Total first quarter investment by Extra Space was ahead of our expectations at $229 million. We also closed $138 million in bridge loans and we added 37 additional stores gross to our management platform. All of our various internal and external growth channels are working. We continue to find opportunities despite the competitive market, and we have strong pipelines for each of these platforms. Our property NOI plus our external growth efforts resulted in core FFO growth of 34%, which allowed our Board to increase our first quarter dividend to $1.50 a share, 20% over the previous quarter's dividend and 50% over the first quarter 2021 dividend. It continues to be a great time for the storage sector and particularly for Extra Space. All aspects of the machine are working really well, and we are looking forward to a very successful 2022. I'll now turn the time over to Scott. Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate the comment. I think the customer has behaved differently than we've projected when we did our initial guidance, both in terms of elongated lengths of stay and the move out rate in response to ECRI to existing customer rate increase notices, both of those things have been better than expected and helped us both achieve better than predictive results and increase our forecast for the entire year. So I won't say we're not seeing pushback from the rental rates we're sending out. Our vacate activity in response to rate increases is probably double what it normally is, but demand is so strong and our ability to backfill those tenants is consistent across the country, that it hasn't affected us in terms of results, in terms of performance. Thank you, Jeff. So we're in a unusual unprecedented situation where we've had several years where we've been restricted in many, many jurisdictions from how much we can increase rates and how much we can built to existing customers and to new customers. The last two of those restrictions in California were just lifted in February. So we had a greater gap between what many customers were paying and what the market price for our product was. And we've tried to make progress towards closing that gap. In the future, I don't expect that gap to be as large. And consequently, ECRIs won't be as large. So it's fair to say that the \u2013 maybe the acceleration is just, is primarily driven by a step-up just based on how you process ECRIs in California rather than a change in \u2013 like the overall program. Is that fair? I mean, the increase, the restrictions were lifted in New York and New Jersey in the fourth quarter of 2021. And that takes a while to roll through to the rent roll. So it's not all California, but your general statement is true. Yes. All great questions. So it is true. We have found more properties than we anticipated that met our return requirements for wholly-owned properties. So we have been more active on the wholly-owned side. Those are almost exclusively unstabilized lease up stores where we're looking at a fairly low initial yield, but we think long-term will be very accretive. We are also very busy on the joint venture side. Well, we only close two in the first quarter. We've closed one since the end of the first quarter and have 12 scheduled to close for the rest of the year in joint venture. If you look at what's been approved in our committee for the first quarter, we've approved 2021 deals in joint ventures versus 2018 wholly-owned deals. So we're active on both sides. Turning to your pricing question, it's been a little bit of a surprise for us as interest rates go up, we would have expected cap rates to also go up. We have not seen a lot of evidence of that yet. I think it's because there is so much pent-up demand for self-storage so much capital from many, many different sources trying to get exposure to this property type. What we have seen though is either fewer initial bidders or as the process goes on, the leverage buyers seem to drop out. But there's enough other buyers that there's still a lot of interest in the properties. Prices are pretty consistent with what they've been towards the end of last year. And there's a lot of volume, there's just a lot on the market. We don't see the big mega portfolios, but absent that it's as busy as it's ever been in the first quarter. Thanks so much. Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question. So we thought that on a portfolio wide basis, we would get a 200 basis point of boost from ECRI, and that's probably now closer to 400 basis points. In California, we set 50 basis points. And as I said earlier, underestimated both the move out rate in response to that, and then the length of stay of tenants who get it, and \u2013 so that's considerably higher also. No. It's a function of everywhere where we have moved people to market, there's two factors. One is the rate restriction, which keeps the existing rate down, but the other is the large increase in Street rates. So if someone comes in at an Internet special rate and they're paying 15%, just as an example below Street rate on day one and rates are going up, Scott said 15% in the first quarter achieved rates. You have a pretty big gap there even in a state without rate restriction. So we are also experiencing the type of behavior that I described in those states. So we haven't changed our underwriting discipline, our processes in any way. As you point out, our average cost of debt has increased slightly. Our cost of equity has increased slightly. So our weighted average cost of capital, the hurdle we have to jump over has gone up, but we've still been able to find deals either through a wholly-owned basis or structured through a joint venture to enhance those returns. That makes sense for our shareholders. No. We have great joint venture partners who have significant capital resources and appetite for storage exposure. And in the event we ever got to the point where they were full or wanted to take a pause, there's plenty of folks out there who would be really happy to partner with Extra Space Storage. So we're in a great position now where we have plenty of access to joint venture capital. We have plenty of access to all different types of debt capital. We feel the restricting metric on our growth is availability of good deals. It's not finding the appropriate type of capital to capitalize them with. The last mile delivery is not a significant part of our business at all. I think that's kind of interesting talk, but realistically that's not meaningful to us. I think the business demand is steady. I wouldn't say we've seen pickup in it. It's an increasingly smaller piece of our business because as we grow the portfolio and add more stores that are current generation storage, that are multi-story, the percentage of units that most business customers seek, right, large outside access units is a much smaller percentage of our portfolio. So therefore that customer becomes a much smaller piece of our business. But in terms of demand and behavior, there's really been no change. Yes. We don't do very much forward price predicting because we change the rates on every unit every day based on data that has come in as to what happened. So it really doesn't help us to try to figure out what a 10 by 10 is going to be priced 30 days from now, the machine and the algorithms and the people who work on that are going to adjust prices constantly to try to optimize revenue. So every time we send out price increases, we keep back a control group. So for example, if we send out 100,000 price increases a month, we'll keep back 1500 or 2000 folks who should have gotten a price increase, and then we'll track their move out rate versus the folks who did get the price increase notice. And that's the way we can constantly check to see if we are pushing too hard and actually harming the business. Does that helpful? So last year was an unusual year, right, because we added 104 properties net. We bought 58 properties off the portfolio too, but we added 104 net, including a large 59 or 60 property portfolio.

That's right in line with our averages over the last couple years, excluding that large portfolio. In the first quarter, we added 19 stores net. We bought six, and added 19 net. So that's what a run rate of 76 properties. That's a good \u2013 if we can grow this business by 75 to 100 properties net a year, that's pretty consistent with what we've done in the past and pretty strong. Sure. So I think demand can stay elevated in a changing economic environment, which is, I think what you're asking is because the drivers of demand, there's some drivers that occur in all economic situations, right. People still get married, they still have babies et cetera. And then there's drivers that occur in bad economic conditions where I can't afford my apartment, I need to move back in with my parents.

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a great first quarter with our same-store performance and FFO, both coming in above our expectations. Our outperformance relative to our guidance was driven by stronger property performance and higher than expected interest income. Our external growth in the quarter was capitalized by draws on our revolving lines of credit and we issued $41 million in common stock as part of an acquisition. During the quarter, we termed out 400 million of revolving balances through our third public bond offering, further laddering our debt maturities and freeing up additional revolver capacity. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. Our unencumbered pool is now approximately $13 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA is 4.4x. We have access to many types of capital and we have significant debt capacity to support future growth. In addition to our first quarter results, we also updated our 2022 full-year guidance. We have increased our same-store revenue and NOI forecast based on our first quarter outperformance and improved outlook heading into the summer leasing season. Same-store revenue guidance increased to 13% to 15% driven primarily by rental rate growth. Same-store expense increases in the quarter were driven primarily by payroll, credit card fees and snow removal. As a result, we have increased our expense guidance to 6.5% to 8% for the full-year. Our revenue and expense guidance results in a same-store NOI growth range of 15% to 18%. As Joe mentioned, acquisition activity in the sector remains elevated and we are ahead of our original guidance for both year-end closings as well as our full-year pipeline. While still competitive, it appears that a number of bidders pursuing any given deal is lower potentially due to the increasing interest rates. As a result, our capture rate has improved, especially on non-stabilized one-off stores.  We expect to continue to acquire through joint venture partnerships and we have increased our 2022 guidance to $800 million in Extra Space investment. We also expect higher bridge loan activity, and we have increased guidance to $150 million in retain new balances in 2022. We have increased our interest income guidance by approximately $7 million since our preferred investment in NexPoint remains in place and due to higher bridge loan volume and interest rates. Due to the increase in interest rates as well as higher acquisition volume, we have increased our interest expense guidance by $13 million at the midpoint. The sum of these adjustments results in an increase in core FFO, which is now estimated to be between $8.05 and $8.30 per share. We anticipate $0.20 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and C of O stores, down $0.03 from our original guidance due to stronger than expected performance at these properties. We are having a great year and we look forward to another great leasing season. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes. Juan, so occupancy at the end of April is just over a 100 basis points lower than where it was last year. So down slightly from the end of March, but not anything unexpected. In terms of rate, in the first quarter, we averaged about 15%. Our achieved rate for new customers was 15% ahead of where it was last year. Today in the last 15 to 30 days, it's been \u2013 or in the last two weeks, it's been moderating to where it's about mid-single digits today \u2013 low-to-mid single digits. Yes. I think you'll see that change in our increased guidance. And Juan, maybe to clarify this isn't a new trend. We saw this in the last year. We saw higher move outs as we executed on higher rate \u2013 larger rate increases. Thanks, Juan. Yes. So in the interest income, it's a couple of things. One is the bridge loan program is just really doing well. It's been successful. We're placing lots of bridge loans. We're keeping more on balance and it's taking maybe a little more time to sell the A piece of that. So the assumption is higher from that aspect. It also is higher because of the JCAP assumption. So we are assuming now that we keep that through May and then do a blend and extend after May, and then that \u2013 in addition to that you have higher interest rates. And so the bridge loans are more profitable as interest rates go up. So that's kind of what's in the next three quarters. In the first quarter, we did have the benefit of some one-time type transactions where we sold the $103 million note. We unwound an unamortized premium that benefited us. And so we had more \u2013 first quarter was higher than the remainder of the year will be. Yes. The equity and earnings piece is primarily getting into the [promote] on some of the JVs with the performance of the properties. It is going to move us into the promote or some of those \u2013 those JV budgets were done late \u2013 earlier than the wholly-owned properties. And as we've gone back through and looked at the performance of those, we feel like they should outperform, where we originally estimated. Thanks. Yes. So our trend continues to extend. If you look at customers that are in our properties today, length of stay is about 42 months. It's just over 40 months. It depends on the period. That has gone up through COVID. If you look at our customers that have moved in and moved out, the average length to stay there is about 16 months. I think that you're probably up as much as 10% over the last two years. So with the ability to adjust rates month-to-month, I mean, I'm guessing some of our rate increases in the overall economy is going to be attributable to inflation, but ours is more demand based and so as demand increases, you have the ability to move up your street rates and move up your existing customer rates. So it's really difficult to attribute what amount is to inflation versus demand. Yes. Ki Bin, our demand has been strong enough that our marketing is actually down. So it's encouraging that we're able to increase rates demands so good. And the customer rate increases are sticking, so. Yes. Our variable rate debt has been something that we've had for a long time. We've typically managed that 20% to 30%. It gives us the flexibility to buy things. Typically what we'll do is we'll draw on the line of credit is, we have acquisition opportunities, and then we'll look to term that out. You saw us do that earlier this year. Clearly, like variable rate debt more when interest rates are falling than when they're rising, but, we'll continue to manage that. We do have a bit of a natural hedge with our bridge loan program, where those are also variable rate, loans go in the other direction. Thank you, Ki Bi. Yes. So move-in rates versus move-out rates, we're about 10% below. Our move-in rates were 10% below our existing customers, which is very typical for this kind of year. So no concerns there. And then our average occupancy we're pulling. Thanks, Mike. Yes. Property taxes were maybe a little lower than maybe some people expected, that has more to do with timing of appeals than you'd like to think you're doing some type of Jedi mind trick or something to keep those rates low, but I don't think that it's, anything other than those appeals coming through when they did. In terms of payroll, we did increase rates for our employees by about 8% at the end of last year, when you take their annual rate increase as well as a one-time adjustment. And then our staffing has largely returned to normal. So those are \u2013 that's a little bit more clarity on those two items. Yes. So that 10% number obviously a time of year type of thing. So you have a customer that moves in last summer at a higher rate. Typically you do see street rates go down in the fall and through the winter and then they go back up in the summer. Those existing customers that moved in last summer, last fall are going to be getting rate increases. So that's going to contribute to your growth going forward. So not uncommon, all part of the kind of the rate cycle. Thanks, Ron."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Jeff Norman, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Norman: Thank you, Liz. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, February 28, 2024. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today\u2019s call. We had a solid fourth quarter where we focused on optimizing the performance of the recently added Life Storage assets while maximizing the performance of the legacy Extra Space locations. We were also very productive on the external growth front adding another 74 third-party managed stores, 8 stores through acquisition and $129 million in bridge loans. Operationally, the Extra Space same-store pool maintained high occupancy and solid in-place rents, driving same-store revenue growth of 0.8% for the quarter. Core FFO in the quarter was $2.02 a share and full year core FFO was $8.10 per share. On our last call, we outlined that in order to reach the high end of our guidance range we would need achieved rates to new customers to improve on a year-over-year basis. While demand was steady and allowed us to maintain strong occupancy, it was not strong enough to eliminate negative new customer rates, which remained at approximately negative 10% during the quarter. As a result, we faced the headwind of higher negative churn, and our full year performance was near the midpoints of our same-store and FFO ranges. Turning to Life Storage. One of the factors in our merger decision was our belief that we could enhance Life Storage property performance through our more sophisticated platform. Seven months removed from closing, we are happy to report that our assumptions have proved true. Customer acceptance of rent increases has been in line with our expectations, and we are seeing the net rent per square foot for legacy Life Storage customers move closer to that of nearby Extra Space locations. Occupancy is also responding positively and we saw the occupancy gap between the LSI and Extra Space Storage same-store pools tightened through the quarter, improving from a gap of 350 basis points at the beginning of the fourth quarter to a gap of 250 basis points at year-end. Today, that gap has tightened further and is approximately 200 basis points. The occupancy improvement together with the benefit of existing customer rent increases resulted in Legacy LSI same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, an acceleration of 80 basis points over the third quarter growth rate. However, similar to the Extra Space properties, we continue to see new customer price sensitivity at the Life Storage locations, resulting in lower-than-anticipated new customer rates. So while we are achieving the anticipated incremental outperformance we expected for the Life Storage assets, reaching full property level synergies is taking longer than anticipated due to current market conditions, which we know will eventually normalize. The current level of demand also influences our outlook for 2024. We are encouraged by our rental velocity, occupancy levels, existing customer health, length of stay and the potential benefits of moderating new supply. However, these factors have not yet led to material improvement in new customer rates. We are confident we can hold strong occupancy and generally maintain current revenue levels, but we believe it will be difficult to drive a reacceleration in revenue growth until we regain pricing power with new customers. We are seeing some positive signs that we are getting closer. And given our strong occupancy levels, when pricing power returns, we are very well positioned to push rates quickly. We just have not seen enough progress to date to feel confident this inflection will be in time for the 2024 leasing season or to include this scenario in our guidance. So, while the industry as a whole will likely face headwinds from lower new customer rates in the near term, the long-term outlook for our sector and for Extra Space specifically remain bright. Storage has consistently proven to be a remarkably durable asset class and Extra Space Storage has the largest and most diverse portfolio in the industry. New supply continues to moderate and the headwinds to future new development are substantial and increasing. We have very strong third-party management and bridge loan pipelines and a robust joint venture program and I am confident in our ability to further scale our capital-light growth activities. We expect to outsize relative growth from our LSI assets in 2024 and with additional synergies to be unlocked as the rental environment improves. And as I mentioned, our occupancy today is over 93% at what is normally our low point for the year. Once demand improves, we are very well positioned to capture it. I will now turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe. And hello, everyone. Our results were generally in line with our expectations with a few exceptions. As Joe already covered, lower new customer rates caused revenue growth to come in modestly below our internal estimate. The revenue mix was partially offset by lower-than-expected property taxes. We also had a beat from G&A savings, partially offset by lower than modeled tenant insurance. All of our other income and expense line items were generally in line with our forecast. As of January 1, we have completed the migration of the Life Storage customers to our tenant insurance program, and we believe we will achieve $16 million in synergies from tenant insurance, exceeding our original estimate by $4 million in 2024. Our G&A run rate from Q4 and is lower than our expected 2024 full year run rate as we continued hiring during the fourth quarter, and we have some G&A seasonality. We now expect to realize 2024 G&A synergies of $39 million, an increase of $16 million over our original forecast of $23 million. Turning to the balance sheet, we completed a $600 million bond offering in the fourth quarter and another $600 million bond offering in the first quarter of 2024. We have used the proceeds from these offerings to pay off the $1 billion variable rate bridge loan we obtained in conjunction with the closing of Life Storage. Our only remaining 2024 loan maturities can be extended at our option, and we have plenty of dry powder if opportunities arise in the market. In last night\u2019s earnings release, we provided our 2024 outlook for both the Extra Space and legacy Life Storage same-store pools. We have provided wider same-store revenue and NOI ranges to capture the different scenarios we believe are possible given the unusual 2023 comparables and uncertainty around new customer pricing. With interest rates potentially remaining higher for longer, our guidance does not assume a material improvement in the housing market during the summer leasing season. For the EXR same-store pool, our same-store revenue guidance is negative 2% to positive 0.5%. Our expense growth range is 4% to 5.5% driven by marketing, insurance and property taxes resulting in an NOI range of negative 4.25% to negative 0.5%. For the legacy LSI same-store pool, we expect stronger property-level growth with same-store revenue ranging from 2% to 4.5%. We expect outsized expense growth at the LSI stores in 2024, especially in the first half of the year. This will be driven by higher payroll as we have brought the LSI stores back to full staffing levels. We expect additional expense pressure on repairs and maintenance, property taxes and property insurance, resulting in a range of 6.25% to 7.75% yielding a life storage same-store NOI range of negative 0.25% to positive 4%. Our core FFO range for 2024 is $7.85 and to $8.15 per share and assumes the full year impact of the shares and debt added through the Life Storage merger. And with that, Liz, let\u2019s open it up for questions\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nLizzy Doykan: Hi, this is Lizzy on for Jeff. Just I guess going back to Joe\u2019s opening comments on not really having the confidence right now to include a scenario on pushing new rates more quickly and not assuming a rebound in housing. So I guess, if you could provide color on what your assumptions are for new move-in rates and how that should trend that\u2019s leading to the lower end versus the higher end of the same-store rev guide, that would be helpful.\nJoe Margolis: So our guidance is really revenue based and new move-in rates to customers are one component we\u2019re a little agnostic between occupancy and new move-in rate and ECRI program and promotions and all the various components that go into the revenue assumptions that produce our guidance. As I said and you indicated, we don\u2019t see enough now to guide to a strong rebound in the housing market in time for the leasing season. We still see price sensitivity from new customers, although rental demand is good, and we\u2019ve had a really good start to this year. We don\u2019t think interest rates are going to go down in time to have a material impact on the leasing season. So while we don\u2019t have a crystal ball, we thought a reasonably prudent guidance would be not to assume that rebound.\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Lizzy, maybe to add a little bit more color to Joe\u2019s comments, our guidance, the base case assumes that we do have sequential rate growth on a month over month basis from now into our leasing season, but just not enough to necessarily close that negative gap that we\u2019re experiencing today.\nLizzy Doykan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And as my follow-up question, we just noticed that the assumption on the SOFR curve driving interest expense within guidance. It seems a bit aggressive just based on where SOFR sits today. So could you just walk through kind of your outlook on rates and what\u2019s embedded in guidance in terms of debt and refi activity? Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So as we were preparing our guidance and preparing our annual budget, the SOFR curve was moving around pretty quite a bit. We saw moving almost every day. So we picked a point in time that had an average of 4.75. That was approved probably 1.5 weeks ago is when we finalized and we figure it will move throughout the year, but that\u2019s the assumption we made in our guidance.\nLizzy Doykan: Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Lizzy.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. My first question is just on the kind of the strategy of increasing occupancy and cutting street rate and then using ECRI as a lever to drive rent growth. Has that held up, has that strategy been effective through the quarter? And then along with that, can you talk a bit about just the customers\u2019 reception to ECRIs? Has that changed at all?\nJoe Margolis: Sure, Michael. So our strategies are designed to maximize long-term revenue, not to maximize incoming rate or any other metric. And all the testing we do \u2013 that we constantly do shows that to lean into occupancy a little more, lean into acquiring web customers at lower rates because they tend to be the longer-term customers and rely on ECRI produces the best long-term revenue growth. Customers\u2019 acceptance of ECRI has not changed at all. We monitor that every month as we send out ECRI notices, and we have not seen any increase in customers vacating the stores because of ECRI. So we believe this strategy is both valid and working.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you for that. My follow-up is just on the \u2013 is on the Life Storage portfolio. Can you kind of \u2013 it sounds like the stuff that you can control within the integration and the environment has been working well. It\u2019s kind of some of the stuff that is plaguing the industry, which is kind of the slower demand and also just the pressure on rates is kind of weighing on the ability to generate synergies, is that right? And then does that kind of change the path to generate the synergies that you expected, whereas like it will not necessarily be generating them all in 2024, but it may require kind of a multi-year process to reach that kind of synergy number that you had initially thought of. Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And I think it\u2019s accurate assessment of what\u2019s going on. The things we control, like G&A and tenant insurance, we\u2019re not only working, but working better, as Scott pointed out in his comments, than underwritten. And we\u2019re not done there. We\u2019re going to continue to look for further savings in those areas. We\u2019re outbidding contracts to get savings from the greater scale that we have now. We\u2019re going to continue to work real hard to improve on those numbers. What\u2019s also working is that the Life Storage properties do perform better and are trending better on our systems. But the headwind that we face that we don\u2019t control is the market conditions, and that is slowing down the achievement of the full underwritten property synergies. So two things are going to happen. The mix of what contributes to the targeted synergies is going to change, and there\u2019s going to be less near-term contribution from the properties and more near-term contribution from the other aspects. And depending on where you are in our guidance, it potentially could not occur until after this year. At the high end of our guidance, we\u2019ll get real close, and at the lower end of our guidance, we\u2019ll fall somewhat short.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. First, I just wanted to see if you can talk a little bit more about the differences that you\u2019re forecasting for same-store revenue growth between the EXR and LSI portfolios. If you can expand a little bit on the primary drivers behind those differences and discuss trends that you\u2019re seeing in occupancy and any differences in move-in rates for those two portfolios.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Hey Todd, it\u2019s Scott. So a couple of things, one is the occupancy delta. So mid-summer last year you were 400 basis points difference between the two pools. When we ended the year, we are 250 basis points different. Today, we\u2019re about 200 basis points different. Through February, we\u2019ve continued to increase occupancy at the Life Storage properties at a time when we were clearing up some auctions, so during the fourth quarter, we had quite a few auctions there, and so you had more churn than is normally happening. On the positive side, at those stores, we have seen customers accept the ECRIs and they have actually moved out at a slightly lower rate than the Extra Space customers receiving ECRIs. So that\u2019s the good news. The thing that has been a bit of a headwind has been the current market conditions. And so we do expect the occupancy gap to close here in this rental season, and we expect to start closing the rate gap also. Today, their stores are priced as much as 10% lower than the Extra Space stores. And as that occupancy gap closes, we would expect to close that gap also.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then it sounded like, I think, Joe, you said that you\u2019re encouraged by the rental activity and what you\u2019re seeing so far early in the year? Are you able to provide an update on January and February occupancy and move-in rate trends?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. The occupancy as of today is 93.1 on the Extra Space same-store pool. And so good news, occupancy delta at the end of the year was a negative delta of 110 basis points. Today, it\u2019s a positive 40 basis point delta, so strong rentals in the month of January. Now, the \u2013 maybe the downside of that is it has come a bit at the expensive rate, our new customer rate, we\u2019ve still found some pushback on rate. Rates in the fourth quarter were down 10%, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, during January, February, they\u2019re down about 17%. But to add some context to that, we pushed rates really hard last year. And so we have actually increased rates again this year, December through the end of February, but just not as much as we pushed them last year. So good news is the occupancy is moving in the right direction or at a time of year when you\u2019re usually losing occupancy, but it is coming at the expense of new customer rate.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And that\u2019s for the EXR legacy same-store that you\u2019re referring to?\nJoe Margolis: I\u2019m referring to actually the new same-store pool, which is slightly different, but the old same-store pool occupancy moved almost the exact same. And that\u2019s the Extra Space same-store pool. The life storage legacy pool, the occupancy delta, as I mentioned, as of today, is about 200 basis points, as opposed to at the end of December, it was 250 basis points.\nTodd Thomas: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Okay. Does the change in the same-store pool for either EXR LSI have any expected meaningful impact?\nJoe Margolis: So there\u2019s not going to be any change in the LSI pool. We\u2019re keeping it the exact same. The Extra Space pool, the benefit in revenues this year is going to be about 40 to 50 basis points, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. And the occupancy delta, as of today, about 30 basis points of that delta is being generated by the change in pool. So it\u2019s moved between December and today about 140, 150 basis points and 30 basis points of that is due to the change in pool.\nTodd Thomas: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.\nSamir Khanal: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Scott, can I ask you to comment on expenses? The midpoint is 4.75%, but help us through, think through the various line items.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So the Extra Space pool, the midpoint 4.75% includes an increase of payroll that is inflationary to slightly plus, but call it, 3%. Biggest line item in terms of dollar increase is marketing, which includes its upper teens in terms of increase year-over-year. And we\u2019re expecting to continue to have to spend on the marketing we saw that increase as we moved through 2023. Property taxes are between 2% and 3% and then tenant insurance is the biggest line item with closer to 20%, I\u2019m sorry, property and casualty insurance is closer to 20%.\nSamir Khanal: Okay, got it. And just switching gears here, maybe on revenue growth, maybe comment on kind of what you\u2019re seeing, maybe in the New York region. I looked at your sort of top three markets, LA and Atlanta, holding up versus maybe New York, down about 150 bps sequentially. So maybe give a bit more color on kind of the New York-New Jersey market. Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So the New York-New Jersey, MSA market is, I think it\u2019s being driven down or negatively impacted by Northern New Jersey. So if you look at the borough, the borough continues to outperform our portfolio as it has for the last three or four quarters. New York was laggard for a while, and now New York markets rotate, and now New York is performing very well. But Northern New Jersey in particular is dragging down the overall MSA performance.\nSamir Khanal: Okay, thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Samir.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. Hi, everyone. In terms of the move-in, move-out rates, that\u2019s very helpful in the disclosure. Can you just give us a feel for how you\u2019re thinking about that sequential benefit, which you did cite, some sequential benefit expected in the move-in rates this year? Is it going to be a similar shape to last year, how it played out in terms of looking at, say, mid-year move in rates versus the ending fourth quarter rates in 2022?\nScott Stubbs: We would expect it to be somewhat of a bell curve with less negative churn in the summer months than today. This is kind of the depths of that negative churn, end of the year till end of February. And that\u2019s that negative 35% that you saw in our subs. But we would expect it to go more similar. And we hope to get rate power. We hope to flatten that out somewhat.\nNick Yulico: Okay, great. Thanks, Scott. Just one other question on the $0.20 dilution from acquisitions and such, is that relating to something more than the $250 million of acquisitions in the guidance, is there some impact from last year? Just seems a lot for like a about a $44 million overall number. So I just wanted to make sure I understood what that related to.\nScott Stubbs: This is the \u2013 sorry, sorry, Joe. This is the impact of last year\u2019s lease up assets, including certificate of occupancy and this year. So it\u2019s things that aren\u2019t in the same-store pool, basically.\nNick Yulico: Okay, perfect. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Hi, can you guys hear me?\nJoe Margolis: Yes, we can, Spenser.\nSpenser Allaway: I\u2019m sorry. Yeah, my audio cut out. Thank you. Maybe we could just circle back to expense management, again, just given the environment and there being minimal new customer demand. How important do you view marketing aggressively right now when customers are presumably making storage decisions based on proximity and price?\nJoe Margolis: So I just want to clarify. There\u2019s not minimal new customer demand. We\u2019re still renting an awful lot of units every month. It\u2019s just that the price sensitivity of those customers is such that we\u2019re not successful in pushing prices. Marketing spend \u2013 I\u2019m sorry?\nSpenser Allaway: No, no, I was going to say that\u2019s a fair point. So thank you for the clarification.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So marketing spend, which is only about 2% of revenue, we really look at as an investment. We\u2019re happy to spend or willing to spend the marketing dollars as long as we can get an ROI in those dollars. And we have a metric that we use to make sure we\u2019re getting a good return on every marketing dollar we spend.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thank you. And then can you comment on how the cost of marketing in terms of Google clicks and ad space today compares with historical norms? Just trying to understand how that fares relative to historic norms. And trying to understand if some of the increase in marketing is just due to higher absolute cost of advertising versus maybe the amount you\u2019re advertising versus last year.\nJoe Margolis: It is slightly higher. That\u2019s certainly a factor. We also are using Sparefoot more than we have in the past. It was a lesson we learned from the LSI merger and that has a slightly higher cost.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just one last one, if I can. Just looking at your marketing performance, can you just \u2013 market performance, excuse me, can you just comment on what was driving the expense cut in your Chicago market?\nScott Stubbs: It\u2019s property tax appeals, so it\u2019s successful appeals. And so you had negative expense effectively in some of those stores.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Spenser.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Spenser.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. You mentioned that LSI rates were getting a bit closer to legacy EXR in the same submarkets, but still 10% below. Just curious, if you achieve your guidance for this year, it sounds like maybe you\u2019d still have another call at 8% or 9% on rate to get to a similar level. Is that the right way to think about it?\nScott Stubbs: So depending on where you are in the range of that, rates do go up and we do assume that they\u2019ll move in the right direction. And we are seeing that as you move throughout the year, the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter is a normal time when you do see rent per square foot tick down, that\u2019s not odd. You saw that in the portfolio. It was also impacted a bit by some of the churn from auctions. But as we move into January, February, we are seeing that rent gap continue to close and move in the right direction.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. And then in your January slide deck, you shared that 62% of customers are staying longer than 12 months, 45% longer than two years. Was just curious what type of ECRIs these customers are getting versus shorter duration customers. Obviously, as moving rates have gone down, the cost goes up. So trying to understand if the magnitude of difference between those longer duration versus short duration customers is changing.\nJoe Margolis: So the shorter duration customers will typically get a larger ECRI if they came in on some type of promotional or introductory rate. And after that, the longer-term customers typically will get a smaller percentage increase because we\u2019re just trying to get them to Street rate.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. And then maybe just one last clarification. Did you say in response to the prior question, that $0.20 of dilution from C of O value add acquisitions was really just from the prior year, because if you kind of just take your share count times that $0.20, it\u2019s sort of like $45 million. Just try and understand how you\u2019d get to that level of dilution based on the amount of acquisitions that you just referenced.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So that actually comes from multiple years. So some of those C of Os are from 2022 C of Os, 2023 C of Os, 2024 C of Os, certificate of occupancy deals. It\u2019s basically as they get up to the run rate of a stabilized property. And so it\u2019s not just 2024 dilution and 2024 adds, it\u2019s multiple year. All we\u2019re trying to show there is the potential upside if we were to stop adding to that portfolio or to that pool of properties.\nEric Wolfe: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.\nKeegan Carl: Yeah. Thanks for the time, guys. Maybe first, just what are you guys currently seeing in the transaction market that gives you confidence in your target? And where are you seeing stabilized cap rates at today?\nJoe Margolis: So most of our guidance towards acquisition is already identified and under contract. I think we only have about $50 million in unidentified and I think between now and the end of the year, we\u2019ll find $50 million. And if it makes sense, we\u2019ll find more. And if it doesn\u2019t make sense, we won\u2019t do it, right? We have plenty of capital, but we\u2019re only going to do things that are accretive to our shareholders. Market cap rate, I think, is a very difficult discussion. Transaction volume is very low, transactions that we see close seem to have a story to them. The last property in a closed-end fund or a family where something happened to the patriarch or matriarch on the property. There doesn\u2019t seem to be enough transactions where you can really say this is a market cap rate. So it\u2019s a very difficult thing, and I wouldn\u2019t want to put a number on it.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. That\u2019s fair. And I\u2019m going to sound like a broken record here on this one. I\u2019m going to ask another question about the Storage Express deal. So I know when you guys initially mentioned you were going to swap some stores between that platform and your Extra Space platform. I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019ve learned so far and if we can expect some more assets, especially from the LSI portfolio to be added to this platform in 2024?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I think we will see more changes in Extra Space Storage Express and Life Storage stores as we learn how best to optimize revenue and then optimize NOI at these stores. And we\u2019re really trying to learn what is the mix of size of the store, rent per square foot population saturation, distance from another one of our branded stores, prime rates in the area, lots and lot driving distances, lots and factors that we can optimize NOI with a store that has \u2013 is fully staffed, that is partially staffed or that is managerless if you will. And as we learn those lessons, we\u2019ll apply it not only to our existing portfolio, but to our acquisition strategy.\nKeegan Carl: Are you willing to share any sort of quantification of performance on stores you would have shifted from one platform to another? Is it too early to tell?\nJoe Margolis: I mean the only thing I\u2019m really willing to share because some of this, I think, is secret sauce. Is Storage Express had some stores that were fairly large, right? Their average store size was 36,000 square feet, half of our average store size. They had some stores that were 80,000 square feet. And we didn\u2019t \u2013 those stores don\u2019t make any sense to work on a manager list basis.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Fair enough. Thanks guys.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald your line is now open.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Two quick ones from me. So the first is, I just want to understand the comments on the ECRIs. So it sounds like there\u2019s been sort of no change in magnitude for sort of frequency. Just want to make sure I understand that correctly. And then how should we think about the first half versus second half of the year cadence as you\u2019re going through the same-store?\nJoe Margolis: So there\u2019s \u2013 in general, there\u2019s no \u2013 we haven\u2019t made any change in frequency for ECRI. Where \u2013 that being said, we\u2019re always testing things. So there are outliers. And what was the second question?\nScott Stubbs: The cadence. And Ron, I think the best way to look at that is it depends a little bit on where you are in the guidance. So if you are at the bottom end of the guidance, that obviously is going to imply that you\u2019re negative for longer \u2013 midpoint, you\u2019re negative. Even at the top end of guidance, it does imply that you do stick slightly negative for a period of time. But I think in none of those scenarios do we have kind of the Nike Swoosh [ph], so to speak, where you see rapid acceleration. And the concept there is, we have so many customers moving in each month at lower rates that it does take some time to move those rates up and to really start seeing that accelerate. So even if you did get pricing power this summer, the benefit of those pricing \u2013 of those customers wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact you until later in the year as they got rate increases and into next year.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second one, if I may. I think one of your competitors made an interesting comment that they\u2019d actually already seen some of their markets start to accelerate and that maybe the markets that went up higher during COVID were taking a little bit sort of longer. And I guess I\u2019m curious, as you\u2019re thinking about your portfolio, you guys have been much more successful peers pushing pricing. Can you comment around is there a sort of are different markets in different stages? And have you seen some already maybe start to turn around and pick up? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So, I think different markets are always in different stages, right? I commented earlier on New York being above portfolio performer in 2023, and it was below in 2021 and 2020. Florida was a great market for prior years, and Florida is having more difficulty now. And it\u2019s one reason that we believe in a highly diversified portfolio because we want to have exposure to all sorts of markets, markets that are accelerating, decelerating, more flat. Markets that have no exposure to new development, have more exposure to new development or coming out of the development cycle. And by having a highly diversified portfolio, and our portfolio got more diversified with this merger, we think we\u2019ll smooth out our returns. So I don\u2019t know if I can identify a major market that\u2019s accelerating. We certainly have markets like Los Angeles that are still doing very well. But I don\u2019t know of a major market that\u2019s accelerating.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. That\u2019s it for me. And we appreciate the new move in disclosures. That was helpful.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: Yes, hi. So hopefully two quick ones here. First, how far through the planned LSI, ECRIs are you? And then on the investment front for the COs [ph] and lease up acquisitions, are you seeing more opportunities on, I guess, maybe somewhat busted developments or on just new, brand new ground up investments?\nJoe Margolis: So we\u2019ve completed the ECRI program for all LSI customers who were customers at closing.\nMichael Mueller: Okay.\nJoe Margolis: So they\u2019re now on the normal site. As new customers come in, they\u2019ll be on the normal program. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen many busted developments or developments that aren\u2019t leasing up as well. They\u2019re disappointed developments that look like really attractive opportunities to us, yet I don\u2019t think that\u2019s meaningful.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Could you comment a little bit on the dual brand strategy if you\u2019re seeing any top of funnel benefits from operating LSI and EXR separately in some of your markets, or if extra operating expenses make that too complicated or costly in terms of operations?\nJoe Margolis: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. So the premise of the dual brand strategy was that by having more digital real estate. We would get more clicks and therefore more rentals, and that would pay for the incremental cost of running two brands. So if you think of the Google landscape in three pieces, there\u2019s the paid section and we absolutely are having more digital real estate and more clicks there and that\u2019s because we pay for it. So that\u2019s easy. We knew that would happen. And then the local section in the map, where the map appears, we are seeing more presence there, and that\u2019s continuing to improve over time. So that seems to be working as planned. And then the last section, the SEO [ph] section or the organic section, takes time, right. When we buy an individual property, it takes time for us to get that property up to the Extra Space organic standards. So that\u2019s moving in the right direction. But we really need more time to see where we\u2019ll end up. And if that trade off of more clicks, more rentals, is revenue positive.\nEric Luebchow: Okay. I appreciate that. Just one follow-up on the guide, and I know Scott touched on this. So the G&A guide of 180 million plus, I know you had some seasonality in your Q4, but you were at a run rate of around 160 million annualized. And maybe you could just kind of help us bridge those two numbers when we\u2019ll see kind of more of the G&A cost synergies that you touched on really flow into the P&L from the G&A side? Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: So the synergies are assuming that the $180 million and not the lower number, the number that you saw in the fourth quarter, they would have been even greater than the 39 million that we referred to if we were able to achieve the fourth quarter run rate. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re done there. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to look for opportunities. That number in the fourth quarter was just a fair amount under due to some transition of employees and hiring and timing. And when we brought things on, as well know there is some seasonality to our G&A with the fourth quarter not being the highest quarter.\nEric Luebchow: All right. Thank you both.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the street rates, I know this is just one variable to the whole equation, but I was curious at the midpoint of your guidance, what you\u2019re implying for street rates for the year in 2024?\nScott Stubbs: So it\u2019s difficult to break it out exactly. I think that we are saying we don\u2019t expect to get significant growth in street rates. They will be the midpoint. We do expect occupancy to be relatively flat. But we don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s helpful to necessarily break those out since there\u2019s one component of the total model, but we are not expecting significant street rate power this year.\nKi Bin Kim: But I\u2019m guessing you probably expect it to reach flat year-over-year at some point in the second half. Is that fair to assume?\nScott Stubbs: Sequentially, we do expect them to go up month-over-month. I think it will depend a little bit on how this leasing season goes. I think that we were disappointed last year. We were at a point last year where we raised rates significantly January through March. And then the leasing season came and the housing, the lack of home sales, I think, impacted last year. And so I think that we\u2019re a little gun shy and don\u2019t want to make that mistake again.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And the second question on your bridge loans, you guys are guiding for a pretty substantial increase in activity. Also curious if you can provide some color around kind of implied valuation cap rates or LTVs, just to get a better sense of what those deals look like?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So part of the increase in bridge loan balances is our plan to hold more of the whole notes and not sell as many A notes. Now that can change as the year unfolds. But the whole bridge loan now is 8.5% to 9%. So we don\u2019t feel that\u2019s a bad use of capital at this point. The fundamentals of the loans are unchanged. We still will end up to 80% of our underwritten value will take operating reserve and interest reserve that\u2019s a recourse obligation to a creditworthy entity. So we know that there\u2019s capital to pay the debt service and operate the property. We require that we manage the property. We require an interest rate cap, which is less important now than when we started the program. So the fundamentals of the loan program haven\u2019t changed.\nKi Bin Kim: And you do have a pretty sizable maturity in the bridge loan program in 2025. What\u2019s the base case scenario? Is that those become kind of rolled over and extended? Or do they truly mature and we should just model in some decreases in interest income?\nJoe Margolis: I\u2019m not sure there is a base case. I mean we\u2019re going to handle every loan as it comes up, and I think some will extend, some will get paid off and some will buy the collateral. And grow, I think the attractiveness of the product will remain, and we should continue to be able to make new loans to backfill ones that are maturing in some way or another.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you guys.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks Ki Bin.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. Maybe could you give us some more color on new supply expectations for deliveries this year, but also what are you seeing on starts, timing of construction and how that impacts your longer-term view?\nJoe Margolis: So our data which we look at for our properties, not for the overall development landscape is pretty encouraging. We see about a 30% drop in Extra Space same-store pools that will be affected by new development in 2024. And when you look at all our wholly owned stores, it\u2019s even a larger drop, almost 40%. So new development isn\u2019t going away, we still have to \u2013 the market still has to lease up the ones that were delivered in prior years, but the environment is certainly getting better.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just one more to follow up on move-in rate topics, which has been talked about a lot. I\u2019m wondering if you could just comment on how you expect either EXR and/or the industry to regain pricing power with new customers? Is it housing market related and you need that to pick up? I know you mentioned marketing spend will be up, but what makes this new customer pricing power improve? And is there anything you can do to help it.\nJoe Margolis: So the housing market certainly will help, but it\u2019s not the sole driver of demand for self-storage. I think just people moving more, whether right now, almost half of the people who tell us their storing because they\u2019re moving or moving apartment to apartment. So more transition is just good. The single-family home rental business, the more that grows, I think that\u2019s great. That helps people move in and out of homes without having to buy them without having to worry about a mortgage. So a strong economy is always better than a weak economy and all indications are now that we\u2019re going to have more of a soft landing than a recession. So I think all of those things can help improve customer demand.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Caitlin\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Robin Haneland [ph], filling in for Juan. I just wanted to follow up on how you expect move-out and move-in spreads to trend throughout the year? And what is the spread for Life Storage? And how do you expect that spread to trend?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So we focus as much on occupancy as we do move ins and move outs, and I\u2019ll give you an example. I mean, Life Storage in the quarter and the fourth quarter elevated move-outs due to the auctions, but they also had elevated move-ins. So we\u2019re managing probably more to occupancy than we are moving ins to move-outs, and we are assuming that occupancy is fairly flat throughout this year. On the Extra Space same-store pool, the Life Storage pool, we would expect to close that gap. So we would expect move-ins to be higher than move-outs.\nUnidentified Analyst: And do you feel like you\u2019re ready to reengage in sort of larger external growth at this point? Or are you still focused internally on executing Life Storage?\nJoe Margolis: So we\u2019re absolutely focused on achieving our goals with the Life Storage portfolio. We are also very focused on the testing and efforts we\u2019re making with respect to remote management. I think that will be another big point. We will grow our management business significantly this year. We added not including the LSI assets, we added 225 new managed stores last year. That\u2019s the most we\u2019ve ever added in a year and we have a very significant and robust pipeline there. We\u2019ve talked about the bridge loan program. We\u2019ll continue to grow that. And I think our joint venture partners were somewhat quiet in 2023, but there\u2019s indications that, that will turn around, and that\u2019s great capital-light accretive growth for us. And we\u2019ll certainly get back into that business. So we\u2019re in a position to take advantage of whatever growth that is both strategic and accretive and we\u2019re not afraid to do so.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Joe Margolis for closing remarks.\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thank you. Lots of questions about the overall environment and what our assumptions were for them. And I can\u2019t tell you whether our assumptions are right or wrong. But I do have an extraordinary amount of confidence that no matter what the market conditions our platform and our people are in a position to maximize our performance and take advantage of whatever occurs in the market. So thank you all for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We had a solid fourth quarter where we focused on optimizing the performance of the recently added Life Storage assets while maximizing the performance of the legacy Extra Space locations. We were also very productive on the external growth front adding another 74 third-party managed stores, 8 stores through acquisition and $129 million in bridge loans. Operationally, the Extra Space same-store pool maintained high occupancy and solid in-place rents, driving same-store revenue growth of 0.8% for the quarter. Core FFO in the quarter was $2.02 a share and full year core FFO was $8.10 per share. On our last call, we outlined that in order to reach the high end of our guidance range we would need achieved rates to new customers to improve on a year-over-year basis. While demand was steady and allowed us to maintain strong occupancy, it was not strong enough to eliminate negative new customer rates, which remained at approximately negative 10% during the quarter. As a result, we faced the headwind of higher negative churn, and our full year performance was near the midpoints of our same-store and FFO ranges. Turning to Life Storage. One of the factors in our merger decision was our belief that we could enhance Life Storage property performance through our more sophisticated platform. Seven months removed from closing, we are happy to report that our assumptions have proved true. Customer acceptance of rent increases has been in line with our expectations, and we are seeing the net rent per square foot for legacy Life Storage customers move closer to that of nearby Extra Space locations. Occupancy is also responding positively and we saw the occupancy gap between the LSI and Extra Space Storage same-store pools tightened through the quarter, improving from a gap of 350 basis points at the beginning of the fourth quarter to a gap of 250 basis points at year-end. Today, that gap has tightened further and is approximately 200 basis points. The occupancy improvement together with the benefit of existing customer rent increases resulted in Legacy LSI same-store revenue growth of 1.8%, an acceleration of 80 basis points over the third quarter growth rate. However, similar to the Extra Space properties, we continue to see new customer price sensitivity at the Life Storage locations, resulting in lower-than-anticipated new customer rates. So while we are achieving the anticipated incremental outperformance we expected for the Life Storage assets, reaching full property level synergies is taking longer than anticipated due to current market conditions, which we know will eventually normalize. The current level of demand also influences our outlook for 2024. We are encouraged by our rental velocity, occupancy levels, existing customer health, length of stay and the potential benefits of moderating new supply. However, these factors have not yet led to material improvement in new customer rates. We are confident we can hold strong occupancy and generally maintain current revenue levels, but we believe it will be difficult to drive a reacceleration in revenue growth until we regain pricing power with new customers. We are seeing some positive signs that we are getting closer. And given our strong occupancy levels, when pricing power returns, we are very well positioned to push rates quickly. We just have not seen enough progress to date to feel confident this inflection will be in time for the 2024 leasing season or to include this scenario in our guidance. So, while the industry as a whole will likely face headwinds from lower new customer rates in the near term, the long-term outlook for our sector and for Extra Space specifically remain bright. Storage has consistently proven to be a remarkably durable asset class and Extra Space Storage has the largest and most diverse portfolio in the industry. New supply continues to moderate and the headwinds to future new development are substantial and increasing. We have very strong third-party management and bridge loan pipelines and a robust joint venture program and I am confident in our ability to further scale our capital-light growth activities. We expect to outsize relative growth from our LSI assets in 2024 and with additional synergies to be unlocked as the rental environment improves. And as I mentioned, our occupancy today is over 93% at what is normally our low point for the year. Once demand improves, we are very well positioned to capture it. I will now turn the time over to Scott. So our guidance is really revenue based and new move-in rates to customers are one component we're a little agnostic between occupancy and new move-in rate and ECRI program and promotions and all the various components that go into the revenue assumptions that produce our guidance. As I said and you indicated, we don't see enough now to guide to a strong rebound in the housing market in time for the leasing season. We still see price sensitivity from new customers, although rental demand is good, and we've had a really good start to this year. We don't think interest rates are going to go down in time to have a material impact on the leasing season. So while we don't have a crystal ball, we thought a reasonably prudent guidance would be not to assume that rebound. Sure, Michael. So our strategies are designed to maximize long-term revenue, not to maximize incoming rate or any other metric. And all the testing we do \u2013 that we constantly do shows that to lean into occupancy a little more, lean into acquiring web customers at lower rates because they tend to be the longer-term customers and rely on ECRI produces the best long-term revenue growth. Customers' acceptance of ECRI has not changed at all. We monitor that every month as we send out ECRI notices, and we have not seen any increase in customers vacating the stores because of ECRI. So we believe this strategy is both valid and working. Yes, it's a great question. And I think it's accurate assessment of what's going on. The things we control, like G&A and tenant insurance, we're not only working, but working better, as Scott pointed out in his comments, than underwritten. And we're not done there. We're going to continue to look for further savings in those areas. We're outbidding contracts to get savings from the greater scale that we have now. We're going to continue to work real hard to improve on those numbers. What's also working is that the Life Storage properties do perform better and are trending better on our systems. But the headwind that we face that we don't control is the market conditions, and that is slowing down the achievement of the full underwritten property synergies. So two things are going to happen. The mix of what contributes to the targeted synergies is going to change, and there's going to be less near-term contribution from the properties and more near-term contribution from the other aspects. And depending on where you are in our guidance, it potentially could not occur until after this year. At the high end of our guidance, we'll get real close, and at the lower end of our guidance, we'll fall somewhat short. Yes. The occupancy as of today is 93.1 on the Extra Space same-store pool. And so good news, occupancy delta at the end of the year was a negative delta of 110 basis points. Today, it's a positive 40 basis point delta, so strong rentals in the month of January. Now, the \u2013 maybe the downside of that is it has come a bit at the expensive rate, our new customer rate, we've still found some pushback on rate. Rates in the fourth quarter were down 10%, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, during January, February, they're down about 17%. But to add some context to that, we pushed rates really hard last year. And so we have actually increased rates again this year, December through the end of February, but just not as much as we pushed them last year. So good news is the occupancy is moving in the right direction or at a time of year when you're usually losing occupancy, but it is coming at the expense of new customer rate. I'm referring to actually the new same-store pool, which is slightly different, but the old same-store pool occupancy moved almost the exact same. And that's the Extra Space same-store pool. The life storage legacy pool, the occupancy delta, as I mentioned, as of today, is about 200 basis points, as opposed to at the end of December, it was 250 basis points. So there's not going to be any change in the LSI pool. We're keeping it the exact same. The Extra Space pool, the benefit in revenues this year is going to be about 40 to 50 basis points, similar to what we've seen in the past. And the occupancy delta, as of today, about 30 basis points of that delta is being generated by the change in pool. So it's moved between December and today about 140, 150 basis points and 30 basis points of that is due to the change in pool. Thanks, Todd. Sure. So the New York-New Jersey, MSA market is, I think it's being driven down or negatively impacted by Northern New Jersey. So if you look at the borough, the borough continues to outperform our portfolio as it has for the last three or four quarters. New York was laggard for a while, and now New York markets rotate, and now New York is performing very well. But Northern New Jersey in particular is dragging down the overall MSA performance. Thanks, Samir. Yes, we can, Spenser. So I just want to clarify. There's not minimal new customer demand. We're still renting an awful lot of units every month. It's just that the price sensitivity of those customers is such that we're not successful in pushing prices. Marketing spend \u2013 I'm sorry? Sure. So marketing spend, which is only about 2% of revenue, we really look at as an investment. We're happy to spend or willing to spend the marketing dollars as long as we can get an ROI in those dollars. And we have a metric that we use to make sure we're getting a good return on every marketing dollar we spend. It is slightly higher. That's certainly a factor. We also are using Sparefoot more than we have in the past. It was a lesson we learned from the LSI merger and that has a slightly higher cost. Thanks, Spenser. So the shorter duration customers will typically get a larger ECRI if they came in on some type of promotional or introductory rate. And after that, the longer-term customers typically will get a smaller percentage increase because we're just trying to get them to Street rate. So most of our guidance towards acquisition is already identified and under contract. I think we only have about $50 million in unidentified and I think between now and the end of the year, we'll find $50 million. And if it makes sense, we'll find more. And if it doesn't make sense, we won't do it, right? We have plenty of capital, but we're only going to do things that are accretive to our shareholders. Market cap rate, I think, is a very difficult discussion. Transaction volume is very low, transactions that we see close seem to have a story to them. The last property in a closed-end fund or a family where something happened to the patriarch or matriarch on the property. There doesn't seem to be enough transactions where you can really say this is a market cap rate. So it's a very difficult thing, and I wouldn't want to put a number on it. Yes. I think we will see more changes in Extra Space Storage Express and Life Storage stores as we learn how best to optimize revenue and then optimize NOI at these stores. And we're really trying to learn what is the mix of size of the store, rent per square foot population saturation, distance from another one of our branded stores, prime rates in the area, lots and lot driving distances, lots and factors that we can optimize NOI with a store that has \u2013 is fully staffed, that is partially staffed or that is managerless if you will. And as we learn those lessons, we'll apply it not only to our existing portfolio, but to our acquisition strategy. I mean the only thing I'm really willing to share because some of this, I think, is secret sauce. Is Storage Express had some stores that were fairly large, right? Their average store size was 36,000 square feet, half of our average store size. They had some stores that were 80,000 square feet. And we didn't \u2013 those stores don't make any sense to work on a manager list basis. Sure. So there's \u2013 in general, there's no \u2013 we haven't made any change in frequency for ECRI. Where \u2013 that being said, we're always testing things. So there are outliers. And what was the second question? So, I think different markets are always in different stages, right? I commented earlier on New York being above portfolio performer in 2023, and it was below in 2021 and 2020. Florida was a great market for prior years, and Florida is having more difficulty now. And it's one reason that we believe in a highly diversified portfolio because we want to have exposure to all sorts of markets, markets that are accelerating, decelerating, more flat. Markets that have no exposure to new development, have more exposure to new development or coming out of the development cycle. And by having a highly diversified portfolio, and our portfolio got more diversified with this merger, we think we'll smooth out our returns. So I don't know if I can identify a major market that's accelerating. We certainly have markets like Los Angeles that are still doing very well. But I don't know of a major market that's accelerating. Thanks, Ron. So we've completed the ECRI program for all LSI customers who were customers at closing. So they're now on the normal site. As new customers come in, they'll be on the normal program. I don't think we've seen many busted developments or developments that aren't leasing up as well. They're disappointed developments that look like really attractive opportunities to us, yet I don't think that's meaningful. Thanks, Mike. Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. So the premise of the dual brand strategy was that by having more digital real estate. We would get more clicks and therefore more rentals, and that would pay for the incremental cost of running two brands. So if you think of the Google landscape in three pieces, there's the paid section and we absolutely are having more digital real estate and more clicks there and that's because we pay for it. So that's easy. We knew that would happen. And then the local section in the map, where the map appears, we are seeing more presence there, and that's continuing to improve over time. So that seems to be working as planned. And then the last section, the SEO [ph] section or the organic section, takes time, right. When we buy an individual property, it takes time for us to get that property up to the Extra Space organic standards. So that's moving in the right direction. But we really need more time to see where we'll end up. And if that trade off of more clicks, more rentals, is revenue positive. Thank you. Yes. So part of the increase in bridge loan balances is our plan to hold more of the whole notes and not sell as many A notes. Now that can change as the year unfolds. But the whole bridge loan now is 8.5% to 9%. So we don't feel that's a bad use of capital at this point. The fundamentals of the loans are unchanged. We still will end up to 80% of our underwritten value will take operating reserve and interest reserve that's a recourse obligation to a creditworthy entity. So we know that there's capital to pay the debt service and operate the property. We require that we manage the property. We require an interest rate cap, which is less important now than when we started the program. So the fundamentals of the loan program haven't changed. I'm not sure there is a base case. I mean we're going to handle every loan as it comes up, and I think some will extend, some will get paid off and some will buy the collateral. And grow, I think the attractiveness of the product will remain, and we should continue to be able to make new loans to backfill ones that are maturing in some way or another. Sure. So our data which we look at for our properties, not for the overall development landscape is pretty encouraging. We see about a 30% drop in Extra Space same-store pools that will be affected by new development in 2024. And when you look at all our wholly owned stores, it's even a larger drop, almost 40%. So new development isn't going away, we still have to \u2013 the market still has to lease up the ones that were delivered in prior years, but the environment is certainly getting better. So the housing market certainly will help, but it's not the sole driver of demand for self-storage. I think just people moving more, whether right now, almost half of the people who tell us their storing because they're moving or moving apartment to apartment. So more transition is just good. The single-family home rental business, the more that grows, I think that's great. That helps people move in and out of homes without having to buy them without having to worry about a mortgage. So a strong economy is always better than a weak economy and all indications are now that we're going to have more of a soft landing than a recession. So I think all of those things can help improve customer demand. So we're absolutely focused on achieving our goals with the Life Storage portfolio. We are also very focused on the testing and efforts we're making with respect to remote management. I think that will be another big point. We will grow our management business significantly this year. We added not including the LSI assets, we added 225 new managed stores last year. That's the most we've ever added in a year and we have a very significant and robust pipeline there. We've talked about the bridge loan program. We'll continue to grow that. And I think our joint venture partners were somewhat quiet in 2023, but there's indications that, that will turn around, and that's great capital-light accretive growth for us. And we'll certainly get back into that business. So we're in a position to take advantage of whatever growth that is both strategic and accretive and we're not afraid to do so. Great. Thank you. Lots of questions about the overall environment and what our assumptions were for them. And I can't tell you whether our assumptions are right or wrong. But I do have an extraordinary amount of confidence that no matter what the market conditions our platform and our people are in a position to maximize our performance and take advantage of whatever occurs in the market. So thank you all for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe. And hello, everyone. Our results were generally in line with our expectations with a few exceptions. As Joe already covered, lower new customer rates caused revenue growth to come in modestly below our internal estimate. The revenue mix was partially offset by lower-than-expected property taxes. We also had a beat from G&A savings, partially offset by lower than modeled tenant insurance. All of our other income and expense line items were generally in line with our forecast. As of January 1, we have completed the migration of the Life Storage customers to our tenant insurance program, and we believe we will achieve $16 million in synergies from tenant insurance, exceeding our original estimate by $4 million in 2024. Our G&A run rate from Q4 and is lower than our expected 2024 full year run rate as we continued hiring during the fourth quarter, and we have some G&A seasonality. We now expect to realize 2024 G&A synergies of $39 million, an increase of $16 million over our original forecast of $23 million. Turning to the balance sheet, we completed a $600 million bond offering in the fourth quarter and another $600 million bond offering in the first quarter of 2024. We have used the proceeds from these offerings to pay off the $1 billion variable rate bridge loan we obtained in conjunction with the closing of Life Storage. Our only remaining 2024 loan maturities can be extended at our option, and we have plenty of dry powder if opportunities arise in the market. In last night's earnings release, we provided our 2024 outlook for both the Extra Space and legacy Life Storage same-store pools. We have provided wider same-store revenue and NOI ranges to capture the different scenarios we believe are possible given the unusual 2023 comparables and uncertainty around new customer pricing. With interest rates potentially remaining higher for longer, our guidance does not assume a material improvement in the housing market during the summer leasing season. For the EXR same-store pool, our same-store revenue guidance is negative 2% to positive 0.5%. Our expense growth range is 4% to 5.5% driven by marketing, insurance and property taxes resulting in an NOI range of negative 4.25% to negative 0.5%. For the legacy LSI same-store pool, we expect stronger property-level growth with same-store revenue ranging from 2% to 4.5%. We expect outsized expense growth at the LSI stores in 2024, especially in the first half of the year. This will be driven by higher payroll as we have brought the LSI stores back to full staffing levels. We expect additional expense pressure on repairs and maintenance, property taxes and property insurance, resulting in a range of 6.25% to 7.75% yielding a life storage same-store NOI range of negative 0.25% to positive 4%. Our core FFO range for 2024 is $7.85 and to $8.15 per share and assumes the full year impact of the shares and debt added through the Life Storage merger. And with that, Liz, let's open it up for questions Yes, Lizzy, maybe to add a little bit more color to Joe's comments, our guidance, the base case assumes that we do have sequential rate growth on a month over month basis from now into our leasing season, but just not enough to necessarily close that negative gap that we're experiencing today. Yes. So as we were preparing our guidance and preparing our annual budget, the SOFR curve was moving around pretty quite a bit. We saw moving almost every day. So we picked a point in time that had an average of 4.75. That was approved probably 1.5 weeks ago is when we finalized and we figure it will move throughout the year, but that's the assumption we made in our guidance. Thanks, Lizzy. Yes. Hey Todd, it's Scott. So a couple of things, one is the occupancy delta. So mid-summer last year you were 400 basis points difference between the two pools. When we ended the year, we are 250 basis points different. Today, we're about 200 basis points different. Through February, we've continued to increase occupancy at the Life Storage properties at a time when we were clearing up some auctions, so during the fourth quarter, we had quite a few auctions there, and so you had more churn than is normally happening. On the positive side, at those stores, we have seen customers accept the ECRIs and they have actually moved out at a slightly lower rate than the Extra Space customers receiving ECRIs. So that's the good news. The thing that has been a bit of a headwind has been the current market conditions. And so we do expect the occupancy gap to close here in this rental season, and we expect to start closing the rate gap also. Today, their stores are priced as much as 10% lower than the Extra Space stores. And as that occupancy gap closes, we would expect to close that gap also. Yes. So the Extra Space pool, the midpoint 4.75% includes an increase of payroll that is inflationary to slightly plus, but call it, 3%. Biggest line item in terms of dollar increase is marketing, which includes its upper teens in terms of increase year-over-year. And we're expecting to continue to have to spend on the marketing we saw that increase as we moved through 2023. Property taxes are between 2% and 3% and then tenant insurance is the biggest line item with closer to 20%, I'm sorry, property and casualty insurance is closer to 20%. We would expect it to be somewhat of a bell curve with less negative churn in the summer months than today. This is kind of the depths of that negative churn, end of the year till end of February. And that's that negative 35% that you saw in our subs. But we would expect it to go more similar. And we hope to get rate power. We hope to flatten that out somewhat. This is the \u2013 sorry, sorry, Joe. This is the impact of last year's lease up assets, including certificate of occupancy and this year. So it's things that aren't in the same-store pool, basically. Thanks, Nick. It's property tax appeals, so it's successful appeals. And so you had negative expense effectively in some of those stores. Thanks, Spenser. So depending on where you are in the range of that, rates do go up and we do assume that they'll move in the right direction. And we are seeing that as you move throughout the year, the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter is a normal time when you do see rent per square foot tick down, that's not odd. You saw that in the portfolio. It was also impacted a bit by some of the churn from auctions. But as we move into January, February, we are seeing that rent gap continue to close and move in the right direction. Yes. So that actually comes from multiple years. So some of those C of Os are from 2022 C of Os, 2023 C of Os, 2024 C of Os, certificate of occupancy deals. It's basically as they get up to the run rate of a stabilized property. And so it's not just 2024 dilution and 2024 adds, it's multiple year. All we're trying to show there is the potential upside if we were to stop adding to that portfolio or to that pool of properties. Thanks, Eric. The cadence. And Ron, I think the best way to look at that is it depends a little bit on where you are in the guidance. So if you are at the bottom end of the guidance, that obviously is going to imply that you're negative for longer \u2013 midpoint, you're negative. Even at the top end of guidance, it does imply that you do stick slightly negative for a period of time. But I think in none of those scenarios do we have kind of the Nike Swoosh [ph], so to speak, where you see rapid acceleration. And the concept there is, we have so many customers moving in each month at lower rates that it does take some time to move those rates up and to really start seeing that accelerate. So even if you did get pricing power this summer, the benefit of those pricing \u2013 of those customers wouldn't necessarily impact you until later in the year as they got rate increases and into next year. So the synergies are assuming that the $180 million and not the lower number, the number that you saw in the fourth quarter, they would have been even greater than the 39 million that we referred to if we were able to achieve the fourth quarter run rate. Now, that doesn't mean we're done there. I think that we're going to continue to look for opportunities. That number in the fourth quarter was just a fair amount under due to some transition of employees and hiring and timing. And when we brought things on, as well know there is some seasonality to our G&A with the fourth quarter not being the highest quarter. So it's difficult to break it out exactly. I think that we are saying we don't expect to get significant growth in street rates. They will be the midpoint. We do expect occupancy to be relatively flat. But we don't feel like it's helpful to necessarily break those out since there's one component of the total model, but we are not expecting significant street rate power this year. Sequentially, we do expect them to go up month-over-month. I think it will depend a little bit on how this leasing season goes. I think that we were disappointed last year. We were at a point last year where we raised rates significantly January through March. And then the leasing season came and the housing, the lack of home sales, I think, impacted last year. And so I think that we're a little gun shy and don't want to make that mistake again. Thanks Ki Bin. Thanks, Caitlin Yes. So we focus as much on occupancy as we do move ins and move outs, and I'll give you an example. I mean, Life Storage in the quarter and the fourth quarter elevated move-outs due to the auctions, but they also had elevated move-ins. So we're managing probably more to occupancy than we are moving ins to move-outs, and we are assuming that occupancy is fairly flat throughout this year. On the Extra Space same-store pool, the Life Storage pool, we would expect to close that gap. So we would expect move-ins to be higher than move-outs. Thanks, Robin."

Please be advised as being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Norman. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Norman: Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review.  Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, November 8, 2023. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call.  I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoseph Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We had a busy third quarter. In July, we successfully completed our merger with Life Storage adding over 1,200 stores to our portfolio and over 2,300 new members to team Extra Space. The transition is going very smoothly, and I am proud of the teamwork and innovation our employees are demonstrating through the merger.  Our combined portfolio of 3,651 stores provides greater diversification, stability, revenue opportunities, operational efficiencies that I believe will improve our property level and external growth for years to come. From a performance standpoint, the third quarter was generally in line with expectations. Revenue growth moderation for the Extra Space same-store pool flattened meaningfully during the third quarter and our 1.9% same-store revenue increase was modestly ahead of our expectations. Revenue growth was driven by high average occupancy in the quarter of 94.4%. Existing customer behavior continued to be strong with solid length of stay, muted vacates and continued acceptance of rate increases.  Rental volume was also steady year-over-year, albeit at lower new customer rates. Expenses came in higher than our estimates, offsetting the revenue outperformance. This was driven by higher-than-expected property tax increases. The higher-than-projected expenses resulted in a modest miss in our same-store NOI, which was offset by a beat in G&A, resulting in core FFO of $2.02. This was in line with our internal forecast. Short-term dilution from the merger with LSI was consistent with our estimates for the third quarter. We have achieved our target G&A synergy run rate of $23 million and we'll continue to gain additional synergies as we further integrate the team, platform and portfolio.  We have also started a property level revenue synergies as we move existing LSI customers to rates more consistent with the Extra Space portfolio. The incremental FFO contribution from these improvements is partially offset initially by lower occupancy at the LSI properties due to catch up auctions and lower new customer rates to drive rental demand. However, once we achieve stronger new customer rates and build occupancy, the benefit to FFO will ramp up and we remain confident we will reach our total expected synergy run rate in the first quarter of 2024.  We have slowed our acquisition pace given the LSI merger, but we continue to be very active in third-party management, adding 49 new stores gross in the third quarter, not including the LSI managed stores. Year-to-date, outside of the LSI merger, we have added 151 stores gross to the managed platform with only 17 departures. We have also continued to have steady bridge loan volume despite the difficult interest rate environment.  In short, property level performance is in line with expectations. The integration of the Life Storage properties is on track, and we continue to be active in our capital-light external growth channels. As a result, we have tightened our annual core FFO guidance for 2023, maintaining the same midpoint. We will remain focused on maximizing performance at all of our stores and executing our integration plan in the fourth quarter. As we have interacted with our shareholders throughout the quarter, it has been hard to miss the serious concerns people have about wars, the economy, interest rates, consumer health, sector demand and our stock price. We absolutely share those concerns.  That said, I think it is important to step back and not lose sight of where we stand today. Storage has consistently proven to be a remarkably durable asset class and Extra Space Storage has the largest and most diverse portfolio in the industry. Occupancy averaged over 94% in the quarter, and it remains very healthy. New customer rates, while not as strong as last year, remained 12% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels and customer health remains strong. New supply continues to moderate and the headwinds to future new development are substantial and increasing. Our external growth drivers continue to fire on all cylinders, and I am confident in our ability to further scale our platform. And finally, I believe we have the strongest team and operating platform in the industry. It is still a great time to be in storage, and I believe the future of Extra Space remains very bright.  I will now turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we would characterize the third quarter as in line, meeting our internal FFO projections, the modest miss in property NOI due to higher noncontrollable expenses was offset by beats in interest income and G&A. Achieved rates to new customers were down an average of 11.8% year-over-year in the third quarter, gapping widest in August and tightening modestly in September and further in October to a negative 10.8%. Given the easier September and October comps, we would have liked to have seen that gap narrow more, but we continue to have a headwind from new customer rates. Fortunately, lower year-over-year vacates and strong existing customer health continues to more than offset the headwind and revenue performance as a whole continues to hold up. Weighing these factors as we forecast revenue for the fourth quarter, new customer rate improvement hasn't been compelling enough for us to raise the high end of our same-store revenue guidance range, but existing customer performance has been steady enough to remove our most cautious scenarios from our full year revenue guide. As a result, we increased the bottom end of our same-store revenue by 25 basis points to a range of 2.75% to 3.5% for the full year. On the expense front, we felt greater-than-expected pressure from property taxes, primarily in Georgia and Florida. We also had significant increases in property insurance premiums. We updated our annual same-store expense guidance to recognize actual expenses as well as a higher run rate for property taxes resulting in a revised same-store expense range of 4% to 5% for the full year. This results in a tightening of the same-store NOI range of 25 basis points both [Technical Difficulty] the low end of the range, maintaining a midpoint of 2.75%.  Turning to the balance sheet. We drew on our line of credit and an undrawn term loan of $1 billion to pay closing costs and to retire Life Storage's debt that we did not assume. With the merger, we assume $2.4 billion in Life Storage's publicly traded bonds at the same coupons and maturities. With the assumption of these bonds mark the debt to market, and we have broken out the noncash interest expense, which has been added back to core FFO.  Upon completion of the merger and the assumption of debt, S&P Global upgraded its credit rating on Extra Space to BBB+, which will drive future interest expense savings for the company. Details to our updated debt stack and revised interest rate spreads on our credit facility are included in our supplemental.  Last quarter, we provided freestanding guidance for Extra Space Storage and then provided separate details related to the anticipated dilution associated with the merger. In last night's earnings release, we updated our 2023 FFO guidance ranges for the combined portfolio. The same-store performance ranges I previously referenced applied to the Extra Space same-store pool as we have not added the Life Storage properties to the pool. Separate disclosures related to the performance of the Life Storage stores are included in our supplemental financials. Our core FFO range, which includes the short-term dilutive impact of the LSI merger as well as an add-back for transaction and transition expenses was tightened to $8.05 to $8.20 per share, maintaining the previous midpoint. We have also provided updates to key assumptions for the combined company.  As Joe mentioned, our performance was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter and the integration of Life Storage remains on track. We continue to believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in the REIT space. We believe our operating platform and highly diversified portfolio has become even stronger through the Life Storage merger and it is positioned for outsized future growth.  And with that, Kevin, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Your updated same-store revenue outlook implies positive fourth quarter same-store revenue growth of 0.8% at the midpoint. And you took the low end of the full year guidance range up slightly. So should we interpret the increase in guidance is confidence that you will hit this range? And what have you seen from street rates in October and expect in November and December to meet this range.\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Michael, your assumptions are correct. It does imply at the midpoint that it's positive for the entire quarter. And we obviously have October, largely we know what October was. And so we're confident that we should hit those numbers.\nMichael Goldsmith: My next question is about how Life Storage portfolio is responding to the Extra Space strategy in part of the revenue synergies from the deal is based on the ability to roll out the Extra Space, rental growth algorithm. So can you walk through how the Life Storage customer is responding to lower street rates and also how the Life Storage customer is responding to the elevated ECRIs?\nJoseph Margolis: Great question. So the short answer is everything is going as planned. We have begun sending out the ECRI notices to the Life Storage customers, and they are accepting them at the same rate or maybe even slightly better rate than Extra Space customers. We have headwinds of catch-up auctions and the slightly elevated vacates from the CRI notices, the occupancy on the LSI portfolio. So we have discounted rates on the web, in particular, to protect that occupancy while we do that. And that's been very successful, and we've actually seen a slight uptick in occupancy in the LSI portfolio. So we're really happy with how the strategy is playing out, and we continue to monitor it and make sure there's no bumps in the road.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: Joe, you mentioned that as you're integrating and now operating the LSI assets you're using street rate to build up that occupancy. How should we think about that over the coming months? How long will that take place? And given the existing overlap with the EXR portfolio, is that creating some of the drag, let's say, on street rate in markets?\nJoseph Margolis: So I might describe it a little differently. We're using rate, I think, to protect occupancy more. We don't really expect to make significant gains in occupancy until we're done correcting the rates and getting through the auctions. So we gained some occupancy, but it's certainly not spiking, and we probably don't expect that until next rental season. With respect to effect on Extra Space stores, that's very market specific, and I don't think very significant.\nJeffrey Spector: And then on the existing customer, you mentioned again the strength there. Can you characterize pricing power today versus, let's say, 6 months ago? And then can you quantify the length of stay versus the vacates?\nJoseph Margolis: So I don't think pricing power to new customers is significantly different than 6 months ago. And I guess I'd say the same thing about pricing power to existing customers, which is very strong. It is also the same, right? We're not seeing a greater amount of ECRI induced vacates. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?\nJeffrey Spector: If you were able to quantify the vacates versus the length of stay?\nJoseph Margolis: I'm not sure I understand the question.\nJeffrey Spector: Where is length of stay today? You had mentioned that the length of stay remains strong and vacates are down.\nJoseph Margolis: I should understood what you were saying. So lots of different ways to measure length of stay. Our average in-place customer is about 34.4 months, which is up a month year-over-year. Our existing customers who have been in the store for 12 months is 61%. That's done a little bit as we continue to normalize from those COVID highs at that metric. We've also lost a little bit of our 24-month customers. That's about 45% now, but still higher than pre-COVID. Is that helpful?\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Truist Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst: So in the quarter, you showed an improved pace of same-store revenue and same-store NOI deceleration. Is that because of easier comps? Or do you think rates have somewhat stabilized at current levels? I'm just trying to better understand if this improves deceleration is sustainable? Or if we should expect a steeper deceleration in 2024?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So comps throughout this year have gotten easier as we've moved through. In terms of how it came out versus what we were expecting, it was pretty similar to what we were expecting. As we mentioned earlier, we don't expect things to go negative in the fourth quarter and that sets us up for what we hope to be a good 2024.  I think our occupancy is holding up well and not going negative, I think, is a positive thing.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then shifting gears a little bit. Can you talk about or can you give us your thoughts around your balance sheet and your variable rate debt. Right now, approximately 30% of your debt is variable. Do you have any plans to decrease your exposure there? Or are you planning on keeping the portion of [indiscernible] that where it is?\nScott Stubbs: So our variable rate debt actually ticked up slightly in the quarter as we completed the merger. With the merger, we had to pay off some fixed rate debt. You had private placement bonds on Life Storage that weren't allowed to be prepaid. To do that, we've used a bridge loan, a $1 billion bridge, that's a 2-year loan, and we will be terming that out over the next 1 to 2 years. So we will be bringing that down. If you look at our variable rate debt net of the variable rate borrowings, it's about 75%. But again, we'll be bringing those down, variable receivables.\nOperator: Next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is A.J. on for Todd. Real quick, could you just provide an occupancy update for October and what that looks like year-over-year?\nScott Stubbs: For the two portfolios, Extra Space, the same-store ended October at 93.9%. It's a 1% gap from where we were last year. The Life Storage occupancy is 90.8% compared to last year, and that has actually narrowed the gap slightly. Our occupancy calculation is slightly different than the way Life Storage calculated. We're going with this calculation going forward as they excluded or made adjustments that we don't make on an ongoing basis.\nUnidentified Analyst: And what is that year-over-year?\nScott Stubbs: It's narrowing and I actually don't have last years in front of me right now.\nJoseph Margolis: We haven't adjusted last year's like storage occupancy to reflect our methodology.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good to know. And then my second question. So you provided a little color around the $100 million of synergies. You noted that you have met the $23 million in G&A synergies. We see some gains in tenant insurance. How should we think about the opportunity to meet or exceed the $100 million guidance over the next several months?\nJoseph Margolis: So I think we have a significant opportunity to exceed the G&A synergy of $23 million. Our original guidance for that was $140 million. Our original Extra Space guidance at the beginning of the year before this merger was contemplated. Our current midpoint guidance for G&A is $150 million. So it's not quite $10 million every 6 months of additional G&A because we closed the merger on July 20. G&A is not smooth. G&A is higher in the first quarter. It's not perfectly spread out through the 4 quarters. And we still have some hiring to do to fill in some spots. But clearly, we're going to be ahead of our $23 million run rate.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then on the tenant insurance synergies, how much more upside do you see there? And can you -- as you continue to transition the LSI customer to [indiscernible] policy and pricing?\nJoseph Margolis: So we've achieved very little of that synergy because the only extra space tenant insurance policies, we're selling now are to new customers. Existing customers will not convert from the Life Storage insurance policy to the Extra Space insurance policy until starting January 1 of 2024, and that was for both regulatory and contractual reasons. But that will be somewhat of a light switch, right? We'll send out the notice, people get them and beyond the extra space policy, which is more robust in terms of coverage but also has a higher premium.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted to kind of piggyback on a couple of questions that have already been asked. I guess on the sequential deceleration that it moderated in the third quarter, it's expected to moderate even further. Should we think that, that continues into 2024 as you stand here today based on what you know and I'm not asking you to give 24 guidance. But I guess what the market is really wondering is have we passed the worst particularly given where comps are as we look into '24. Just curious on your thoughts on what you could share there.\nScott Stubbs: Okay. If you look at our deceleration through the year, I mean we've clearly moderated that deceleration. Our fourth quarter guidance implies that it continues fairly flat from where we are today. 2024 will be ready, obviously, to give the full year guidance in February. But I think we're set up to be -- we're in a good spot. We'd like to see new customer rates get stronger, but existing customers are holding up very well. In 2024 also has easier comps compared to what we had this year.\nJuan Sanabria: And then can I just ask on the LSI occupancy front is part of the synergies that you guys are assuming that you're able to make up the difference in occupancy between the EXR and LSI portfolio? And I guess -- if so, what does that entail doing to close that gap? Or are you happy keeping the portfolio is running at different occupancy levels. Just curious on how that should evolve.\nJoseph Margolis: So I'll tell you how we underwrote the transaction to get to underwritten synergies and really how we get there, mix of occupancy and revenue, we don't really care as much as long as we get the dollars. So at underwriting, we observed on average a 2% gap in occupancy and about a 15% gap in rate and to get to our $65 million of property synergies, we underwrote 0 improvement in occupancy and about a 7% improvement in rate. So our opportunity to do better is to achieve better than those assumptions. Sorry for [indiscernible] audience.\nJuan Sanabria: I guess this is a quick. So would you want to discount further at LSI to close that gap? Or are you happy kind of running two different occupancies across the different portfolios [Technical Difficulty].\nJeffrey Norman: Thank you, everybody, for your patience. One, I'm not sure where you lost a in the middle of Joe's response. Could you give us a reprompting before we answer the question?\nJuan Sanabria: Sure. My addendum was is the goal to close eventually that occupancy gap? Or are you happy, I guess, running different levels of occupancy across the 2 portfolios?\nJoseph Margolis: So the portfolios will be run on the same platform, right, despite the 2 brands, it's going to be the same customer acquisition systems, the same pricing algorithms, the same sales process. So eventually, the two portfolio should run very similarly. We don't have a strategy of running a higher occupancy, Extra Space store and a lower occupancy Life Storage store. Everything is going to be run on one platform to maximize revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway from Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: I know you commented in your opening remarks that you're focused on your asset-light initiatives right now. But can you just walk through where you're seeing specifically the best returns in terms of your use of capital right now?\nJoseph Margolis: So the best returns on capital continues to be a redevelopment of existing stores. Those returns are high single, low double-digit returns. You can add units where you already own the land, you already have the office, you already have entitlements and we are very excited to now have 1,200 more stores to look at and try to find additional opportunities to put storage in parking lots or make single stores storage, multistory storage. The challenge with those are they're relatively small in terms of dollar investment, so you have to do a lot of them, but we have a team and a process and a program and we expect to do a lot more of those in the future. Another bridge loan program also provides very high return on capital. The whole note rate is 10% now, average is 10% now. And when we sell the A note, the rate on the B notes is into the teens and that does not include the economic benefit of managing the property, which we lend on. So that also is a very good use of capital, particularly because we can control the capital by selling or not selling the A note.\nSpenser Allaway: And then do you have a sense for ESR assets that are now in a competing radius of newly acquired LSI assets, you have a sense of what the average delta would be for the in-place rents for the EXR versus the legacy LSI assets? \nJoseph Margolis: So I think our best sense is one of the ways we underwrote this transaction is. We identified 106 or 109 LSI stores that had one or more extra space store that was in a very tight geographical radius was a similar type store in terms of single-story drive-up or multistory and we felt was a truly competitive store. And at the time of underwriting, the delta in rate was about 15% for those stores.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you on the LSI portfolio, you mentioned a number of catch-up options. And just it I guess, a little less familiar with that. I'm just wondering, is that a significant part of the portfolio? Will that make a significant difference, I guess, as those customers are, I guess, cleared out who are nonpaying and putting in new customers?\nJoseph Margolis: I mean it's a standard practice when we buy a store not to rely on the prior owner's auction process because we don't caught up in a noncompliant auction. So we start the auction process over again, and that leads to a several month lag. So we have several months of units, nonpaying units, we have to auction out, recover those units, and we let them. It it's temporary and in the overall scheme of things, I think not significant, although it does provide some occupancy pressure in the short run.\nSmedes Rose: [indiscernible] picking over. Yes, sorry go ahead.\nScott Stubbs: As you say me, it doesn't really impact your bad debt either because you've already accrued the bad debt reserve. So there's no impact there, but it does impact occupancy.\nSmedes Rose: And then I just -- you mentioned higher property taxes in the quarter. And I just -- as you -- the larger expense lines just looking into next year is there -- so we're broad sense of how we might be thinking about wages and benefits for pace of growth slowing at all? Is it maybe what are you thinking about for kind of the pace of tax property tax increases? Any sort of thoughts there you could share?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So we actually thought it had decreased some in the 6-month numbers. I think we were looking pretty good. We won some appeals. We were a little bit surprised on how our actuals came in for Florida and Georgia and Illinois versus the estimates we've made using property tax consultants. We hope that the worst of the property tax reassessments are behind us, but every year is a new year with the local municipalities.\nSmedes Rose: And on wages and benefits, how is that pacing?\nScott Stubbs: Wages and benefits, we've actually had it slow some. We don't see the wage pressure that we saw the last couple of years. We saw higher slightly earlier in the year as we had more hours compared to prior years when it was difficult to hire. Today, it's much easier to hire. Our applicant flow is significantly better and we're not seeing the wage pressure we've seen over the last couple of years.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just two quick ones for me. Just going back to the same-store revenue number of close to 1% in 4Q, is the messaging -- I think this got asked earlier, but is the messaging that essentially, unless you sort of see things take a turn to the downside wouldn't expect that number to get sort of worse going into next year? Or is it sort of still wait and see? I'm just trying to figure out if 4Q is sort of a good run rate looking forward from here without asking for guidance.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So we think it's a good run rate, the estimate we've given for the quarter. Obviously, October is done. It's too early to tell for next year.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then doubling back on the sort of the expense line items. Obviously, you took the same-store up for EXR. I see sort of LSI at 4.5% as well. Maybe can you talk about just doubling down on whether it's marketing expenses or insurance. Is there anything either one timing in nature this year that we should be mindful of? Or are these sort of decent run rates.\nScott Stubbs: So why storage, the big increase year-over-year came from more personnel and the payroll line item. Our managers, on average, make more, and we have more hours allocated to us, and that's how we get the premium rates that we get. So we are operating them more like we operate our stores. The other thing that's different from their historical same-store numbers is we have allocated call center and a technology charge to the stores that they historically had in their G&A. So we went back to their historical numbers and added those in, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: I was wondering maybe -- I don't think anybody's asked about supply yet. So we've seen it fall off in other sectors, new starts. So I was wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing now? Have you noticed any projects either getting -- taking longer, getting pushed out or any new ones getting started, just kind of what you're seeing on the new supply side.\nJoseph Margolis: Sure, great question. So we continue to see moderation in new supply. The peak was maybe 2018 and every year since then, it's moderated. We expect deliveries in 2023 to be kind of similar to 2022. But after that, likely to be more moderation. The headwinds to new supply in terms of interest rates and debt capital, equity capital, availability, construction costs, entitlement period, underwriting forward revenue growth are pretty significant and drop our rates for projects that you can see on yard and all those other reports are really high and a lot of projects we see in these reports end up not getting built.\nCaitlin Burrows: And just to that last point, would you say that the dropout rate is more significant today than it has been in like the past? Because of maybe those factors you mentioned?\nJoseph Margolis: Many of us were at a conference in New York a couple of weeks ago where one of the leading brokers in the industry said, he thinks the dropout rate is 70% to 90%. I don't have the statistics for that, but that's an observation from someone who's very, very close to the industry.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And then maybe just a quick 1 on the transaction side. You mentioned that EXR has pulled out recently, especially to focus on merger, which makes sense. I guess, could you comment more broadly on the transaction market? Kind of our properties trading have cap rates stabilized? Has the bid-ask spread close? Or is it still pretty quiet in storage also?\nJoseph Margolis: Yes, I would characterize it as quiet. There are very few transactions that we see end up making many transactions. People bring our portfolios and they don't end up transacting. That's an indication of a bid-ask spread. And the transactions we do see that happen. There's it seems to be some story either on the buyer side, why it was a special buy for them or on the seller side. But I don't think there's enough of a market where I could tell you what market cap rates are. It's just very quiet and very circumstantial.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.\nSamir Khanal: Joe, when I look at some of your top markets, the Texas markets, Florida, they're holding up quite well this year and from a revenue growth perspective? And I guess how are you thinking about those Sunbelt markets into next year, the markets which got a boost in the last few years? I mean, do they give back in '24? How are you thinking about that?\nJoseph Margolis: There's two things, I think, to think about. One is maybe 3 things. One is job growth. Job growth is maybe the #1 indicator of storage performance. And those Sunbelt markets still have job growth, and that's an important factor. On the flip side, when a market has a couple of years of 20%, 30% plus revenue growth, it's really difficult to keep up. So it may look like it's giving back because it's not growing as fast, but it's still a healthy market, and it's just coming up against a tough comp. And then lastly, which is a little bit of the wildcard is the housing market. I firmly believe the housing market will come back. It's got two people can't stay in their houses forever, life events happen, just when and how quickly is going to be a factor that will inform our performance next year.\nSamir Khanal: And then just as a follow-up from prior questions. You mentioned the 15% gap I think, between rents for the LSI and the XR portfolio on underwriting. And I just want to clarify, did you say the gap is about 7% today?\nJoseph Margolis: No, I said we underwrote 7% to achieve our underwritten synergies. So we underwrote not closing the occupancy gap at all and only closing about half of the rate gap and that if we can do those 2 things, that will give us our $65 million synergies from the properties.\nSamir Khanal: And then finally, on just maybe ECRIs. I mean, how much has that pace of, I guess, increases moderated at this point? I mean I'm just trying to think if you have macro conditions that sort of stay similar as it is, I mean, do you think that moderates further in '24. How are you thinking about that?\nJoseph Margolis: Maybe not as much as might be -- we might assume because one of the big drivers of ECRI is the gap between the discounted web rate. The customer comes in and the actual market rate for that unit. So while we're in a period of time now where we're offering significant discounts for customers to come into the web that gives us the opportunity to catch them up to ECRI and get them to what the true market rate is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: I'm curious, what are the early observations on operating 2 brands versus 1 brand so far?\nJoseph Margolis: So it's very early. We don't have any firm conclusions. I think the most important thing that we see is we have increased our digital footprint. So when you're in one of those saturated markets where we're operating 2 brands and you search for storage near me or whatever generic storage starts to use. You will find both Extra Space and Life Storage branded stores come up on the search, sometimes also a Storage Express store. So we are getting more digital real estate. That's kind of the main assumption to the success of the program, but it's very early, and we have quite a ways to go before we can draw definitive conclusions.\nMichael Mueller: And then maybe one other quick expense question. And I know this isn't a huge line item in the grand scheme of things. But the growth in insurance expenses, how should we think about that over the next few years in terms of how outsized they could be or relative to the overall expense pool?\nScott Stubbs: I think it will bend a little bit on claims. You had a really rough year in Florida this past year. Overall, if you had -- anything wind related in Florida saw a 100-plus percent increase in lots of areas. So I think it will depend some on events that happen but you've also seen a rise in interest rate caused those pools not to be as deep as they found other sources to put other places and put that money. So making sure that we have competitive bids, adding the Life Storage properties will help us because we have a new group of insurers that we haven't used in the past. And so hopefully, we should be able to bring that down and not see the kind of increases we've seen in this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolf Research.\nKeegan Carl: I guess maybe first on occupancy, where do you expect your year-over-year occupancy delta various last year to trend for the balance of the year?\nScott Stubbs: We're assuming about a 100 basis point gap through this year. And then obviously, moving into 2024, I think that gap gets easier.\nKeegan Carl: And then shifting gears here, I feel like these 2 platforms have kind of gotten shuffle just given the Life Storage. I'm just curious if you could provide any update on the Bar Gold and storage Express platforms. What are you guys seeing as far as internal and external growth opportunities?\nJoseph Margolis: Sure. So Bar Gold, I would say, is glasses half full and half empty. The half full is we've done a really, really good job of institutionalizing and integrating the operations there. We're significantly outperforming budget on the expense side, where I think we have more wood to chop is the growth side of that. We are growing bar gold at historical rates at the rates that bar gold grew before we bought it. and we really want to turn some attention to that and try to grow it at a faster rate. Some of that, I think, is just us getting to know the business, getting to know the people and understanding it and some of it is, frankly, attention on Storage Express and then Life Storage. Storage Express is -- I think we made a lot of progress. It was actually, in some ways, harder to integrate Storage Express because it was a different platform, a different way of doing business. I mean we got all of the 1,200 Life Stores on our operating platform breeze in 19 days. It took us 6 months with 107 Storage Express stores because it's a different way of operating. There's just different software systems procedures. So we're doing very well on the integration front. We have bought several small remotely managed stores in our traditional markets, not in the more rural markets they operate in. They trade at 7% yield. So we feel they're good purchases. And we're learning a lot. We're learning about exactly what should be a remote store partially manned. What are the various attributes, distance from an Extra Space store population, rent per square foot saturation that makes it work and makes it doesn't work. We have opened up our third-party management platform. We've just signed up a 60-property portfolio to be run remotely. We have a large, large pipeline of remotely managed stores for our Management Plus platform. So I think similar to Bar Gold, the growth of that platform was slowed by our attention to the Life Storage deal. We used that time to learn things, which I think is good. And as we move forward, I expect that growth to accelerate.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe Margolis for any closing remarks.\nJoseph Margolis: Great. Thank you, everyone, for your time today. I hope the message was clear that things are going as expected. Our integration is realization of synergies are proceeding very well, and we look forward to seeing many, many of you in Los Angeles next week. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We had a busy third quarter. In July, we successfully completed our merger with Life Storage adding over 1,200 stores to our portfolio and over 2,300 new members to team Extra Space. The transition is going very smoothly, and I am proud of the teamwork and innovation our employees are demonstrating through the merger.  Our combined portfolio of 3,651 stores provides greater diversification, stability, revenue opportunities, operational efficiencies that I believe will improve our property level and external growth for years to come. From a performance standpoint, the third quarter was generally in line with expectations. Revenue growth moderation for the Extra Space same-store pool flattened meaningfully during the third quarter and our 1.9% same-store revenue increase was modestly ahead of our expectations. Revenue growth was driven by high average occupancy in the quarter of 94.4%. Existing customer behavior continued to be strong with solid length of stay, muted vacates and continued acceptance of rate increases.  Rental volume was also steady year-over-year, albeit at lower new customer rates. Expenses came in higher than our estimates, offsetting the revenue outperformance. This was driven by higher-than-expected property tax increases. The higher-than-projected expenses resulted in a modest miss in our same-store NOI, which was offset by a beat in G&A, resulting in core FFO of $2.02. This was in line with our internal forecast. Short-term dilution from the merger with LSI was consistent with our estimates for the third quarter. We have achieved our target G&A synergy run rate of $23 million and we'll continue to gain additional synergies as we further integrate the team, platform and portfolio.  We have also started a property level revenue synergies as we move existing LSI customers to rates more consistent with the Extra Space portfolio. The incremental FFO contribution from these improvements is partially offset initially by lower occupancy at the LSI properties due to catch up auctions and lower new customer rates to drive rental demand. However, once we achieve stronger new customer rates and build occupancy, the benefit to FFO will ramp up and we remain confident we will reach our total expected synergy run rate in the first quarter of 2024.  We have slowed our acquisition pace given the LSI merger, but we continue to be very active in third-party management, adding 49 new stores gross in the third quarter, not including the LSI managed stores. Year-to-date, outside of the LSI merger, we have added 151 stores gross to the managed platform with only 17 departures. We have also continued to have steady bridge loan volume despite the difficult interest rate environment.  In short, property level performance is in line with expectations. The integration of the Life Storage properties is on track, and we continue to be active in our capital-light external growth channels. As a result, we have tightened our annual core FFO guidance for 2023, maintaining the same midpoint. We will remain focused on maximizing performance at all of our stores and executing our integration plan in the fourth quarter. As we have interacted with our shareholders throughout the quarter, it has been hard to miss the serious concerns people have about wars, the economy, interest rates, consumer health, sector demand and our stock price. We absolutely share those concerns.  That said, I think it is important to step back and not lose sight of where we stand today. Storage has consistently proven to be a remarkably durable asset class and Extra Space Storage has the largest and most diverse portfolio in the industry. Occupancy averaged over 94% in the quarter, and it remains very healthy. New customer rates, while not as strong as last year, remained 12% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels and customer health remains strong. New supply continues to moderate and the headwinds to future new development are substantial and increasing. Our external growth drivers continue to fire on all cylinders, and I am confident in our ability to further scale our platform. And finally, I believe we have the strongest team and operating platform in the industry. It is still a great time to be in storage, and I believe the future of Extra Space remains very bright.  I will now turn the call over to Scott. Great question. So the short answer is everything is going as planned. We have begun sending out the ECRI notices to the Life Storage customers, and they are accepting them at the same rate or maybe even slightly better rate than Extra Space customers. We have headwinds of catch-up auctions and the slightly elevated vacates from the CRI notices, the occupancy on the LSI portfolio. So we have discounted rates on the web, in particular, to protect that occupancy while we do that. And that's been very successful, and we've actually seen a slight uptick in occupancy in the LSI portfolio. So we're really happy with how the strategy is playing out, and we continue to monitor it and make sure there's no bumps in the road. So I might describe it a little differently. We're using rate, I think, to protect occupancy more. We don't really expect to make significant gains in occupancy until we're done correcting the rates and getting through the auctions. So we gained some occupancy, but it's certainly not spiking, and we probably don't expect that until next rental season. With respect to effect on Extra Space stores, that's very market specific, and I don't think very significant. So I don't think pricing power to new customers is significantly different than 6 months ago. And I guess I'd say the same thing about pricing power to existing customers, which is very strong. It is also the same, right? We're not seeing a greater amount of ECRI induced vacates. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question? I'm not sure I understand the question. I should understood what you were saying. So lots of different ways to measure length of stay. Our average in-place customer is about 34.4 months, which is up a month year-over-year. Our existing customers who have been in the store for 12 months is 61%. That's done a little bit as we continue to normalize from those COVID highs at that metric. We've also lost a little bit of our 24-month customers. That's about 45% now, but still higher than pre-COVID. Is that helpful? We haven't adjusted last year's like storage occupancy to reflect our methodology. So I think we have a significant opportunity to exceed the G&A synergy of $23 million. Our original guidance for that was $140 million. Our original Extra Space guidance at the beginning of the year before this merger was contemplated. Our current midpoint guidance for G&A is $150 million. So it's not quite $10 million every 6 months of additional G&A because we closed the merger on July 20. G&A is not smooth. G&A is higher in the first quarter. It's not perfectly spread out through the 4 quarters. And we still have some hiring to do to fill in some spots. But clearly, we're going to be ahead of our $23 million run rate. So we've achieved very little of that synergy because the only extra space tenant insurance policies, we're selling now are to new customers. Existing customers will not convert from the Life Storage insurance policy to the Extra Space insurance policy until starting January 1 of 2024, and that was for both regulatory and contractual reasons. But that will be somewhat of a light switch, right? We'll send out the notice, people get them and beyond the extra space policy, which is more robust in terms of coverage but also has a higher premium. So I'll tell you how we underwrote the transaction to get to underwritten synergies and really how we get there, mix of occupancy and revenue, we don't really care as much as long as we get the dollars. So at underwriting, we observed on average a 2% gap in occupancy and about a 15% gap in rate and to get to our $65 million of property synergies, we underwrote 0 improvement in occupancy and about a 7% improvement in rate. So our opportunity to do better is to achieve better than those assumptions. Sorry for [indiscernible] audience. So the portfolios will be run on the same platform, right, despite the 2 brands, it's going to be the same customer acquisition systems, the same pricing algorithms, the same sales process. So eventually, the two portfolio should run very similarly. We don't have a strategy of running a higher occupancy, Extra Space store and a lower occupancy Life Storage store. Everything is going to be run on one platform to maximize revenue. So the best returns on capital continues to be a redevelopment of existing stores. Those returns are high single, low double-digit returns. You can add units where you already own the land, you already have the office, you already have entitlements and we are very excited to now have 1,200 more stores to look at and try to find additional opportunities to put storage in parking lots or make single stores storage, multistory storage. The challenge with those are they're relatively small in terms of dollar investment, so you have to do a lot of them, but we have a team and a process and a program and we expect to do a lot more of those in the future. Another bridge loan program also provides very high return on capital. The whole note rate is 10% now, average is 10% now. And when we sell the A note, the rate on the B notes is into the teens and that does not include the economic benefit of managing the property, which we lend on. So that also is a very good use of capital, particularly because we can control the capital by selling or not selling the A note. So I think our best sense is one of the ways we underwrote this transaction is. We identified 106 or 109 LSI stores that had one or more extra space store that was in a very tight geographical radius was a similar type store in terms of single-story drive-up or multistory and we felt was a truly competitive store. And at the time of underwriting, the delta in rate was about 15% for those stores. I mean it's a standard practice when we buy a store not to rely on the prior owner's auction process because we don't caught up in a noncompliant auction. So we start the auction process over again, and that leads to a several month lag. So we have several months of units, nonpaying units, we have to auction out, recover those units, and we let them. It it's temporary and in the overall scheme of things, I think not significant, although it does provide some occupancy pressure in the short run. Sure, great question. So we continue to see moderation in new supply. The peak was maybe 2018 and every year since then, it's moderated. We expect deliveries in 2023 to be kind of similar to 2022. But after that, likely to be more moderation. The headwinds to new supply in terms of interest rates and debt capital, equity capital, availability, construction costs, entitlement period, underwriting forward revenue growth are pretty significant and drop our rates for projects that you can see on yard and all those other reports are really high and a lot of projects we see in these reports end up not getting built. Many of us were at a conference in New York a couple of weeks ago where one of the leading brokers in the industry said, he thinks the dropout rate is 70% to 90%. I don't have the statistics for that, but that's an observation from someone who's very, very close to the industry. Yes, I would characterize it as quiet. There are very few transactions that we see end up making many transactions. People bring our portfolios and they don't end up transacting. That's an indication of a bid-ask spread. And the transactions we do see that happen. There's it seems to be some story either on the buyer side, why it was a special buy for them or on the seller side. But I don't think there's enough of a market where I could tell you what market cap rates are. It's just very quiet and very circumstantial. There's two things, I think, to think about. One is maybe 3 things. One is job growth. Job growth is maybe the #1 indicator of storage performance. And those Sunbelt markets still have job growth, and that's an important factor. On the flip side, when a market has a couple of years of 20%, 30% plus revenue growth, it's really difficult to keep up. So it may look like it's giving back because it's not growing as fast, but it's still a healthy market, and it's just coming up against a tough comp. And then lastly, which is a little bit of the wildcard is the housing market. I firmly believe the housing market will come back. It's got two people can't stay in their houses forever, life events happen, just when and how quickly is going to be a factor that will inform our performance next year. No, I said we underwrote 7% to achieve our underwritten synergies. So we underwrote not closing the occupancy gap at all and only closing about half of the rate gap and that if we can do those 2 things, that will give us our $65 million synergies from the properties. Maybe not as much as might be -- we might assume because one of the big drivers of ECRI is the gap between the discounted web rate. The customer comes in and the actual market rate for that unit. So while we're in a period of time now where we're offering significant discounts for customers to come into the web that gives us the opportunity to catch them up to ECRI and get them to what the true market rate is. So it's very early. We don't have any firm conclusions. I think the most important thing that we see is we have increased our digital footprint. So when you're in one of those saturated markets where we're operating 2 brands and you search for storage near me or whatever generic storage starts to use. You will find both Extra Space and Life Storage branded stores come up on the search, sometimes also a Storage Express store. So we are getting more digital real estate. That's kind of the main assumption to the success of the program, but it's very early, and we have quite a ways to go before we can draw definitive conclusions. Sure. So Bar Gold, I would say, is glasses half full and half empty. The half full is we've done a really, really good job of institutionalizing and integrating the operations there. We're significantly outperforming budget on the expense side, where I think we have more wood to chop is the growth side of that. We are growing bar gold at historical rates at the rates that bar gold grew before we bought it. and we really want to turn some attention to that and try to grow it at a faster rate. Some of that, I think, is just us getting to know the business, getting to know the people and understanding it and some of it is, frankly, attention on Storage Express and then Life Storage. Storage Express is -- I think we made a lot of progress. It was actually, in some ways, harder to integrate Storage Express because it was a different platform, a different way of doing business. I mean we got all of the 1,200 Life Stores on our operating platform breeze in 19 days. It took us 6 months with 107 Storage Express stores because it's a different way of operating. There's just different software systems procedures. So we're doing very well on the integration front. We have bought several small remotely managed stores in our traditional markets, not in the more rural markets they operate in. They trade at 7% yield. So we feel they're good purchases. And we're learning a lot. We're learning about exactly what should be a remote store partially manned. What are the various attributes, distance from an Extra Space store population, rent per square foot saturation that makes it work and makes it doesn't work. We have opened up our third-party management platform. We've just signed up a 60-property portfolio to be run remotely. We have a large, large pipeline of remotely managed stores for our Management Plus platform. So I think similar to Bar Gold, the growth of that platform was slowed by our attention to the Life Storage deal. We used that time to learn things, which I think is good. And as we move forward, I expect that growth to accelerate. Great. Thank you, everyone, for your time today. I hope the message was clear that things are going as expected. Our integration is realization of synergies are proceeding very well, and we look forward to seeing many, many of you in Los Angeles next week. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we would characterize the third quarter as in line, meeting our internal FFO projections, the modest miss in property NOI due to higher noncontrollable expenses was offset by beats in interest income and G&A. Achieved rates to new customers were down an average of 11.8% year-over-year in the third quarter, gapping widest in August and tightening modestly in September and further in October to a negative 10.8%. Given the easier September and October comps, we would have liked to have seen that gap narrow more, but we continue to have a headwind from new customer rates. Fortunately, lower year-over-year vacates and strong existing customer health continues to more than offset the headwind and revenue performance as a whole continues to hold up. Weighing these factors as we forecast revenue for the fourth quarter, new customer rate improvement hasn't been compelling enough for us to raise the high end of our same-store revenue guidance range, but existing customer performance has been steady enough to remove our most cautious scenarios from our full year revenue guide. As a result, we increased the bottom end of our same-store revenue by 25 basis points to a range of 2.75% to 3.5% for the full year. On the expense front, we felt greater-than-expected pressure from property taxes, primarily in Georgia and Florida. We also had significant increases in property insurance premiums. We updated our annual same-store expense guidance to recognize actual expenses as well as a higher run rate for property taxes resulting in a revised same-store expense range of 4% to 5% for the full year. This results in a tightening of the same-store NOI range of 25 basis points both [Technical Difficulty] the low end of the range, maintaining a midpoint of 2.75%.  Turning to the balance sheet. We drew on our line of credit and an undrawn term loan of $1 billion to pay closing costs and to retire Life Storage's debt that we did not assume. With the merger, we assume $2.4 billion in Life Storage's publicly traded bonds at the same coupons and maturities. With the assumption of these bonds mark the debt to market, and we have broken out the noncash interest expense, which has been added back to core FFO.  Upon completion of the merger and the assumption of debt, S&P Global upgraded its credit rating on Extra Space to BBB+, which will drive future interest expense savings for the company. Details to our updated debt stack and revised interest rate spreads on our credit facility are included in our supplemental.  Last quarter, we provided freestanding guidance for Extra Space Storage and then provided separate details related to the anticipated dilution associated with the merger. In last night's earnings release, we updated our 2023 FFO guidance ranges for the combined portfolio. The same-store performance ranges I previously referenced applied to the Extra Space same-store pool as we have not added the Life Storage properties to the pool. Separate disclosures related to the performance of the Life Storage stores are included in our supplemental financials. Our core FFO range, which includes the short-term dilutive impact of the LSI merger as well as an add-back for transaction and transition expenses was tightened to $8.05 to $8.20 per share, maintaining the previous midpoint. We have also provided updates to key assumptions for the combined company.  As Joe mentioned, our performance was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter and the integration of Life Storage remains on track. We continue to believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in the REIT space. We believe our operating platform and highly diversified portfolio has become even stronger through the Life Storage merger and it is positioned for outsized future growth.  And with that, Kevin, let's open it up for questions. Yes, Michael, your assumptions are correct. It does imply at the midpoint that it's positive for the entire quarter. And we obviously have October, largely we know what October was. And so we're confident that we should hit those numbers. Yes. So comps throughout this year have gotten easier as we've moved through. In terms of how it came out versus what we were expecting, it was pretty similar to what we were expecting. As we mentioned earlier, we don't expect things to go negative in the fourth quarter and that sets us up for what we hope to be a good 2024.  I think our occupancy is holding up well and not going negative, I think, is a positive thing. So our variable rate debt actually ticked up slightly in the quarter as we completed the merger. With the merger, we had to pay off some fixed rate debt. You had private placement bonds on Life Storage that weren't allowed to be prepaid. To do that, we've used a bridge loan, a $1 billion bridge, that's a 2-year loan, and we will be terming that out over the next 1 to 2 years. So we will be bringing that down. If you look at our variable rate debt net of the variable rate borrowings, it's about 75%. But again, we'll be bringing those down, variable receivables. For the two portfolios, Extra Space, the same-store ended October at 93.9%. It's a 1% gap from where we were last year. The Life Storage occupancy is 90.8% compared to last year, and that has actually narrowed the gap slightly. Our occupancy calculation is slightly different than the way Life Storage calculated. We're going with this calculation going forward as they excluded or made adjustments that we don't make on an ongoing basis. It's narrowing and I actually don't have last years in front of me right now. Okay. If you look at our deceleration through the year, I mean we've clearly moderated that deceleration. Our fourth quarter guidance implies that it continues fairly flat from where we are today. 2024 will be ready, obviously, to give the full year guidance in February. But I think we're set up to be -- we're in a good spot. We'd like to see new customer rates get stronger, but existing customers are holding up very well. In 2024 also has easier comps compared to what we had this year. As you say me, it doesn't really impact your bad debt either because you've already accrued the bad debt reserve. So there's no impact there, but it does impact occupancy. Yes. So we actually thought it had decreased some in the 6-month numbers. I think we were looking pretty good. We won some appeals. We were a little bit surprised on how our actuals came in for Florida and Georgia and Illinois versus the estimates we've made using property tax consultants. We hope that the worst of the property tax reassessments are behind us, but every year is a new year with the local municipalities. Wages and benefits, we've actually had it slow some. We don't see the wage pressure that we saw the last couple of years. We saw higher slightly earlier in the year as we had more hours compared to prior years when it was difficult to hire. Today, it's much easier to hire. Our applicant flow is significantly better and we're not seeing the wage pressure we've seen over the last couple of years. Yes. So we think it's a good run rate, the estimate we've given for the quarter. Obviously, October is done. It's too early to tell for next year. So why storage, the big increase year-over-year came from more personnel and the payroll line item. Our managers, on average, make more, and we have more hours allocated to us, and that's how we get the premium rates that we get. So we are operating them more like we operate our stores. The other thing that's different from their historical same-store numbers is we have allocated call center and a technology charge to the stores that they historically had in their G&A. So we went back to their historical numbers and added those in, too. I think it will bend a little bit on claims. You had a really rough year in Florida this past year. Overall, if you had -- anything wind related in Florida saw a 100-plus percent increase in lots of areas. So I think it will depend some on events that happen but you've also seen a rise in interest rate caused those pools not to be as deep as they found other sources to put other places and put that money. So making sure that we have competitive bids, adding the Life Storage properties will help us because we have a new group of insurers that we haven't used in the past. And so hopefully, we should be able to bring that down and not see the kind of increases we've seen in this year. We're assuming about a 100 basis point gap through this year. And then obviously, moving into 2024, I think that gap gets easier."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Jeff Norman, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Latif. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's second quarter 2023 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business.

Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, August 4, 2023. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. And I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We have had a busy three months and a lot has happened since our first quarter earnings call. Operationally, same-store occupancy remained high through the second quarter. Although rental volume was down year-over-year, vacates also remain muted, allowing us to improve occupancy sequentially each month through the quarter, ending June at a very healthy 94.5%. The existing customer health remains strong with ARs and bad debt levels remaining low and customer acceptance of rate increases remain steady. Our strategy coming into the year was to maintain high occupancy in order to enhance pricing power to new customers as we moved into the leasing season. This strategy was effective through May, and we improved rental rates sequentially and started to tighten the year-over-year negative delta and achieved great growth to new customers. However, new customer rates have not improved meaningfully in June and July, both of which are typically high-volume rental months in a busy leasing season. The miss in same-store revenue in June was offset by lower-than-expected same-store expenses, allowing us to remain on budget for property NOI for the first half of the year. From an FFO perspective, we also met our internal budgets for the first and second quarter. As we look forward, we expect the impact of lower new customer rates in the summer months to weigh on revenue growth in the back half of the year. Our initial guidance assumed that we would fully close our negative year-over-year new customer rental rate growth gap by July, and that new customer rate growth would be positive through the end of the year. Year-to-date, we have not gained that pricing power and now believe new customer rate growth will remain negative year-over-year further into 2023. As a result, we have reduced our 2023 same-store revenue expectations. Our lower estimated property revenue, together with a higher forward interest rate curve also reduced our full year outlook for core FFO. Needless to say, we are disappointed that rental rate growth to new customers has been weaker this leasing season, and we never liked the idea of having to reduce our outlook. With that said, we are also careful to maintain perspective about where Extra Space and the storage industry actually sit today. First, occupancy levels remain just below 95%, which excluding the last couple of years, are as high as we have ever seen. Second, new customer rates, while not as strong as last year, remained 15% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Third, new supply continues to be manageable and the headwinds to future new development are increasing. And finally, our external growth drivers continue to fire on all cylinders with 54 additions to our third-party management platform in the quarter and 102 stores added through two quarters. On July 20, we closed our merger with Life Storage, adding over 1,200 stores to our portfolio, which today has over 3,500 stores spanning 43 states. I am proud of both teams who have worked tirelessly to complete the merger to create a stronger portfolio, platform and company. We are all focused and working hard to achieve a smooth integration. So far, I am very pleased with how seamlessly the integration is progressing and how we are already finding ways to create value and unlock synergies. Let me provide a couple of examples. In the two weeks since we closed the transactions, we have onboarded and trained over 2,700 LSI employees and already transitioned over 900 stores to our point-of-sale system with the remaining stores to follow next week. This move to our point-of-sale system is critical because, among other things, this platform allows us to implement our digital marketing and pricing strategies, which will allow us to begin to optimize performance at these stores. And second, last week, S&P Global raised our credit rating to a BBB+ to reflect our larger and stronger company, which will have an immediate and future benefit on our cost of debt capital. So while we have just closed and we know it is still early, we are excited as we begin to realize the many future opportunities this merger creates for Extra Space and our shareholders. We will continue to give updates on the integration and performance of the Life Storage assets as well as our progress towards our $100 million in minimum estimated synergies. After some short-term dilution expected during the remainder of 2023, we believe we will be at least in our underwritten synergy run rate early in 2024 with additional upside beyond, as we continue to optimize the performance of the combined company and capture additional synergies not quantified in the original underwriting. It is still a great time to be in storage, and I believe the future of Extra Space remains bright. I will now turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had another solid quarter, meeting our internal same-store NOI and FFO projections. The modest miss in property revenue in June was offset by expense savings and other small beats in interest income, G&A and higher management fees were offset by higher interest expense and lower tenant insurance. After tightening year-over-year achieved rate to new customers to negative 3% in March, we backed off on rates and averaged approximately negative 8% in April, which immediately drove higher rental volumes. We saw similar traction in May but then saw rental volume slow in June and July, despite keeping new customer rates down approximately 10% year-over-year. On the expense front, we are performing well with minimal payroll and property tax growth and marketing expense remaining in line with our expectations. However, we have experienced additional pressure in insurance expense premiums in the property and casualty markets with average premium increases in our June renewal of approximately 50%. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed a $450 million bond offering in the quarter and completed a recast of our credit facility, bringing revolving capacity to approximately $2 billion in preparation for the Life Storage merger. We also closed on a term loan of $1 billion with a delayed draw feature that we accessed at closing to pay off Life Storage's line of credit, private placement debt and other closing costs. In last night's earnings release, we updated our 2023 guidance ranges for same-store growth expectations and core FFO, which do not include the impact of the recently closed merger with Life Storage. Given the tight timing between the closing -- between closing the merger on July 20 and yesterday's release, we provided standalone guidance for Extra Space, excluding the impact of the merger with separate details about the anticipated dilution from the merger in the remainder of 2023. Despite meeting our internal projections for same-store NOI and core FFO, we have reduced our forward-looking estimates given the lower than forecasted pricing power and rental volume experienced in June and July as well as the upswing in the forward interest rate curve. Our outlook for same-store revenue growth, which does not include the LSI assets is now 2.5% to 3.5%. We have also reduced our same-store expense range to 3.5% to 4.5% due to better-than-expected payroll and property tax, resulting in a revised NOI range of 2% to 3.5%. Our expectation remains that the rate of revenue growth deceleration continues to flatten in the back half of the year with easing comparables. Our core FFO range, excluding the impact of the LSI merger, is reduced to $8.15 to $8.35 per share, driven primarily by lower property revenues and higher anticipated interest rates. For the Life Storage merger, we estimate initial dilution in 2023 as we integrate and optimize the portfolio to capture our anticipated synergies. We estimate $0.10 to $0.15 of dilution per share in 2023, and we believe that we will be at our $100 million run rate in early 2024. Details of the second quarter performance of Life Storage have been provided in our supplemental package, and we will provide updates on the performance of the LSI assets going forward. We continue to believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in the REIT space. We believe our operating platform and highly diversified portfolio has become even stronger through the Life Storage merger and that is positioned for outsized growth. With that, Latif, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith of UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. It seems like the largest driver of the reduced guidance is that street rates didn't converge with last year, which is weighing on results in the back half, so two-parter here. One, what's assumed for street rates for the back half of the year? And two, this is expected to weigh on the results in the back half of '23, what is the expected impact from this on 2024 operating metrics?\nJoe Margolis: So I think we see - the biggest difference we see in the back half of the year, frankly, is the comps get a lot easier. So we kind of see a continuation of modest growth, but with much easier comps. What was the second question, Michael?\nMichael Goldsmith: So you see any impact on the street rates are weighing on the second half of '23, is there any impact from that into 2024?\nJoe Margolis: So we are not talking - we don't have any guidance. I'm not talking about guidance to 2024 yet. But clearly, where you end '23 is your, sorry to give a stupid answer, as a starting point for '24. So that will be the impact.\nMichael Goldsmith: And just to clarify on the first question, like by growth, you mean you're expecting a slow convergence of '23 street rates to '22 levels and you expect that to converge sometime in the back half? Do you have any visibility? Like is that early? Is that late? Like just ticking for sort of just relative placement there.\nJoe Margolis: Yes. We had thought by June, July, we would have had that conversions point, and now we think it's further into 2023.\nMichael Goldsmith: Okay. Got it. And then my second question here is that given that a majority of the revenue synergies are driven from revenue - or given that a majority of the entire synergies are driven from revenue. What gives you confidence that you can achieve your $100 million of run rate synergies in early 2024? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: So on the revenue side, as I mentioned in my comments, we have 900-plus stores on our point-of-sale soft breeze and the ECRI notices have started going out. And we have a very detailed plan customer-by-customer, when do they get their last one, where their rate is, on street rate, not to overload any store, but that has started. And next week, we'll have all the rest of the stores on breeze and those ECRI notices will go out. And the confidence we have is because we've done this all the time. We take over stores all the time that have rates below where we want them and we send out ECRI notices, and we know the acceptance rate and the churn rate, and it gives us a high degree of confidence that's going to work. On the insurance side, once we're on breeze, new customers will purchase insurance from our platform, which is at a higher rate than LSI's program was and existing customers won't be converted until January 2024. Those notices will go out. And that delay is for both regulatory reasons and notice requirements in the existing LSI contract with their insurance provider. And then the third biggest kind of segment of the $100 million is the G&A side. And we've now sharpened our pencils, hired who we want to hire redone budgets department by department and have greatly increased confidence we will exceed the underwritten G&A savings.\nMichael Goldsmith: And apologies for keeping that going. But just to clarify on the ECRIs. I think you said in the script that customers are continuing to absorb them. That said, easier eyes can be highly dependent on the trajectory of street rates. So it is a just a trajectory of street rates, is that going to impact your ability to pass along ECRIs in the near to intermediate term?\nJoe Margolis: So I don't think that's going to be a significant impact. So you're right that street rate is a factor in the quantum of the ECRI that's given. But the gap between the rate at the LSI stores and the rate at the competitive Extra Space stores gives us confidence that there's still plenty of meat on that bone.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. First question, I guess just taking a step back, and listening to the comments on what you thought would happen versus what actually happened to understand and feel comfortable with the new guidance? Like why did you - what were the systems telling you, let's say, in the spring or early summer, that you would close the gap to actually what happened and then compare that to now what the systems are saying for the rest of the year?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Jeff. So what we were seeing earlier in the year was we were seeing our street rates or our achieved rates to new customers steadily moving up, and we were seeing that our occupancy gap was maintaining what we were expecting. That was pretty consistent through May. As we moved into June, we found that in order to maintain our occupancy, we needed the lower rates. And that continued into July. And so into July, we were negative 10.5% whereas in the second quarter, our rates were averaged about 8% negative to new customers. So just that change in customers being shopping more and being much more rate sensitive is what caused us to change our outlook going forward.\nJeff Spector: Okay. Thanks. And then on the rental volume comment, Scott, I think you said rental volumes slowed in June and July, obviously. I guess trying to tie that into one of your competitors' comments on record move-ins, I guess what is the health of the top of the funnel, like new customer traffic? Like what are we seeing today, let's say, as we started August? And how should we think about that in terms of seasonality as we head into the coming months?\nJoe Margolis: So there's plenty of self-storage customers out there for the larger operators to capture, right? We're at 94.5% occupied. Obviously, we can keep our stores full. The challenge is there's not sufficient enough customers to give us pricing power. We can't move rates and maintain that type of occupancy to the level we wanted to. So our year-over-year rentals were down 9% in the second quarter so were Life Storage for comparison purpose. But vacates were also down a little less than that, but a similar number. So there's customers out there, our platform can capture them, but we don't have the pricing power we expected.\nScott Stubbs: And Jeff, maybe where we vary a little bit from some of the other reports that have been out there is while they may see increases in rental some of it could be what happened last year and also what their new rate is moving in. And I think some of them reported a wider gap than what we have even experienced.\nJeff Spector: And then -- I'm sorry, but just one follow-up to Michael's question on the -- I guess, you discussed the easier comps, I think you said into the end of this year. I guess, can you provide like a specific month or time frame? And do the easier comps continue into '24?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So the easier comps do continue into '24 as rates moderated in the back half of last year in terms of our rates to new customers, they continue to moderate it back half of last year and into this year. In addition, you have an easier revenue comp this year than you had from last year. Our revenue growth the first half of 2022 was almost 22%.\nJeff Spector: Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks Jeff.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. I guess, good morning. It seems like the light switch went off in June or July. And I'm just curious, can you guys put your finger on what sort of changed customer behavior that much to change the pricing dynamic in June?\nJoe Margolis: I don't think we can, we had an odd March. We couldn't figure that out as well. We've talked about that. We were feeling really good at the end of May, and there was a distinct change in customer behavior in June and July, and I would be guessing if I told you I knew what it was.\nSteve Sakwa: I mean do you think it's housing related? Is that maybe just the lack of movement in housing creating more less demand than you would have thought?\nJoe Margolis: I think housing is certainly a factor, right? That's one important component of demand for self-storage, and we all know the housing market story. I think another factor is consumers don't have as much money in their pocket, right? If the savings rate is way down, all the extra COVID dollars that were floating around have gone away. There's inflation in the economy. I think the consumers have fewer dollars as well.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And I guess, secondly, if you kind of look at the implied guidance for the second half of the year. If I'm doing my math right, I think the revenue growth is kind of 0% to 2%, which compares to the 2.7% you did in the second quarter. So maybe, Scott, just help us think through like what gets you to kind of the upper end of the range and what gets you to the lower end of the range? Is it more occupancy driven? Is it more the new rates, the customers, the slowdown in ECRI? Like what are the big drivers between kind of the low end and high end, do you think from - \nJoe Margolis: The biggest drivers, I think, are when we move positive in terms of achieved rates to new customers. And as we mentioned before, we do have an easier comp from last year. But I think that where you fall in that guidance is when those new customer rates move positive and you start to have a little bit of pricing power to new customers.\nSteve Sakwa: So, I'm sorry, is there any of that embedded in the guidance for the back half of the year? Or is it like at the high end that assumes that and the low end it doesn't?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So, the low end assumes that you don't get pricing power, the high end assumes that you start to get some of that pricing power. And it's probably more in the back half of - the end of the year where you start to see the benefit of it. Any pricing power you got in August, you might start to see some benefit later in the year. If you don't get pricing power until November, December, you're not going to see anything this year.\nSteve Sakwa: Got it. Okay. Thank you. That's it.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Just a quick follow-up to start on Steve's last question. When you say pricing power is that you're able to raise street rates sequentially or more just benefiting from easier comps and you will the decline year-over-year will go away?\nScott Stubbs: It's more of the year-over-year comp. We have actually been able to move street rates sequentially, as we've moved through this year, but the year-over-year comp has made them negative.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And then just a regular rate question. Just curious, is there anything by MSA or region that's - where you saw softness like are the cost performing better than some of the previously high-flying Sunbelt markets? Or just curious on any commentary you could provide around that?\nJoe Margolis: So, I think it's too much of a generalization to say the Sunbelt is weak and the coast are strong or anything like that, right? Some of our best markets, Orlando, Tampa, Miami, continue to outperform portfolio averages. Those are Sunbelt markets. L.A. continues to be good. And some of the weaker markets, frankly, are markets that put up 30% growth last year. So, they - it's hard to do that several years in a row. So they appear weaker. But I think the important thing to remember is markets will cycle in a non-correlated factor - non-correlated manner. And because of that, it's important to be as diversified as possible. So, you always have some markets that are on the upswing, and you always have some markets that maybe are coming off of the upswing. And one of the reasons we like the LSI merger is because it further diversifies our portfolio and reduces our concentration in our top markets.\nJuan Sanabria: And then just one last one if you humor me. Anything on the churn front in terms of length of stay, you're seeing be impacted as you've seen kind of less top of funnel demand throughout the system worth note either with the one or two-year length of stay, decreasing or anything to that out?\nJoe Margolis: So the one or two-year length of stay has decreased very slightly. We're still in the low 60% on the one year and 46% or so on the two-year - I think we are losing some of those long-term COVID tenants, but not all of them. But length of stay is still healthy. Our average vacating customer is almost 18 months, median is about 7.5 months. Those are great numbers as compared to pre-COVID.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks guys. Good luck.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Juan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. I appreciate the disclosure on LSI same-store. It looked like revenue and NOI growth decelerated quite a bit more than we would have anticipated. I'm not sure how that compares to what you were anticipating, but it was about 1,000 basis points sequentially during the quarter before the merger closed. Any sense on what happened during the quarter? And can you speak to the integration there and first steps around stabilizing growth in the Life Storage portfolio?\nScott Stubbs: And maybe I'll speak to the results, and Joe can take the integration piece. First of all, they were still managing their properties. So clearly, we couldn't go in and manage them the way we would have liked to. I think that what we saw was occupancy fell off more than we would have expected, and we would attribute that to them keeping rates too high in May and June. When they've lowered them, you've seen it move in the positive direction in the month of July, they finished the month of July around 91%. So it ticked up slightly, but they did not see that busy season bump than we would have expected. And then in terms of the integration, Joe?\nJoe Margolis: So, I spoke a little bit about the systems integration. That's going well, and we'll continue to work on that. Data transmission is going well. We still have some work to do there, but no hiccups. People is not something you can just do in a couple of weeks. It will take us a while to fully train the Life Storage managers on our way of doing things. They can all take rentals now and do the basics, if you will. But they'll continue to get better and better. And as they do, the performance will improve.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Do you expect to continue providing a breakout of the Life Storage same-store portfolio and performance going forward through '24, I guess, until it's included in the same-store in '25?\nScott Stubbs: So have not fully determined '24. We think it is likely, because it's probably the best way to show the improvement. If you compare our same-store pool to theirs, you should be able to see them outperforming due to them being on our systems. But I think it's likely, but no final decision yet.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then I had a question around this environment here as it pertains to new supply. We've heard that starts are likely declining and could be materially lower moving forward here in the near term, which would be good for absorption of existing stores. But as it pertains to the supply added over the last few years, a lot of that product leased up at an accelerated rate during the pandemic from some of the new demand related to the pandemic. Are assets in your system that leased up with a disproportionate amount of, I guess, COVID demand customers? Are you seeing more pressure on move outs or different customer behavior than the stores that you've operated and that were stabilized for a period of time before the pandemic?\nJoe Margolis: No. I don't think customers pay differently if they moved into a new store that just opened or whether they moved into a store that's been up and stabilized for a long time, right? They leave some point after their need for storage goes away. I think your thesis is right, right? We see a moderation of new supply, but at the same time, we see markets that had kind of excess COVID demand that's going away that build up new supply and now that may be moderating, creating more availability.\nTodd Thomas: Right. I guess that's my question. The latter point that you just made, are the assets over the last several years, a couple of thousand stores that were delivered beginning maybe in 2018 or 2019 through 2022? Or are you seeing those stores either a little bit more challenged? Or are they even in some markets, maybe still struggling to find equilibrium in terms of rate as demand moderates and some of those renters move out?\nJoe Margolis: So, I'm sorry if I didn't answer that question clearly. I think, it's an asset-by-asset analysis. Certainly, there are markets that are struggling because they had a lot of new supply delivered. It all got filled up during COVID. Now there's lesser demand. So maybe those markets are under a little more pressure. And I would give you Phoenix is a really good example of that. But I think it's a market analysis, not an asset analysis. It's not like all the excess COVID demand customers moved into the new property and the other - all the regular customers moved into the existing properties. So, the new properties are struggling more, the customers go everywhere, and the markets perform similarly. I hope that makes sense.\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Todd, you're probably seeing it a little bit more in rate than you are occupancy. We have been able to maintain the occupancy at those newer stores, but you have - the ability to push rates has not been there.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi guys. I just wanted to ask you, the implied guidance through the back half for your same-store portfolio. Is that sort of a similar guideline for what you're seeing for the LSI portfolio as well? Or could you - is it something meaningfully different?\nJoe Margolis: We would expect the LSI portfolio to do better as we get their stores on our platform, that uplift to begin to occur.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. So embedded in your dilution is better same-store NOI for that portfolio through the back half of the year offset the some of the things that you've called out?\nScott Stubbs: So, there is some growth there, but not significant. Typically, what happens is you bring things onto our portfolio is it takes a month or two as you bring things on. And so not a significant amount of increase, but we would expect those stores to start to benefit from the ECRI.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you on your third-party management platform, maybe it's too soon. But I know that the economics were different for the LSI tenants. And I'm just wondering if you would expect most of them to come on board, either your - I think you take a higher share? Or do you think some will leave? Or kind of what's embedded into your kind of - your outlook on that side?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I think that's a good description. So we talked to all of the managed owners that had LSI managing their stores. And our expectation is that everyone will migrate to our economics, which are significantly better than LSI's economics and also our kind of service levels. We run one program. Everyone is on the same program. LSI ran more of a customized program for their managed partners. And we will absolutely separate with some of those managed partners who don't want to work on our system, and that's fine because our goal is not to have the most stores, but to have an efficient profitable management program that works well for both parties. So, we'll continue to - we'll keep most, I think, and lose many, I think, as you said. But I'm very confident we'll continue to grow our management platform faster than anyone else in the industry.\nScott Stubbs: Smedes, one other point I would make there is, I think there's been some narrative that we are going to lose some of these customers, and Life Storage actually added 17 stores during the quarter. So, they've continued to add to their management portfolio through Q2.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Smedes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl of Wolfe Research.\nKeegan Carl: Yes. Thanks for the time guys. Maybe big picture here. Just wondering if you could walk us through your view on the strategy to cut street around this time last year. One, do you think the strategy worked? Two, what's the plan for here because it seems that it's had a lot of ripple effects throughout the space. It's created a more challenging operating environment for everyone?\nScott Stubbs: I'm not sure we have that kind of power, first of all, to create that kind of environment. I think we typically react, or based on the data that we're reviewing to maintain the occupancy and maintain the pricing power in terms of our existing customer rate increases. So if you look at big picture, I think we were probably one of the earlier ones to move on rate. And I think everyone else eventually, we'd like to have the hubris to think they copied us, but I think they probably saw the same thing in the data that we saw, and they moved on rates also to maintain occupancy.\nJoe Margolis: I would also say that we don't guess at these strategies. We test them pretty vigorously before we implement them and keep control groups. So, we know whether we're doing the right thing or if the situation changed. So because of that, I have a high degree of confidence, we executed the right strategy.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. And shifting gears here at NAREIT. I remember you guys mentioned that marketing spend was up materially in May, and you weren't seeing the same results. So one, is it fair to assume that since you weren't seeing the results you wanted that you drastically reduced that in June? And I'm just curious how it translated in July and how you're thinking about marketing spend in the back half of the year?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. Good memory. So, we did run some tests during that time period with significantly higher marketing expense, and we didn't see the return on those dollars spent, so we pulled back. And we'll continue to test as we always do, in what situations can we get an acceptable return on incremental marketing dollars. And whenever that's the case, we're happy to spend them. And if we can't get that return, we're not going to spend money for no reason at all.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. Thanks for the time guys.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hi. Thanks so much. Just two quick ones for me. So back to the question on sort of the top of the funnel demand. I think you talked about sort of things changing in June and July, where you can maintain occupancy, but not sort of pricing power. So when I tie that into sort of the guidance ranges for the back half of the year on the same-store revenue, how do we think about sort of the conviction or the potential upside and downside as you're going to the back half of the year on the revenue front? So what I mean by that is, do you sort of need to see trends stabilize or get better in the next sort of two to three months to get there or what's sort of baked into that? Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So, I think what we've seen early in the summer in July, is that there is demand. You just can't get the occupancy and the rate. As we move throughout this year, we have easier comparables from last year. And so that's where it gives us the confidence to be able to go with the numbers that we've done - that we've gone with. We think that it gets easier as we move through this year in terms of new customer rates. And so that's where we're confident. And again, as we mentioned before, where you are in that range is going to depend somewhat on how quickly we get some pricing power.\nRonald Kamdem: Right. And I guess my follow-up - the follow-up question I have was just because I think the guidance range is just 0 to 2%. But the heart of my question was like, is there a conviction that you can't go negative at some point or is it just - things just don't move that quickly. That's - I'm just trying to figure out like rate of change here?\nScott Stubbs: So if you look at the lower end of the guidance, I think it does imply that you could tick negative for a period of time in the back half of the year.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. That's helpful. Last one, just on LSI. We noticed the occupancy dip as well, and I think you explained that they kept maybe pricing higher. I just want to go back to the synergies guidance because initially, I think it was $60 million revenues, $40 million in expenses, and you reiterated sort of. Has that mix changed at all? Is it more - or is it sort of still the same? Because presumably, the outlook for revenues have sort of shifted a little bit? Just trying to understand that $100 million still the same mix? Or has that moved around a little bit? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Yes, it's a good question. So, we had initially had four components of underwritten synergies. We had G&A. We had reduced marketing spend. We had increased store revenue, and we had tenant insurance. Tenant insurance has stayed about the same. We feel better about G&A that we'll do better than that component. The marketing piece we will not achieve. We - since we did the underwriting, we have decided pursuing a dual brand strategy, which we can discuss, if you like. But the marketing savings was presumed to be under one brand. But we think that the revenue increase, the rental increase in revenue increase from two brands will more than offset the $50 million underwritten marketing savings, and we'll also save about $70 million or so of rebranding costs. So better in G&A, won't achieve the marketing savings, about the same in tenant insurance and better at the property level.\nRonald Kamdem: Super helpful. I think I'll follow-up offline just to make sure I got that. But that's it for me. Thanks so much.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks Ronald.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Just going back to the LSI topic. This year, you're guiding towards $0.10 to $0.15 of dilution. I'm just curious, how should we think about that during - like how should we think about that improving into next year, just given the size of the portfolio? I think it's going to be pretty helpful for people to understand the earnings runway from here on out?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. When we announced the deal, we said that it would be just under 1% accretive and that assumes the full $100 million. So assuming we hit the run rate early next year, clearly, it shouldn't be dilutive next year. And you should start achieving a portion of that 1% accretion. Now as Joe mentioned, some of these, I think, will hit earlier than others. I think G&A will start achieving some of that this year immediately. The marketing, we - marketing and revenue increases, we'll start to achieve as we send out rate increases. You can't send them all out at day one. Some of these tenants received a rate increase a month ago. And then the last one is the tenant insurance, and that should be effective January 1.\nJoe Margolis: And we - sorry, on top of this, Scott. But we've also achieved non-underwritten synergies. We've got our rating upgrade, which will immediately save us on interest expenses this year and obviously, on any future borrowings. We sold warehouse anywhere to that management team at closing, which takes that loss off the books. And lots of other smaller things that were not in our $100 million that we're starting to achieve.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And earlier in the call, you mentioned that street rates are 15% higher than 2019 levels. And when I look at the cumulative same-store revenue growth that you've achieved since 2019 is closer to 30%, obviously, not purely apples-to-apples. But I'm just trying to get a sense of as rates are up 15% in '19 and revenue is up 30%, is there further risk of revenues, I guess, getting closer to that 15% mark?\nScott Stubbs: So your difference between those two numbers is your existing customer rates are more than that 15%, and that's what's created the negative churn gap that we have today.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you, Ki Bin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway of Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Apologies if I missed this, but have you guys quantified the magnitude of ECRIs in the stand-alone LSI portfolio and EXR for 2Q and then through July?\nScott Stubbs: So, we have not quantified the LSI ECRIs other than the fact that we've said with the synergies, there is $50 million that has to do with ECRIs as well as potential occupancy upside. When we did the initial underwriting and the initial deck that went out with the acquisition. We showed two studies that we had done that showed a pretty significant gap between rate per square foot on their stores and our stores. And we did not assume that we closed that gap 100%. We assume that we only closed about one-third of that gap.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And sorry, did you quantify it for ESRIs portfolio?\nScott Stubbs: We did not quantify anything in terms of the back half of 2Q in terms of ECRI.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And then I know you guys have spent a lot of time on this call, and thank you, just provide any color around the potential uplift you expect on operations from the LSI portfolio. But are there any concerns as it relates to the NOI kind of operating margin that you guys kind of hope to achieve with this integration just as we started to see some material weakness in some of LSI's smaller secondary markets? Or said differently, are there any like structural or demographic headwinds in those markets that you think that maybe your scale or superior revenue management platform won't be able to overcome in the near term?\nJoe Margolis: So it's a good question. I think we really look at this on a long-term basis. And are there going to be some markets that we adopted from LSI? We weren't in Buffalo. How is Buffalo going to do? I'm not sure. Over the short term, they will be weaker and some will be stronger, sure. But what is really important is the increased diversification and to have greater variability in where all the cash flows come from is just going to help take volatility out of returns. So yes, some markets will do better. Some markets will be worse market cycle through performance. But over the long term, it's going to be a benefit to the company.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thanks so much.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James.\nJonathan Hughes: Hi. Good afternoon. So normally, we see street rates are, I think, really only impacted by new supply, but deliveries have been pretty muted for the past few years. And I know you said in Ki Bin's question earlier that you don't think your strategy implemented a year ago impacted the industry. But the extra-fast brand is the second largest out there. So my question is, when you take a bit more of an introspective look and maybe be a little more careful about running these types of strategies in the future because I do think some of your peers, certainly smaller ones might agree that the seeming price war we have today started a year ago, which did coincide with the strategy change.\nJoe Margolis: So I think it's important to remember that even though public and Extra Space and cube and life are the largest brands. It's still a highly fragmented industry. And we don't control these markets in any respect. We have many, many stores where most or all of our competitors are mom-and-pops and not REIT. So we only have one or two REIT competitors. So we're going to continue to adopt strategies that we think produce the best long-term results for our shareholders and not really care about what it does to others.\nJonathan Hughes: But if the - I understand the fragmented nature of the market, but I think if you look at maybe the comparable product, an Extra Space property is, I think, different than, say, the Gen 1 drive-up mom-and-pop. So if that's your target consumer, and they want your product that's multistory air-conditioned. They don't want that legacy property. Your share of that market is much greater. And so I think maybe that's where some of my line of questioning came from that overall on the industry basis, yes, I think the Extra Space brand. We all know the concentration. But I think on the actual like-for-like type of product competing for that type of customer, I do think you own a little more sway than you think. So that's my question.\nJoe Margolis: I would respectfully disagree. I think our private competitors are not all Gen 1 older. There's plenty of sophisticated private regional operators that have new store climate control that are very comparable to our stores. Their systems and their operating platforms aren't comparable to us at all. But from a tenant standpoint, the product is the same.\nJonathan Hughes: Okay. All right. Well, that's it for me. I appreciate it, and happy early birthday, Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks Jonathan.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you, Jonathan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Thanks for the time. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Firstly, is there any update on Storage Express and how that transition is going and then the rollout of the strategy?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So Storage Express was a little harder, frankly, to put onto our systems than Life Storage because we had to put it on a system with a different operating model that we hadn't had program. But once they got on to our system, everything is working very well. And one of the reasons we're confident with the ECRI program for life storages, we just went through that ECRI program for Storage Express, and we saw how their customers accepted it. So in terms of integration very well. Operating through six months of the year ahead of underwriting, which is good. Growth is a little slower than we underwrote as we scaled that back while we were focused on the LSI merger. So we bought five or we've approved for purchase five remote stores, less than $30 million, so smaller stores, $130 a foot, but 7% yields in the first year. So once we can turn our full attention to growing this, we're excited about it. So the summary would be, everything on track or ahead of track going well, just slower growth than we thought as we turned our attention to integrating Life Storage.\nJuan Sanabria: And just one more question for me. And I appreciate you guys are focused on maximizing revenue, but a lot of the conversation today has seemed to have talked about occupancy and maintaining occupancy and the importance of that. So I was just hoping you could square it here. I mean is there a chance that maybe you're kind of hooked on the high occupancy? I know that's not the most elegant way to phrase, but just would appreciate your thoughts there.\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, our strategies are based on results of testing that we do. And our - the results of those tests have led us to have a strong conviction that we want to have incrementally higher occupancies. We want to seek the longer-term customers, and both of those things come at the expense of initial rate and try to make that up through ECRI. So I apologize if we've spoken too much about occupancy, but it is a tool to maximize revenue.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Margolis for closing remarks. Sir?\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thank you, everyone, for your time today. I want to emphasize and assure everyone that everyone here at our combined teams is very focused not only on integrating the companies, but maximizing performance at our stores as a difficult time. We are very, very excited about the future. We see a lot of tailwinds in 2024 is beyond as the underwritten and non-underwritten synergies from LSI hit the books, given the moderating delivery of new stores, given that we have $0.23 of dilution from lease-up stores that will come to the bottom line, that eventually interest rates will be lower. Eventually, the housing market will recover, and we will continue to grow our ancillary management bridge loan and insurance businesses. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We have had a busy three months and a lot has happened since our first quarter earnings call. Operationally, same-store occupancy remained high through the second quarter. Although rental volume was down year-over-year, vacates also remain muted, allowing us to improve occupancy sequentially each month through the quarter, ending June at a very healthy 94.5%. The existing customer health remains strong with ARs and bad debt levels remaining low and customer acceptance of rate increases remain steady. Our strategy coming into the year was to maintain high occupancy in order to enhance pricing power to new customers as we moved into the leasing season. This strategy was effective through May, and we improved rental rates sequentially and started to tighten the year-over-year negative delta and achieved great growth to new customers. However, new customer rates have not improved meaningfully in June and July, both of which are typically high-volume rental months in a busy leasing season. The miss in same-store revenue in June was offset by lower-than-expected same-store expenses, allowing us to remain on budget for property NOI for the first half of the year. From an FFO perspective, we also met our internal budgets for the first and second quarter. As we look forward, we expect the impact of lower new customer rates in the summer months to weigh on revenue growth in the back half of the year. Our initial guidance assumed that we would fully close our negative year-over-year new customer rental rate growth gap by July, and that new customer rate growth would be positive through the end of the year. Year-to-date, we have not gained that pricing power and now believe new customer rate growth will remain negative year-over-year further into 2023. As a result, we have reduced our 2023 same-store revenue expectations. Our lower estimated property revenue, together with a higher forward interest rate curve also reduced our full year outlook for core FFO. Needless to say, we are disappointed that rental rate growth to new customers has been weaker this leasing season, and we never liked the idea of having to reduce our outlook. With that said, we are also careful to maintain perspective about where Extra Space and the storage industry actually sit today. First, occupancy levels remain just below 95%, which excluding the last couple of years, are as high as we have ever seen. Second, new customer rates, while not as strong as last year, remained 15% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Third, new supply continues to be manageable and the headwinds to future new development are increasing. And finally, our external growth drivers continue to fire on all cylinders with 54 additions to our third-party management platform in the quarter and 102 stores added through two quarters. On July 20, we closed our merger with Life Storage, adding over 1,200 stores to our portfolio, which today has over 3,500 stores spanning 43 states. I am proud of both teams who have worked tirelessly to complete the merger to create a stronger portfolio, platform and company. We are all focused and working hard to achieve a smooth integration. So far, I am very pleased with how seamlessly the integration is progressing and how we are already finding ways to create value and unlock synergies. Let me provide a couple of examples. In the two weeks since we closed the transactions, we have onboarded and trained over 2,700 LSI employees and already transitioned over 900 stores to our point-of-sale system with the remaining stores to follow next week. This move to our point-of-sale system is critical because, among other things, this platform allows us to implement our digital marketing and pricing strategies, which will allow us to begin to optimize performance at these stores. And second, last week, S&P Global raised our credit rating to a BBB+ to reflect our larger and stronger company, which will have an immediate and future benefit on our cost of debt capital. So while we have just closed and we know it is still early, we are excited as we begin to realize the many future opportunities this merger creates for Extra Space and our shareholders. We will continue to give updates on the integration and performance of the Life Storage assets as well as our progress towards our $100 million in minimum estimated synergies. After some short-term dilution expected during the remainder of 2023, we believe we will be at least in our underwritten synergy run rate early in 2024 with additional upside beyond, as we continue to optimize the performance of the combined company and capture additional synergies not quantified in the original underwriting. It is still a great time to be in storage, and I believe the future of Extra Space remains bright. I will now turn the time over to Scott. So I think we see - the biggest difference we see in the back half of the year, frankly, is the comps get a lot easier. So we kind of see a continuation of modest growth, but with much easier comps. What was the second question, Michael? So we are not talking - we don't have any guidance. I'm not talking about guidance to 2024 yet. But clearly, where you end '23 is your, sorry to give a stupid answer, as a starting point for '24. So that will be the impact. Yes. We had thought by June, July, we would have had that conversions point, and now we think it's further into 2023. So on the revenue side, as I mentioned in my comments, we have 900-plus stores on our point-of-sale soft breeze and the ECRI notices have started going out. And we have a very detailed plan customer-by-customer, when do they get their last one, where their rate is, on street rate, not to overload any store, but that has started. And next week, we'll have all the rest of the stores on breeze and those ECRI notices will go out. And the confidence we have is because we've done this all the time. We take over stores all the time that have rates below where we want them and we send out ECRI notices, and we know the acceptance rate and the churn rate, and it gives us a high degree of confidence that's going to work. On the insurance side, once we're on breeze, new customers will purchase insurance from our platform, which is at a higher rate than LSI's program was and existing customers won't be converted until January 2024. Those notices will go out. And that delay is for both regulatory reasons and notice requirements in the existing LSI contract with their insurance provider. And then the third biggest kind of segment of the $100 million is the G&A side. And we've now sharpened our pencils, hired who we want to hire redone budgets department by department and have greatly increased confidence we will exceed the underwritten G&A savings. So I don't think that's going to be a significant impact. So you're right that street rate is a factor in the quantum of the ECRI that's given. But the gap between the rate at the LSI stores and the rate at the competitive Extra Space stores gives us confidence that there's still plenty of meat on that bone. So there's plenty of self-storage customers out there for the larger operators to capture, right? We're at 94.5% occupied. Obviously, we can keep our stores full. The challenge is there's not sufficient enough customers to give us pricing power. We can't move rates and maintain that type of occupancy to the level we wanted to. So our year-over-year rentals were down 9% in the second quarter so were Life Storage for comparison purpose. But vacates were also down a little less than that, but a similar number. So there's customers out there, our platform can capture them, but we don't have the pricing power we expected. Thanks Jeff. I don't think we can, we had an odd March. We couldn't figure that out as well. We've talked about that. We were feeling really good at the end of May, and there was a distinct change in customer behavior in June and July, and I would be guessing if I told you I knew what it was. I think housing is certainly a factor, right? That's one important component of demand for self-storage, and we all know the housing market story. I think another factor is consumers don't have as much money in their pocket, right? If the savings rate is way down, all the extra COVID dollars that were floating around have gone away. There's inflation in the economy. I think the consumers have fewer dollars as well. The biggest drivers, I think, are when we move positive in terms of achieved rates to new customers. And as we mentioned before, we do have an easier comp from last year. But I think that where you fall in that guidance is when those new customer rates move positive and you start to have a little bit of pricing power to new customers. Thanks Steve. So, I think it's too much of a generalization to say the Sunbelt is weak and the coast are strong or anything like that, right? Some of our best markets, Orlando, Tampa, Miami, continue to outperform portfolio averages. Those are Sunbelt markets. L.A. continues to be good. And some of the weaker markets, frankly, are markets that put up 30% growth last year. So, they - it's hard to do that several years in a row. So they appear weaker. But I think the important thing to remember is markets will cycle in a non-correlated factor - non-correlated manner. And because of that, it's important to be as diversified as possible. So, you always have some markets that are on the upswing, and you always have some markets that maybe are coming off of the upswing. And one of the reasons we like the LSI merger is because it further diversifies our portfolio and reduces our concentration in our top markets. So the one or two-year length of stay has decreased very slightly. We're still in the low 60% on the one year and 46% or so on the two-year - I think we are losing some of those long-term COVID tenants, but not all of them. But length of stay is still healthy. Our average vacating customer is almost 18 months, median is about 7.5 months. Those are great numbers as compared to pre-COVID. Thanks, Juan. So, I spoke a little bit about the systems integration. That's going well, and we'll continue to work on that. Data transmission is going well. We still have some work to do there, but no hiccups. People is not something you can just do in a couple of weeks. It will take us a while to fully train the Life Storage managers on our way of doing things. They can all take rentals now and do the basics, if you will. But they'll continue to get better and better. And as they do, the performance will improve. No. I don't think customers pay differently if they moved into a new store that just opened or whether they moved into a store that's been up and stabilized for a long time, right? They leave some point after their need for storage goes away. I think your thesis is right, right? We see a moderation of new supply, but at the same time, we see markets that had kind of excess COVID demand that's going away that build up new supply and now that may be moderating, creating more availability. So, I'm sorry if I didn't answer that question clearly. I think, it's an asset-by-asset analysis. Certainly, there are markets that are struggling because they had a lot of new supply delivered. It all got filled up during COVID. Now there's lesser demand. So maybe those markets are under a little more pressure. And I would give you Phoenix is a really good example of that. But I think it's a market analysis, not an asset analysis. It's not like all the excess COVID demand customers moved into the new property and the other - all the regular customers moved into the existing properties. So, the new properties are struggling more, the customers go everywhere, and the markets perform similarly. I hope that makes sense. Thanks, Todd. We would expect the LSI portfolio to do better as we get their stores on our platform, that uplift to begin to occur. Yes. I think that's a good description. So we talked to all of the managed owners that had LSI managing their stores. And our expectation is that everyone will migrate to our economics, which are significantly better than LSI's economics and also our kind of service levels. We run one program. Everyone is on the same program. LSI ran more of a customized program for their managed partners. And we will absolutely separate with some of those managed partners who don't want to work on our system, and that's fine because our goal is not to have the most stores, but to have an efficient profitable management program that works well for both parties. So, we'll continue to - we'll keep most, I think, and lose many, I think, as you said. But I'm very confident we'll continue to grow our management platform faster than anyone else in the industry. Thanks, Smedes. I would also say that we don't guess at these strategies. We test them pretty vigorously before we implement them and keep control groups. So, we know whether we're doing the right thing or if the situation changed. So because of that, I have a high degree of confidence, we executed the right strategy. Yes. Good memory. So, we did run some tests during that time period with significantly higher marketing expense, and we didn't see the return on those dollars spent, so we pulled back. And we'll continue to test as we always do, in what situations can we get an acceptable return on incremental marketing dollars. And whenever that's the case, we're happy to spend them. And if we can't get that return, we're not going to spend money for no reason at all. Thank you. Yes, it's a good question. So, we had initially had four components of underwritten synergies. We had G&A. We had reduced marketing spend. We had increased store revenue, and we had tenant insurance. Tenant insurance has stayed about the same. We feel better about G&A that we'll do better than that component. The marketing piece we will not achieve. We - since we did the underwriting, we have decided pursuing a dual brand strategy, which we can discuss, if you like. But the marketing savings was presumed to be under one brand. But we think that the revenue increase, the rental increase in revenue increase from two brands will more than offset the $50 million underwritten marketing savings, and we'll also save about $70 million or so of rebranding costs. So better in G&A, won't achieve the marketing savings, about the same in tenant insurance and better at the property level. Thanks Ronald. And we - sorry, on top of this, Scott. But we've also achieved non-underwritten synergies. We've got our rating upgrade, which will immediately save us on interest expenses this year and obviously, on any future borrowings. We sold warehouse anywhere to that management team at closing, which takes that loss off the books. And lots of other smaller things that were not in our $100 million that we're starting to achieve. Thank you, Ki Bin. So it's a good question. I think we really look at this on a long-term basis. And are there going to be some markets that we adopted from LSI? We weren't in Buffalo. How is Buffalo going to do? I'm not sure. Over the short term, they will be weaker and some will be stronger, sure. But what is really important is the increased diversification and to have greater variability in where all the cash flows come from is just going to help take volatility out of returns. So yes, some markets will do better. Some markets will be worse market cycle through performance. But over the long term, it's going to be a benefit to the company. Sure. So I think it's important to remember that even though public and Extra Space and cube and life are the largest brands. It's still a highly fragmented industry. And we don't control these markets in any respect. We have many, many stores where most or all of our competitors are mom-and-pops and not REIT. So we only have one or two REIT competitors. So we're going to continue to adopt strategies that we think produce the best long-term results for our shareholders and not really care about what it does to others. I would respectfully disagree. I think our private competitors are not all Gen 1 older. There's plenty of sophisticated private regional operators that have new store climate control that are very comparable to our stores. Their systems and their operating platforms aren't comparable to us at all. But from a tenant standpoint, the product is the same. Thank you, Jonathan. Yes. So Storage Express was a little harder, frankly, to put onto our systems than Life Storage because we had to put it on a system with a different operating model that we hadn't had program. But once they got on to our system, everything is working very well. And one of the reasons we're confident with the ECRI program for life storages, we just went through that ECRI program for Storage Express, and we saw how their customers accepted it. So in terms of integration very well. Operating through six months of the year ahead of underwriting, which is good. Growth is a little slower than we underwrote as we scaled that back while we were focused on the LSI merger. So we bought five or we've approved for purchase five remote stores, less than $30 million, so smaller stores, $130 a foot, but 7% yields in the first year. So once we can turn our full attention to growing this, we're excited about it. So the summary would be, everything on track or ahead of track going well, just slower growth than we thought as we turned our attention to integrating Life Storage. Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, our strategies are based on results of testing that we do. And our - the results of those tests have led us to have a strong conviction that we want to have incrementally higher occupancies. We want to seek the longer-term customers, and both of those things come at the expense of initial rate and try to make that up through ECRI. So I apologize if we've spoken too much about occupancy, but it is a tool to maximize revenue. Thanks. Great. Thank you, everyone, for your time today. I want to emphasize and assure everyone that everyone here at our combined teams is very focused not only on integrating the companies, but maximizing performance at our stores as a difficult time. We are very, very excited about the future. We see a lot of tailwinds in 2024 is beyond as the underwritten and non-underwritten synergies from LSI hit the books, given the moderating delivery of new stores, given that we have $0.23 of dilution from lease-up stores that will come to the bottom line, that eventually interest rates will be lower. Eventually, the housing market will recover, and we will continue to grow our ancillary management bridge loan and insurance businesses. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had another solid quarter, meeting our internal same-store NOI and FFO projections. The modest miss in property revenue in June was offset by expense savings and other small beats in interest income, G&A and higher management fees were offset by higher interest expense and lower tenant insurance. After tightening year-over-year achieved rate to new customers to negative 3% in March, we backed off on rates and averaged approximately negative 8% in April, which immediately drove higher rental volumes. We saw similar traction in May but then saw rental volume slow in June and July, despite keeping new customer rates down approximately 10% year-over-year. On the expense front, we are performing well with minimal payroll and property tax growth and marketing expense remaining in line with our expectations. However, we have experienced additional pressure in insurance expense premiums in the property and casualty markets with average premium increases in our June renewal of approximately 50%. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed a $450 million bond offering in the quarter and completed a recast of our credit facility, bringing revolving capacity to approximately $2 billion in preparation for the Life Storage merger. We also closed on a term loan of $1 billion with a delayed draw feature that we accessed at closing to pay off Life Storage's line of credit, private placement debt and other closing costs. In last night's earnings release, we updated our 2023 guidance ranges for same-store growth expectations and core FFO, which do not include the impact of the recently closed merger with Life Storage. Given the tight timing between the closing -- between closing the merger on July 20 and yesterday's release, we provided standalone guidance for Extra Space, excluding the impact of the merger with separate details about the anticipated dilution from the merger in the remainder of 2023. Despite meeting our internal projections for same-store NOI and core FFO, we have reduced our forward-looking estimates given the lower than forecasted pricing power and rental volume experienced in June and July as well as the upswing in the forward interest rate curve. Our outlook for same-store revenue growth, which does not include the LSI assets is now 2.5% to 3.5%. We have also reduced our same-store expense range to 3.5% to 4.5% due to better-than-expected payroll and property tax, resulting in a revised NOI range of 2% to 3.5%. Our expectation remains that the rate of revenue growth deceleration continues to flatten in the back half of the year with easing comparables. Our core FFO range, excluding the impact of the LSI merger, is reduced to $8.15 to $8.35 per share, driven primarily by lower property revenues and higher anticipated interest rates. For the Life Storage merger, we estimate initial dilution in 2023 as we integrate and optimize the portfolio to capture our anticipated synergies. We estimate $0.10 to $0.15 of dilution per share in 2023, and we believe that we will be at our $100 million run rate in early 2024. Details of the second quarter performance of Life Storage have been provided in our supplemental package, and we will provide updates on the performance of the LSI assets going forward. We continue to believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in the REIT space. We believe our operating platform and highly diversified portfolio has become even stronger through the Life Storage merger and that is positioned for outsized growth. With that, Latif, let's open it up for questions. Yes, Jeff. So what we were seeing earlier in the year was we were seeing our street rates or our achieved rates to new customers steadily moving up, and we were seeing that our occupancy gap was maintaining what we were expecting. That was pretty consistent through May. As we moved into June, we found that in order to maintain our occupancy, we needed the lower rates. And that continued into July. And so into July, we were negative 10.5% whereas in the second quarter, our rates were averaged about 8% negative to new customers. So just that change in customers being shopping more and being much more rate sensitive is what caused us to change our outlook going forward. And Jeff, maybe where we vary a little bit from some of the other reports that have been out there is while they may see increases in rental some of it could be what happened last year and also what their new rate is moving in. And I think some of them reported a wider gap than what we have even experienced. Yes. So the easier comps do continue into '24 as rates moderated in the back half of last year in terms of our rates to new customers, they continue to moderate it back half of last year and into this year. In addition, you have an easier revenue comp this year than you had from last year. Our revenue growth the first half of 2022 was almost 22%. Thanks Jeff. Yes. So, the low end assumes that you don't get pricing power, the high end assumes that you start to get some of that pricing power. And it's probably more in the back half of - the end of the year where you start to see the benefit of it. Any pricing power you got in August, you might start to see some benefit later in the year. If you don't get pricing power until November, December, you're not going to see anything this year. It's more of the year-over-year comp. We have actually been able to move street rates sequentially, as we've moved through this year, but the year-over-year comp has made them negative. And maybe I'll speak to the results, and Joe can take the integration piece. First of all, they were still managing their properties. So clearly, we couldn't go in and manage them the way we would have liked to. I think that what we saw was occupancy fell off more than we would have expected, and we would attribute that to them keeping rates too high in May and June. When they've lowered them, you've seen it move in the positive direction in the month of July, they finished the month of July around 91%. So it ticked up slightly, but they did not see that busy season bump than we would have expected. And then in terms of the integration, Joe? So have not fully determined '24. We think it is likely, because it's probably the best way to show the improvement. If you compare our same-store pool to theirs, you should be able to see them outperforming due to them being on our systems. But I think it's likely, but no final decision yet. Yes, Todd, you're probably seeing it a little bit more in rate than you are occupancy. We have been able to maintain the occupancy at those newer stores, but you have - the ability to push rates has not been there. So, there is some growth there, but not significant. Typically, what happens is you bring things onto our portfolio is it takes a month or two as you bring things on. And so not a significant amount of increase, but we would expect those stores to start to benefit from the ECRI. Smedes, one other point I would make there is, I think there's been some narrative that we are going to lose some of these customers, and Life Storage actually added 17 stores during the quarter. So, they've continued to add to their management portfolio through Q2. I'm not sure we have that kind of power, first of all, to create that kind of environment. I think we typically react, or based on the data that we're reviewing to maintain the occupancy and maintain the pricing power in terms of our existing customer rate increases. So if you look at big picture, I think we were probably one of the earlier ones to move on rate. And I think everyone else eventually, we'd like to have the hubris to think they copied us, but I think they probably saw the same thing in the data that we saw, and they moved on rates also to maintain occupancy. Yes. So, I think what we've seen early in the summer in July, is that there is demand. You just can't get the occupancy and the rate. As we move throughout this year, we have easier comparables from last year. And so that's where it gives us the confidence to be able to go with the numbers that we've done - that we've gone with. We think that it gets easier as we move through this year in terms of new customer rates. And so that's where we're confident. And again, as we mentioned before, where you are in that range is going to depend somewhat on how quickly we get some pricing power. So if you look at the lower end of the guidance, I think it does imply that you could tick negative for a period of time in the back half of the year. Yes. When we announced the deal, we said that it would be just under 1% accretive and that assumes the full $100 million. So assuming we hit the run rate early next year, clearly, it shouldn't be dilutive next year. And you should start achieving a portion of that 1% accretion. Now as Joe mentioned, some of these, I think, will hit earlier than others. I think G&A will start achieving some of that this year immediately. The marketing, we - marketing and revenue increases, we'll start to achieve as we send out rate increases. You can't send them all out at day one. Some of these tenants received a rate increase a month ago. And then the last one is the tenant insurance, and that should be effective January 1. So your difference between those two numbers is your existing customer rates are more than that 15%, and that's what's created the negative churn gap that we have today. So, we have not quantified the LSI ECRIs other than the fact that we've said with the synergies, there is $50 million that has to do with ECRIs as well as potential occupancy upside. When we did the initial underwriting and the initial deck that went out with the acquisition. We showed two studies that we had done that showed a pretty significant gap between rate per square foot on their stores and our stores. And we did not assume that we closed that gap 100%. We assume that we only closed about one-third of that gap. We did not quantify anything in terms of the back half of 2Q in terms of ECRI. Thanks Jonathan."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. And now, I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program Mr. Jeff Norman. Please go ahead, sir.\nJeff Norman: Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Extra Space Storage\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings call. In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the Company\u2019s business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the Company\u2019s latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review. Forward-looking statements represent management\u2019s estimates as of today, May 3, 2023. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you, Jeff. And thank you, everyone, for joining today\u2019s call. We have had an exciting couple of months, and a lot has happened since our fourth quarter earnings call in late February. Operationally, occupancy remained very strong through the first quarter, ending March at 93.5%, our highest first quarter result outside of the COVID years. Our strategy to maintain high occupancy through the winter allowed us to sequentially increase rates to new and existing customers through the first quarter, driving same-store revenue growth of 7.4%. Same-store expenses were lower than expected due to normalizing payroll expense growth, as well as year-over-year savings from repairs and maintenance and property taxes. As expected our same-store NOI growth rate moderated sequentially from the fourth quarter due to an exceptionally difficult 2022 comparable and was modestly ahead of our internal projections at 8.7%. We have also been busy on the external growth front. We continued to grow our third-party management platform with net additions of 44 stores. We acquired six stores primarily in joint venture structures. We originated $53 million in bridge loans. We started our external growth phase of our remote storage strategy, approving three remote model acquisitions, two of which are in our primary markets. Subsequent to quarter-end, we closed the second preferred investment with an affiliate of SmartStop in the amount of $150 million. And of course on April 3rd, we announced a strategic merger with Life Storage through a leverage neutral all stock deal. We believe this combination will produce an even more formidable portfolio, team and platform with over 3,500 stores across 43 states. We anticipate that there are at least $100 million in annual run rate synergies with this transaction that neither company could have created on their own. So far, everything is on track to successfully complete the merger in the second half of the year. And as we continue to refine our integration plan, we are even more confident that we can achieve at least our stated synergies. Further, there are additional potential growth drivers and synergies not captured in the minimum target of $100 million. These include additional expense savings due to increased scale, a lower cost of capital, a 50% increase in data, which could further improve property performance, a larger pool of properties to evaluate opportunities, such as expansion, redevelopment, and solar installation and finally, broader industry relationships, which will provide greater reach and scale to offer potential products and services and build our acquisition pipeline. We are working hard to complete the pending merger and I appreciate the efforts of the teams from both companies and the way they have remained focused on driving the existing business as we enter the busy leasing season. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had another good quarter, beating our internal FFO projections by $0.04. The beat was driven by better than expected property net operating income, lower G&A and higher management fees and tenant insurance. Interest income and interest expense both came in modestly lower than modeled, generally offsetting each other. Achieved rates to new customers have been improving sequentially since bottoming out in November. In January, year-over-year rates improved to approximately negative 14%; in February, they were negative 11%; and in March they were negative 3%. We did see lower rental volume in March at those rates. And in April, our pricing algorithms dropped rates modestly with average achieved rates in April closer to negative 7% year-over-year, contributing to higher rental volumes in April. Turning to the balance sheet, we completed a $500 million bond offering of five-year notes with a coupon of 5.7%. We used the proceeds to reduce our revolver balances to less than $100 million at the end of the quarter, leaving over $1 billion in revolving capacity. We reduced our floating interest rate exposure to 22% of total debt net of variable rate receivables. Shortly after the announcement of our proposed merger with Life Storage, S&P Global updated our rating to CreditWatch positive, confirming its view that the proposed transaction is credit-enhancing, given the increase in scale and potential synergy opportunities. We reaffirmed our guidance ranges for same-store growth expectations and core FFO, which do not include the impact of the proposed merger with Life Storage. We made modifications to our 2023 outlook to capture the SmartStop preferred investment, delays in bridge loan closings, the impact of our bond deal on interest expense, and other adjustments to tenant insurance in G&A. Property net operating income in the first quarter was modestly ahead of our expectations. As we progress through the leasing season, we will monitor achieved rates to new customers, rental and vacate trends, web traffic and top of funnel demand before revisiting these guidance ranges after the second quarter. As mentioned on our fourth quarter call, our guidance assumes positive same-store revenue growth for and throughout the full year. It assumes the growth rate moderates more quickly in the first half of the year, due to exceptionally difficult first half comps, troughs in this summer and modestly reaccelerates late in the year. Much of our NOI growth is offset by the first year headwind of our investment in non-stabilized properties, which carry approximately $0.23 of dilution, the modification of the NexPoint preferred investment and higher interest rates. While each of these headwinds slows our 2023 growth, we believe they will result in stronger long-term growth rates over a multiyear period for shareholders. We\u2019re off to a great start in 2023. We believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in the REIT space, and that the sector will continue to produce healthy, albeit moderating year-over-year growth. We believe our operating platform and highly diversified portfolio will become even stronger through the Life Storage merger and are well positioned for another solid year. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc.\nTodd Thomas: I just wanted first to ask about occupancy in April. If you could talk a little bit about any post quarter updates there, where you stand year-over-year and just talk about rental demand coming out of March a little bit in greater detail.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Our occupancy at the end of April increased about 30 basis points. At the end of April, we were 93.8%. So we actually are in a good position moving into the rental season. We saw good rental activity during the month of April.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And within the guidance framework, where would you expect to see occupancy kind of peak in June, July? It seems like the quarter-end occupancy, which was about 10 basis points below the quarter average was a little unusual from a seasonal standpoint. Are you pleased with the occupancy improvements that you\u2019re seeing, is it a little bit below what you were anticipating? And, yes, if you could just talk about what you expect in terms of the peak during the rental season?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So, as we did our guidance, we focused obviously on revenue, but in that number, we do assume that occupancy is a negative delta compared to last year, less than 1%, you\u2019re up against two of the toughest years, the last two years with the COVID peaks. But there is a slight negative headwind with occupancy throughout the entire year. It\u2019s pretty consistent.\nTodd Thomas: And last question, in terms of the guidance, so you updated the dilution that you expect from C of O and value add acquisitions was $0.25 initially, it\u2019s $0.23. Is that -- what\u2019s driving that? And is that related to the guidance going forward for the balance of the year or -- I mean, is that the full year dilution that\u2019s actually been increased and -- or decreased and is an improvement relative to the initial guidance?\nScott Stubbs: It\u2019s actually an improvement of $0.02 compared to initial guidance, and it\u2019s from two things. Leased up properties are filling up faster, and then it assumes that the timing on a couple of the C of O and acquisitions is bumped back slightly.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael, you might have your phone on mute. Moving on, one moment. Our next question then comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO. Your question, please?\nJuan Sanabria: Joe, I think you mentioned at the top the remote storage acquisitions. Could you just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing early days there, and what the opportunity set could be going forward? And any thoughts about how that could tie in with Life Storage, recognizing it\u2019s early days there?\nJoe Margolis: I don\u2019t know if everyone\u2019s having this problem. We have a very bad connection. Could you repeat the question, please? We couldn\u2019t hear it here.\nJuan Sanabria: Sure. Is that better?\nJoe Margolis: A little bit. Yes.\nJuan Sanabria: Just curious, Joe, you talked about the remote storage investments in the first quarter\u2026\nJoe Margolis: We can\u2019t here.\nJuan Sanabria: Just curious, Joe, you mentioned remote storage acquisitions in the first quarter. Just curious on what early learnings are and what that opportunity set is. And if there\u2019s any tie-ins or expansion opportunities to that opportunity with Life Storage pending transaction, just curious on -- bigger picture thoughts on what that could represent for you guys?\nJoe Margolis: It\u2019s a great question. So with respect to the opportunity set, I think it\u2019s masked, right, the number of small stores in our market that we traditionally would not look at for acquisition, because we could not efficiently manage them without permanent -- 100% on site management is huge. And not only existing storage but just vacant space, we can turn it this storage that is small. And then, we will undertake an effort to go through the Life Storage portfolio and see which of their stores would be candidates for this type of different management model. So, it is an exciting opportunity set that we will look at.\nJuan Sanabria: Is there a different margin that these remote storage spaces are capable of generating?\nJoe Margolis: I think the margin is not different, but the efficiencies gained by managing them through the remote platforms make the margins acceptable. You can get to the right margin, because you have the reduced expenses, if that makes sense.\nJuan Sanabria: Yes, it does. And then just curious, you talked about and seemingly are very confident on the synergies from the pending LSI transaction. I was hoping maybe you could just unpack a little bit what\u2019s driving that increased enthusiasm post the transaction being announced?\nJoe Margolis: Well, we\u2019re certainly learning more about the opportunities within the Life Storage portfolio, and the synergies we could gain by combining that portfolio with ours. I\u2019ll give you just one simple example. In our underwriting, we assumed we would need to have six new regional offices. We\u2019ve now gone through everything and we\u2019re going to end up with four regional offices. So, that\u2019s just one example of many incremental savings that we think we can achieve. And we also become more and more confident on the revenue synergies as we learn more and more.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal from Evercore ISI.\nSamir Khanal: [Technical Difficulty] you\u2019ve implemented. Just trying to -- whether it\u2019s markets, regionally, anything you\u2019ve seen, clearly we\u2019ve had the headline risk out there with the banks, the regional banks. Just wondering, is there any signs that you\u2019re seeing at all at this point?\nJeff Norman: Samir, we only picked up about second half of your question. Could you repeat the full question?\nSamir Khanal: I was asking about whether you\u2019re seeing any pushback from existing customers on price increases, whether it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve seen a lot of headlines over the last few months, right, regional banks having issues. I don\u2019t know if you can make some comments around markets where you see maybe occupancy drops or bad debt pickup? Just trying to see any sort of things that may -- on the negative side or pushback that you may have been getting from existing customers on the price increases.\nJoe Margolis: So, it\u2019s a good kind of health-of-the-customer question. And to answer specifically your question, we have not. We peaked out at about 800 basis points greater move out from customers who receive the ECRIs than those who didn\u2019t. And that has trailed back down towards the more normal rate and it has stabilized in a number that\u2019s a little higher than normal, but our ECRIs are a little higher than normal. So still a very manageable number and justifies the program. But, we also see signs of health in the customer in our very low bad debt under 2%, and willingness of customers on the demand side. The strength of demand, which frankly isn\u2019t as good as it was during the COVID years, but if you look at demand statistics compared to pre-COVID years, it is pretty comparable. Demand is still strong in this sector.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Got it. And I guess, for Scott, just as a second question, I know in the last earnings call, you spoke about expense pressures that you could face this year. I mean, you\u2019re doing about 3.5% growth in the first quarter. Maybe talk us through kind of what you\u2019re expecting for expense pressures? And maybe what are you seeing so far sort of year-to-date?\nScott Stubbs: So, if you look at our expenses, payroll is progressing as expected. We expected it to go back to a more moderate pace than what we\u2019ve seen in the past year. And we saw that at 3.9% in the first quarter, and we would expect that to continue to moderate as we move throughout the year. Moving to the other big expense items, payroll -- property taxes were actually a benefit to us in the quarter. We were negative and we would not expect that throughout the remainder of the year. We would expect that to be an inflationary plus. The other one that was a benefit in the quarter is snow removal, which living in Utah, we never would have guessed we had lower snow removal throughout the rest of the U.S., but it was actually a benefit for us in the quarter. In terms of other expense items that we expect some potential pressure moving forward, we do our property -- we renew our property and casualty insurance 1st of June, and we would expect that to see another sizable bump similar to what I think everybody\u2019s experiencing.\nSamir Khanal: And what\u2019s -- just as a follow-up, what\u2019s the size of it? Can you just sort of quantify that as we think about from a modeling perspective?\nScott Stubbs: We\u2019re still in the early phases, but it\u2019s definitely double digits, and could be significant. The other expense item that ran at 11% in the quarter is marketing, and we\u2019ll use that as needed throughout the year, if we find that we find positive returns on our marketing spend and we can spend that instead of cutting rates. Obviously, that\u2019s the first area we\u2019ll look.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl from Wolfe Research.\nKeegan Carl: Maybe first just on your same-store pool breakouts. Can you help us better understand the outperformance of the 2023 pool relative to the 2022 pool, especially given that occupancy was higher in the 2022 pool?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Your benefit comes from adding properties that are finishing the final stages of lease-up and those properties either came from C of O properties or acquisitions. And so as they stabilize, rates typically continue to outperform the same-store pool. Our definition goes back to our IPO of our same-store pool, and that\u2019s 80% occupancy, or we have to own them for a year. So, we do see some benefit. If you look at the three pools in our subs, and each year, it gets a little slower.\nKeegan Carl: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess on the acquisition market, just kind of curious, what are you guys seeing as far as volumes and cap rates? And how should we be thinking about it the rest of the year? And I guess, as an adjacent one to that, I mean, how is it impacting your bridge lending program?\nJoe Margolis: Good question. So, volumes in the transaction market are significantly down. There\u2019s not a lot of distress in the self-storage market, so sellers don\u2019t have to sell. And if they don\u2019t get the price they want, they don\u2019t sell. So, there\u2019s a significant bid-ask spread. The deals we do see trade all seem to have some unique story. Not sure there\u2019s enough of a market to tell you what cap rates are because everything seems to be unique. And unfortunately, our bridge loan volumes were slower in the first quarter than we expected. Now, that being said, there is some seasonality to this business. If you look back at three or four years we\u2019ve been doing this, we always end up closing the most loans or proving the most loans in the second half of the year. So, we hope we follow the same pattern, but we were a little slower than expected in the first quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Your question, please?\nMichael Goldsmith: Can anyone hear me?\nJeff Norman: We can year you now.\nMichael Goldsmith: Okay, great. My first question is just about the cadence through the -- this quarter, you talked about street rates moving from down 14% to down 3% January through March, and then kind of returning back down to 7% in April. It sounds like from a lot of your peers that March was a particularly challenging month. So, I was wondering what you were seeing that -- are you able to kind of parse out what was going on between the demand side relative to where you set rates versus just kind of like the overall demand environment in March and how that translated into April?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I don\u2019t want to overstate the difficulties of March, right? I think we pushed a little harder with rates than maybe we should, which is fine, right? That\u2019s what the algorithm should do. They should try to find that point of resistance. And we went from minus 11% in February all the way to minus 3% in March, and we did see that there was some weakness at that level and the systems brought things back and we\u2019re recovering. So yes, March wasn\u2019t the best month in our last four months. But overall, the last four months have been strong. It\u2019s been good for us. As Scott says, we\u2019re overperforming our expectations.\nMichael Goldsmith: And my follow-up is related to the bridge lending program. Can you provide a little bit more color on just kind of the reasoning why deals may have been falling out? I would think this would be a good environment for bridge lending. And sort of related to that, there was a nice pickup in the third-party management net stores that you added. So, can you just talk a little bit about the appetite for kind of independent players looking for third-party management in this environment? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So with respect to bridge loans, you have a couple of things going on. One, you have seasonality, which I mentioned. The second is, we had a couple of deals get dropped, deals we had already signed a term sheet, collected a commitment fee, was in our numbers for pipeline and the borrower walked on the commitment fee. And then, we had a couple that were delayed. So normal, I think, volatility in a business, and we will hope to pick it up in the second half of the year. With respect to management, we had a great quarter. We picked up 11 stores from NexPoint as part of our strategic relationship with them and the 37 other stores, and the churn is much less in the management business. We only lost 4 stores in the quarter because the transaction market is so slow. And one of those we bought into a JV. So we had a great start to our management business. We expect to have a great second quarter as well. And it\u2019s -- one of the advantages of having multiple growth drivers is that when one might be growing a little more slowly, another one could be growing a little more quickly. And it always allows us to grow the overall enterprise.\nMichael Goldsmith: Can you provide a little bit more specifics around why some of the bridge lending deals would be dropped? Are they -- is it a reflection of the self-storage environment? Is it -- reflects like the lending environment, the appetite for others to lend? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of kind of factors surrounding that bridge loan program.\nJoe Margolis: So, some of our bridge loans are commitments to issue the loan upon completion of construction, right, because we won\u2019t lend until the property has a CO and is operational. And when the project gets built and the CO is issued, if the owner has a different plan, maybe he sells the property instead of borrowing it or maybe he finances it some other way, they have the option to walk from their commitment fee and not take the loan.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: So first question, your New York City Metro area same-store revenue decelerated a little bit further than your portfolio average. I\u2019m not sure what was the cause. If it is a comp issue, or if you\u2019re seeing additional pressures in the new supply deliveries in Northern New Jersey, but any kind of color you can share would be helpful.\nJoe Margolis: I think those certainly are both important factors to that. I think you\u2019ve circled that Ki Bin.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And in terms of the LSI merger and the synergy math that you\u2019ve talked about, a lot of the focus has been about getting the synergies from the LSI portfolio, but I was wondering if you can maybe take a different perspective and look at it from a combined basis. What is the upside from the combined company in terms of improving the overall NOI picture -- NOI margin picture and maybe close the gap between you and your larger peer?\nJoe Margolis: What was the gap in terms of margin?\nKi Bin Kim: Yes.\nJoe Margolis: So, I think margin is a difficult thing to compare because it\u2019s not apples and apples, right? So for example, if one company has a much larger deductible on their insurance program, they may have a lower insurance cost, but they\u2019re taking more risk. Neither one is right nor wrong, but they\u2019re just different strategies that will affect your margin. Secondly, margin is affected by what you include at a store level cost and what you include at G&A level cost. So I wouldn\u2019t look at -- compare our margin to our largest peers and assume that it\u2019s an apples-to-apples comparison. But I really appreciate your question, which is, do we think there are additional synergies in the overall portfolio that aren\u2019t in the underwritten number that we\u2019ve given? And it\u2019s absolutely true. I mean, just things like densification, right? If we now have a district manager, our district managers cover about 17 stores. And because of our portfolio footprint there have 8 stores in 1 city and 10 stores in another, that\u2019s inefficient. It has travel costs and other negative impacts. But as we get more and more stores and those footprints of the district managers get smaller, one, they can take on more stores, which reduces the number of district managers we need; and second of all, just become more efficient in their coverage of those stores. So, there\u2019s a lot of those types of synergies that we absolutely expect to achieve that are not in any of our numbers. The other thing is the testing with running a second brand and whether the revenue uplift from the second brand will more than cover the cost of maintaining a second brand, and we\u2019re hopeful and optimistic that we are going to figure that one out as well.\nKi Bin Kim: And, Joe, you talked about the benefit of having more data, but there\u2019s obviously a diminishing return to that because this 50% more data doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re 50% more better. So, can you just talk a little bit more about that and what the upside looks like from a more tangible standpoint?\nJoe Margolis: So if you went and talk to our data scientists, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d agree with that. They can\u2019t get enough data. But yes, I mean, I think, logically, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not 1:1, but it\u2019s certain -- there certainly is a benefit -- from nothing else in just the speed in which you can get statistically significant results, right? We can run tests faster and then implement whatever the optimized solution is quicker because with more data in a bigger pool, you get this statistical significance quicker.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just two quick ones for me. So, one is on the -- just going back to the tenants that are coming through some of the online or the mobile, just after a couple of years, a couple of quarters from COVID now, any sort of learnings in terms of how they\u2019re behaving versus sort of tenants that are coming into the store? Is it the same? Is there sort of any noticeable difference?\nJoe Margolis: So, we\u2019ve always observed differences of tenant behavior depending on what channel they come through, both in terms of what\u2019s an effective tool to capture that tenant and what their behavior is in terms of unit size, length of stay, other factors. And we\u2019re constantly refining the differences in our different channels that is the results of those learnings.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then the -- just going back to the expenses, the property tax being negative. I know you touched on it, but can you give a little bit more color sort of what happened there on the negative growth on the property taxes? Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: That\u2019s primarily appeals that we won during the quarter then revised numbers going forward. So it really relates primarily to prior periods as you win those appeals from prior periods.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.\nMichael Mueller: I guess a couple of questions. First of all, going forward, should we think of the bridge loan program and balances as kind of going up and down based on acquisition opportunities, or should we really be thinking about that business as being completely independent regardless of what you\u2019re thinking about the acquisition markets?\nJoe Margolis: I think the latter. I think our capital position is such, one that we can fund bridge loans that we feel are good deals and do so in a capital-light manner because we can sell the A notes and not restrict ourselves from good acquisition opportunities because we\u2019re making bridge loans and vice versa.\nMichael Mueller: Got it. Okay. And second question, I apologize if it was discussed before. But part of Scott\u2019s comments I think were a little garbled, at least on my end. But can you touch on the percentage of customers that have been in place over a year and over two years? And if you\u2019re seeing any degradation in that ratio?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So, if you look at our customers that have been with us for more than two years, that number is now in the upper-40s, about 47%. Customers that have been with us 12 to 18 months, that\u2019s in the low-60s. That number has actually come down some. So, long-term customers, beyond two years is increasing. That midterm customer has actually come down a little bit.\nOperator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Joe Margolis for any further remarks.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your time and your interest. I want to thank the LSI team for their great cooperation, professionalism and efforts over the past many weeks. I\u2019ve been very impressed with every individual we have interacted with, how they\u2019ve handled themselves, and I\u2019m very grateful. I also want to assure our shareholders that while we are spending a lot of time preparing for this merger and it\u2019s time consuming and a significant effort, everyone at Extra Space Storage remains focused on the fundamentals of our business, which is driving performance in our stores. Thank you very much. I hope everyone has a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. And thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We have had an exciting couple of months, and a lot has happened since our fourth quarter earnings call in late February. Operationally, occupancy remained very strong through the first quarter, ending March at 93.5%, our highest first quarter result outside of the COVID years. Our strategy to maintain high occupancy through the winter allowed us to sequentially increase rates to new and existing customers through the first quarter, driving same-store revenue growth of 7.4%. Same-store expenses were lower than expected due to normalizing payroll expense growth, as well as year-over-year savings from repairs and maintenance and property taxes. As expected our same-store NOI growth rate moderated sequentially from the fourth quarter due to an exceptionally difficult 2022 comparable and was modestly ahead of our internal projections at 8.7%. We have also been busy on the external growth front. We continued to grow our third-party management platform with net additions of 44 stores. We acquired six stores primarily in joint venture structures. We originated $53 million in bridge loans. We started our external growth phase of our remote storage strategy, approving three remote model acquisitions, two of which are in our primary markets. Subsequent to quarter-end, we closed the second preferred investment with an affiliate of SmartStop in the amount of $150 million. And of course on April 3rd, we announced a strategic merger with Life Storage through a leverage neutral all stock deal. We believe this combination will produce an even more formidable portfolio, team and platform with over 3,500 stores across 43 states. We anticipate that there are at least $100 million in annual run rate synergies with this transaction that neither company could have created on their own. So far, everything is on track to successfully complete the merger in the second half of the year. And as we continue to refine our integration plan, we are even more confident that we can achieve at least our stated synergies. Further, there are additional potential growth drivers and synergies not captured in the minimum target of $100 million. These include additional expense savings due to increased scale, a lower cost of capital, a 50% increase in data, which could further improve property performance, a larger pool of properties to evaluate opportunities, such as expansion, redevelopment, and solar installation and finally, broader industry relationships, which will provide greater reach and scale to offer potential products and services and build our acquisition pipeline. We are working hard to complete the pending merger and I appreciate the efforts of the teams from both companies and the way they have remained focused on driving the existing business as we enter the busy leasing season. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott. I don't know if everyone's having this problem. We have a very bad connection. Could you repeat the question, please? We couldn't hear it here. A little bit. Yes. We can't here. It's a great question. So with respect to the opportunity set, I think it's masked, right, the number of small stores in our market that we traditionally would not look at for acquisition, because we could not efficiently manage them without permanent -- 100% on site management is huge. And not only existing storage but just vacant space, we can turn it this storage that is small. And then, we will undertake an effort to go through the Life Storage portfolio and see which of their stores would be candidates for this type of different management model. So, it is an exciting opportunity set that we will look at. I think the margin is not different, but the efficiencies gained by managing them through the remote platforms make the margins acceptable. You can get to the right margin, because you have the reduced expenses, if that makes sense. Well, we're certainly learning more about the opportunities within the Life Storage portfolio, and the synergies we could gain by combining that portfolio with ours. I'll give you just one simple example. In our underwriting, we assumed we would need to have six new regional offices. We've now gone through everything and we're going to end up with four regional offices. So, that's just one example of many incremental savings that we think we can achieve. And we also become more and more confident on the revenue synergies as we learn more and more. So, it's a good kind of health-of-the-customer question. And to answer specifically your question, we have not. We peaked out at about 800 basis points greater move out from customers who receive the ECRIs than those who didn't. And that has trailed back down towards the more normal rate and it has stabilized in a number that's a little higher than normal, but our ECRIs are a little higher than normal. So still a very manageable number and justifies the program. But, we also see signs of health in the customer in our very low bad debt under 2%, and willingness of customers on the demand side. The strength of demand, which frankly isn't as good as it was during the COVID years, but if you look at demand statistics compared to pre-COVID years, it is pretty comparable. Demand is still strong in this sector. Good question. So, volumes in the transaction market are significantly down. There's not a lot of distress in the self-storage market, so sellers don't have to sell. And if they don't get the price they want, they don't sell. So, there's a significant bid-ask spread.

So yes, March wasn't the best month in our last four months. But overall, the last four months have been strong. It's been good for us. As Scott says, we're overperforming our expectations. Sure. So with respect to bridge loans, you have a couple of things going on. One, you have seasonality, which I mentioned. The second is, we had a couple of deals get dropped, deals we had already signed a term sheet, collected a commitment fee, was in our numbers for pipeline and the borrower walked on the commitment fee.

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had another good quarter, beating our internal FFO projections by $0.04. The beat was driven by better than expected property net operating income, lower G&A and higher management fees and tenant insurance. Interest income and interest expense both came in modestly lower than modeled, generally offsetting each other. Achieved rates to new customers have been improving sequentially since bottoming out in November. In January, year-over-year rates improved to approximately negative 14%; in February, they were negative 11%; and in March they were negative 3%. We did see lower rental volume in March at those rates. And in April, our pricing algorithms dropped rates modestly with average achieved rates in April closer to negative 7% year-over-year, contributing to higher rental volumes in April. Turning to the balance sheet, we completed a $500 million bond offering of five-year notes with a coupon of 5.7%. We used the proceeds to reduce our revolver balances to less than $100 million at the end of the quarter, leaving over $1 billion in revolving capacity. We reduced our floating interest rate exposure to 22% of total debt net of variable rate receivables. Shortly after the announcement of our proposed merger with Life Storage, S&P Global updated our rating to CreditWatch positive, confirming its view that the proposed transaction is credit-enhancing, given the increase in scale and potential synergy opportunities. We reaffirmed our guidance ranges for same-store growth expectations and core FFO, which do not include the impact of the proposed merger with Life Storage. We made modifications to our 2023 outlook to capture the SmartStop preferred investment, delays in bridge loan closings, the impact of our bond deal on interest expense, and other adjustments to tenant insurance in G&A. Property net operating income in the first quarter was modestly ahead of our expectations. As we progress through the leasing season, we will monitor achieved rates to new customers, rental and vacate trends, web traffic and top of funnel demand before revisiting these guidance ranges after the second quarter. As mentioned on our fourth quarter call, our guidance assumes positive same-store revenue growth for and throughout the full year. It assumes the growth rate moderates more quickly in the first half of the year, due to exceptionally difficult first half comps, troughs in this summer and modestly reaccelerates late in the year. Much of our NOI growth is offset by the first year headwind of our investment in non-stabilized properties, which carry approximately $0.23 of dilution, the modification of the NexPoint preferred investment and higher interest rates. While each of these headwinds slows our 2023 growth, we believe they will result in stronger long-term growth rates over a multiyear period for shareholders. We're off to a great start in 2023. We believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in the REIT space, and that the sector will continue to produce healthy, albeit moderating year-over-year growth. We believe our operating platform and highly diversified portfolio will become even stronger through the Life Storage merger and are well positioned for another solid year. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes. Our occupancy at the end of April increased about 30 basis points. At the end of April, we were 93.8%. So we actually are in a good position moving into the rental season. We saw good rental activity during the month of April. Yes. So, as we did our guidance, we focused obviously on revenue, but in that number, we do assume that occupancy is a negative delta compared to last year, less than 1%, you're up against two of the toughest years, the last two years with the COVID peaks. But there is a slight negative headwind with occupancy throughout the entire year. It's pretty consistent. It's actually an improvement of $0.02 compared to initial guidance, and it's from two things. Leased up properties are filling up faster, and then it assumes that the timing on a couple of the C of O and acquisitions is bumped back slightly. So, if you look at our expenses, payroll is progressing as expected. We expected it to go back to a more moderate pace than what we've seen in the past year. And we saw that at 3.9% in the first quarter, and we would expect that to continue to moderate as we move throughout the year. Moving to the other big expense items, payroll -- property taxes were actually a benefit to us in the quarter. We were negative and we would not expect that throughout the remainder of the year. We would expect that to be an inflationary plus. The other one that was a benefit in the quarter is snow removal, which living in Utah, we never would have guessed we had lower snow removal throughout the rest of the U.S., but it was actually a benefit for us in the quarter. In terms of other expense items that we expect some potential pressure moving forward, we do our property -- we renew our property and casualty insurance 1st of June, and we would expect that to see another sizable bump similar to what I think everybody's experiencing. We're still in the early phases, but it's definitely double digits, and could be significant. The other expense item that ran at 11% in the quarter is marketing, and we'll use that as needed throughout the year, if we find that we find positive returns on our marketing spend and we can spend that instead of cutting rates. Obviously, that's the first area we'll look. Yes. Your benefit comes from adding properties that are finishing the final stages of lease-up and those properties either came from C of O properties or acquisitions. And so as they stabilize, rates typically continue to outperform the same-store pool. Our definition goes back to our IPO of our same-store pool, and that's 80% occupancy, or we have to own them for a year. So, we do see some benefit. If you look at the three pools in our subs, and each year, it gets a little slower. That's primarily appeals that we won during the quarter then revised numbers going forward. So it really relates primarily to prior periods as you win those appeals from prior periods. Yes. So, if you look at our customers that have been with us for more than two years, that number is now in the upper-40s, about 47%. Customers that have been with us 12 to 18 months, that's in the low-60s. That number has actually come down some. So, long-term customers, beyond two years is increasing. That midterm customer has actually come down a little bit."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Jared Conley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nJared Conley: Thank you, Michelle. Welcome to Extra Space Storage's Q3 2024 earnings call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Jared, and thank you everyone for joining today's call. To begin the call today, I would first like to address the impact of Hurricane Milton on our people. I am happy to report that all our teammates are safe, although a small number of individuals and their families were displaced and we have provided shelter assistance for them. Scott will address the financial impacts of the hurricane in his comments. Before we address the myriad of data points and moving pieces from the quarter, I want to make some overall big picture comments on our performance. We had a good quarter, optimizing performance in the current market environment and our efforts allow us to increase the midpoint of our full year FFO guidance. Let me start with the biggest contributor to FFO growth, which is store performance. The Extra Space same-store pool performed consistently with our expectations with quarter ending and October occupancy of 94.3%. This solid performance allows us to increase the bottom end of 2024 same-store guidance. Revenue for the Life Storage same-store pool came in slightly below our expectations, but this was generally offset by meaningful outperformance with respect to expenses. Having completed the move to a single brand in the latter part of the quarter, we are just starting to see the benefits of a single brand. We fully expect this group of stores to follow the same pattern of improvement into and during 2025 as the 143 Life Storage stores that we converted to the Extra Space brand at closing in 2023. Our non same-store properties are also outperforming our expectations and contributed to our FFO B. Outside of store performance, our external growth initiatives are exceeding projections. In the third quarter, we added 63 third-party managed stores gross, netting 38 stores. Year-to-date, we've added 124 net stores to the platform, and we anticipate adding approximately 100 additional properties by year-end. This would make 2024 our best year for net additions to our management program outside of the Life Storage merger. Our bridge loan program expanded with $158 million in new loans originated in this quarter, and we have increased our expected average hold of such loans to $925 million for the year. On the acquisition front, we have deployed $334 million in wholly-owned and joint venture acquisitions year-to-date and are seeing an encouraging increase in accretive opportunities. Lastly, we continue to find efficiencies in the business and have again lowered our G&A guidance for the year. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance and trajectory this year. We continue to leverage our scale to find efficiencies in all areas of the business, optimize store performance, and grow our ancillary businesses to drive FFO growth. Our higher portfolio occupancy positions us well to capitalize on an improving new customer rate environment when fundamentals recover. I will now turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a good quarter, driven by occupancy gains, G&A savings, and external growth. October to date same-store occupancy is 94.3%, an 80 basis point improvement over last year. In the third quarter, the average new customer move-in rate was negative 9% year-over-year. Due to strong occupancy and performance to date, we are raising the bottom end of the Extra Space same-store revenue guidance by 75 basis points, bringing the midpoint to a positive 0.125%. Despite meaningful savings in controllable expense categories, increases in property taxes have made it necessary for us to raise our expense guidance by 25 basis points. We have also raised the bottom end of our NOI guidance by 75 basis points, bringing the midpoint to negative 1.375%. The Life Storage same-store revenue improved by 0.4% year-over-year, and we saw seasonal declines in occupancy for the Life Storage same-store pool, finishing the quarter at 92.9%. This represents an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. October occupancy has increased to 93.2%, 210 basis points over last year. For the Life Storage same-store pool, the sequential change in average move in rate from the second quarter to the third quarter was negative 1%, much better than normal seasonal declines. Lower than expected pricing power to new customers in the Life Storage same-store pool has led to the reduction in our revenue expectations for the year. We have reduced our annual same-store revenue guidance by 50 basis points at the midpoint. This is partially offset by lower controllable expenses for these properties. As a result, we are revising our expense guidance downward by 100 basis points at the midpoint, and consequently, we have adjusted Life Storage same-store NOI guidance to a range of negative 1.5% to positive 0.5% for the year. Given the steady volume of bridge loans, we have raised the 2024 average outstanding loan guidance and increased our expected interest income. We have also lowered our estimates for G&A and increased our tenant reinsurance guidance. Interest expense has been updated to account for higher bridge loan volume and an increase in our acquisition guidance. As a result of these revisions, we've raised the lower end of our FFO guidance by $0.05 per share from $7.95 per share to $8 per share, a modest increase at the midpoint. Our revisions to guidance exclude the impact of Hurricane Milton as we are still assessing the full extent of property damage and tenant insurance claims. We've sustained damage at several REIT and managed properties, and 3 REIT stores remain closed. As of today, we are currently estimating total property damage and tenant insurance claims to be $10 million or more. Major hurricane costs have historically been added back to our core FFO. Therefore, these amounts have not been contemplated in our guidance. We've also seen an increase in rental activity and have paused existing customer rate increases in certain markets. We will report full details related to Hurricane Milton with our fourth quarter earnings. And with that, Michelle, let's open things up for questions.\nOperator: And our first question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I think in the opening remarks, you said that you're just starting to see the evidence of the benefit of being of a single brand. Can you provide a little bit more detail in terms of what you're seeing what have you accomplished so far? What you're seeing and what gives you confidence that you'll be able to continue to drive the benefit from this brand consolidation?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Happy to, Michael. Thank you for the question. So just to be clear, we're in very early stages here, right. We did change to the Extra Space brand late in third quarter. So we're several weeks then. But that being said, we see slightly better SEO performance from what was once the life storage stores, some improvement in the local or map section, but lesser than the SEO. The former LSI store conversion rate is better on the Extra Space website than it was on the LSI website. And we're starting to see some modest savings in paid marketing spend. Now what gives us confidence is when we close the merger in 2023 and decided to test two brands, we took a pool of 143 Life stores and converted them to Extra Space, and we watched the pattern of improvement of those stores over time. And we know that it doesn't happen immediately, but over a period of a number of months, up to 6 months, we will see those converted stores perform as well as stores that have always been branded Extra Space. So we see no reason why the stores we just converted won't act just like those stores and follow the same pattern of improvement and we're encouraged that we're starting to see the green shoots.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And my follow-up question is, there's still a pretty wide range for the core FFO guidance and what's implied for the fourth quarter. But can -- what is implied at the midpoint does suggest a material deceleration from the third to the fourth quarter. Now some of that, I assume, is related to seasonality, but is there any other factors or dynamics at play, which would weigh on the results in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter?\nScott Stubbs: No, Michael. The biggest difference is just property performance in the fourth quarter and then it will obviously depend on where you are in that range.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to stick with that line of questioning a little bit, but move to the same-store pool. Just curious there, the guidance implies continued deceleration in the fourth quarter for both the EXR and LSI portfolios. Can you just talk a little bit about whether you have line of sight toward stabilization just given the ability to drive customer traffic to the portfolio and the higher occupancy rates that you've been able to maintain across both portfolios?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Todd, it's Scott. So it depends a bit on where you are in that range of guidance. I'll start with the Extra Space pool. It does imply that it is slightly negative at the midpoint. If you're at the high end, it's obviously slightly positive. At the low-end, it's slightly negative. But there is some stabilization in there. It's fairly flat in the fourth quarter. The Life Storage pool, again, depending on where you are in the range, at the midpoint, slightly negative to slightly positive at the high-end and more negative at the low-end. But it does not show significant deceleration either. It's not dropping way down. It's also not an IT solution on its way up. Some of the life storage has a little noise in it month-by-month because it's a difficult comp with October being our strongest month as that's when many of the ECRI's hit last year.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask about the hurricanes, just given the comments that you made. I realize it's early and you're still sort of sorting through what's happened and sort of the aftermath a little bit. Can you just talk about the uptick in rental activity that you mentioned that you're seeing in some of the impacted areas and sort of how that plays out with the pause in ECRIs in some of these markets or states given the state of emergencies? And perhaps you can share some occupancy statistics to help provide some color around some of the changes in rental activity that you're seeing in some of those impacted MSAs?\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So we have seen an uptick in rentals, particularly in the life storage pool. The occupancies, for instance, have jumped from 92%, 93% to 96% at some of those stores. It's store by store. It's obviously going to be better on the West Coast. You see more of a benefit there than in Miami. A typical hurricane customer is going to stay on average, I think, about 10 months. So, we would expect to benefit from that. State of emergencies, obviously, we're following them. We are implementing those on a store by store level, so it's not on a market level. So, we would expect to see some benefit from hurricane occupancy, but that typically offsets the damage or partially offsets what we spend in hurricane damage.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. Maybe on the acquisition side, it sounds like you're active and expecting to stay active. I was wondering if you could give some more color on kind of who's selling. And I know in the past, a hurdle had been on the pricing expectations. So just kind of the volume that you're seeing and to the extent that the pricing is now being better agreed upon on the buyer and seller side?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. It's a good question, but I'm not sure I have a market wide answer, right. We see a lot more activity, but until transactions get actually closed and reported, it's hard to tell what's true and what's actually activity. I know from Extra Space side, we have a number of discussions underway, some-on market, some-off market that we're very confident will end up as accretive transactions.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. And then maybe as we think about move in rents, we know about the headwinds that the sector has been facing. But I guess if you consider properties where the move in rate trends have been relatively stronger, is there anything that you could point out that's different there? Is it less supply, easier comps? I know we've talked about that in the past, like an urban versus not urban, some indication of like housing impacts or regional, but anything else you can mention on the stronger move in properties versus not as strong?\nJoe Margolis: I think the two factors you mentioned are the most important factors. One is new supply in markets where there's been heavy supply deliveries, it's just harder. And then secondly is the comps. If a market like Atlanta or Phoenix has had several years of very, very strong revenue growth, it's hard to have additional years of very strong revenue growth. And particularly the markets that have both of those factors are probably the toughest markets. But it's cyclical, right? Real estate cyclical, markets are cyclical and that's why we believe in a highly diversified portfolio. So we have exposure to some markets that are on different ends of the cycle.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Securities. Can you please pick up your handset on your phone? Okay. Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Maybe just piggybacking off Caitlin's question. Did you guys happen to provide the cap rates on the transactions you guys closed in the quarter and sorry if you did.\nJoe Margolis: I don't think we did provide cap rates on the transactions we closed. I can tell you for all of the deals that we've approved this year, up we've had 10 wholly-owned operating deals with first year yield in the low 5s, about 13 months to stabilization and a 6.5 average stabilized yield. Same thing with remote stores, we've done 9 wholly-owned remote stores, very similar returns. And then our JV deals, we had 8 JV deals, 5 operating stores, first year yields at 10, stabilized yields at 12 and that's because of the economic benefit of the joint venture. And then we approved 3 developments in an 8.6 development yield.\nSpenser Allaway: Great. Thanks and then as it relates to the rebranding of the legacy LSI assets, can you just remind us what the cost has been to date for that endeavor.\nJoe Margolis: Gosh, I don't have cost to date numbers. It's probably pretty modest because what we've done to date is put banners up at the stores and then the rest has been digital. We expect total cost of about $117 million but that includes $20 million of non-branding capital costs that were delayed pending the test and the decision which store to go. So the store needed to be repainted and we decided not to repaint it until we knew which color to repaint it.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay.\nScott Stubbs: Our underwriting for the deal, we assumed $75,000 of property or $90 million. So it was obviously in our returns when we announced the deal.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Good morning. Just a quick one to start. I know you gave the October occupancies, but can you give us a sense of where the new customers came in the door at relative to last year?\nScott Stubbs: So our average rate to new customers for the quarter was negative 9% year-over-year, and our average new customer rate in October was negative 8%. So I think some people have wondered, are rates getting stronger, they significantly better. We would tell you that October feels a lot like September and August, and any kind of difference on a month by month basis is caused more by a comp than seeing significant changes so far and that's on the EXR pool.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And then just on the guidance for LSI, I was a little bit confused about the commentary in the prepared remarks. You said that seasonality, correct me if I'm wrong. I thought it was better than expected, but yet guidance was cut with lower pricing power. So just hoping you could help square those two kind of different comments that you made previously.\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So LSI, I mean, has not performed as expected this year, right? We've cut revenue guidance now twice for those stores. And really 3 things have contributed to that. One is that the markets in 2024 is weaker than we projected in the beginning of the year that just is. And then secondly, the markets that LSI has disproportionate concentration have performed disproportionately weaker. So think of Florida, where LSI has a larger concentration than extra space proportionally. And then the third thing is we didn't get the benefit of the dual brand that we expected. And that's why we made the decision this summer to move to the single brand and get the hope to get the expected benefit from that. So to me those are the 3 largest factors that led to us having to reduce revenue guidance for LSI.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. So it sounds like maybe some of the overweight, i.e. Florida markets deteriorated a bit more than you expected in the back half of the summer or early fall. Would that be fair to say?\nJoe Margolis: That's very fair to say, yes.\nScott Stubbs: Michelle, do we have additional questions? Michelle?\nJoe Margolis: So we're not sure if anyone can hear us. We're having some technical difficulties. Please be patient. We're going to get to the host and see what we can do. So again, I apologize to everyone. We are still trying to reconnect with the operator and we will try to resume this call as soon as possible. Please be patient. We'll be right back with you as quickly as we can.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico:\nA - Joe Margolis: Sorry? Who is this?\nNick Yulico: This is Nick Yulico, Scotiabank.\nJoe Margolis: So, Nick, we had technical difficulties and we couldn't hear anything. So but we're back now and if you wouldn't mind repeating the question, we can jump right back into it. Sorry about that.\nNick Yulico: Yes, sure. Thanks. So just the question is going back to the fourth quarter and what's assumed in guidance. Can you give us a feel for how occupancy is expected to trend?\nScott Stubbs: Yes, Nick. So, it's Scott. We typically don't model occupancy rate, it's more modeling revenue. And so we would tell you that there's not extreme revenue drop off and not extreme revenue growth is all that we can really say there.\nJoe Margolis: I would expect we're going to continue to operate at higher than historical occupancy levels.\nNick Yulico: Okay. All right. Thanks. And then the other question is just going back to LSI and the synergies. I know you've changed the revenue outlook. But I guess going back to those the June nonrevenue pieces on the synergies. Can you just give us a feel for latest thoughts on how you're trending versus those expectations?\nJoe Margolis: Sure. Happy to. So we were targeting $100 million in synergies in 3 categories, G&A, tenant insurance, and properties. And we're doing very well in the ones that we control. So, G&A, we're now looking at about $53 million worth of synergies well in excess of our initial estimate. Tenant insurance, we're looking at about $27 million of synergies. And then from the properties, it depends on where you are in the range of guidance anywhere from 0 to 10. So overall about $80 million to $90 million of the $100 million and we believe we originally targeted $65 million in the property synergies. We do believe we can eventually get there. We just need some market improvement, move to the single brand and some time and we'll get there. And of course, these $100 million of synergies doesn't include all the other benefits of the merger. The increase in our management business, in our bridge loan business, the many procurement and IT contracts we've renegotiated due to our new scale and got savings there, value add projects that we've identified and started to execute at the life storage properties. So the $100 million relates to just those three categories, not the total benefit of the merger.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. Maybe just to follow-up LSI. I think last quarter you mentioned that you expected your life storage portfolio to outperform your legacy EXR portfolio in 2025. I was just curious if that's still the case or some of the recent weakness in Sunbelt markets has changed that view?\nJoe Margolis: No. Life storage portfolio is outperforming the Extra Storage portfolio this year and I would expect it to do the same next year.\nEric Wolfe: And that's not just across the same markets, right, that's across that's comparing one directly versus the other, meaning LSI like the same-store pool versus the other same-store pool. Am I right about that?\nJoe Margolis: Correct. Yes, correct.\nEric Wolfe: And then you mentioned in your release just a moment ago about occupancy being stronger than it normally is through the rest of the year. So I guess what are you looking forward to try to dial up move in rates? Like what would it take over the next, say 3 to 6 months, you have strong occupancy. So like what else are you looking forward to try to get more aggressive on move in rates?\nJoe Margolis: So and I'm sorry if I'm going to state the obvious. We talk about aggregate data here, but every night the algorithms look at every unit type in every building and adjust rates. So as we speak today, there are rates in certain unit sizes, in certain buildings, in certain markets that are moving up. And the algorithm looks at many, many variables, historical data, number of move in, number of vacates and a bunch of projected performance to make those decisions. And the aggregate of all of those decisions is what we report. But it's not like any group of us sit here in Salt Lake City and look for a few macro things and decide we're going to increase rates 5% or decrease rates 2%.\nEric Wolfe: Right. Yes, I completely understand that. I guess from our perspective, you're just looking at occupancy and see that it's relatively full and better than it normally is. And so I don't know if there's some kind of demand. I'm just trying to understand the algorithm like what demand indicators. I don't know if you can list a couple that are maybe lower than normal or otherwise suggesting that you need to be cautious on moving rates. And I get that there's many factors you're looking at in your projections in the future. I'm just trying to understand generally what the main ones are.\nJoe Margolis: Okay. Sure, let me give you a better answer then, hopefully a better answer. So one thing that we're constantly doing is the algorithms will produce a price for a unit type in a building. And we will always have a test running where a certain number of stores will add 5% to that algorithm number and a certain number of stories will subtract 5% from that algorithm number. So we'll be able to tell at these different price bands, right? The algorithm produced price bands, 5% higher, 5% lower, and you look at number of rentals, rate, cost to acquire that customer, ECRI and length of stay and come up with a customer value. And that will tell us that the algorithm produced number, produces the best long-term revenue. Or if we intervened and went 5% lower or 5% higher, where we would do better. And that's kind of an ongoing test we run to help us understand if the algorithm rhythmic produce prices is, in fact, producing the best result for us. Is that helpful?\nEric Wolfe: Yes. That's helpful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: This is Jeff Spector for Josh. Sorry, we had technical difficulty before. And I apologize if you already discussed this, Joe, you talked about occupancy and the strength in occupancy trajectory. And just given the time of the year, I know we typically like to ask, how are you feeling right now as we're entering November, and how does that -- how does -- I guess how does -- how do you feel the year will end? And how does it bode heading into '25 compared to, let's say, prior years. And I know we had a number of years where there wasn't seasonality, but if you go back pre-COVID, right, how does this compare in terms of now this high occupancy level and then thoughts into '25.\nJoe Margolis: So I feel good that our people and processes and systems are optimizing performance in a difficult market. I feel better if it wasn't a difficult market, but I can't control that. But I feel really good that everything we're doing, the strategies we're implementing, the tests that we're undertaking is squeezing as much juice out of the fruit as we possibly can. I also feel very good that at a high level of occupancy when the market turns and the market will turn. We are in a really good position to benefit from that quickly. I feel good that everything we see confirms moderation in new supply. So that makes me feel good as well. So I certainly feel better if we're having 6% revenue growth, but we're not going to have that this year. And all we can do is make the best of it and position ourselves well for the future.\nJeff Spector: Okay. That's fair. And then my second question is again on LSI. You talked about the lack of pricing power there, and I keep thinking about your -- you want to again, use the EXR systems fully into the LSI portfolio. And you're saying it's outperforming. But again, there seems to be some weakness there, right? It feels like at least tell me if I'm wrong, between that LSI customer possibly versus the EXR customer. So what gives confidence that you can really push on that LSI customer as we enter '25. So again, I think of those markets as more tertiary, secondary markets, that consumer is more squeezed today than ever.\nJoe Margolis: So we don't see that difference in consumer. We think the storage consumer is the storage consumer, whether regardless of what product they go to the -- their behavior is very similar. We don't see significant difference in bad debt or reaction to ECRI or other behavior between markets? So I don't -- I'm not sure I agree with the thesis there.\nScott Stubbs: And Jeff, I'd maybe point to a couple of other things. One is we went into this with a 400 basis point delta in occupancy that we had to make up. So we went in with softer rates partly to gain occupancy there. Recently, we switched our algorithm over time that will even things out. In addition, you had a brand and a thesis going in where we thought the dual brand was going to compensate, and we would actually have higher growth as a result of the dual brand. We haven't found that and we now believe that it's going to do better on a single brand. That change just happens. So we're still optimistic and feel like it's been tough timing, and we think that there's still a lot of good growth in that portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.\nEric Luebchow: I appreciate you taking the question. Maybe could you comment a little bit on kind of the move in to move-out spread, I think it had been kind of the negative 30% range, maybe a little bit north of that. And then as you kind of look out over the next 1 to 2 years, I mean, where do you think that spread has to go to get back to what would be kind of a more typical same-store growth rate based on your current pacing of ECRIs? Is it negative 20%, negative 15%? Maybe any color there would be helpful.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So for the quarter, we averaged just over 30%. Moving into October, you were mid to upper-30s, which is the growth from the second to the third quarter is common at this time of the year, you typically -- that spread usually does get larger. I think it will depend a little bit on how strong the market comes back and what we do with kind of pricing strategy. Today, we found the most effective way to attract new customers is with the lowest rate. It's possible that changes as the market strengthens. So it's hard to comment on that until we kind of see it and have confidence on which pricing strategy is going to work best.\nEric Luebchow: Got you. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up on rate is between the LSI and EXR properties, I guess, more for like-for-like markets, how much of a spread you still have remaining there? And kind of as you work through this new branding strategy, when you think that can continue to close or hit parity?\nJoe Margolis: So on like-for-like properties, our spread is about 6% today, and it was closer to the 16 at closing. And there's no reason that, that should be 0 at 1 point. When you look at like-for-like markets, we haven't made as much progress. We've only closed about 2% of the rate gap, although we have closed the occupancy gap meaningfully for those stores. And I don't think we'll ever get to parity there, but we will close some more of the rate gap.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hongliang Zhang with JPMorgan.\nHongliang Zhang: I guess, my first question is, as you look towards next year, how do you think your pricing power and top of phone demand would compare to, I guess, this year and pre-COVID levels?\nJoe Margolis: Well, that's the crystal ball question, right? I think we need to understand interest rates. We need to understand the housing market. We need to understand the health of the economy and the consumer. And all of those things will drive into storage demand and our ability to push pricing. So I wish I had a crystal ball, but I don't. I do know that -- and sorry to repeat myself, whatever environment we're faced with, we will be able to maximize performance and do well. And also that we have all of these other ancillary businesses and tools that can help support company performance in periods when perhaps the stores aren't doing as well.\nHongliang Zhang: Got it. And my second question is with the EXR, LSI -- with LSI working on our same brand as EXR, are there any quantifiable cost savings you'll realize over the near term, say marketing?\nJoe Margolis: So the easiest cost saving to quantify is we were spending on an annual run rate basis, $10 million more in paid search for the LSI stores to make up for the relative weakness in organic sections of the search. So once we -- not immediately on day 1, but once we get the LSI stores the parity with the extra space stores, we shouldn't have to spend that extra $10 million. And then the second savings, which is more difficult to quantify is with more stores on the Extra Space brand, the Express brand should be stronger, leading to additional marketing savings.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nJenny Li: You have Jenny on for Ron. I just have 2 quick questions. The first is, can you please comment on the magnitude of ECRI for LSI and EXR pool? Like do you put there at a similar like pace for both pools? Or you do like the EXR harder than the other one?\nJoe Margolis: So they're both on the same ECRI program now. So there's no difference in -- by original brand of the store in a pace or amount of ECRI.\nJenny Li: I think the second one, actually, I'm really curious about your views or commentary on the moving rate because we know like moving rates continue to be weak. And do you think it's actually overcorrected by your model? And going forward, do you -- you give us a feeling that you prioritize occupancy over pricing, but if that's going to be continued your focus going forward in Q4 and '25?\nJoe Margolis: So we prioritized long-term revenue and whatever mix of occupancy and rate and the other various factors produced the long-term revenue. That's what we'll follow. Right now, the data is showing us to lean a little heavier into occupancy than we did. But if the data ever tells us something differently across the board or for a particular store or market, then we'll follow that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.\nSamir Khanal: Joe, on your comments about ECRI, I know you kind of talked about the magnitude being similar for both LSI and EXR now. But I mean, has there been any sort of pushback at all that you're seeing from the customers at this point?\nJoe Margolis: So there's always what you would call, pushback from the customers, right? Some customers move out because the space got too expensive for them or some customers move out because when we notify them, their rate went up, they remind them they have storage and they don't need it anymore. But we track that very carefully what percentage of customers are moving out because they got an ECRI notice, and we do that because every month, we keep a control group and track different behavior. So we know the excess move-outs were causing by our ECRI program, and it's within an acceptable range today and if it ever changes, then we can adjust our program accordingly.\nSamir Khanal: Okay. Got it. And I guess my second question is around your bridge loan program. And you've been pretty active on that front this year as well right? It's led to higher interest income in the financials. So help us think through kind of how to think about the volume or the program into next year? And kind of what does that opportunity set look like?\nJoe Margolis: So we've had a very strong year in bridge loan originations. I think one of the reasons of that was we had a whole new group of LSI partners that we got to know and made a lot of bridge loans to them. So that was helpful. Another reason was the acquisition market was difficult. There was a bid-ask spread we've talked about. So some owners decided instead of trying to sell in the current market, they'll get a bridge loan and try again in 3 years. So volumes were good. Next year, we have some meaningful maturities, some of those will extend, some will pay off and some will buy. So that will have some downward pressure on our book of business. But we continue to remain -- I expect we'll continue to remain active and make new loans. It all depends on opportunities. We're not going to make bad loans just to keep our book of business large, and we're not going to pass by opportunities because we think we've made too many bridge loans because we can always sell A notes which we've done to manage our exposure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank.\nOmotayo Okusanya: I just wanted to stay on the credit lending platform and the line of questioning there. Again, the loan that was sold this quarter, could you just talk a little bit about the characteristics of those loans, why you decided it made sense to sell it. And if we just kind of confirm where you're doing this as you're kind of selling 8 pieces, but just so holding on to a residual.\nJoe Margolis: So we make a calculation of loans that are easy to sell. So for example, if we have a $20 million loan and $4 million or $5 million loans, it may make more sense to sell the A on the $20 million because it's 1 transaction as opposed to 4 separate transactions. Also, our buyers have preferences for certain markets or where they have exposure where they don't. So clearly, the buyers have input into this as well. So there's no formula lookup table. It's more business judgment on which loans to sell. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?\nOmotayo Okusanya: For the loans [indiscernible], do you sell the whole loan? Or are you holding onto a residual?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I'm sorry. Yes, we sell the A piece and we keep the mess. So we do keep -- we keep residual. So the whole loan -- the whole capital stack is 100%. We're selling 55 or 60 and keeping the balance up to 75 or 80.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Got you. That's helpful. And then just to talk a little bit about one of your other growth drivers, which is the third-party asset management. Again, you continue to grow in that space, and I know that each management agreement is kind of different and unique to each operator. But just kind of curious, again, if you could just kind of talk thematically about anything that may be happening to kind of improve profitability of that business as you continue to grow it?\nJoe Margolis: So we're continuing to grow the business for a couple of reasons. One is there's 1 less competitor out there, right? LSI was a competitor for this business, and they don't -- they're us now. We have develop relationships with all the owners who LSI used to manage for. And for many of them, we're growing that relationship. Also, the operating environment is harder and when the operating environment is harder, more non-institutional owners seek professional management, right? Our -- if you look at our occupancies compared to the occupancies and performance of the small operators. In general, we're significantly outperforming them. And I also think we're growing the business because we do an excellent job in running the properties, communicating with our owners and providing great customer service. And because of that, we have a great reputation. So even though we are the most expensive in the business, more expensive and have very healthy margins, we're also growing the business faster than anyone else.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. Could you comment on LSI street rate trends in the quarter and into October?\nScott Stubbs: So on a year-over-year basis, Ki Bin, we have a difficult time partly because on a year-over-year basis, we didn't manage them for the whole quarter, so we don't have perfect data on that. For the quarter, quarter-over-quarter, their rates are down 1%, so just on a quarter-over-quarter basis, you didn't see as much of a seasonal decline as you saw in the Extra Space portfolio.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And you mentioned that there's a 6% spread on a like-for-like basis. In order for that to close, do you ultimately need kind of top of the funnel demand to be better? Or do you think on a single brand strategy and whatever else you guys are working on, do you think you can close that gap holding everything else constant.\nJoe Margolis: I think the latter. I think on the stores that are like-for-like, same quality store in the exact stream trade area, same type of store, once we're on a single brand and have some time, we'll close that gap.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And just last question on the bridge loans. Of the 300 plus or minus maturity for next year, roughly do you know what percent what extent?\nJoe Margolis: So half of those loans aren't maturing until November and December last year. So we have quite some time before we fully understand are they going to satisfy all the tests to extend or not. So it's hard to give an accurate percentage at this time.\nScott Stubbs : [Indiscernible] to meet any of those requirements. So they still have a fair amount of time before maturity.\nOperator: Now, I'm showing no further questions. So with that, I'll hand the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Extra Space and your time. I apologize for the technical difficulties we had today. We look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming meetings. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jared, and thank you everyone for joining today's call. To begin the call today, I would first like to address the impact of Hurricane Milton on our people. I am happy to report that all our teammates are safe, although a small number of individuals and their families were displaced and we have provided shelter assistance for them. Scott will address the financial impacts of the hurricane in his comments. Before we address the myriad of data points and moving pieces from the quarter, I want to make some overall big picture comments on our performance. We had a good quarter, optimizing performance in the current market environment and our efforts allow us to increase the midpoint of our full year FFO guidance. Let me start with the biggest contributor to FFO growth, which is store performance. The Extra Space same-store pool performed consistently with our expectations with quarter ending and October occupancy of 94.3%. This solid performance allows us to increase the bottom end of 2024 same-store guidance. Revenue for the Life Storage same-store pool came in slightly below our expectations, but this was generally offset by meaningful outperformance with respect to expenses. Having completed the move to a single brand in the latter part of the quarter, we are just starting to see the benefits of a single brand. We fully expect this group of stores to follow the same pattern of improvement into and during 2025 as the 143 Life Storage stores that we converted to the Extra Space brand at closing in 2023. Our non same-store properties are also outperforming our expectations and contributed to our FFO B. Outside of store performance, our external growth initiatives are exceeding projections. In the third quarter, we added 63 third-party managed stores gross, netting 38 stores. Year-to-date, we've added 124 net stores to the platform, and we anticipate adding approximately 100 additional properties by year-end. This would make 2024 our best year for net additions to our management program outside of the Life Storage merger. Our bridge loan program expanded with $158 million in new loans originated in this quarter, and we have increased our expected average hold of such loans to $925 million for the year. On the acquisition front, we have deployed $334 million in wholly-owned and joint venture acquisitions year-to-date and are seeing an encouraging increase in accretive opportunities. Lastly, we continue to find efficiencies in the business and have again lowered our G&A guidance for the year. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance and trajectory this year. We continue to leverage our scale to find efficiencies in all areas of the business, optimize store performance, and grow our ancillary businesses to drive FFO growth. Our higher portfolio occupancy positions us well to capitalize on an improving new customer rate environment when fundamentals recover. I will now turn the time over to Scott. Sure. Happy to, Michael. Thank you for the question. So just to be clear, we're in very early stages here, right. We did change to the Extra Space brand late in third quarter. So we're several weeks then. But that being said, we see slightly better SEO performance from what was once the life storage stores, some improvement in the local or map section, but lesser than the SEO. The former LSI store conversion rate is better on the Extra Space website than it was on the LSI website. And we're starting to see some modest savings in paid marketing spend. Now what gives us confidence is when we close the merger in 2023 and decided to test two brands, we took a pool of 143 Life stores and converted them to Extra Space, and we watched the pattern of improvement of those stores over time. And we know that it doesn't happen immediately, but over a period of a number of months, up to 6 months, we will see those converted stores perform as well as stores that have always been branded Extra Space. So we see no reason why the stores we just converted won't act just like those stores and follow the same pattern of improvement and we're encouraged that we're starting to see the green shoots. Sure. It's a good question, but I'm not sure I have a market wide answer, right. We see a lot more activity, but until transactions get actually closed and reported, it's hard to tell what's true and what's actually activity. I know from Extra Space side, we have a number of discussions underway, some-on market, some-off market that we're very confident will end up as accretive transactions. I think the two factors you mentioned are the most important factors. One is new supply in markets where there's been heavy supply deliveries, it's just harder. And then secondly is the comps. If a market like Atlanta or Phoenix has had several years of very, very strong revenue growth, it's hard to have additional years of very strong revenue growth. And particularly the markets that have both of those factors are probably the toughest markets. But it's cyclical, right? Real estate cyclical, markets are cyclical and that's why we believe in a highly diversified portfolio. So we have exposure to some markets that are on different ends of the cycle. I don't think we did provide cap rates on the transactions we closed. I can tell you for all of the deals that we've approved this year, up we've had 10 wholly-owned operating deals with first year yield in the low 5s, about 13 months to stabilization and a 6.5 average stabilized yield. Same thing with remote stores, we've done 9 wholly-owned remote stores, very similar returns. And then our JV deals, we had 8 JV deals, 5 operating stores, first year yields at 10, stabilized yields at 12 and that's because of the economic benefit of the joint venture. And then we approved 3 developments in an 8.6 development yield. Gosh, I don't have cost to date numbers. It's probably pretty modest because what we've done to date is put banners up at the stores and then the rest has been digital. We expect total cost of about $117 million but that includes $20 million of non-branding capital costs that were delayed pending the test and the decision which store to go. So the store needed to be repainted and we decided not to repaint it until we knew which color to repaint it. Yes. So LSI, I mean, has not performed as expected this year, right? We've cut revenue guidance now twice for those stores. And really 3 things have contributed to that. One is that the markets in 2024 is weaker than we projected in the beginning of the year that just is. And then secondly, the markets that LSI has disproportionate concentration have performed disproportionately weaker. So think of Florida, where LSI has a larger concentration than extra space proportionally. And then the third thing is we didn't get the benefit of the dual brand that we expected. And that's why we made the decision this summer to move to the single brand and get the hope to get the expected benefit from that. So to me those are the 3 largest factors that led to us having to reduce revenue guidance for LSI. That's very fair to say, yes. So we're not sure if anyone can hear us. We're having some technical difficulties. Please be patient. We're going to get to the host and see what we can do. So again, I apologize to everyone. We are still trying to reconnect with the operator and we will try to resume this call as soon as possible. Please be patient. We'll be right back with you as quickly as we can. So, Nick, we had technical difficulties and we couldn't hear anything. So but we're back now and if you wouldn't mind repeating the question, we can jump right back into it. Sorry about that. I would expect we're going to continue to operate at higher than historical occupancy levels. Sure. Happy to. So we were targeting $100 million in synergies in 3 categories, G&A, tenant insurance, and properties. And we're doing very well in the ones that we control. So, G&A, we're now looking at about $53 million worth of synergies well in excess of our initial estimate. Tenant insurance, we're looking at about $27 million of synergies. And then from the properties, it depends on where you are in the range of guidance anywhere from 0 to 10. So overall about $80 million to $90 million of the $100 million and we believe we originally targeted $65 million in the property synergies. We do believe we can eventually get there. We just need some market improvement, move to the single brand and some time and we'll get there. And of course, these $100 million of synergies doesn't include all the other benefits of the merger. The increase in our management business, in our bridge loan business, the many procurement and IT contracts we've renegotiated due to our new scale and got savings there, value add projects that we've identified and started to execute at the life storage properties. So the $100 million relates to just those three categories, not the total benefit of the merger. No. Life storage portfolio is outperforming the Extra Storage portfolio this year and I would expect it to do the same next year. Correct. Yes, correct. So and I'm sorry if I'm going to state the obvious. We talk about aggregate data here, but every night the algorithms look at every unit type in every building and adjust rates. So as we speak today, there are rates in certain unit sizes, in certain buildings, in certain markets that are moving up. And the algorithm looks at many, many variables, historical data, number of move in, number of vacates and a bunch of projected performance to make those decisions. And the aggregate of all of those decisions is what we report. But it's not like any group of us sit here in Salt Lake City and look for a few macro things and decide we're going to increase rates 5% or decrease rates 2%. Okay. Sure, let me give you a better answer then, hopefully a better answer. So one thing that we're constantly doing is the algorithms will produce a price for a unit type in a building. And we will always have a test running where a certain number of stores will add 5% to that algorithm number and a certain number of stories will subtract 5% from that algorithm number. So we'll be able to tell at these different price bands, right? The algorithm produced price bands, 5% higher, 5% lower, and you look at number of rentals, rate, cost to acquire that customer, ECRI and length of stay and come up with a customer value. And that will tell us that the algorithm produced number, produces the best long-term revenue. Or if we intervened and went 5% lower or 5% higher, where we would do better. And that's kind of an ongoing test we run to help us understand if the algorithm rhythmic produce prices is, in fact, producing the best result for us. Is that helpful? So I feel good that our people and processes and systems are optimizing performance in a difficult market. I feel better if it wasn't a difficult market, but I can't control that. But I feel really good that everything we're doing, the strategies we're implementing, the tests that we're undertaking is squeezing as much juice out of the fruit as we possibly can. I also feel very good that at a high level of occupancy when the market turns and the market will turn. We are in a really good position to benefit from that quickly. I feel good that everything we see confirms moderation in new supply. So that makes me feel good as well. So I certainly feel better if we're having 6% revenue growth, but we're not going to have that this year. And all we can do is make the best of it and position ourselves well for the future. So we don't see that difference in consumer. We think the storage consumer is the storage consumer, whether regardless of what product they go to the -- their behavior is very similar. We don't see significant difference in bad debt or reaction to ECRI or other behavior between markets? So I don't -- I'm not sure I agree with the thesis there. So on like-for-like properties, our spread is about 6% today, and it was closer to the 16 at closing. And there's no reason that, that should be 0 at 1 point. When you look at like-for-like markets, we haven't made as much progress. We've only closed about 2% of the rate gap, although we have closed the occupancy gap meaningfully for those stores. And I don't think we'll ever get to parity there, but we will close some more of the rate gap. Well, that's the crystal ball question, right? I think we need to understand interest rates. We need to understand the housing market. We need to understand the health of the economy and the consumer. And all of those things will drive into storage demand and our ability to push pricing. So I wish I had a crystal ball, but I don't. I do know that -- and sorry to repeat myself, whatever environment we're faced with, we will be able to maximize performance and do well. And also that we have all of these other ancillary businesses and tools that can help support company performance in periods when perhaps the stores aren't doing as well. So the easiest cost saving to quantify is we were spending on an annual run rate basis, $10 million more in paid search for the LSI stores to make up for the relative weakness in organic sections of the search. So once we -- not immediately on day 1, but once we get the LSI stores the parity with the extra space stores, we shouldn't have to spend that extra $10 million. And then the second savings, which is more difficult to quantify is with more stores on the Extra Space brand, the Express brand should be stronger, leading to additional marketing savings. So they're both on the same ECRI program now. So there's no difference in -- by original brand of the store in a pace or amount of ECRI. So we prioritized long-term revenue and whatever mix of occupancy and rate and the other various factors produced the long-term revenue. That's what we'll follow. Right now, the data is showing us to lean a little heavier into occupancy than we did. But if the data ever tells us something differently across the board or for a particular store or market, then we'll follow that. So there's always what you would call, pushback from the customers, right? Some customers move out because the space got too expensive for them or some customers move out because when we notify them, their rate went up, they remind them they have storage and they don't need it anymore. But we track that very carefully what percentage of customers are moving out because they got an ECRI notice, and we do that because every month, we keep a control group and track different behavior. So we know the excess move-outs were causing by our ECRI program, and it's within an acceptable range today and if it ever changes, then we can adjust our program accordingly. So we've had a very strong year in bridge loan originations. I think one of the reasons of that was we had a whole new group of LSI partners that we got to know and made a lot of bridge loans to them. So that was helpful. Another reason was the acquisition market was difficult. There was a bid-ask spread we've talked about. So some owners decided instead of trying to sell in the current market, they'll get a bridge loan and try again in 3 years. So volumes were good. Next year, we have some meaningful maturities, some of those will extend, some will pay off and some will buy. So that will have some downward pressure on our book of business. But we continue to remain -- I expect we'll continue to remain active and make new loans. It all depends on opportunities. We're not going to make bad loans just to keep our book of business large, and we're not going to pass by opportunities because we think we've made too many bridge loans because we can always sell A notes which we've done to manage our exposure. So we make a calculation of loans that are easy to sell. So for example, if we have a $20 million loan and $4 million or $5 million loans, it may make more sense to sell the A on the $20 million because it's 1 transaction as opposed to 4 separate transactions. Also, our buyers have preferences for certain markets or where they have exposure where they don't. So clearly, the buyers have input into this as well. So there's no formula lookup table. It's more business judgment on which loans to sell. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question? Yes. I'm sorry. Yes, we sell the A piece and we keep the mess. So we do keep -- we keep residual. So the whole loan -- the whole capital stack is 100%. We're selling 55 or 60 and keeping the balance up to 75 or 80. So we're continuing to grow the business for a couple of reasons. One is there's 1 less competitor out there, right? LSI was a competitor for this business, and they don't -- they're us now. We have develop relationships with all the owners who LSI used to manage for. And for many of them, we're growing that relationship. Also, the operating environment is harder and when the operating environment is harder, more non-institutional owners seek professional management, right? Our -- if you look at our occupancies compared to the occupancies and performance of the small operators. In general, we're significantly outperforming them. And I also think we're growing the business because we do an excellent job in running the properties, communicating with our owners and providing great customer service. And because of that, we have a great reputation. So even though we are the most expensive in the business, more expensive and have very healthy margins, we're also growing the business faster than anyone else. I think the latter. I think on the stores that are like-for-like, same quality store in the exact stream trade area, same type of store, once we're on a single brand and have some time, we'll close that gap. So half of those loans aren't maturing until November and December last year. So we have quite some time before we fully understand are they going to satisfy all the tests to extend or not. So it's hard to give an accurate percentage at this time. Great. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Extra Space and your time. I apologize for the technical difficulties we had today. We look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming meetings. Have a great day."

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a good quarter, driven by occupancy gains, G&A savings, and external growth. October to date same-store occupancy is 94.3%, an 80 basis point improvement over last year. In the third quarter, the average new customer move-in rate was negative 9% year-over-year. Due to strong occupancy and performance to date, we are raising the bottom end of the Extra Space same-store revenue guidance by 75 basis points, bringing the midpoint to a positive 0.125%. Despite meaningful savings in controllable expense categories, increases in property taxes have made it necessary for us to raise our expense guidance by 25 basis points. We have also raised the bottom end of our NOI guidance by 75 basis points, bringing the midpoint to negative 1.375%. The Life Storage same-store revenue improved by 0.4% year-over-year, and we saw seasonal declines in occupancy for the Life Storage same-store pool, finishing the quarter at 92.9%. This represents an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. October occupancy has increased to 93.2%, 210 basis points over last year. For the Life Storage same-store pool, the sequential change in average move in rate from the second quarter to the third quarter was negative 1%, much better than normal seasonal declines. Lower than expected pricing power to new customers in the Life Storage same-store pool has led to the reduction in our revenue expectations for the year. We have reduced our annual same-store revenue guidance by 50 basis points at the midpoint. This is partially offset by lower controllable expenses for these properties. As a result, we are revising our expense guidance downward by 100 basis points at the midpoint, and consequently, we have adjusted Life Storage same-store NOI guidance to a range of negative 1.5% to positive 0.5% for the year. Given the steady volume of bridge loans, we have raised the 2024 average outstanding loan guidance and increased our expected interest income. We have also lowered our estimates for G&A and increased our tenant reinsurance guidance. Interest expense has been updated to account for higher bridge loan volume and an increase in our acquisition guidance. As a result of these revisions, we've raised the lower end of our FFO guidance by $0.05 per share from $7.95 per share to $8 per share, a modest increase at the midpoint. Our revisions to guidance exclude the impact of Hurricane Milton as we are still assessing the full extent of property damage and tenant insurance claims. We've sustained damage at several REIT and managed properties, and 3 REIT stores remain closed. As of today, we are currently estimating total property damage and tenant insurance claims to be $10 million or more. Major hurricane costs have historically been added back to our core FFO. Therefore, these amounts have not been contemplated in our guidance. We've also seen an increase in rental activity and have paused existing customer rate increases in certain markets. We will report full details related to Hurricane Milton with our fourth quarter earnings. And with that, Michelle, let's open things up for questions. No, Michael. The biggest difference is just property performance in the fourth quarter and then it will obviously depend on where you are in that range. Yes. Todd, it's Scott. So it depends a bit on where you are in that range of guidance. I'll start with the Extra Space pool. It does imply that it is slightly negative at the midpoint. If you're at the high end, it's obviously slightly positive. At the low-end, it's slightly negative. But there is some stabilization in there. It's fairly flat in the fourth quarter. The Life Storage pool, again, depending on where you are in the range, at the midpoint, slightly negative to slightly positive at the high-end and more negative at the low-end. But it does not show significant deceleration either. It's not dropping way down. It's also not an IT solution on its way up. Some of the life storage has a little noise in it month-by-month because it's a difficult comp with October being our strongest month as that's when many of the ECRI's hit last year. Yes. So we have seen an uptick in rentals, particularly in the life storage pool. The occupancies, for instance, have jumped from 92%, 93% to 96% at some of those stores. It's store by store. It's obviously going to be better on the West Coast. You see more of a benefit there than in Miami. A typical hurricane customer is going to stay on average, I think, about 10 months. So, we would expect to benefit from that. State of emergencies, obviously, we're following them. We are implementing those on a store by store level, so it's not on a market level. So, we would expect to see some benefit from hurricane occupancy, but that typically offsets the damage or partially offsets what we spend in hurricane damage. Our underwriting for the deal, we assumed $75,000 of property or $90 million. So it was obviously in our returns when we announced the deal. So our average rate to new customers for the quarter was negative 9% year-over-year, and our average new customer rate in October was negative 8%. So I think some people have wondered, are rates getting stronger, they significantly better. We would tell you that October feels a lot like September and August, and any kind of difference on a month by month basis is caused more by a comp than seeing significant changes so far and that's on the EXR pool. Michelle, do we have additional questions? Michelle? Yes, Nick. So, it's Scott. We typically don't model occupancy rate, it's more modeling revenue. And so we would tell you that there's not extreme revenue drop off and not extreme revenue growth is all that we can really say there. And Jeff, I'd maybe point to a couple of other things. One is we went into this with a 400 basis point delta in occupancy that we had to make up. So we went in with softer rates partly to gain occupancy there. Recently, we switched our algorithm over time that will even things out. In addition, you had a brand and a thesis going in where we thought the dual brand was going to compensate, and we would actually have higher growth as a result of the dual brand. We haven't found that and we now believe that it's going to do better on a single brand. That change just happens. So we're still optimistic and feel like it's been tough timing, and we think that there's still a lot of good growth in that portfolio. Yes. So for the quarter, we averaged just over 30%. Moving into October, you were mid to upper-30s, which is the growth from the second to the third quarter is common at this time of the year, you typically -- that spread usually does get larger. I think it will depend a little bit on how strong the market comes back and what we do with kind of pricing strategy. Today, we found the most effective way to attract new customers is with the lowest rate. It's possible that changes as the market strengthens. So it's hard to comment on that until we kind of see it and have confidence on which pricing strategy is going to work best. So on a year-over-year basis, Ki Bin, we have a difficult time partly because on a year-over-year basis, we didn't manage them for the whole quarter, so we don't have perfect data on that. For the quarter, quarter-over-quarter, their rates are down 1%, so just on a quarter-over-quarter basis, you didn't see as much of a seasonal decline as you saw in the Extra Space portfolio. [Indiscernible] to meet any of those requirements. So they still have a fair amount of time before maturity."

We had a great quarter, exceeding our internal FFO per share projections due to outperformance in multiple areas of our business, allowing us to increase our 2024 FFO outlook. We experienced steady improvement in Extra Space same-store occupancy for the second quarter, ending at 94.3% and continue to see occupancy gains in July. Our second quarter occupancy represents 110 basis point sequential gain over our first quarter occupancy and a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. In the same period, the average move-in rate improved by approximately 12%. However, it is still about 8% below last year's average moving rate. The combination of increased move-in rate and occupancy gain contributed to a 0.6% increase in Extra Space same-store revenue year-over-year. Same-store expenses increased by 6% for the quarter compared to the same period last year, marginally better than internal projections. As expected, we saw significant gains in occupancy for the Life Storage same-store pool, finishing the quarter at 93.8%. This represents an increase of 400 basis points year-over-year and a 200 basis point improvement over first quarter levels. The occupancy gains drove revenue growth for the Life Storage same-store pool of 1.8% year-over-year. Given the occupancy gains, we expected to generate significant pricing power at the Life Storage properties. Midway through the quarter, we eliminated the move-in rate discounts and placed new customer pricing for the Life Storage properties on par with comparable extra space stores. However, the pricing improvement at the Life Storage stores has been below our internal projections. We are confident our approach is maximizing revenue at these stores. However, progress has been slower than anticipated. We remain convinced that we will continue to close the rate gap between Life Storage and extra space stores over time. Life Storage same-store property expenses increased by 0.8% year-over-year, significantly better than our internal projections. The team has done a great job finding additional expense efficiencies, and we can now project lower expenses, particularly with respect to property taxes and in the controllable areas of R&M, utilities, and payroll for the second half of the year. Turning to growth. While the transaction environment remains muted, our capital-light external growth programs continue to make gains. In the quarter, we added 77 third-party managed stores, netting 14 stores after factoring in the expected departure of a large portfolio that internalized management. Year-to-date, we have added 86 net stores to the platform, one of the strongest first halves of the year ever. Additionally, our bridge loan program expanded with $433 million in new loans originated in this quarter. Our greater scale and sophisticated operating platform have led to meaningful wins in other areas of the business, including G&A and tenant insurance. We're working hard to continue to find efficiencies in all areas of the business to drive FFO growth despite the difficult operating environment at the stores. I will now turn the time over to Scott.\nScott Stubbs: Thanks, Joe and hello everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a good quarter, driven by occupancy and steady revenue growth. In addition to G&A savings, we have experienced better-than-expected property operating expenses, specifically property taxes, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. The G&A and property level savings have come from a broad range of categories as we continue to find efficiencies and capitalize on our greater scale. Due to the steady Extra Space same-store performance through the leasing season, we are raising the bottom end of our revenue guidance by 100 basis points bringing the midpoint to negative 0.25%. We have also reduced our expense guidance dropping the midpoint by 25 basis points to 4.5%. Accordingly, the bottom end of our net operating income guidance is being raised by 125 basis points to a negative 1.75% at the midpoint. Regarding the Life Storage same-store pool, the lower-than-expected pricing power has led to a reduction in our revenue expectations for the year. We have reduced our annual same-store revenue guidance by 200 basis points at the midpoint. Fortunately, this is partially offset by lower-than-expected expenses for these properties. As a result, we are also revising our expense guidance downward by 200 basis points at the midpoint and consequently, we have adjusted Life Storage same-store NOI guidance to a range of negative 1.5% to positive 1% for the year. Given the recent demand and volume of bridge loans, we have raised the 2024 average outstanding loan guidance and increased our expected interest income. We've also lowered our estimates for G&A and increased our management fees and tenant reinsurance income. Additionally, we adjusted interest expense and income tax expense guidance to reflect the current business environment. These revisions have contributed to a raise of the lower end of our FFO guidance from $7.85 per share to $7.95 per share, a $0.05 increase at the midpoint. And with that, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on the adjustment of the Life Storage guidance. And you talked a little bit about the lack of pricing power in order to push rates. What are you seeing there? Like what is weighing there? And then also is the -- can you talk a little bit about the geographical footprint of that portfolio and how that may be also influencing the results from that segment.\nJoe Margolis: Sure, Michael. So when we took the portfolio over, we had a significant 420 basis point occupancy gap. And that was the first thing we worked on. And the main tool, we used over the last year was discounting the new customer rate at the Life Storage stores below the Extra Space stores. And we made good progress. And by mid-quarter, we were close enough to occupancy parity that we remove that extra discount at the Life Storage stores. We then thought we would gain pricing power, and we just didn't gain as much as we did. The customers new customers remain price sensitive, and we haven't been able to move new customer rates at the Life Storage stores or the Extra Space stores as much as we would have hoped. So that is certainly a factor in our projected revenue for the Life Storage stores for the rest of the year. Another factor is geography, as you pointed out. When we close this merger, one thing we were excited about was the effect on our portfolio footprint. By merging with Life Storage, we reduced our proportional exposure to California and increased our proportional exposure to Sunbelt markets, including Florida, for example. And we still are happy about that. We think long term, we believe in the Sunbelt. We believe in Florida. We're happy to have greater exposure in those growth markets. But it worked against us this year. Extra Space has 23% of its same-store revenue coming from California, Life Storage has 7% and California is an outperforming market this year. And conversely, Extra Space has 10% of our same-store revenue coming from Florida, Life Storage has 16% and Florida is an underperforming market this year. So I think it's timing. Long term, we like where we are. We think we'll close the rate gap and we like our geographical footprint.\nMichael Goldsmith: Sure. Thanks for that. And my follow-up, I think the natural follow-up question is what has to change in the environment in order for things to get better? Is it demand needs to pick up from the housing market. Is it competition needs to kind of moderate from here? Like what are the catalyst that you're looking for that would be an indicator that the return of the pricing power and closing the gap on rate? Thanks.\nJoe Margolis: Yes. I mean, clearly, a pickup in demand would be positive. Whether that's going to come from the housing market or otherwise, I think it's probably a little of both, right? We'll probably have a slow and steady improvement in the housing market, not a hockey stick. I think continued moderation of new development is a positive that will help us as well. So, we can't control market conditions, but we can control how we react to them. And I'm highly confident that our systems will optimize performance given whatever market conditions were presented with. And when I look at our occupancy, which is 94 -- Extra Space same store pool, 94.5% in July and 93.9% for the Life Storage in July. I'm very confident in our systems are capturing the demand that's out there and maximizing revenue.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you, very much.\nJoe Margolis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes, thank. I guess, good morning still out there. Maybe Joe or Scott, can you maybe -- maybe I missed it, did you touch on the July trends at all? And if you haven't, could you just kind of provide where July trends are on some of the key metrics like occupancy and the revenue growth or kind of move-in rents. Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. So starting with the Extra Space pool, occupancy at the end of July or as of yesterday is 94.5% to 94.5%. So sequentially, we increased by 20 basis points. The Life Storage pool is now 93.9% sequentially up 10 basis points. Now, that came a bit at the expense of rate. So, during the second quarter, our achieved rate to new customers were down 8%. And during the month of July, they were down 12%, pretty similar for the Life Storage pool also.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Joe, maybe just going back to this EXR LSI and the pricing and a little disappointing that you didn't get the rate. I'm just wondering, is it possible that the customer mix was different. And before the merger, if LSI had lower street rates and charge less that attracted 1 type of customer and the fact that you're trying to bring them up to parity with EXR, just kind of either pushes them out of the system? Or I guess I'm just trying to think, is everybody at the same pricing level or do you have to fully turn that customer mix to get them back up to parity on the EXR rent side?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. It's a good question, Steve, but I don't think so. And the reason I don't think so is, when we track move out as a result of ECRI. The Life Storage customers are actually moving out at a slightly lower level than an Extra Space customers. So they're -- and it very, very slightly. So they're basically behaving the same. So I think a storage customer is a storage customer, and they act the same weather they're behind yellow doors or green doors.\nScott Stubbs: Yes. Steve, we would point a little bit more to this being a new customer issue, meaning the existing customers are still behaving quite well. We're seeing strength with those customers. But the new customer has been price sensitive, and this came at a time when we were trying to increase occupancy.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks, guys.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, it's Eric Wolfe here with Nick. Sorry, if I missed this in the last question, but did you say where LSI rates are compared to XR. Just curious whether you took it back down to that sort of 10% gap that was in place before.\nScott Stubbs: So we have put them on parity with extra space, where they compete with extra space stores. So we have not dropped them back down.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. So you haven't dropped them back down. And so the guidance reduction of 200 basis points, isn't due to pricing, it's due to less moving customers, less occupancy? Like I'm just trying to understand what sort of specifically drove that 200 basis point -- 200 basis point reduction.\nJoe Margolis: So there's -- each unit is priced but then is adjusted every night, every unit type and every store is adjusted based on the models, historic data of vacates and rentals and then projected data vacates in rentals. So while we set a price, it's not a fixed price for any period of time that's charged. That's the base price, if you will, and then the model will adjust that price going forward. And we produce projections based on how we think that's going to work out and result in what type of revenue gain.\nScott Stubbs: Eric, you've effectively brought more customers in at lower prices, so you're starting off a lower base. And that takes some time to work through. We expect those customers to accept rate increases similar to other customers, but it does take time to work through if they came in at lower rates.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. Okay. And then the second question. If I look at your same-store net rental income, it was up 70 bps. Your occupancy was up 40 bps and your net rents were down 10, so it looks like there's a bit of a gap there, like 40 or 50 basis points. Is that extra gap just sort of expansion or renovation activity? And would you say that's sustainable, that benefit would be sustainable through the rest of the year?\nScott Stubbs: So some of that can be timing on the numbers you just gave and exactly where they are. And then some of that is expansion or change in units. We are constantly modifying our units in terms of converting them large to small or small to large, but there is some degree of expansion in our portfolio.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Just wanted to follow up on that prior question. But from the perspective of the new customer rates, so how much -- or how have the new customer rates changed as a result of I guess, still having a price-sensitive customer. I get it that it takes a while to move the in place. So how have you changed your thought process after reaching occupancy parity for that new customer? And how does that compare to extra, I guess, relative to prior guidance. Still a little bit unclear there.\nJoe Margolis: So we had projected that once we achieved in the Life Storage pool this level of occupancy, we would be able to have higher new customer rates and the behavior of the tenants is not allowing us to do that. We still need to be aggressive with rates to capture those tenants, particularly the web tenants.\nJuan Sanabria: Just to compare with versus the extra experience, you haven't necessarily had to have stayed as aggressive for new customers on the extra versus LSI.\nJoe Margolis: No, I'm sorry.\nJuan Sanabria: And that's just due to geographies?\nJoe Margolis: No, I'm sorry if I gave that impression. The extra space customers, they're the same customers, right? The self-storage customer is sensitive, new self-storage customers, price sensitive, whether they end up on the LSI website or on the extra space website. So we also have been had to be aggressive with the extra space customer and frankly, that's why we have 0.6% revenue growth. I mean, we're still significantly outperforming extra space at the life storage pool. It's just not to the extent we expected.\nJuan Sanabria: Got you. Okay. Then just to -- what should we think of as the exit run rate for both pools for same store revenue? Just in general, we could do the math on what's implied for the second half, but should we think of the growth rate for same store revenue improving or being fairly steady between the third and fourth quarter for each of the two pools?\nScott Stubbs: I'll talk about two pools. So the extra space pool is going to be fairly steady. I mean, it's not a big swoosh. You're not seeing it drop drastically and then coming back really strong at the end of the year, it's pretty steady. Life storage on a year-over-year basis, there obviously is more of a deceleration in the back half in terms of a year-over-year as we're coming up against much more difficult costs as we did a large volume of rate increases as we took over that portfolio last August.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nKeegan Carl: Yeah. Thanks for the time, guys. Maybe first, just two-parter, I guess, how do you think about your marketing spend trending the rest of the year, and ultimately, what's that translating to in your top-of-the-funnel demand?\nScott Stubbs: So our marketing spend has been up on a year-over-year basis. If you just take the extra space portfolio, it is about 2% of revenues, but it is a 20% increase year-over-year. So we had very, very low marketing spend during COVID in the periods following that. We would expect it to be pretty consistent through this year. The life storage spend has been slightly more elevated than that as a percentage of revenue. It's about 3% of revenue, and we would expect it to continue through the year.\nKeegan Carl: Then just on top-of-the-funnel demand, I guess just more broadly, what are you guys seeing and maybe how does that compare to your comments at NAREIT?\nJoe Margolis: Very similar. I think demand is measured by kind of generic Google search terms, storage near me, things like that. It's very similar to 2019. So kind of historical levels, but it is down from last year and the year before when we had elevated demand. No real change in that area.\nKeegan Carl: Got it. Then just maybe more broadly within your embedded guide, I guess I'm just curious on a year-over-year occupancy Delta versus last year, just any more color and how you expect to trend through the back half, and if you've changed any of those assumptions in your guidance range?\nScott Stubbs: So on the Extra Space pool, we did not change. And again, we're guiding more for revenue than occupancy, because revenue is going to be an output of rate occupancy, all of those things, and so no significant changes in our assumptions on the Extra Space pool. On the Life Storage pool, obviously, occupancy is continues to be at the higher levels, more similar to Extra Space, but again, not big changes in the back half in terms of an occupancy guide, just more of a revenue guide there.\nKeegan Carl: Great. Thanks for time guys.\nScott Stubbs: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey guys, thanks for the time. Joe, just wanted to follow up on one of your opening remarks. It sounded like the LSI property is just underperforming your internal projections. Is there anything in particular that you think is driving that underperformance?\nJoe Margolis: Well, I mentioned geographical differentiation between the pools. Certainly, that's one thing. I would also say that we have not gotten the improvement in the Life storage organic strength, SEO strength that we expected. And we've made up for some of that to increase marketing spend, increased paid search. Scott just mentioned that. But our thought was a year or nine months really into running the second brand, second website, the Life Storage, SEO would be closer to the Extra Space strength than it actually is.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Does that maybe change how you're thinking about the SEO on a go-forward basis? Like would you want to put the -- make the brands one, or still keep them separate?\nJoe Margolis: So the decision to test dual brand was based on the theory that if we have twice the digital real estate in the paid section, in the local section and in the organic section, we would have more clicks and more rentals and that benefit would outweigh the cost of running two brands. And we certainly see that in the page that's easy to buy it. We've had progress and are seeing movement in the local section where we have -- we've been most disappointed is in the organic section. And it's something we're looking at. We're looking at the data. We'll let the test run its course, and then we'll make the decision.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones, staying on the different pools between Life Storage and EXR. I guess, if we think about three to five years out, when should we expect both pools behave similarly. I mean, it sounds like the pricing is the same or the average prices are the same, maybe one has higher occupancy. But at what point does this converge, or will it always sort of be two separate pools three, four, five years down the road?\nScott Stubbs: I would expect it to converge at some point. The store -- the pools are slightly different in terms of makeup, in terms of demographics, things like that. But overall, they should behave the same. But I would expect Life Storage to outperform in terms of year-over-year revenue growth in 2025.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then my second commentary question, I should say, is just maybe can you talk about that you talked about, there's a lot more sort of competition or pricing in the market. Maybe if you could just contextualize that. What do you think specifically is driving that? Is that less activity in the housing markets? Is it the consumer is more price sensitive? Like, what do you think is maybe leading to a little bit more competition than you would have anticipated on the pricing?\nJoe Margolis: So I think it's several factors. I think the housing market is a factor. I think sometimes it can be overblown, right? Our peak percentage of customers who tell us they were in the moving process was in 2021 with 61% of our customers. Now it's about 51% of our customers. So clearly, that's a decline and in effect, but it doesn't explain everything. I think we need to remember that in 2020, we were in the peak of a three-year development cycle, three-year deliveries of development almost 80% of our same-store pool had new supply delivered in the three years, 2018, 2019 and 2020. And that got masked by COVID, the excess COVID demand kind of masked that new development supply. And now that excess demand is gone and in markets that have those new -- that new supply, we feel impact. I also think the consumer is weak, right? We've had several years of inflation outpacing wage growth. Inflation has slowed down, but we have no disinflation, right? Prices are still high. The extra money the government throw into the economy is -- is largely gone, right? Savings rates are down from their historic highs, credit card debt defaults, auto loan defaults are increasing. We have a weaker consumer, and we see that in their shopping behavior.\nRonald Kamdem: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks so much.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here. When you talk about some of the additional pricing sensitivity with your customer base. How do you notice that on web traffic, whether it be customers jumping around from your pace to a competitive page, I'm not sure if that's trackable, by any kind of metrics that you can share where we are today versus maybe a year ago?\nJoe Margolis: I think there's a number of ways to observe it. But the best way is we'll pretty continually run a test where we have a series of stores or units at stores that are priced 5% higher or 5% lower than we think they should then the model thinks they should be. And we can see the consumer reaction to a 5% increase in prices or a 5% decrease in prices. And that really helps us kind of zero in on what the right price is and which -- which combination of rate and rental volume and discount and marketing spend maximizes revenue.\nKi Bin Kim: Got it. And the second question on your expenses for payroll and utilities. Can you just give a broad sense what we should expect for payroll going forward? Should it be more inflationary? Or are there other things that you might -- we do like FTEs at the stores. And on the solar side, I mean, on the utility side, is that decrease being driven mostly by like solar initiatives? And just curious like how much more room may you have to add more solar, if that was the driver?\nScott Stubbs : Yes. So on the payroll side, first half of this year, it is slightly elevated. Some of that's a comp issue. So last year, we ran fewer hours at the stores, as we were basically just a little bit understaffed. So this year, it -- not only do you have the wage increase, you also have the increase in hours. We would expect that to be less in the back half of the year to become more inflationary. In terms of utilities, we've actually been quite aggressive on the solar side for a lot of years. Prior to the Life Storage acquisition, we had about 50% of our fully owned stores that have solar on them, so that is clearly benefiting us. We continue to look for opportunities to have a good yield, and we continue to install solar. One of the opportunities with the Life Storage acquisition is more stores to install solar. We've also been focused on our HVAC and getting that to be more efficient. We've also done a lot of LED lighting. So solar is obviously a big component of that and probably the bigger driver, but also some opportunities on HVAC and LED lighting.\nJoe Margolis : Just as a follow-up comment on payroll, I think, it could be a mistake to look at payroll expense in a vacuum, because we can reduce -- anybody can reduce payroll expense, but it's important to also understand what are the impacts of that. Does that mean if you cut store hours, you have to have more call center agents? Does it mean that you have to have R&M? We noticed that the fewer number of bodies we have in the store, the more small fires we have, the more mattresses we have left in the hallway. And then most importantly, what does it do to rentals? If you lose rentals in a high operating margin business, your efforts to reduce payroll can be counterproductive. So we want to be as careful as we can as efficient we can with payroll, but we don't want to do it at the expense of hurting the store or hurting revenue.\nKi Bin Kim: All that makes sense to me. Thank you.\nScott Stubbs : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. There's an uptick in acquisition guidance for the year. I wondered if you could comment on the bid-ask spread that you're seeing in the market and where cap rates are trending.\nJoe Margolis: Sure. So our increase of guidance was really the function of us capturing three deals that we didn't expect to. And it's not a reflection that we see the market changing drastically. I think the market is still muted. There's still a bid-ask spread. There'll likely be a few more transactions at the second half of the year as there always are in any year. But I don't think there's a material change in market dynamics, right? Leverage buyers are still on the sidelines. Most storage owners aren't in distressed. They don't need to sell. And if they can't get their price, they'll just hold or frankly, what we're seeing, they'll come to us for a bridge loan. And one of the reasons our bridge loan activity is up is because the acquisition market is quiet and people are looking for other options.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. That's helpful. And then on the third-party management, you mentioned the internalization of one of your prior customers. Can you just talk about what drove that decision and if you would expect more of that to occur?\nJoe Margolis: This was a owner that we inherited from Life Storage. They were a capital partner. They purchased a self-storage company and operating platform and moved all of their stores to that operating platform. So we lost 63 stores in the quarter, 59 of them were because of this internalization of management. Other than that, we only lost four stores. So part of having over 1,400 stores on our third-party management platform, is that every now and then you lose a portfolio, and we've lost portfolios in the past, but we continue to grow at a very healthy pace. We've added 174 stores gross throughout the year and 86 net, and that's a very, very healthy year for us, and we see the demand continuing.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hongliang Zhang with JPMorgan.\nHongliang Zhang: Hey, guys. I guess you've talked about street rates being down 8% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. I was wondering how you expect that gap to trend throughout the rest of the year.\nScott Stubbs: So we don't see a catalyst for a big -- for us to be able to have a lot of pricing power. I think that's the reality. I think with housing market down with the consumer where they are, we don't see a strong catalyst. Our guidance doesn't imply that. That being said, we are going to -- the street rates are somewhat an outcome of your occupancy, your rentals, the volume, what you're giving. And we're going to solve for occupancy -- the first thing we look at is occupancy -- I'm sorry, not occupancy, but for revenue, sorry. So you can use occupancy, you can use street rate all to solve for occupancy. And as we've always said, we are solving for I did it again. We are solving for revenue. We want to make sure that we use these other tools to solve for revenue.\nJoe Margolis: I'm going to answer that question. .\nScott Stubbs: I know .\nHongliang Zhang: And then I guess on -- just thinking about the magnitude of ECRIs, how do those compare and the EXL portfolio versus the LSI portfolio? Are you doing anything different in terms of rent increases for either one?\nJoe Margolis: No. Now that everything is priced at parity they're on the same system, they're on the same ECRI system. So it's the same.\nHongliang Zhang: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. First question, I just wanted to follow up -- sorry to harp on the changes here to the EXR and LSI revenue growth guidance. But you commented, you moved LSI pricing to parity with EXR. Did not see the improvement in achieved rents that you anticipated, which led to the decrease for LSI, but what caused the increase in the EXR revenue growth forecast?\nScott Stubbs: So I think it was really more a function of us taking the bottom end of the guidance off the table. Based on where the stores are halfway through the year, we didn't feel like that was a likely scenario.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then just going back to, I think, Ki Bin's question around, a little bit around the web and web traffic. Are there any structural differences at this point in the websites or anything related to running separate banners that you're \u2013 you're starting to identify or see. I'm just -- I'm not clear on how the sites and banners have been integrated on the back end, I guess. And I'm just curious if you're seeing differences there either in terms of levels of web demand or customers finding you or the overall execution of leasing on the LSI versus the EXR websites?\nJoe Margolis: No. So we addressed the differences in website, and I'll give you one example. When we closed the transaction, the LSI website was twice as slow or the Extra Space website was twice as fast as the LSI website. And that's an important signal to Google. That's one of the factors Google looks in when they decide who's going to be first in the SEO ranking. So all of those things that we could address, we addressed. So the websites physically, if you will are now comparable. The challenge we're having is if Life Storage average seven or eight, the seventh or eighth spot on the SEO, and we've improved it to five to six, that's not enough to get the results we want. We need to continue to see improvement where we could get that up into the top three locations to get the benefit we're hoping for. And there are dozens of factors that Google takes into account in determining when someone searches storage near me, who they're going to put first in the organic rankings and who they're going to put second and third. And those are the things that we need to work on and continue to see improvement in.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And just lastly, normally, I think you moved the LSI portfolio or you'd move acquisitions into the same-store next year in 2025 from when you closed LSI, I think there was some uncertainty on what you would do there. Any sense whether you're going to move them into the same store in 2025 or continue to break out the two segments?\nScott Stubbs: Our plan would be to move them into same-store, but we would still provide the previous year, so you should be able to see it kind of before and after.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Maryland REIT Research.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to again just keep focusing on LSI. I guess, with the big increase in occupancy, it does sound like the lease-up you were trying to get in that portfolio has happened, and so when I just kind of think about going forward with ECRI, I think you can average inflation rents in this portfolio next balance in change, reflecting kind of I called the lower move-in rates, but for your EXR portfolio, it's in the low 20s. I mean, is that the pickup we should be looking for over time? And what time period yet that average increase went from say to 22, 23 and change?\nScott Stubbs: Yeah. So when you look at the average rent per square foot between the two portfolios, they are structurally different somewhat. Some of them are -- they're in different demographics, different markets. And when the markets where we compete is the markets we refer to closing the gap. So we would expect them to behave like the Extra Space property in the markets they compete, and we would expect them to continue to perform better on the Extra Space platform, but not necessarily be on the -- at the exact same rent per square foot.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Perfect. That's helpful. And then on the credit lending side, again, nice pickup in activity. Again, just kind of curious how much more you can potentially expect that to grow on a going-forward basis? And how does one kind of think about the ideal balance between the credit lending platform versus kind of classic acquisitions?\nJoe Margolis: Yes. So, we've grown that pretty significantly this year for a few reasons. One is we had very few maturities this year, and some of those maturities chose to extend. I discussed earlier kind of the effect of a muted acquisition market on greater demand for that product. And then we made a capital allocation decision, right? We had a quiet year on the acquisition front. So, we're holding incrementally more of the loans on our balance sheet because that's a good use of capital when we don't have as many acquisition opportunities. I would expect over time, things will change and maybe when the acquisition market gets more active, we'll sell more loans and hold less on our balance sheet. We certainly have more maturities next year than we do this year, and we'll have to address that. But I think this is a viable business that serves a number of benefits to the company and increases our management business. It gives us an acquisition pipeline. It increases the number of relationships we have across the business and provides great economics. So, I think it's a business we can continue to grow.\nOmotayo Okusanya: Thank you.\nJoe Margolis: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I know you guys gave some of the move-in rate commentary for July. I just wanted to see if it was possible to get sort of like the dollar rate. You give it in this up for the quarter ended the 133. Is it possible to get what that number is for July?\nScott Stubbs: It's 129 move in and a move out of 180.\nJoe Margolis: That's Extra Space.\nScott Stubbs: Yes, that's the Extra Space.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then I guess the other question is just on the balance sheet. Scott, like what -- the line of credit balance going up, which I assume is related to all the bridge loan activity, how should we think about just debt, how you're thinking about the debt component going forward because the balance has gotten higher? Thanks.\nScott Stubbs: So, we have a few bridge loan sales lined up here in the next month that I'll bring it down some. And then we will look to turn that out as that volume gets larger or as we have opportunities. So, I think that you can see is in the bond market as soon as this quarter or a later in the year or early next year.\nNick Yulico: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And as I see no further questions in the queue, I will turn the call back to Joe Margolis for his closing remarks.\nJoe Margolis: Great. Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for your time and interest in Extra Space Storage. But a lot of questions about Life Storage and how it's not performed as expected. I truly believe that's a timing factor. We will get to those rates and that improvement that we want. And when I look across all other areas of the business, whether it's our expense control, our G&A, our ancillary businesses, like management, bridge lending, the company is really performing at a very high level, and I'm confident we can continue to do so in the future. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jared, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We had a great quarter, exceeding our internal FFO per share projections due to outperformance in multiple areas of our business, allowing us to increase our 2024 FFO outlook. We experienced steady improvement in Extra Space same-store occupancy for the second quarter, ending at 94.3% and continue to see occupancy gains in July. Our second quarter occupancy represents 110 basis point sequential gain over our first quarter occupancy and a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year. In the same period, the average move-in rate improved by approximately 12%. However, it is still about 8% below last year's average moving rate. The combination of increased move-in rate and occupancy gain contributed to a 0.6% increase in Extra Space same-store revenue year-over-year. Same-store expenses increased by 6% for the quarter compared to the same period last year, marginally better than internal projections. As expected, we saw significant gains in occupancy for the Life Storage same-store pool, finishing the quarter at 93.8%. This represents an increase of 400 basis points year-over-year and a 200 basis point improvement over first quarter levels. The occupancy gains drove revenue growth for the Life Storage same-store pool of 1.8% year-over-year. Given the occupancy gains, we expected to generate significant pricing power at the Life Storage properties. Midway through the quarter, we eliminated the move-in rate discounts and placed new customer pricing for the Life Storage properties on par with comparable extra space stores. However, the pricing improvement at the Life Storage stores has been below our internal projections. We are confident our approach is maximizing revenue at these stores. However, progress has been slower than anticipated. We remain convinced that we will continue to close the rate gap between Life Storage and extra space stores over time. Life Storage same-store property expenses increased by 0.8% year-over-year, significantly better than our internal projections. The team has done a great job finding additional expense efficiencies, and we can now project lower expenses, particularly with respect to property taxes and in the controllable areas of R&M, utilities, and payroll for the second half of the year. Turning to growth. While the transaction environment remains muted, our capital-light external growth programs continue to make gains. In the quarter, we added 77 third-party managed stores, netting 14 stores after factoring in the expected departure of a large portfolio that internalized management. Year-to-date, we have added 86 net stores to the platform, one of the strongest first halves of the year ever. Additionally, our bridge loan program expanded with $433 million in new loans originated in this quarter. Our greater scale and sophisticated operating platform have led to meaningful wins in other areas of the business, including G&A and tenant insurance. We're working hard to continue to find efficiencies in all areas of the business to drive FFO growth despite the difficult operating environment at the stores. I will now turn the time over to Scott. Sure, Michael. So when we took the portfolio over, we had a significant 420 basis point occupancy gap. And that was the first thing we worked on. And the main tool, we used over the last year was discounting the new customer rate at the Life Storage stores below the Extra Space stores. And we made good progress. And by mid-quarter, we were close enough to occupancy parity that we remove that extra discount at the Life Storage stores. We then thought we would gain pricing power, and we just didn't gain as much as we did. The customers new customers remain price sensitive, and we haven't been able to move new customer rates at the Life Storage stores or the Extra Space stores as much as we would have hoped. So that is certainly a factor in our projected revenue for the Life Storage stores for the rest of the year. Another factor is geography, as you pointed out. When we close this merger, one thing we were excited about was the effect on our portfolio footprint. By merging with Life Storage, we reduced our proportional exposure to California and increased our proportional exposure to Sunbelt markets, including Florida, for example. And we still are happy about that. We think long term, we believe in the Sunbelt. We believe in Florida. We're happy to have greater exposure in those growth markets. But it worked against us this year. Extra Space has 23% of its same-store revenue coming from California, Life Storage has 7% and California is an outperforming market this year. And conversely, Extra Space has 10% of our same-store revenue coming from Florida, Life Storage has 16% and Florida is an underperforming market this year. So I think it's timing. Long term, we like where we are. We think we'll close the rate gap and we like our geographical footprint. Yes. I mean, clearly, a pickup in demand would be positive. Whether that's going to come from the housing market or otherwise, I think it's probably a little of both, right? We'll probably have a slow and steady improvement in the housing market, not a hockey stick. I think continued moderation of new development is a positive that will help us as well. So, we can't control market conditions, but we can control how we react to them. And I'm highly confident that our systems will optimize performance given whatever market conditions were presented with. And when I look at our occupancy, which is 94 -- Extra Space same store pool, 94.5% in July and 93.9% for the Life Storage in July. I'm very confident in our systems are capturing the demand that's out there and maximizing revenue. Thank you. Yes. It's a good question, Steve, but I don't think so. And the reason I don't think so is, when we track move out as a result of ECRI. The Life Storage customers are actually moving out at a slightly lower level than an Extra Space customers. So they're -- and it very, very slightly. So they're basically behaving the same. So I think a storage customer is a storage customer, and they act the same weather they're behind yellow doors or green doors. Sure. So there's -- each unit is priced but then is adjusted every night, every unit type and every store is adjusted based on the models, historic data of vacates and rentals and then projected data vacates in rentals. So while we set a price, it's not a fixed price for any period of time that's charged. That's the base price, if you will, and then the model will adjust that price going forward. And we produce projections based on how we think that's going to work out and result in what type of revenue gain. Thanks, Eric. So we had projected that once we achieved in the Life Storage pool this level of occupancy, we would be able to have higher new customer rates and the behavior of the tenants is not allowing us to do that. We still need to be aggressive with rates to capture those tenants, particularly the web tenants. No, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry if I gave that impression. The extra space customers, they're the same customers, right? The self-storage customer is sensitive, new self-storage customers, price sensitive, whether they end up on the LSI website or on the extra space website. So we also have been had to be aggressive with the extra space customer and frankly, that's why we have 0.6% revenue growth. I mean, we're still significantly outperforming extra space at the life storage pool. It's just not to the extent we expected. Very similar. I think demand is measured by kind of generic Google search terms, storage near me, things like that. It's very similar to 2019. So kind of historical levels, but it is down from last year and the year before when we had elevated demand. No real change in that area. Well, I mentioned geographical differentiation between the pools. Certainly, that's one thing. I would also say that we have not gotten the improvement in the Life storage organic strength, SEO strength that we expected. And we've made up for some of that to increase marketing spend, increased paid search. Scott just mentioned that. But our thought was a year or nine months really into running the second brand, second website, the Life Storage, SEO would be closer to the Extra Space strength than it actually is. So the decision to test dual brand was based on the theory that if we have twice the digital real estate in the paid section, in the local section and in the organic section, we would have more clicks and more rentals and that benefit would outweigh the cost of running two brands. And we certainly see that in the page that's easy to buy it. We've had progress and are seeing movement in the local section where we have -- we've been most disappointed is in the organic section. And it's something we're looking at. We're looking at the data. We'll let the test run its course, and then we'll make the decision. Sure. So I think it's several factors. I think the housing market is a factor. I think sometimes it can be overblown, right? Our peak percentage of customers who tell us they were in the moving process was in 2021 with 61% of our customers. Now it's about 51% of our customers. So clearly, that's a decline and in effect, but it doesn't explain everything. I think we need to remember that in 2020, we were in the peak of a three-year development cycle, three-year deliveries of development almost 80% of our same-store pool had new supply delivered in the three years, 2018, 2019 and 2020. And that got masked by COVID, the excess COVID demand kind of masked that new development supply. And now that excess demand is gone and in markets that have those new -- that new supply, we feel impact. I also think the consumer is weak, right? We've had several years of inflation outpacing wage growth. Inflation has slowed down, but we have no disinflation, right? Prices are still high. The extra money the government throw into the economy is -- is largely gone, right? Savings rates are down from their historic highs, credit card debt defaults, auto loan defaults are increasing. We have a weaker consumer, and we see that in their shopping behavior. Sure. I think there's a number of ways to observe it. But the best way is we'll pretty continually run a test where we have a series of stores or units at stores that are priced 5% higher or 5% lower than we think they should then the model thinks they should be. And we can see the consumer reaction to a 5% increase in prices or a 5% decrease in prices. And that really helps us kind of zero in on what the right price is and which -- which combination of rate and rental volume and discount and marketing spend maximizes revenue. Just as a follow-up comment on payroll, I think, it could be a mistake to look at payroll expense in a vacuum, because we can reduce -- anybody can reduce payroll expense, but it's important to also understand what are the impacts of that. Does that mean if you cut store hours, you have to have more call center agents? Does it mean that you have to have R&M? We noticed that the fewer number of bodies we have in the store, the more small fires we have, the more mattresses we have left in the hallway. And then most importantly, what does it do to rentals? If you lose rentals in a high operating margin business, your efforts to reduce payroll can be counterproductive. So we want to be as careful as we can as efficient we can with payroll, but we don't want to do it at the expense of hurting the store or hurting revenue. Sure. So our increase of guidance was really the function of us capturing three deals that we didn't expect to. And it's not a reflection that we see the market changing drastically. I think the market is still muted. There's still a bid-ask spread. There'll likely be a few more transactions at the second half of the year as there always are in any year. But I don't think there's a material change in market dynamics, right? Leverage buyers are still on the sidelines. Most storage owners aren't in distressed. They don't need to sell. And if they can't get their price, they'll just hold or frankly, what we're seeing, they'll come to us for a bridge loan. And one of the reasons our bridge loan activity is up is because the acquisition market is quiet and people are looking for other options. This was a owner that we inherited from Life Storage. They were a capital partner. They purchased a self-storage company and operating platform and moved all of their stores to that operating platform. So we lost 63 stores in the quarter, 59 of them were because of this internalization of management. Other than that, we only lost four stores. So part of having over 1,400 stores on our third-party management platform, is that every now and then you lose a portfolio, and we've lost portfolios in the past, but we continue to grow at a very healthy pace. We've added 174 stores gross throughout the year and 86 net, and that's a very, very healthy year for us, and we see the demand continuing. I'm going to answer that question. . No. Now that everything is priced at parity they're on the same system, they're on the same ECRI system. So it's the same. No. So we addressed the differences in website, and I'll give you one example. When we closed the transaction, the LSI website was twice as slow or the Extra Space website was twice as fast as the LSI website. And that's an important signal to Google. That's one of the factors Google looks in when they decide who's going to be first in the SEO ranking. So all of those things that we could address, we addressed. So the websites physically, if you will are now comparable. The challenge we're having is if Life Storage average seven or eight, the seventh or eighth spot on the SEO, and we've improved it to five to six, that's not enough to get the results we want. We need to continue to see improvement where we could get that up into the top three locations to get the benefit we're hoping for. And there are dozens of factors that Google takes into account in determining when someone searches storage near me, who they're going to put first in the organic rankings and who they're going to put second and third. And those are the things that we need to work on and continue to see improvement in. Yes. So, we've grown that pretty significantly this year for a few reasons. One is we had very few maturities this year, and some of those maturities chose to extend. I discussed earlier kind of the effect of a muted acquisition market on greater demand for that product. And then we made a capital allocation decision, right? We had a quiet year on the acquisition front. So, we're holding incrementally more of the loans on our balance sheet because that's a good use of capital when we don't have as many acquisition opportunities. I would expect over time, things will change and maybe when the acquisition market gets more active, we'll sell more loans and hold less on our balance sheet. We certainly have more maturities next year than we do this year, and we'll have to address that. But I think this is a viable business that serves a number of benefits to the company and increases our management business. It gives us an acquisition pipeline. It increases the number of relationships we have across the business and provides great economics. So, I think it's a business we can continue to grow. Sure. That's Extra Space. Great. Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for your time and interest in Extra Space Storage. But a lot of questions about Life Storage and how it's not performed as expected. I truly believe that's a timing factor. We will get to those rates and that improvement that we want.

            "name": "Scott Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe and hello everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had a good quarter, driven by occupancy and steady revenue growth. In addition to G&A savings, we have experienced better-than-expected property operating expenses, specifically property taxes, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. The G&A and property level savings have come from a broad range of categories as we continue to find efficiencies and capitalize on our greater scale. Due to the steady Extra Space same-store performance through the leasing season, we are raising the bottom end of our revenue guidance by 100 basis points bringing the midpoint to negative 0.25%. We have also reduced our expense guidance dropping the midpoint by 25 basis points to 4.5%. Accordingly, the bottom end of our net operating income guidance is being raised by 125 basis points to a negative 1.75% at the midpoint. Regarding the Life Storage same-store pool, the lower-than-expected pricing power has led to a reduction in our revenue expectations for the year. We have reduced our annual same-store revenue guidance by 200 basis points at the midpoint. Fortunately, this is partially offset by lower-than-expected expenses for these properties. As a result, we are also revising our expense guidance downward by 200 basis points at the midpoint and consequently, we have adjusted Life Storage same-store NOI guidance to a range of negative 1.5% to positive 1% for the year. Given the recent demand and volume of bridge loans, we have raised the 2024 average outstanding loan guidance and increased our expected interest income. We've also lowered our estimates for G&A and increased our management fees and tenant reinsurance income. Additionally, we adjusted interest expense and income tax expense guidance to reflect the current business environment. These revisions have contributed to a raise of the lower end of our FFO guidance from $7.85 per share to $7.95 per share, a $0.05 increase at the midpoint. And with that, let's open it up for questions. Yes. So starting with the Extra Space pool, occupancy at the end of July or as of yesterday is 94.5% to 94.5%. So sequentially, we increased by 20 basis points. The Life Storage pool is now 93.9% sequentially up 10 basis points. Now, that came a bit at the expense of rate. So, during the second quarter, our achieved rate to new customers were down 8%. And during the month of July, they were down 12%, pretty similar for the Life Storage pool also. Yes. Steve, we would point a little bit more to this being a new customer issue, meaning the existing customers are still behaving quite well. We're seeing strength with those customers. But the new customer has been price sensitive, and this came at a time when we were trying to increase occupancy. So we have put them on parity with extra space, where they compete with extra space stores. So we have not dropped them back down. Eric, you've effectively brought more customers in at lower prices, so you're starting off a lower base. And that takes some time to work through. We expect those customers to accept rate increases similar to other customers, but it does take time to work through if they came in at lower rates. So some of that can be timing on the numbers you just gave and exactly where they are. And then some of that is expansion or change in units. We are constantly modifying our units in terms of converting them large to small or small to large, but there is some degree of expansion in our portfolio. I'll talk about two pools. So the extra space pool is going to be fairly steady. I mean, it's not a big swoosh. You're not seeing it drop drastically and then coming back really strong at the end of the year, it's pretty steady. Life storage on a year-over-year basis, there obviously is more of a deceleration in the back half in terms of a year-over-year as we're coming up against much more difficult costs as we did a large volume of rate increases as we took over that portfolio last August. So our marketing spend has been up on a year-over-year basis. If you just take the extra space portfolio, it is about 2% of revenues, but it is a 20% increase year-over-year. So we had very, very low marketing spend during COVID in the periods following that. We would expect it to be pretty consistent through this year. The life storage spend has been slightly more elevated than that as a percentage of revenue. It's about 3% of revenue, and we would expect it to continue through the year. So on the Extra Space pool, we did not change. And again, we're guiding more for revenue than occupancy, because revenue is going to be an output of rate occupancy, all of those things, and so no significant changes in our assumptions on the Extra Space pool. On the Life Storage pool, obviously, occupancy is continues to be at the higher levels, more similar to Extra Space, but again, not big changes in the back half in terms of an occupancy guide, just more of a revenue guide there. Thank you. I would expect it to converge at some point. The store -- the pools are slightly different in terms of makeup, in terms of demographics, things like that. But overall, they should behave the same. But I would expect Life Storage to outperform in terms of year-over-year revenue growth in 2025. Yes. So on the payroll side, first half of this year, it is slightly elevated. Some of that's a comp issue. So last year, we ran fewer hours at the stores, as we were basically just a little bit understaffed. So this year, it -- not only do you have the wage increase, you also have the increase in hours. We would expect that to be less in the back half of the year to become more inflationary. In terms of utilities, we've actually been quite aggressive on the solar side for a lot of years. Prior to the Life Storage acquisition, we had about 50% of our fully owned stores that have solar on them, so that is clearly benefiting us. We continue to look for opportunities to have a good yield, and we continue to install solar. One of the opportunities with the Life Storage acquisition is more stores to install solar. We've also been focused on our HVAC and getting that to be more efficient. We've also done a lot of LED lighting. So solar is obviously a big component of that and probably the bigger driver, but also some opportunities on HVAC and LED lighting. Thank you. So we don't see a catalyst for a big -- for us to be able to have a lot of pricing power. I think that's the reality. I think with housing market down with the consumer where they are, we don't see a strong catalyst. Our guidance doesn't imply that. That being said, we are going to -- the street rates are somewhat an outcome of your occupancy, your rentals, the volume, what you're giving. And we're going to solve for occupancy -- the first thing we look at is occupancy -- I'm sorry, not occupancy, but for revenue, sorry. So you can use occupancy, you can use street rate all to solve for occupancy. And as we've always said, we are solving for I did it again. We are solving for revenue. We want to make sure that we use these other tools to solve for revenue. I know . So I think it was really more a function of us taking the bottom end of the guidance off the table. Based on where the stores are halfway through the year, we didn't feel like that was a likely scenario. Our plan would be to move them into same-store, but we would still provide the previous year, so you should be able to see it kind of before and after. Yeah. So when you look at the average rent per square foot between the two portfolios, they are structurally different somewhat. Some of them are -- they're in different demographics, different markets. And when the markets where we compete is the markets we refer to closing the gap. So we would expect them to behave like the Extra Space property in the markets they compete, and we would expect them to continue to perform better on the Extra Space platform, but not necessarily be on the -- at the exact same rent per square foot. It's 129 move in and a move out of 180. Yes, that's the Extra Space. So, we have a few bridge loan sales lined up here in the next month that I'll bring it down some. And then we will look to turn that out as that volume gets larger or as we have opportunities. So, I think that you can see is in the bond market as soon as this quarter or a later in the year or early next year."

In addition to our press release, we have furnished unaudited supplemental financial information on our website. Please remember that management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by our forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. These forward-looking statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in the company's latest filings with the SEC, which we encourage our listeners to review.  \n Forward-looking statements represent management's estimates as of today, May 1, 2024. The company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements because of changing market conditions or other circumstances after the date of this conference call. \n I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Margolis, Chief Executive Officer. \nJoseph Margolis: Thanks, Jared, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. As many of you know, Jeff Norman has transitioned into another role within the organization as the Head of Treasury and Capital Markets. Many of you on this call have worked with Jeff and experienced his professionalism, responsiveness, fast knowledge and good nature. I recognize and appreciate his efforts to make Extra Space a leader in the industry, and look forward to his continued contribution to the company.  \n I would also like to introduce Jared Conley, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Jared has been with Extra Space since 2002 and has worked in various roles, most recently as our Head of Financial Planning and Analysis. We look forward to introducing him in person next month at NAREIT. \n Turning to this quarter's performance. We have seen sequential improvement in occupancy and rate since our fourth quarter earnings call in late February. Operationally, occupancy at the Extra Space same-store pool grew every month during a period normally recognized for seasonal declines, ending the quarter at 93.2%, a 50 basis point increase year-over-year. Our revenue strategy has allowed us to both improve occupancy and average move-in rate in the quarter, with the latter growing sequentially by approximately 8% from a seasonal low in January. The combination of improving move-in rate, higher occupancy, and steady existing customer rate increases have provided a 1% lift in Extra Space's same-store revenue performance, which is in line with our internal projections. \n Also, as expected, Extra Space same-store expense growth increased by 5.5% year-over-year. The legacy Life Storage same-store pool performance continues to improve, outpacing the Extra Space same-store properties. Revenue gained 1.7% year-over-year, which was in line with internal projections and against the backdrop of a difficult comp, where prior management pushed hard on rates in 2023 at the expense of occupancy.  \n Occupancy at our Life Storage improved to 92%, a 220 basis point improvement over last year, narrowing the gap between pools to 120 basis points at quarter end. At the end of April, this gap, which was over 400 basis points in closing, has further narrowed to 90 basis points on our platform. To do so, we have maintained lower rates through the quarter with the strategy of higher occupancy, leading to stronger new and existing customer rates through the remainder of the year. We believe improved rate performance will continue to lift these properties and ultimately bring them to parity with legacy Extra Space store rate and occupancy levels.  \n Life Storage same-store expenses increased 6.7% year-over-year, also due to an exceptionally hard 2023 comparable, but below internal projections. Expenses increased particularly in the areas of payroll and repairs and maintenance, as we address areas that were underinvested at this time last year.\n On the external growth front, the transaction market continues to be muted. However, we expanded our capital-light external growth activities, adding $164 million in new bridge loans meaningfully ahead of our projections. In addition, we added 97 third-party managed stores gross and 72 stores net. We continue to have the fastest-growing third-party management platform in the industry.  \n Overall, the year is unfolding as expected with wins in capital-light growth and G&A and expense savings. We are working hard and I am confident of our teams and infrastructure are well prepared to optimize performance during the important upcoming leasing season.\n I will now turn the time over to Scott. \nP. Stubbs: Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had another good quarter, driven by steady revenue, G&A savings, and better-than-expected property operating expenses, specifically property taxes. The G&A savings have been from a broad range of categories as we continue to seek efficiencies and capitalize on our greater scale. As mentioned in our prior call, we closed a $600 million bond offering in the quarter at a time when interest rates were more favorable than the current environment. Proceeds were used to repay the bridge loan that we used to acquire Life Storage and the offering helps reduce our exposure to variable interest rate debt. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we have plenty of dry powder to capitalize on an improving transactions market.  \n Due to the in-line nature of same-store performance, we are not making any revisions related to property operations. We will update our property guidance after the second quarter once we see how the leasing season progresses and how much pricing power we gain. We do expect to see continued savings in G&A and have adjusted our annual assumptions accordingly. We have also adjusted our annual average SOFR assumption, increasing interest expense, which is partially offset by increases in interest income from our bridge loan program. We are encouraged by the outsized rental volume year-to-date and the high occupancy at our stores, and we should be in a great position to maximize the performance at our properties as we move into the rental season.  \n With that, Michelle, let's open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith: Can you talk a little bit about what the trend was in April and how that kind of compares from the last couple of months of the end of the first quarter? \nP. Stubbs: Yes, Michael. So we ended the month of April at 93.7% occupied, which is still a 50 basis point delta over last year, and our rates improved sequentially month-over-month from the month of January. So what's happened in the quarter is we averaged about 14% negative achieved rates in the quarter. And in the month of April, that has moved to about negative 9% year-over-year. \nJoseph Margolis: So that 92.7% is the Extra Space same-store pool. We're at 92.8% for the Life Storage same-store pool. \nMichael Goldsmith: And my follow-up question is, to reach the midpoint of the guidance, it seems like you kind of hit your occupancy or have started to make some momentum there. I suspect that's going to translate to starting to push street rates. To meet the midpoint of your guidance, how much the street rates need to increase from here in order to achieve that midpoint level? \nJoseph Margolis: So street rates is only one component, right? And we're kind of agnostic as to whether we can maximize our revenue through street rates, through occupancy, through discounts, through marketing spend, through ECRI. So there's no one number we're targeting for any one of those metrics. We're trying to mix and match them to maximize revenue. \nMichael Goldsmith: So maybe if I ask that in a slightly different way. If ECRIs kind of remain steady and you get kind of the normal seasonality within occupancy, then how much street rate gains do you need in order to kind of meet your kind of internal expectations? \nP. Stubbs: Michael, we actually have not broken out street rates. If you remember on the last call, we actually didn't break them out. We said when we did our budgets, when we did our estimates and forecast, we did it based on revenue growth. And so street rate is a component of that, as is occupancy. And obviously, the better the street rates are, the better the occupancy, the higher we are going to be in that range. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. \nJeffrey Spector: I just want to confirm, thinking about your comments and where we stand here, May 1 versus, let's say, the last couple of years, where there was a bit less visibility, seasonality was a bit distorted or, I guess, can you just put the context of how you feel today versus the prior 2 years? Because it sounds like you're more comfortable, confident maybe with that seasonality. Normal seasonality trends are kicking in and we should expect that to continue for the remainder of the year. \nJoseph Margolis: So I think comfort is always greater as you get into and have some feeling as to how the leasing season is going to go. So at this time of year, before we're into the leasing season, in a period where we have reduced housing activity, where we have signs of consumer weakness, I'll say this, we have not enough comfort that we're going to change our guidance. \nJeffrey Spector: I understand that, Joe. I guess I'm just asking, though, again, part of the issue in the last couple of years was pinning down seasonality trends, right? And I feel like it's important to have a grasp on that seasonality trends are back normal, so your operations and systems are running smoothly and you're confident in those systems. Is that not a fair way to think about it? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So I think if you look at, say, occupancy seasonality, and you look at the annual occupancy curve pre-COVID to what we've experienced last year and what we expect to experience this year, our system has taken a great deal of the seasonality in occupancy out of our performance. We will keep our stores at higher occupancy levels at all times of the year. And I think you see that in the first quarter this year, right? The bigger question is how much rate power do we have and can we push rates at those occupancy levels? \nJeffrey Spector: And do you think we'll have a better feel when we see you at NAREIT, or again, could it be later in the summer like last year? \nJoseph Margolis: No, I think we get data every day, and we'll have more data and a better feel at NAREIT, and we'll have even more and a better feel in our next conference call, and we'll certainly keep all of our shareholders and interested parties up to date with what we know. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. \nEric Wolfe: If I look at the 165 stores added to the same-store pool this year, it looks like they're growing around 7%. And if you include the 2023 same-store pool, it looks like the 216 stores combined are going around 5%. So I was just wondering if the deceleration that you're predicting in your same-store revenue guidance is coming mainly from those stores just as occupancy comps get tougher through the year? Or is there something else that would be driving the deceleration? Or maybe you're just being conservative because it's early? But just trying to understand what would drive the deceleration to, call it, 1% same-store revenue to get you down to your midpoint? \nP. Stubbs: Eric, so the main driver of that is not the 165 stores. I mean, those stores actually increased our performance in the quarter. I think they added about 40 bps to our revenue growth in the quarter. Our revenue growth throughout the summer is impacted somewhat by our performance last year. Obviously, where you're coming off higher numbers, comps do get easier as you move throughout the year. But we are not seeing -- our current expectation, similar to when we gave our annual guidance is we're not expecting a major recovery from the housing market today. We're expecting things to kind of perform as they are today and not seeing a major rebound. And I think that's maybe one difference from what some other people have projected or thought. \nEric Wolfe: That's helpful. And then, I guess, conversely, on your LSI guidance, you're expecting looks like around 3.25% same-store revenue growth for the rest of the year. Can you just talk about the timing of that acceleration from your 1Q numbers? Obviously, your occupancy did increase, I think, 200 bps at quarter end, so that should drive over 200 bps same-store revenue growth, but just curious what gets you the rest of the way there to that 3.25%? I mean, when would you expect to see that? \nP. Stubbs: Yes. So obviously, it's a range that we provided. So it will depend a little bit on where you are in that range. But the way we're viewing this is, as occupancy moves up to parity with the Extra Space stores, those rates will move up. So today, our Life Storage stores have rates that are 5% to 10% below our Extra Space stores, as they are growing faster. We saw very good rentals in the first quarter. We've continued to close that occupancy gap. We would expect that occupancy gap to be closed at some point during this rental season and then see the growth in the back half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. \nNicholas Yulico: First question is just can you give us a feel for how ECRI is trending year-to-date versus, let's say, the back half of last year? On a percentage basis? \nJoseph Margolis: So I would say, very similarly. I mean, we're constantly testing and trying new things. But overall, the program is very similar to the back half of last year. Customers are accepting ECRI at the same rates. And it's an effective tool for us to maximize revenue. \nNicholas Yulico: And then in terms of -- maybe could you just elaborate a little bit further on that pricing strategy right now where it feels like it's been a heavily discounted promotional move in, web rate in some cases, and then you're trying to get that customer back up to a more normalized rate in a pretty quick time frame. Are you getting pushback from customers? I mean, what's sort of the feeling for that? And I guess I'm wondering, at some point, do you move away from that strategy as you get more comfortable with occupancy, and then that will help show improvement in move-in rates? How should we think about that? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So I mean, this strategy, you described it pretty well, right, for the web customer. They get a discounted rate, but no promotion, right, which is different than our peers, who offer many times promotions on the web. So the discounted rate, we do that because the data tells us these are the longer term and better customers, and that is the pricing package they react best to. We use ECRI to get them to street rate within a reasonable period of time. \n We have a different structure for the customer who walks in the store. And our data tells us and our testing tells us this is a very effective strategy. And when the data tells us and the testing tells us we should evolve it to something else, then we will. But it's not in place for a fixed period of time or until we see something. One of the advantages of our scale is we can constantly have a few hundred stores here and there or running different tests. And when we see something that tells us we need to evolve our strategy, we will. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. \nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping you could talk a little bit about the transaction market. You guys have done some deals in the first quarter and then expected to close over the balance of the year. So maybe you could give us a little flavor for the going in and stabilized yields that you're underwriting to? \nJoseph Margolis: Sure. So the transaction market is pretty muted. There's still a significant bid-ask spread. There's not a lot of distress in storage, so sellers don't need to sell in general. We see a lot of transactions get put on the market and get pulled, particularly larger transactions. It seems there's less capital for big portfolios than there are for one-offs. So the transaction market is pretty quiet. We did close 7 deals in the first quarter, but one of those was a joint venture development and one was a CO deal. So those were agreed to some time ago. \n We only approved. I think the better sense of the market is what's approved in a quarter, because the ones that closed might have been baked many, many, many months before. And we only approved 3 transactions in the first quarter. One was a remotely managed store and the initial cap rate was in the mid-6s. And then 2 developments where the development yield at a property level was in the high 8s and about 100 basis points higher to us because of the joint venture structure. So I mean, we'll do good deals like that when we see them, but there's not a lot of them in the market right now. \nJuan Sanabria: Great. And then just a bigger picture question. Maybe a little bit to Jeff's question earlier that you guys sound fairly optimistic, but the guidance doesn't necessarily call for any necessary reacceleration in the second half. But I guess, are you seeing signs at the different markets that individual markets are starting to reaccelerate at all? \nJoseph Margolis: So an advantage of our scale is how diversified we are and the exposure we have to many, many, many markets. And that's a purposeful portfolio of construction, because all of our data tells us that markets act differently. Not all markets move in the same direction. Even if you start to categorize markets by primary, secondary, tertiary, coastal, or whatever, they don't act with any correlation. And the reasons markets act differently is because of new supply situations, because of job growth and population, and because sometimes if the market does really well for a couple of years, as revenue growth over 20%, like we experienced in Atlanta, then the next year, it's not going to be so good. \n So because we have this wide exposure, we absolutely have markets that are reaccelerating, and we have markets that are flat, and we have markets that are not doing as well. And I think we'll always be in that position. But this broad diversification smooths our volatility, if you will. And we are big believers in having exposure to as many good growth markets as we possibly can. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. \nSamir Khanal: Maybe sticking to the last question here on markets. One market that sort of is lagging here is Florida. You look at Tampa, you look at Orlando. And I know that, looking at the integration of LSI, LSI had a big exposure to Florida. So I mean that occupancy gap is still about, I think, 180 to 200 basis points. How do you think about your ability to sort of close that gap given some of the dynamics in sort of Florida? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So great question. So yes, Florida, some of the markets in Florida are some of our weaker markets today. That's a good observation. That's partially because they did so well during COVID, and that's partially because of supply issues in some of those markets. But we're in this, and we did this merger for the long term. And over the long term, the Sunbelt markets, the Florida markets, and the population growth and the businesses that are moving there, we believe those are really good long-term markets. So yes, this quarter, some of those markets and maybe this year, some of those markets might be on the weaker side. But long term, we're really happy to have exposure down there. \n A market like Houston and Chicago, which we also increased our exposure to do the Life transaction, those markets are doing really well. They're kind of on the top of the sheet now. So again, it's great to have exposure to lots of different markets, because they'll always be moving in different directions. \nSamir Khanal: I guess my second question is around ECRIs. That's still holding up clearly. I guess what does it take for the consumer behavior to sort of shift? Is it job growth at this point? I mean, job growth with nonfarm payroll is still pretty strong month-to-month. I mean, is it really job growth that will sort of crack that? I mean, just kind of what your thoughts are? \nJoseph Margolis: So when we talk about the consumer, I think we have to separate the existing tenant consumer and the new tenant consumer. The existing tenant consumer is really strong and really price insensitive. We're not moving out in the face of ECRI, bad debt is very low, lengths of stay are incrementally improving. The storage customer, once they become a storage customer, is really a strong, sticky customer. \n We see more weakness in the new customer, the customer looking for storage. And that's where we see more price sensitivity. There's enough demand out there for us to capture more than our share and keep our stores at optimal occupancy, but it's the pricing strength that is an issue now. And I think we're at a period of time where we've had several quarters where inflation outpaced wage growth. The extra money that was pumped into the economy isn't there anymore. Savings rates are down. You have some weakness in the consumer, and that's what we're experiencing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nAnthony Peak: This is AJ on for Todd. Appreciate you guys taking the question. But first, just to piggyback off that last question. So vacates were down. But one of your peers noted that they saw a slight uptick in vacate activity and noted that there might be a normalization in the length of stay. You just noted that length of stay is incrementally improving. I'm curious, though, if you expect that to continue? Or do you see potential for vacate activity and the length of stay trends to normalize a bit moving forward? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So I probably explain that incorrectly. Length of stay is incrementally better than pre-COVID. It's worse than during COVID. We had that period where people just weren't leaving the stores. So overall, I'm looking at a longer period of time we're saying length of stay is incrementally improving. But it is clearly normalizing from COVID levels. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough on that. \nAnthony Peak: Yes, that clarification is helpful. And then transitioning just over to the structured finance book as that kind of continues to grow. So it seems like the demand for that product definitely seems strong today. How big are you comfortable with growing that to? And are you starting to see competition from others creating a more competitive environment for the bridge loan and mezz financing? \nJoseph Margolis: So we do see other people getting into the business. Some of our public peers have announced they want to get into this business. On the ground, we don't see competition yet. We're not losing loans. We don't hear people saying they're taking this to someone else to bid. But there's other lenders. There's competition for this business, just like there's competition for the management business or any other business we're in. And our job is to compete well, and that's what we're trying to do.  \n How big this can get? We have the ability to sell off the A notes in this structure. And that's a really good tool for us to be able to control how much of the balance sheet, how many of these loans we keep on the balance sheet. So we've picked up our guidance a little bit through this year as to what we expect to keep on the balance sheet, but we certainly have flexibility to move that number one way or another. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. \nKeegan Carl: Maybe first just on LSI. I'd love to hear how the performance of the portfolio is trending relative to your expectations at the start of the year? And do you think you fully realize revenue synergies in this yet? \nJoseph Margolis: So I think LSI performance in the first quarter was as expected on target, so we were happy with that. And we still have, as of today, a 90 basis point occupancy gap. And depending on what metric you look at, what pool of stores you look at, anywhere from an 8% to 12% rate gap. So we still have wood to chop. I think the good news is the tools we need, the infrastructure we need in place to close those gaps is largely there, right? So the LSI store manager is now performing close to or at the level of an extra space store manager in terms of conversion rates and all the metrics we use, right? And that took some time to get there. \n We've largely caught up on R&M and capital, and the stores look like an Extra Space store now in terms of cleanliness and repair, things like that. The LSI website is actually now faster than the Extra Space website. It was much slower when we bought it. So a lot of the customer acquisition metrics are improving. I'd say they're not all the way there yet for LSI, but improving. So we've made a lot of progress. We still have some wood to chop, and we still have some opportunity to capture. \nKeegan Carl: That's really helpful. And then I guess just shifting gears here a little bit. I know you guys don't necessarily break it out, but it would be helpful to maybe just understand how you expect your year-over-year occupancy delta to trend throughout the rest of this year? If anything might have changed from a few months ago? \nP. Stubbs: Yes. So we don't expect a significant occupancy delta for the entire year. Obviously, it's a component of your revenue, but we would expect it to be flat for most of the year, although we have been ahead some in the first quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street. \nSpenser Allaway: You guys have been successful with your revenue management strategy. But just thinking about how you had to cut moving rents fairly aggressively like peers. I'm just curious if you have a sense of how long, on average, based on the current cadence and magnitude of ECRIs, it would take you to get your new customer rent up to market level rents? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So I think there's a little bit of a misunderstanding baked into that question that we've cut rents more aggressively than our peers. And I think that comes from the web scraping data that is published and people see. When you look at that data, that's not adjusted for promotions. And we offer promotions. It's under 10% of our web customers get a first month free or a promotion like that. Where at our peers, it's the vast majority of their customers. So to compare our web rates to our peers' web rates, you have to adjust for promotions. And I think once you do that, you'll see we have not cut rates significantly more than our competitors. It's just not true. And our goal is, once someone comes in at a discounted rate, to get them to street rate within a reasonable period of time. And that may vary based on different factors, but within a reasonable period of time, they need to get the street rate. \nSpenser Allaway: And then you spoke about the progress you've made in closing the occupancy gap on the legacy LSI assets. But based on your growing knowledge of the LSI market, I'm just curious what you think is a sustainable long-term occupancy level for that portion of the portfolio? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So we had an 80% market overlap with LSI and Extra Space stores. So for 80% of the portfolio, it's the same. And we don't really target an occupancy level. Again, as we said earlier, it's just one factor that goes into the algorithm that is trying to maximize revenue. And it may be different in different types of markets based on customer behavior. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. \nCaitlin Burrows: I don't think this has been talked about yet. I just wanted to touch on the marketing spend. So can you talk about how you measure maybe the return on marketing spend and how long you expect this kind of level to sustain for? \nP. Stubbs: Yes, the first thing to look at here is really a marketing spend as a percentage of your revenues. If you look at our marketing spend as a percentage of revenues, we're still about 2%, which is still a very small component. On a year-over-year perspective, we get at the 23%, looks like a big number, but there's still a very positive yield. We look at the return on that spend in several different ways. It depends on where you're spending money, whether it's paper click, whether it's search engine optimization, or other areas. But we continue to have a very high return on that marketing spend, and it's a very small component of our expenses. \nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. And then maybe just thinking, I know you guys maximize revenue through both rate and occupancy. But as you think about maybe absolute rental rates, how much they've grown over the past few years, I guess, what kind of gives you confidence that there does continue to be upside to that rent per square foot number? \nP. Stubbs: So I think that -- what gives you confidence? I think the question was asked earlier, your guide versus your tone and where you are. I think we've seen positive things early in this year in terms of month-over-month rate increases. Now that's a positive. The negative is we're still negative to last year. So we are moving in the right direction. I think the leasing season will kind of be the real catalyst to say it was a great year or a good year or, hey, maybe it's still a little bit slow. So I think that it's really that June, July time frame when we're going to get a feel for that. But so far, occupancies held up sequentially, rate has improved, but it's still probably too early to really say, yes, it's been a good year so far. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronald Camden with Morgan Stanley. \nRonald Kamdem: The first one is just on housing. Can you sort of remind us what percent of your customers are coming in because of sort of home sales or the home activity and how you're thinking the demand is changing as rates have moved up? \nJoseph Margolis: Sure. So right now, about half of our customers, a little more, 51% of our customers tell us that they're moving. Now it doesn't mean they're buying a home, right? 45% of those 51% are moving from apartment to apartment. The peak of that was 61% in the third quarter of 2021. So we don't have enough data, right? We can only ask so many questions and have the tenant answer the surveys. My gut tells me fewer people are moving because they're buying a house, but more people are moving because they're renting house or because they're moving apartment to apartment or for other home transition reasons. So down somewhat from the peak, but still a meaningful portion of our customers. \nRonald Kamdem: And then my second question was just on the guidance. There was a lot of moving pieces from sort of the first quarter, the initial guidance and the guidance that you gave today. I know you reiterated that interest costs are higher, interest income is also higher, and so forth. And then if I think about where you are in 1Q on the same-store NOI, whether it's a legacy EXR or LSI, it seems like the EXR portfolio needs to decelerate to get to the middle of the NOI guidance, while the LSI will accelerate. \n I guess the question is really, was the lack of the raise -- yes, there's a peak leasing season aspect of it, too, but is it just there's so many pieces that are changing right now that it's hard to -- like the range of outcome is still so wide that it's hard to have conviction in raising? \nP. Stubbs: So we have not seen anything that is significantly different than what we saw 60 days ago. So that's really the catalyst for us not changing the guidance. In terms of the items that we did change, they were interest rate based, which we changed our SOFR assumption from 4.75% to 5.2%. That's based on the forward curve and when you obviously lock into that or update your guidance. And then we updated it for volume of bridge loans and a small change in our management fees. All of those netted to a very small delta, which caused your FFO to stay the same. But we really don't have the information yet to be able to give strong conviction that things are better or worse than what we originally estimated for our properties. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: I know you talked about the current gap between LSI and EXR for new customers, but any color you could provide on the gap between the in-place customer at those 2? How far apart they are? And how long you think it will take to get to kind of the target to hit your revenue synergies? \nP. Stubbs: You're talking the gap on specifically the Life Storage tenants. The negative roll down or which gap are you talking about? \nEric Luebchow: I was talking about like the in-place rental rate per square foot gap. \nJoseph Margolis: So when we underwrote this deal, we looked at this in a number of different ways. And I think the most meaningful way is we found 109 Life Storage stores that had an Extra Space competitor of Life type, right, multistory climate control or whatever it was, similar type in the trade area, and we compared rates of those stores. And right now, that gap is about 8% between those stores. We also looked at it at a portfolio level and at market level and different -- but I think that kind of like-for-like store is the best comparison. \nEric Luebchow: That's helpful. I know we touched on this in a few different questions. But as you look generally at the supply picture across many of your markets, do you think, based on construction starts, things will improve even more into 2025? And are there any markets that you'd highlight that still you think will continue to deal with elevated levels of supply, whether that's like a Phoenix, Atlanta, a few markets in Florida you touched on as well, that would be helpful. \nJoseph Margolis: Sure. So we look at supply by looking at our same-store pool and how many stores within our same-store pool will have new supply delivered. In the first quarter, 3% of our same-store pool stores had new supply delivered in their trade area. And that's kind of right on our estimate of 11%, 12%, 13% for the year. That's down 30% from 2023 deliveries. I think the headwinds to development, equity dollars, debt dollars, debt costs, construction costs, entitlement periods, all the things that are making the ability to put together a pro forma with rent growth in it, I think all of those items are going to continue to provide a headwind to self-storage development. There certainly are markets, Northern New Jersey, some of the Florida markets that do have new supply issues, and we'll have to work through those. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. \nMichael Mueller: I have a follow-up question on LSI and kind of a sequencing. You talked about potentially closing the occupancy gap this summer, and then kind of moving, closing the rate gap maybe in the second half of the year. And I guess the question is, when you're talking about closing the rate gap, are you talking about resetting pricing and then starting the process of letting them flow through the system, or say by year-end, you could be a parity in-place portfolio to in-place portfolio? \nP. Stubbs: Mike, it's really a combination of both. The first thing you had to move is the street rates or your achieved rate coming in. So it's at parity with the Extra Space. So the new customer would then be paying the same amount. Then the other differential in the achieved rate, or I mean in your rent per square foot that's at the store, that will come over time as we do existing customer rate increases. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Yes. First question is just around ECRI. I'm taking a look at your revenues per occupied square foot kind of in the 20s. Again, so that means for a typical 10 x 10 unit, someone is paying like $220 a month, which isn't an insignificant bill. I mean, probably outside of your mortgage and your card payments, it's probably one of the higher bills one would be paying. So when I look at that, I just kind of ask, what is that ability to keep pushing ECRIs kind of 10%, 12%, 15% without that becoming such a huge piece of someone's monthly payments that they start to push back? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. I'm not sure I agree with your thesis, right? It may be $200 for that unit, but what is your alternative. If it's move from a 2-bedroom to a 3-bedroom apartment, that delta is probably greater than what you're paying for the unit. I also think it's important to realize that our tenants consistently underestimate how long they're going to stay for. So maybe $200 a month, but normally staying 6 or 7 months. It's not a permanent drag on your monthly budget. And then they end up staying much longer, but that's a different thing. So I don't think we're -- this is a flexible, convenient, important and relatively affordable option for people. And I don't think we're at that point yet where we're capped out on rate. \nOmotayo Okusanya: Fair enough. That's helpful. And then my second question, if you would allow me. Again, the past 10 years, technology has been such a big game changer in the industry. Could you help us think about the next 10 years, whether it's AI or kind of what are you seeing that drops that helps lower customer acquisition costs, that helps lower cost of operation? And how quickly can we kind of see some of that stuff get implemented and kind of hit your overall numbers? \nJoseph Margolis: Yes. So I mean I think we're seeing it now, and we'll continue to see it, because your thesis is right, like technology and AI are going to change things drastically. We used and tested AI in several parts of our business. Sometimes it worked well, sometimes it didn't. We'll continue to help us at the call center, on the web, in all sorts of data analytics. And we are striving to find the right combination of people and technology to run our stores. And we think over time, that will help us optimize that expense. So you're right, the last 10 years have shown a lot of change and a lot of efficiencies through technology, and I expect the next 10 years to be the same. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. \nKi Bin Kim: Just want to go back to your bridge loan program. You obviously announced a pretty major increase in the pipeline. Just curious if you can provide more color on where this demand is coming from? And just high level, I mean, the rates are a bit higher, 9%. So what is the kind of profile of the customer that would come to you guys for this type of loans? \nJoseph Margolis: So I think it's customers that have expensive equity partners that want to get cashed out, folks that don't think this is the greatest sales market where there's been value created. We talk about the benefits of the Life Storage transaction. One benefit we don't really talk about is we were introduced to a whole new group of partners we didn't have relationships with. \n So we've closed or have under term sheet $239 million worth of bridge loans. With LSI Partners, we had no relationship with before closing. And I'm off topic now, but we have signed 30 management contracts, new management contracts with LSI partners we have relationships with. So part of the increase in our bridge loan volume is we have all these new relationships now we got through the merger, and we're doing a lot of business with them. \nKi Bin Kim: And that was actually part of my second question. Do the vast majority of these come with management contracts? The management contracts can obviously be terminated, but is there a sense that the management contract lifetime can exceed the bridge loan maturities? \nJoseph Margolis: So 100% of our bridge loans, we manage the property. We will not make a loan on a property we don't manage for risk control and economic reasons. So yes, they all come with management contracts. And the management contracts can be canceled. That hardly ever happens. It hardly ever happens if someone cancels a public or a cube contract that comes to us. People don't move like that. If we're a good manager, we produce good results that we're going to have these relationships and manage these properties after the bridge loan is gone, unless we end up buying the property, which is also nice. \nKi Bin Kim: And second question on CapEx. Can you just provide some color? I know you don't really disclose it on the maintenance CapEx you spent in 2023 and what we should expect in 2024, obviously, excluding development or whatever solar projects you might have? \nP. Stubbs: Ki Bin, our maintenance CapEx has typically been about $0.65 a square foot, and we would expect it to be pretty similar in 2024. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe Margolis for closing remarks. \nJoseph Margolis: Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for your time and your interest in Extra Space. I hope you could tell, we're off to a good start. We're really excited about the rest of the year. We can't control all the variables. We can't control the housing market and the customer. But what we can control, we do very well. We have the platform and the people to take advantage and optimize whatever the external situation is. So I hope everyone has a great day, and thank you for your time. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Margolis",
            "content": "Thanks, Jared, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. As many of you know, Jeff Norman has transitioned into another role within the organization as the Head of Treasury and Capital Markets. Many of you on this call have worked with Jeff and experienced his professionalism, responsiveness, fast knowledge and good nature. I recognize and appreciate his efforts to make Extra Space a leader in the industry, and look forward to his continued contribution to the company.  \n I would also like to introduce Jared Conley, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Jared has been with Extra Space since 2002 and has worked in various roles, most recently as our Head of Financial Planning and Analysis. We look forward to introducing him in person next month at NAREIT. \n Turning to this quarter's performance. We have seen sequential improvement in occupancy and rate since our fourth quarter earnings call in late February. Operationally, occupancy at the Extra Space same-store pool grew every month during a period normally recognized for seasonal declines, ending the quarter at 93.2%, a 50 basis point increase year-over-year. Our revenue strategy has allowed us to both improve occupancy and average move-in rate in the quarter, with the latter growing sequentially by approximately 8% from a seasonal low in January. The combination of improving move-in rate, higher occupancy, and steady existing customer rate increases have provided a 1% lift in Extra Space's same-store revenue performance, which is in line with our internal projections. \n Also, as expected, Extra Space same-store expense growth increased by 5.5% year-over-year. The legacy Life Storage same-store pool performance continues to improve, outpacing the Extra Space same-store properties. Revenue gained 1.7% year-over-year, which was in line with internal projections and against the backdrop of a difficult comp, where prior management pushed hard on rates in 2023 at the expense of occupancy.  \n Occupancy at our Life Storage improved to 92%, a 220 basis point improvement over last year, narrowing the gap between pools to 120 basis points at quarter end. At the end of April, this gap, which was over 400 basis points in closing, has further narrowed to 90 basis points on our platform. To do so, we have maintained lower rates through the quarter with the strategy of higher occupancy, leading to stronger new and existing customer rates through the remainder of the year. We believe improved rate performance will continue to lift these properties and ultimately bring them to parity with legacy Extra Space store rate and occupancy levels.  \n Life Storage same-store expenses increased 6.7% year-over-year, also due to an exceptionally hard 2023 comparable, but below internal projections. Expenses increased particularly in the areas of payroll and repairs and maintenance, as we address areas that were underinvested at this time last year.\n On the external growth front, the transaction market continues to be muted. However, we expanded our capital-light external growth activities, adding $164 million in new bridge loans meaningfully ahead of our projections. In addition, we added 97 third-party managed stores gross and 72 stores net. We continue to have the fastest-growing third-party management platform in the industry.  \n Overall, the year is unfolding as expected with wins in capital-light growth and G&A and expense savings. We are working hard and I am confident of our teams and infrastructure are well prepared to optimize performance during the important upcoming leasing season.\n I will now turn the time over to Scott. So that 92.7% is the Extra Space same-store pool. We're at 92.8% for the Life Storage same-store pool. So street rates is only one component, right? And we're kind of agnostic as to whether we can maximize our revenue through street rates, through occupancy, through discounts, through marketing spend, through ECRI. So there's no one number we're targeting for any one of those metrics. We're trying to mix and match them to maximize revenue. So I think comfort is always greater as you get into and have some feeling as to how the leasing season is going to go. So at this time of year, before we're into the leasing season, in a period where we have reduced housing activity, where we have signs of consumer weakness, I'll say this, we have not enough comfort that we're going to change our guidance. Yes. So I think if you look at, say, occupancy seasonality, and you look at the annual occupancy curve pre-COVID to what we've experienced last year and what we expect to experience this year, our system has taken a great deal of the seasonality in occupancy out of our performance. We will keep our stores at higher occupancy levels at all times of the year. And I think you see that in the first quarter this year, right? The bigger question is how much rate power do we have and can we push rates at those occupancy levels? No, I think we get data every day, and we'll have more data and a better feel at NAREIT, and we'll have even more and a better feel in our next conference call, and we'll certainly keep all of our shareholders and interested parties up to date with what we know. So I would say, very similarly. I mean, we're constantly testing and trying new things. But overall, the program is very similar to the back half of last year. Customers are accepting ECRI at the same rates. And it's an effective tool for us to maximize revenue. Yes. So I mean, this strategy, you described it pretty well, right, for the web customer. They get a discounted rate, but no promotion, right, which is different than our peers, who offer many times promotions on the web. So the discounted rate, we do that because the data tells us these are the longer term and better customers, and that is the pricing package they react best to. We use ECRI to get them to street rate within a reasonable period of time. \n We have a different structure for the customer who walks in the store. And our data tells us and our testing tells us this is a very effective strategy. And when the data tells us and the testing tells us we should evolve it to something else, then we will. But it's not in place for a fixed period of time or until we see something. One of the advantages of our scale is we can constantly have a few hundred stores here and there or running different tests. And when we see something that tells us we need to evolve our strategy, we will. Sure. So the transaction market is pretty muted. There's still a significant bid-ask spread. There's not a lot of distress in storage, so sellers don't need to sell in general. We see a lot of transactions get put on the market and get pulled, particularly larger transactions. It seems there's less capital for big portfolios than there are for one-offs. So the transaction market is pretty quiet. We did close 7 deals in the first quarter, but one of those was a joint venture development and one was a CO deal. So those were agreed to some time ago. \n We only approved. I think the better sense of the market is what's approved in a quarter, because the ones that closed might have been baked many, many, many months before. And we only approved 3 transactions in the first quarter. One was a remotely managed store and the initial cap rate was in the mid-6s. And then 2 developments where the development yield at a property level was in the high 8s and about 100 basis points higher to us because of the joint venture structure. So I mean, we'll do good deals like that when we see them, but there's not a lot of them in the market right now. So an advantage of our scale is how diversified we are and the exposure we have to many, many, many markets. And that's a purposeful portfolio of construction, because all of our data tells us that markets act differently. Not all markets move in the same direction. Even if you start to categorize markets by primary, secondary, tertiary, coastal, or whatever, they don't act with any correlation. And the reasons markets act differently is because of new supply situations, because of job growth and population, and because sometimes if the market does really well for a couple of years, as revenue growth over 20%, like we experienced in Atlanta, then the next year, it's not going to be so good. \n So because we have this wide exposure, we absolutely have markets that are reaccelerating, and we have markets that are flat, and we have markets that are not doing as well. And I think we'll always be in that position. But this broad diversification smooths our volatility, if you will. And we are big believers in having exposure to as many good growth markets as we possibly can. Yes. So great question. So yes, Florida, some of the markets in Florida are some of our weaker markets today. That's a good observation. That's partially because they did so well during COVID, and that's partially because of supply issues in some of those markets. But we're in this, and we did this merger for the long term. And over the long term, the Sunbelt markets, the Florida markets, and the population growth and the businesses that are moving there, we believe those are really good long-term markets. So yes, this quarter, some of those markets and maybe this year, some of those markets might be on the weaker side. But long term, we're really happy to have exposure down there. \n A market like Houston and Chicago, which we also increased our exposure to do the Life transaction, those markets are doing really well. They're kind of on the top of the sheet now. So again, it's great to have exposure to lots of different markets, because they'll always be moving in different directions. So when we talk about the consumer, I think we have to separate the existing tenant consumer and the new tenant consumer. The existing tenant consumer is really strong and really price insensitive. We're not moving out in the face of ECRI, bad debt is very low, lengths of stay are incrementally improving. The storage customer, once they become a storage customer, is really a strong, sticky customer. \n We see more weakness in the new customer, the customer looking for storage. And that's where we see more price sensitivity. There's enough demand out there for us to capture more than our share and keep our stores at optimal occupancy, but it's the pricing strength that is an issue now. And I think we're at a period of time where we've had several quarters where inflation outpaced wage growth. The extra money that was pumped into the economy isn't there anymore. Savings rates are down. You have some weakness in the consumer, and that's what we're experiencing. Yes. So I probably explain that incorrectly. Length of stay is incrementally better than pre-COVID. It's worse than during COVID. We had that period where people just weren't leaving the stores. So overall, I'm looking at a longer period of time we're saying length of stay is incrementally improving. But it is clearly normalizing from COVID levels. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough on that. So we do see other people getting into the business. Some of our public peers have announced they want to get into this business. On the ground, we don't see competition yet. We're not losing loans. We don't hear people saying they're taking this to someone else to bid. But there's other lenders. There's competition for this business, just like there's competition for the management business or any other business we're in. And our job is to compete well, and that's what we're trying to do.  \n How big this can get? We have the ability to sell off the A notes in this structure. And that's a really good tool for us to be able to control how much of the balance sheet, how many of these loans we keep on the balance sheet. So we've picked up our guidance a little bit through this year as to what we expect to keep on the balance sheet, but we certainly have flexibility to move that number one way or another. So I think LSI performance in the first quarter was as expected on target, so we were happy with that. And we still have, as of today, a 90 basis point occupancy gap. And depending on what metric you look at, what pool of stores you look at, anywhere from an 8% to 12% rate gap. So we still have wood to chop. I think the good news is the tools we need, the infrastructure we need in place to close those gaps is largely there, right? So the LSI store manager is now performing close to or at the level of an extra space store manager in terms of conversion rates and all the metrics we use, right? And that took some time to get there. \n We've largely caught up on R&M and capital, and the stores look like an Extra Space store now in terms of cleanliness and repair, things like that. The LSI website is actually now faster than the Extra Space website. It was much slower when we bought it. So a lot of the customer acquisition metrics are improving. I'd say they're not all the way there yet for LSI, but improving. So we've made a lot of progress. We still have some wood to chop, and we still have some opportunity to capture. Yes. So I think there's a little bit of a misunderstanding baked into that question that we've cut rents more aggressively than our peers. And I think that comes from the web scraping data that is published and people see. When you look at that data, that's not adjusted for promotions. And we offer promotions. It's under 10% of our web customers get a first month free or a promotion like that. Where at our peers, it's the vast majority of their customers. So to compare our web rates to our peers' web rates, you have to adjust for promotions. And I think once you do that, you'll see we have not cut rates significantly more than our competitors. It's just not true. And our goal is, once someone comes in at a discounted rate, to get them to street rate within a reasonable period of time. And that may vary based on different factors, but within a reasonable period of time, they need to get the street rate. Yes. So we had an 80% market overlap with LSI and Extra Space stores. So for 80% of the portfolio, it's the same. And we don't really target an occupancy level. Again, as we said earlier, it's just one factor that goes into the algorithm that is trying to maximize revenue. And it may be different in different types of markets based on customer behavior. Sure. So right now, about half of our customers, a little more, 51% of our customers tell us that they're moving. Now it doesn't mean they're buying a home, right? 45% of those 51% are moving from apartment to apartment. The peak of that was 61% in the third quarter of 2021. So we don't have enough data, right? We can only ask so many questions and have the tenant answer the surveys. My gut tells me fewer people are moving because they're buying a house, but more people are moving because they're renting house or because they're moving apartment to apartment or for other home transition reasons. So down somewhat from the peak, but still a meaningful portion of our customers. So when we underwrote this deal, we looked at this in a number of different ways. And I think the most meaningful way is we found 109 Life Storage stores that had an Extra Space competitor of Life type, right, multistory climate control or whatever it was, similar type in the trade area, and we compared rates of those stores. And right now, that gap is about 8% between those stores. We also looked at it at a portfolio level and at market level and different -- but I think that kind of like-for-like store is the best comparison. Sure. So we look at supply by looking at our same-store pool and how many stores within our same-store pool will have new supply delivered. In the first quarter, 3% of our same-store pool stores had new supply delivered in their trade area. And that's kind of right on our estimate of 11%, 12%, 13% for the year. That's down 30% from 2023 deliveries. I think the headwinds to development, equity dollars, debt dollars, debt costs, construction costs, entitlement periods, all the things that are making the ability to put together a pro forma with rent growth in it, I think all of those items are going to continue to provide a headwind to self-storage development. There certainly are markets, Northern New Jersey, some of the Florida markets that do have new supply issues, and we'll have to work through those. Yes. I'm not sure I agree with your thesis, right? It may be $200 for that unit, but what is your alternative. If it's move from a 2-bedroom to a 3-bedroom apartment, that delta is probably greater than what you're paying for the unit. I also think it's important to realize that our tenants consistently underestimate how long they're going to stay for. So maybe $200 a month, but normally staying 6 or 7 months. It's not a permanent drag on your monthly budget. And then they end up staying much longer, but that's a different thing. So I don't think we're -- this is a flexible, convenient, important and relatively affordable option for people. And I don't think we're at that point yet where we're capped out on rate. Yes. So I mean I think we're seeing it now, and we'll continue to see it, because your thesis is right, like technology and AI are going to change things drastically. We used and tested AI in several parts of our business. Sometimes it worked well, sometimes it didn't. We'll continue to help us at the call center, on the web, in all sorts of data analytics. And we are striving to find the right combination of people and technology to run our stores. And we think over time, that will help us optimize that expense. So you're right, the last 10 years have shown a lot of change and a lot of efficiencies through technology, and I expect the next 10 years to be the same. So I think it's customers that have expensive equity partners that want to get cashed out, folks that don't think this is the greatest sales market where there's been value created. We talk about the benefits of the Life Storage transaction. One benefit we don't really talk about is we were introduced to a whole new group of partners we didn't have relationships with. \n So we've closed or have under term sheet $239 million worth of bridge loans. With LSI Partners, we had no relationship with before closing. And I'm off topic now, but we have signed 30 management contracts, new management contracts with LSI partners we have relationships with. So part of the increase in our bridge loan volume is we have all these new relationships now we got through the merger, and we're doing a lot of business with them. So 100% of our bridge loans, we manage the property. We will not make a loan on a property we don't manage for risk control and economic reasons. So yes, they all come with management contracts. And the management contracts can be canceled. That hardly ever happens. It hardly ever happens if someone cancels a public or a cube contract that comes to us. People don't move like that. If we're a good manager, we produce good results that we're going to have these relationships and manage these properties after the bridge loan is gone, unless we end up buying the property, which is also nice. Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for your time and your interest in Extra Space. I hope you could tell, we're off to a good start. We're really excited about the rest of the year. We can't control all the variables. We can't control the housing market and the customer. But what we can control, we do very well. We have the platform and the people to take advantage and optimize whatever the external situation is. So I hope everyone has a great day, and thank you for your time."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "P. Stubbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had another good quarter, driven by steady revenue, G&A savings, and better-than-expected property operating expenses, specifically property taxes. The G&A savings have been from a broad range of categories as we continue to seek efficiencies and capitalize on our greater scale. As mentioned in our prior call, we closed a $600 million bond offering in the quarter at a time when interest rates were more favorable than the current environment. Proceeds were used to repay the bridge loan that we used to acquire Life Storage and the offering helps reduce our exposure to variable interest rate debt. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we have plenty of dry powder to capitalize on an improving transactions market.  \n Due to the in-line nature of same-store performance, we are not making any revisions related to property operations. We will update our property guidance after the second quarter once we see how the leasing season progresses and how much pricing power we gain. We do expect to see continued savings in G&A and have adjusted our annual assumptions accordingly. We have also adjusted our annual average SOFR assumption, increasing interest expense, which is partially offset by increases in interest income from our bridge loan program. We are encouraged by the outsized rental volume year-to-date and the high occupancy at our stores, and we should be in a great position to maximize the performance at our properties as we move into the rental season.  \n With that, Michelle, let's open it up for questions. Yes, Michael. So we ended the month of April at 93.7% occupied, which is still a 50 basis point delta over last year, and our rates improved sequentially month-over-month from the month of January. So what's happened in the quarter is we averaged about 14% negative achieved rates in the quarter. And in the month of April, that has moved to about negative 9% year-over-year. Michael, we actually have not broken out street rates. If you remember on the last call, we actually didn't break them out. We said when we did our budgets, when we did our estimates and forecast, we did it based on revenue growth. And so street rate is a component of that, as is occupancy. And obviously, the better the street rates are, the better the occupancy, the higher we are going to be in that range. Eric, so the main driver of that is not the 165 stores. I mean, those stores actually increased our performance in the quarter. I think they added about 40 bps to our revenue growth in the quarter. Our revenue growth throughout the summer is impacted somewhat by our performance last year. Obviously, where you're coming off higher numbers, comps do get easier as you move throughout the year. But we are not seeing -- our current expectation, similar to when we gave our annual guidance is we're not expecting a major recovery from the housing market today. We're expecting things to kind of perform as they are today and not seeing a major rebound. And I think that's maybe one difference from what some other people have projected or thought. Yes. So obviously, it's a range that we provided. So it will depend a little bit on where you are in that range. But the way we're viewing this is, as occupancy moves up to parity with the Extra Space stores, those rates will move up. So today, our Life Storage stores have rates that are 5% to 10% below our Extra Space stores, as they are growing faster. We saw very good rentals in the first quarter. We've continued to close that occupancy gap. We would expect that occupancy gap to be closed at some point during this rental season and then see the growth in the back half of the year. Yes. So we don't expect a significant occupancy delta for the entire year. Obviously, it's a component of your revenue, but we would expect it to be flat for most of the year, although we have been ahead some in the first quarter. Yes, the first thing to look at here is really a marketing spend as a percentage of your revenues. If you look at our marketing spend as a percentage of revenues, we're still about 2%, which is still a very small component. On a year-over-year perspective, we get at the 23%, looks like a big number, but there's still a very positive yield. We look at the return on that spend in several different ways. It depends on where you're spending money, whether it's paper click, whether it's search engine optimization, or other areas. But we continue to have a very high return on that marketing spend, and it's a very small component of our expenses. So I think that -- what gives you confidence? I think the question was asked earlier, your guide versus your tone and where you are. I think we've seen positive things early in this year in terms of month-over-month rate increases. Now that's a positive. The negative is we're still negative to last year. So we are moving in the right direction. I think the leasing season will kind of be the real catalyst to say it was a great year or a good year or, hey, maybe it's still a little bit slow. So I think that it's really that June, July time frame when we're going to get a feel for that. But so far, occupancies held up sequentially, rate has improved, but it's still probably too early to really say, yes, it's been a good year so far. So we have not seen anything that is significantly different than what we saw 60 days ago. So that's really the catalyst for us not changing the guidance. In terms of the items that we did change, they were interest rate based, which we changed our SOFR assumption from 4.75% to 5.2%. That's based on the forward curve and when you obviously lock into that or update your guidance. And then we updated it for volume of bridge loans and a small change in our management fees. All of those netted to a very small delta, which caused your FFO to stay the same. But we really don't have the information yet to be able to give strong conviction that things are better or worse than what we originally estimated for our properties. You're talking the gap on specifically the Life Storage tenants. The negative roll down or which gap are you talking about? Mike, it's really a combination of both. The first thing you had to move is the street rates or your achieved rate coming in. So it's at parity with the Extra Space. So the new customer would then be paying the same amount. Then the other differential in the achieved rate, or I mean in your rent per square foot that's at the store, that will come over time as we do existing customer rate increases. Ki Bin, our maintenance CapEx has typically been about $0.65 a square foot, and we would expect it to be pretty similar in 2024."
