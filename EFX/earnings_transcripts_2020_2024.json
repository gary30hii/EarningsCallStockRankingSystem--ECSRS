At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDorian Hare: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I am Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentation. These materials are labeled Q4 2020 Earnings Release Presentation. During the call, we'll be making certain forward-looking including first quarter and full year 2021 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In the fourth quarter, Equifax incurred a $31.9 million restructuring charge related to right sizing the organization as investments in technology transformation are reduced in 2021, as compared to 2020. Also in the fourth quarter, Equifax change its method for accounting for pensions to recognize the measurement of benefit, obligations and plan assets to earnings annually can cease delayed recognition of gains or losses caused by changes in discount rates, or other extra value assumptions such as mortality, and planned asset actual versus assumed returns. All prior period GAAP and adjusted financial information has been revised to reflect the change. Pension expense in prior years is improved by the elimination of the amortization of accumulated prior losses. For 2020, excluding the annual remeasurement impact, I will reference in a moment, this benefit was approximately $17 million to net income or $0.14 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2020, this benefit resulted in an improvement to net income of $4.3 million or $0.35 per share. The annual remeasurement occurs in the fourth quarter of each year and is recorded in other income on the income statement. This annual remeasurement will be treated as a non-GAAP adjustment as it is non operational in nature. Pretax mark-to-market adjustments resulted in the pretax gain of $4.8 million in 2019 and the pretax loss of $32.2 million in 2020. The details of this change in pension accounting are included in the fourth quarter 2020 earnings press release on slide 25 of the 4Q 2020 IR slide deck and will also be included in the 2020 report 10-K. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks Dorian. Before I address Equifax's strong fourth quarter in 2020 results, I want to take a moment to thank our 11,000 employees and families who have supported them with a tremendous dedication they showed under the challenging COVID environment during 2020. We continue to make the health and safety of our employees a top priority and I hope you and those close to you remain safe. Turning towards to slide 4, I wanted to start with a review of our business model, growth strategy and cloud investments that positions to win in the marketplace. Our highly unique and diverse data assets are at the core of Equifax's differentiation in the marketplace. We have data assets of scale that our competitors do not have. Our acquisition this week of Kount in a global identity and fraud and AccountScore for UK open banking and data categorization are examples of accelerating focus and expanding our differentiated data assets and capabilities. Expanding our differentiated data assets through organic actions, partnerships, and M&A continues to be a priority. We and our customers are benefiting from our investment over the last three years in our new Equifax cloud native technology footprint, which enabled the creation of our single data fabric and rapid implementation of best-in-class cloud based tools and capabilities. We accelerated our new product rollouts and revenue in 2020 by leveraging our new Equifax cloud and Equifax cloud native footprint is enhanced our ability to integrate new partners and acquisitions into speed the recognition of synergies, as we believe only Equifax can. Our cloud infrastructure will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace and drive our revenues and margins in the future. Data Security is deeply embedded in our culture. And we have made tremendous progress towards our goal of being an industry leader in security. We will be relentlessly focused on a customer first mentality, which moves us closer to our customers with a focus on delivering solutions to help them solve their problems and grow their businesses. And lastly, with the acquisition of Kount in our investments in the Equifax Data Fabric, we've taken substantial steps forward towards building a leading identity and fraud business while expanding our market coverage to include retail, ecommerce and transaction based markets alongside our traditional FI telco insurance markets.  Moving now to slide 5 and spoken before that key market macros that we believe are positively impacting information service industry, and Equifax. First, the dramatic acceleration of the digitization of consumer and commercial customers facing transactions and our customers' internal infrastructure with clearly accelerated during Covid, which drives rapidly growing requirements for data and insights around identity, authentication and fraud. Second, accelerating adoption of advanced analytics and machine learning is driving increasing needs for differentiated data. Third fintechs and alternative lenders are driving innovation, growing share and accelerating this digitization macro which drives data usage. Fourth, increased need for robust identity validation and fraud prevention capabilities and digital transactions is also driving data requirements. And fifth, the explosion of data drives increased requirements for data governance by our customers and control of data by consumers. These macros clearly accelerate demand for broader differentiated data assets, alternative data sources, increased requirements for data recency and integrated insights. Equifax is very well positioned to address these trends as we build on the depth of our Equifax cloud data assets, and our capabilities to deliver advanced Equifax cloud data management, and continue to leverage our Equifax cloud data and technology investments. In USIS, the depth of our assets across credit alternative credit with DataX telco and utilities with NCTUE and consumer asset data with ISI has long been Equifax strength. Workforce Solutions TWN data is our most differentiated data asset with coverage of 90 million unique individuals in the United States. EWS is expanding between data set while broadening their point focus beyond W2 income to include 1099 and other income and employment data. At the same time, EWS is broadening beyond TWN income and employment data with partnerships to deliver individuals education, licensure, and other data to our customers to use in the hiring process. With the additional Kount broad and massive scale of digital consumer data assets, including phone numbers, email and IP addresses. Equifax data assets extend substantially as your capabilities across identity and fraud globally.  Moving now to slide 6, we believe the identity validation and fraud prevention markets will deliver strong long-term growth for Equifax and that it combined Equifax and Kount are very well positioned to deliver new and differentiated solutions to this large and fast growing marketplace. E-commerce was up over 20% in 2020 alone, while online banking was up 67% and mobile wallet usage increased 56%. And fraud is a huge and growing issue with our customers transactions have shifted from cash to digital, along with increased real time payments. Online credit card fraud hit nearly $6 billion last year with 40% of ecommerce merchants reporting an increase in chargeback fraud, and over 40% of merchants say their digital fraud slows their innovation and growth. The digital market macro clearly accelerated during COVID and we see it continuing to expand. The combination of Equifax and Kount can protect these new distribution channels while evaluating high risk transactions on a real time basis. Balanced fraud with the user experience, serve as a growth platform for customer ecommerce activities while simultaneously enabling trust and confidence. Both Kount and Equifax will leverage to be extended predictability of our combined data. And Kount brings Equifax into the fast growing ecommerce and retail markets. And last, Equifax wins Kount into the banking, finance FinTech, telco and insurance markets. The scale of counter data assets, including 32 billion in your consumer interactions, 255 million identities, 400 million addresses and a billion unique devices combined with Equifax's scale data assets is a powerful combination in this fast growing market. Advanced Data Analytics, AI and machine learning capabilities are more crucial than ever before in preventing frauds. The first suite of Kount products including its next generation AI and machine learning model, combined with the cloud based Equifax Luminate platform which orchestrates multiple solutions with machine learning, and our patented NDT AI technology will provide risk managers with insights only Equifax can give across the consumer account lifecycle. Kount also provides account takeover protection and transaction dispute management, two capabilities which Equifax did not have before to address heightened cybersecurity and fraud payment activity. We were energized to close the Kount acquisition yesterday, and to have the Kount team joining Equifax and the strong growth potential the combined Kount and Equifax in the fast growing identity and fraud marketplace. As you see on slide 7, while Kount is clearly our most sizable transaction in recent years, as we ramp up our bolt-on M&A focus to expand and strengthen Equifax's capabilities and close two other transactions in recent days focused on decisioning and alternative data. We acquired the minority position we did already own of creditworks in Australia. creditworks is a low cost, flexible, modular trade credit decisioning platform that targets the SME segment, which is a key growth driver for activities in the region. In the UK we acquired AccountScore, our partner in the UK open banking solutions and a provider of bank transaction data categorization analytics and consent technology. AccountScore has also a license in the UK where open banking is accelerating. Importantly, its capabilities will be integrated into our interconnect and Ignite platforms. We're investing our 2020 outperformance and leveraging our strong balance sheet and cash generation with bolt-on M&A is central for future growth strategy. And our cloud data and technology platforms allow us to more quickly integrate acquisitions and drive synergies. Continued expansion of our data assets and capabilities through acquisitions is a priority for Equifax in 2021 and beyond. Turning now to slide 8, Equifax performance in 2020 was very strong with sequential improvements in both total and core revenue as we exited the year. Our business model is resilient in delivering in the challenging COVID recessionary environment. We're energetic about our momentum as we enter 2021. Revenue in 2020 was $4.1 billion, up 17% with organic growth of 16.3%, is the first time we've delivered over $4 billion in revenue and the highest annual organic revenue growth rate in our history. Adjusted EBITDA was just under $1.5 billion, up 25%. And EBITDA margin was 36.2%, up 240 basis points. Adjusted EPS at $6.97 was up 22%. We delivered double digit revenue growth in all four quarters of 2020 with 23% total in organic growth in the fourth quarter, a record for Equifax.  We executed on our investments to accelerate and leverage our Equifax cloud data and technology transformation, including migrating more than 47,000 customers as at the end of the year, onto our new Equifax cloud services. Leveraging is now our new cloud infrastructure we delivered a record 134 new products while decreasing our NPI development time by one third. 134 NPI, we're well in excess of the 100 anticipated coming into 2020 and above 120 we discussed with you in December. As we continue to leverage our new cloud capabilities we expect to accelerate revenue growth for new products in 2021, a key driver to our long-term growth expectations. We're energized about our 2020 performance and we're already seeing the momentum of our only Equifax model leveraging our new cloud capabilities as we move into 2021. Turning to slide 9, fourth quarter revenue at $1.12 billion was up 23% on a reported and local currency basis, which is one of our expectations in the framework of 17.5% to 20% that we shared with you in early December. M&A contributed just under 1% in the quarter. Our growth is again powered by our US b2b businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions with combined revenue of a very strong 36.6% and combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%. As a reminder, EWS and USIS are now over 70% of Equifax revenue and 80% of Equifax business unit EBITDA, their combined contribution to Equifax is up 700 basis points in revenue, and almost 750 basis points in EBITDA versus 2019, which is very powerful for the future of Equifax. Importantly, international also had a strong quarter delivering 3% revenue growth, and over 34% adjusted EBITDA margins outperforming our expectations in revenue, while maintaining strong control over costs. Fourth quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA total $422 million, up 31% with a 215 basis point expansion in our margins to 37.8%. This margin expansion was delivered while making continued investments in our cloud transformation, new products and data analytics that will drive future growth. Adjusted EPS at $2 per share was up a strong 28% versus 2019 despite incurring increased depreciation and amortization, and incremental cloud costs at $0.16 a share and increased interest expense at $0.05 a share from our second quarter bond offering. The $2 per share EPS exceeded our expectations in the framework of $1.75 to $1.85 we shared with you in early December. USIS revenue of $387 million was up a very strong 17% in the fourth quarter with M&A contributing less than 0.5%. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $153 million was up 60% in the quarter while mortgage credit inquiries grew in line with our expectations increasing 55%. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by 500 basis points driven by growth and share gains, marketing and new debt monitoring products. Non-mortgage revenue performance strengthened substantially in the quarter and was just below flat improvement from down 6% in the third quarter and down 9% in the second quarter. Importantly, non-mortgage online revenue grew slightly in the quarter versus the 5% and 11% declines we saw on the third and second quarters respectively. Banking, ID and fraud, commercial, insurance and direct-to-consumer all showed growth in fourth quarter, which is a positive sign for the future. Autos fourth quarter decline at 5% was an improvement in the third quarter decline of 7%. Non-mortgage online revenue strengthened further by 5% growth in December and 6% growth in January. Banking ID and fraud, insurance and direct-to-consumer drove the growth in December and continued into January. We also saw auto returned to positive growth in January. Financial marketing services revenue which is broadly speaking offline or data business is $70 million in the quarter down about 2% which was up sharply from the third quarter, which was down 9%. The relative improvement in the quarter was driven by double digit growth and identity and fraud related revenue. We're also seeing improving trends in marketing related revenue which was down under 10% in the quarter. As a reminder, marketing related revenue represents about 40% of FMS revenue identity and brought about 20 and risk decision about 40. USIS team continues to drive growth in their deal pipeline with the fourth quarter up 15% driven by growth in both the volume and size of new opportunities. Fourth quarter win rates finish the year at 2020 times, switching into team or on offense in the USIS and winning in the marketplace. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 43.5% in fourth quarter were down 160 basis points from last year which was principally driven by a much higher mix of mortgage revenue and mortgage products in the quarter. Margins were also impacted by redundant systems costs and investments in new products. Turning now to Workforce Solutions, they had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $406 million of a very strong 62%. EWS finished the year with revenue of $1.4 billion and extraordinary accomplishment compared to their 2019 revenue of $950 million. Customers found incredible value in Workforce Solutions unique TWN income and employment data assets and new products. While the team's focus on penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions drove growth. EWS remains our most valuable and differentiated business with revenue growth rates far in excess of the rest of Equifax and highly accretive margins. Verification service revenue and Workforce Solutions at $330 million is up 70% versus fourth quarter 2019. Verification services mortgage revenue more than doubled versus the prior year for the third quarter in a row growing almost 100 percentage points faster in the 55% growth we saw in mortgage market credit inquiries in the third quarter. Verification services non-mortgage revenue was up about 15% in the quarter up substantially from the 4% growth in third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we saw significant growth in talent solutions primarily driven by new products introduced in the second half of the year. We also saw strong growth in card and auto. In cards, we've added to two major customers that now use the work number broadly in the origination process. In auto, we're also seeing the expansion in the use of the work number in subprime loan approvals. We again saw strong growth in government verification services growth in January, continued strong levels delivered in the fourth quarter. And product services revenue of $77 million increased 35% in the quarter driven again by Unemployment Claims business which had revenue of over $50 million, up 73% compared to last year. In the fourth quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 2.6 million initial claims which are down from the 3.4 million in the third quarter. EWS continue to process roughly one in five US initial unemployment claims. And as a reminder, we expect our UC claims revenue to decline in 2021 as initial Unemployment Claims reduced from record 2020 levels. Employee services, non UC claims business and revenue down about 6% in the quarter, strong revenue growth in I-9 and onboarding services that driven by the acceleration of our new online Anywhere solutions is more than offset by declines in workforce analytics and our tax credits business. We're seeing a positive shift to our new online Anywhere product suite the new customer wins at much higher price points. We expect employee services nine UC business revenue performance in the first quarter to improve relative to fourth quarter and returned to growth in the second quarter as we move towards a more normal environment. Strong EWS verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 56.2%, which was an over 900 basis point expansion from the prior year, which reflects the power and uniqueness of the TWN dataset.  Turning down now to international, their revenue of $242 million is up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, a significant milestone is the business unit returned to growth after very challenging second and third quarters. This was nicely above our expectations from early December. Asia Pacific which is principally our Australian business had very good performance in the fourth quarter with revenue of $77 million, up about 4% in local currency versus last year and better than yet slightly we expected in early December. Australia consumer revenue was down about 5% versus last year, a significant improvement from the down 10% we saw in the third quarter. Our commercial businesses combined online and offline revenue in Australia is up 3% in the quarter. Again, a nice improvement from the up about 1% in third quarter. And fraud and identity was up almost 20% in the fourth quarter. European revenues of $79 million were up 4% in local currency in the quarter, our European credit business was down about 3%. A significant improvement from the down 7% we saw in the third quarter. The improvement was driven by Spain which saw revenue growth of 7% in the quarter. UK revenue was down about 8% in the quarter similar to third quarter. Our European debt management business grew about 20% local currency in the fourth quarter as the UK Government restarted collections activity in late September. However, following the COVID measures put in place in late in the fourth quarter by the UK Government to address the pandemic, debt collections were again halted late in the year. We expect debt management revenue to decline in the order of 10% in the first quarter reflecting these actions but to improve once vaccine are more widely distributed and we return to a more normal mode. Latin American revenues of $46 million declined about 2% in fourth quarter in local currency in line with what we expected, which was a significant improvement from the down 6% we saw in the third quarter. Positively Chile, a largest country in Latin America delivered revenue growth in the quarter. But America continues to benefit from the expansions at Ignite and the migration of customers to our global cloud based interconnects SaaS decisioning platform. And we're also seeing the benefit of the strong new product introductions in the region over the past three years. Canada revenue of $41 million was up about 3% in local currency in the fourth quarter, which was also a positive. Consumer online was down just over 5% in the quarter similar to the third quarter, improving growth in analytic and decision solutions ideally broad drove the growth in Canadian revenue in the quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 33.8% were up 150 basis points sequentially, but down 260 basis points from last year. It declined versus fourth quarter last year was principally driven by redundant systems cost from cloud investments in low income and minority investments. Global consumer solutions revenue at $76.9 million was down 13% reported in local currency basis in the quarter as we expected. Global consumer solutions performance was very strong in our Consumer Direct benefits channel and events states businesses, and they collectively grew over 10% on a combined basis in the fourth quarter. The decline in overall GCS revenue in the fourth quarter was driven by our US lead generation partner businesses. As we discussed previously, our US lead generation partner revenue was significantly impacted by the COVID recession that began in the second quarter. The declines in this revenue increasing through the fourth quarter as banking customers cut back on lead gen spending. Accordingly, we expect declines in total GCS revenue in the first quarter just over 50% similar to fourth quarter levels. We expect a decline in total GCS revenue due to lead generation declines to moderate substantially as we move into the second quarter. Our global Consumer Direct business, the business in which we sell directly to consumers through Equifax.com which represents about half of total GCS revenues was up strong 9% in fourth quarter, the highest growth rate since 2017. Our North American Consumer Direct Business revenue was up a solid 10% versus last year, and we continue to see sequential subscriber growth in the US and Canada, our two largest markets. Our GCS Consumer Direct business will principally complete migrating their customers onto the new cloud based platform renaissance in the first quarter. This will allow for a new field focus on new product and service introductions to consumers in the second half of 2021. Our benefits channel and events based businesses which now represent about 10% of global consumer also delivered about 30% growth in the quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.9% were down about 610 basis points principally reflecting the increased platforms spend as they complete their cloud systems migrations, increase marketing spend to drive future direct revenue, and the lower lead generation partner revenue we talked about. Slide 10 provides an updated view of Equifax core revenue growth. As a reminder, core revenue growth is defined as Equifax revenue growth, excluding number one, extraordinary revenue growth in our unemployment claims business in 2020, and 2021. And number two, the impact on revenue from the US mortgage market activity as measured by changes in total, US mortgage market credit inquiries. Core revenue growth is our attempt to provide a more normalized view of Equifax revenue growth to you, excluding these UC and US mortgage market factors. In the fourth quarter Equifax core revenue growth, the green section on the bars on slide 10, was up a very strong 11%. This is up to significantly from the 6% core revenue growth we delivered in third quarter due to strong Workforce Solutions in USIS outperformance where they continue to deliver mortgage revenue growth rates well in excess of US mortgage market credit inquiries, and a significant improvement in revenue performance from our non-mortgage business in the US, as well as the return to growth in international. A critical level in our ability to deliver high levels of core revenue growth is our deep and broad array of new products and solutions for the US mortgage market. And the ability to constantly outgrow -- consistently outgrow the underlying market. Slide 11 highlights the strong core growth performance and mortgage for our US b2b mortgage businesses Workforce Solutions and USIS. EWS in the USIS outgrew their underlying US mortgage market significantly in 2020, with a combined core growth of 37%. This outperformance was driven strongly by Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, with core growth at 80% in 2020, which exceeded mortgage market growth rates by an outstanding 80 points during the year. The key drivers of the strong EWS outperformance include increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates, new products and records.  EWS has a long history of outgrowing their underlying markets. USIS also delivered strong core revenue growth mortgage in 2020, the growth exceeding the market by 8% driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions, with further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow underlying markets is core to our business model in a substantial strength that should continue to benefit Equifax in 2021 and in the future. Turning now to slide 12; Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding results and is clearly our strongest and most valuable business. Workforce Solutions total revenue grew sequentially during 2020 to 62% in the fourth quarter, and 51% for the year. More importantly, core revenue growth also accelerated throughout 2020 with core growth at 37% in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter and 27% for the year. This outperformance and sequential improvements reflects the uniqueness of between data and the power of the Workforce Solutions business model. Rudy Porter and his team have built a business with strong, long-term growth levers and they continue to demonstrate the value of their scale and differentiated TWN income and employment data, is depth breadth and scale of between database and over 20,000 customer verification network and value of the Workforce Solutions and core service offerings are driving substantial growth in value. In 2020, Workforce Solutions reached 114 million active TWN records an increase of 10 million active records during a difficult period of high US unemployment. Of these 114 million active records over 60% are contributed directly by employers to Workforce Solutions that the team has built up over the past decade. The remaining 40% are contributed through partnerships, many of which are exclusive. Also in 2020, TWN reached over 1 million in core contributors, a significant milestone. As we have a dedicated team focused on TWN record additions and expects to add records again in 2021. Just last week, we signed a new exclusive partnership with a major payroll provider, that we'll be integrating their payroll system with Equifax with their work number later this year. As we're able to monetize record additions instantly from our strong network over 20,000 verification customers. And of course, the uniqueness of the TWN data. Rudy and his team continue to rapidly expand the number of mortgage companies and financial institutions with whom we have built real time system to system integrations. As we talked previously, those derive more usage of our TWN data. In mortgage for example, full 65% mortgage transactions are now system to system Workforce Solutions. These integrations are now extending into our verticals, as well as across our growing government business. We also expect our new verification solution for the Social Security Administration to go online in the first half of this year, which will deliver incremental revenue for Workforce Solutions. The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding with new products across mortgage. channel solutions, government, and I-9, a new product revenue expected to increase substantially in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, Workforce Solutions verification service infrastructure will be fully cloud native, also providing the industry's leading cloud native data and technology platform that will further accelerate data ingestion, massive additions of employee contributors to the clean database, and new product capabilities to this unique and scale TWN data asset. In slide 13, I'd like to turn into 2021 and discuss some of the favorable market and macro trends that I alluded to earlier. Before Covid, the macro trends on the left hand side of the slide had already begun to manifest themselves. As I discussed earlier, COVID driven a rapid acceleration of digital and online consumer interactions, improve real time decisioning require more complete, and more recent information from the broader set of data assets, including alternative data sets has become even more critical. This is required to reduce friction in consumer transactions while ensuring certainty of identities and minimizing credit and fraud risk. Effectively utilizing these expanded requirements for data decisioning has accelerated the need for advanced analytics, including machine learning, as well as the need for effective data governance including the ability to provide consumers with acquired control, and seamless delivery of these capabilities continues to advance. High Performance is always been table stakes in the space that we play in. Given these accelerating and continuing trends, the implications for Equifax are that the gain for our unique datasets and integrated insights has never been stronger, including those involving our powerful TWN income, income and employment data. Our ID and fraud prevention solutions and those include news acquired from Kount target ecommerce and retail space, our trust enhancing, thereby improving the overall digital experience for consumers. I'll now hand it over to John to provide our 2021 guidance, and I'll come back to wrap up.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks Mark. Now let's turn to slide 14 and our economic and market assumptions for 2021. In December, we provided you with a framework for revenue and adjusted EPS for 2021, as well as the basic assumptions underlying that framework. Our current view of 2021 and the 2021 guidance we're providing are consistent with that view, as are the basic economic and market assumptions underlying them. However the progress with COVID-19 vaccines and expected substantial additional economic stimulus are promising to the 2021 economic recovery. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the timing and pace of economic recovery in the US, as well as internationally. Consistent with our discussion in December, our 2021 guidance assumes US mortgage market are proxy for which is US mortgage credit inquiries will remain strong in the first half of 2021, but declined in the second half. We assumed 2021 credit inquiries overall to be down about 5% versus 2020. The first half credit inquiries up almost 15% and second half inquiries down over 23%. For perspective, US credit inquiries in first half 2021 are assumed to grow about 6% from the strong level we saw in the second half of 2020. January was strong and confirms this trend. Equifax US b2b mortgage revenue, EWS and USIS will continue to significantly outpace the overall mortgage market growth of over 10%. US economic recovery will start early in the second quarter of 2021 with over 3.5% GDP growth for the full year. We expect USIS and Workforce Solutions, non mortgage businesses to outperform their underlying markets. EWS' talent solutions and government businesses should also significantly outperform. Workforce Solutions Unemployment Claims business should be down over 35% versus 2020. As unemployment declines with the recovering economy, and we expect the international economies will also recover in 2021 beginning in the second quarter; we expect full year GDP growth of about 2.5% in Australia over 5% in the UK and over 5% in Canada. Our international business is also expected to outperform its underlying markets. US mortgage market has continued to be very strong, driven by both record refinancings and home purchases, as shown on the left side of slide 15, as of December Black Knight, estimates that about 16.5 million US mortgages could still benefit from the refinancing based on the current record low interest rate environment. While down from September's record levels, there remain significant runway in the refi market as refinance candidates continue to be markedly higher than the previous speaking refinance activity in 2016 in the global recession of 2008, given the current pace of mortgage refinancing that almost 1 million per month based on data through August, we expect elevated levels of refinancing should continue well into 2021. As shown on the right side of slide 15, the pace of existing home purchases further strengthened in 4Q reaching 6.8 million on an annualized basis as of December, up from 6.5 million in September. The trend of families seeking more spaces work from home persistence continuing further supported by the continuation of record low mortgage rates. Slide 16 provides the specifics of our 2021 guidance, including the bridge between the midpoint of our 2021 revenue and addressed EPS guidance and our 2020 results. 2021 revenue of between $4.35 billion and $4.45 billion reflects revenue growth of about 5.4% to 7.8% versus 2020 with FX positively impacting revenue by about 1.5%. USIS revenue is expected to be at mid-single digits in 2020, which includes the benefit of Kount acquisition. EWS will continue to deliver double digit revenue growth with continued strong growth and verification services. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth in upper single digits, strong strengthening beginning in the second quarter, reflecting the assumed economic recoveries I discussed earlier. And GCS revenue will be down mid-single digits in 2021. Revenue declined to 15% plus in 1Q 2021 reflects the weakness in US lead gen partner revenue that Mark discussed earlier. We expect to see improved performance as we move through 2021 driven principally by continued growth and our Consumer Direct business. As a reminder, in 2021 Equifax will include all cloud technology transformation costs, and adjusted operating income, EBITDA and EPS, is one time costs have been excluded from our adjusted operating income EBITDA and EPS in 2017 through 2020. In 2021, Equifax will incur one time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $145 million, a reduction of about 60%, and the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $145 million in one time costs with reduced adjusted EPS by about $0.90 per share. 2021 adjusted EPS are $6.20 to $6.50 per share, which includes these tech transformation cost is down approximately 7% to 11% from 2020. Excluding these tech transformation costs of $0.90 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 would show growth of about 2% to 6% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of almost $60 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.37 per share, and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about five percentage points in 2021. Additional assumptions including the 2021 guidance are capital spending in 2020 is expected to be about $400 million. Depreciation and amortization, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to be almost $310 million. This includes about $10 million of D&A from the acquisitions completed so far in 2021. Interest and other income net are expected to be slightly negative in 2021 versus 2020. Our 2021 tax rate is expected to be up from 2020 and slightly above 24%. 2021 Combined corporate and corporate technology costs are expected to be approximately $485 million. About three quarters of the increase from 2020 is driven by the inclusion of technology transformation costs, and adjusted operating income EBITDA and EPS in 2021. These tech transformation costs are principally across the programs. Remainder of the increases principally in security and corporate technology. Slide 17 provides our guidance for 1Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.125 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 15% to 17%, including a 1.9% benefit from foreign exchange. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q 2021 to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share, compared to 1Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share. In 1Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be just over $45 million or $0.28 per share. Excluding these costs that were excluded from 1Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 1Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.73 to $1.83 per share up 21% to 28% from 1Q 2021. Slide 18 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2019 to 2021. The data provided for 1Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of the guidance ranges we have provided. In 2021, we expect core revenue growth of over 10% and turning the strong levels delivered in 4Q 2020 and building momentum for 2022. Slide 18 also provides revenue growth from acquisitions for 4Q 2020, calendar year 2020, and expected levels for 1Q 2021 and calendar 2021. For your reference in the appendix of this presentation, we've included slides that provide more detail on 2020 performance and 2021 guidance. They include 2020 revenue trend details for 2Q 2020 through 4Q 2020. Details on the pension accounting change we completed in 4Q 2020. More detail on our 2021 guidance, including both our expectation for US mortgage market credit inquiries in 1Q 2021, Q2 2021 and second half 2021, and an update to the 2020 through 2022 Cloud transformation cost benefits framework we shared with you in December. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Turning to slide 19; we made significant progress on our cloud data technology transformation in the second half of last year. Progressing through the data product and customer migration stages of our North American technology transformation. The pace of product and customer migrations continues to accelerate and as of year end 2020, USIS completed over 12,000 customer migrations onto cloud based services including our Intertech Ignite and API capabilities. And Workforce Solutions also completed over 26,000 customer migrations and verification services onto its cloud based portals in online fulfillment platforms. This represents over 95% of the workforce solution verification services customer base. As we discussed earlier, global consumer will complete migration of all Consumer Direct customers onto its transform Renaissance platform over the next several months. Across North America, we need to remain on track to have our US customer migrations completed principally during 2021. Our North American exchange migrations also continue to progress well toward our 2021 goals, including our major North American exchanges of the US and Canadian consumer risk, the work number and NCTUE exchanges. In 2021, we're accelerating strange migration to the data pack, Europe, LATAM and Asia Pacific. Europe and Latin America I've already made substantial progress in deploying interconnect, ignite in our API frameworks in the cloud. And as of 2020, as of the end of the year, international had migrated over 9,000 customers onto cloud based services. In 2021, our focus is on product and customer migration to accelerate the decommissioning of legacy systems and data centers to deliver the customer benefits in Equifax cost savings. We will continue to ramp our focus on delivering new products, and NPI revenue by leveraging our new cloud native data and technology infrastructure. 2021 is a critical year as we drive toward completion of our North American transformation. We remain committed to achieving the substantial top and bottom line benefits from the cloud we discussed with you previously. The Equifax cloud native data Intech infrastructures providing meaningful benefits in the marketplace today, and that will even further differentiate Equifax as we complete the transformation.  Turning out a slide 20; this highlights our continued focus on new product innovation, which is a key component of the next chapter of growth at Equifax as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation and new products. We continue to focus on transforming our company into a product led organization and powered by the best-in-class cloud native data technology to fuel our top line growth. In 2020, we further invested in NPI resources while leveraging our new Equifax cloud capabilities to deliver 134 new products above the 120 we discussed in December in our historical 70 to 90 NPIs annually. Importantly, in 2020, over 50% of the new products were delivered leveraging our cloud native data and technology.  In our December investor update, we shared with you several products introduced in 2020 that will have the opportunity to drive significant revenue in 2021 and beyond. Response Confidence, watched by USIS, offers tools that empower our customers to enable consumers to share alternative data that's currently available in credit reports. USIS also launched OneView, a configurable consumer report that will allow consumer credit data to be combined with any other Equifax consumer data asset, to create an easily consumable and configurable multi data asset report. In the first quarter, OneVew will incorporate TWN income employment data along with consumer credit and our other differentiated Equifax data assets. Workforce Solutions continues to expand its suite of new products focused on the hiring process. Our new Talent Select suite of VOE solutions products provide easy access to all or a subset of workforce solution data on a candidate across varying price points with fulfillment based pricing. In mortgage Workforce Solutions has launched new products that support lenders need to combine the TWN employment and income data to tax return data. The new product simplifies lenders processes by providing individual or multiple borrower information per loan via a single transaction from Equifax. In Employer Services our I-9 Anywhere product creates a more efficient and low touch onboarding experience. The product allows a new hire to initiate their application from any device such as a phone, tablet or computer via our I-9 app the new hire then schedules the completion of their application from a nationwide network of over 1,300 locations at a convenient time and location of their choice. The I-9 Anywhere products improves accessibility for employees and off site locations, streamlines paperwork and improves and speeds up the onboarding experience for the employee, hiring managers and human resource professionals. With our strong new product launches in 2020, we expect to accelerate our NPI revenue growth in 2021. As many of our NPI revenue is defined as the revenue delivered by new products launched over the prior three years. And our vitality index is defined as the percentage of current year revenue from new products. In 2021, we expect NPI revenue to increase by over 75% with our vitality index, exceeding 7%, which is up substantially for the past three years. Continued expansions of innovation products leveraging the Equifax cloud are central to our strategy and future growth priorities.  Wrapping up in slide 21, Equifax finished a challenging 2020 COVID environment with record revenue and earnings and strong momentum as we enter 2021. Our 11% core growth in the fourth quarter reflects the strength of our business model. Our estimated 6.6% growth in 2021 at the midpoint of our range, while still in the midst of the COVID recession reflects the resiliency, strength and momentum of the Equifax business model. We are delivering this growth in the context of our expectations that we see economic recovery in the second quarter, and that US mortgage market activity declined 5% in the second half. Core revenue growth of over 10% in 2021 reflects the strength of our business model as new products and expansion of our data assets allow us to outperform in a still uncertain, global environment. Workforce Solutions will continue to power Equifax as operating performance in 2021. Work numbers is our most differentiated data asset and Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business. And likely we will see that Workforce Solutions become our largest business in the very near future. Rudy and his team are driving outsized growth by focusing on their key levers, new records, new products, penetration and expansion into new verticals. We also expect our USIS mortgage business to continue to outgrow the underlying mortgage market. And we are energized by the outlook for USIS' non mortgage performance and momentum from the fourth quarter from both organic growth and new products and the growth we expect from Kount. USIS is competitive and winning in the marketplace and will deliver in 2021. Internationals return to growth in the fourth quarter is a little positive and we expect that to continue in 2021 as their underlying markets recover. We were encouraged by improving conditions across our international portfolio and we expect the international to outperform these underlying markets. We're also turning the corner; we're turning the corner from building our cloud capabilities to leveraging our new Equifax cloud data and technology to drive innovation, new products and growth. We remain confident in the significant top line cost and cash benefits from our new cloud capabilities. These financial benefits start to ramp in 2021 and are enabled by our always on stability, speed to market and the ability to rapidly build and move products around the globe. Our strong operating performance, strong balance sheet and Equifax cloud data and technology platforms position us to enhance our capability via M&A. We are building our acquisition pipeline as we pursue accretive bolt-on transactions that will strengthen the core of Equifax and meet our stringent mutual criteria. And given our very strong financial performance, our strong cash generation in 2020 and our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the future of Equifax, we are restarting our share repurchase program at an expected level of over $100 million in 2021 to offset dilution from employee benefit plans. We view this as a positive step forward in returning cash to shareholders. While the COVID recession and recovery is still uncertain, we have a lot of confidence in our business model and our ability to perform. We have strong momentum on all fronts as we move into 2021. Equifax is outperforming in the challenging COVID recessionary environment. We are on often in position to leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation of new products to drive future growth, margins and cash generation as a market leading data analytics internet technology company. With hat operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our questions from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavidTogut: Thank you. Good morning and appreciate the detailed business and guidance update. Could you maybe dig into the outlook for EWS a bit more? You called out double digit revenue growth expected? Can you be a little bit more precise there is that approximately 10% or something potentially much higher? And then if you could drill down a little bit into growth expectations for employers services and verification, and maybe just close on your expectations for record growth in 2021\nMarkBegor: Yes, we believe in we talked about it that the workforce is clearly our most differentiated business. And when we talked about the strong performance in 2020 that follows from performance in 2017-2018 and 2019. So they've got a long history of growth and have a lot of levers for growth. I don't think we want to get into specific guidance around workforces revenue growth, except that we expect it to outgrow their underlying markets again in 2021. And as we said, we expect that to be in double digit. And we also said it will be for sure the highest growing business inside of Equifax. The levers that workforce has in front of it. And at the top of the list is their ability to add records. That's a very powerful lever and as you know we added records throughout 2020. Those are monetized right out of the chute as soon as we add them to our database. And of course, year-over-year basis those record additions drive revenue growth in 2021. And I think we also stated that we expect to grow records quite confidently in 2021. We added the large agreement we signed just last week with a large payroll processor for an exclusive agreement to contribute their records to Equifax. So that's going to help drive our record growth going forward. On the verifications, clearly they aren't the strongest and largest part of Equifax and the highest margin part. But as you point out talent solutions, it's something we're also excited about, we expect to see some recovery and elements of that business as the market improves, and the economy improves kind of post vaccine. Now we're targeting that kind of second quarter and going into third and fourth. But underlying there, we've got some really impressive growth from our I-9 solution. And we talked about the quality I-9 Anywhere that is really got a lot of traction, because of the uniqueness of the solution. And of course it drives a much higher revenue solution for Equifax. Anything else you'd add John?\nJohnGamble: I mean government, we expect government to continue to grow very, very nicely, right, we have obviously have a substantial new contract in the government segment and also we continue to build out our suite of solutions that service not only federal but also state and local governments in their benefit system. So we feel very good really across the board in EWS and talent solutions is obviously I-9 Anywhere, but also substantial new products across the talent solutions marketplace in general.\nMarkBegor: And as a reminder, we've talked many times during 2020 on our calls with you about the new solution, that workforce is rolling out with the Social Security Administration, and they're talking about that being at run rate of $40 million or $50 million a year contract, and that's going to ramp during our 2021, then becomes a full vendor in 2022. That's a very attractive addition to the business and just reflects, again, the uniqueness of the scale of the data set, and the uniqueness of the data itself.\nDavidTogut: Appreciate that, just as a quick follow up, if you see a ceiling on either down margin expansion for EWS, can this business get above 60%? Or are you going to just reinvest at a high rate, to keep margins approximately in the mid-50s?\nMarkBegor: Yes, I don't think we need to invest just to keep margins at a certain level, we invest where we see accretive returns for our shareholders, when it comes to internal investments, and we've been doing that quite substantially, I think, over the last three years, and even in 2020, we reinvested that quite substantially in the workforce in the USIS whether it was obviously in the cloud transformation investments, but then new products and new D&A assets, investing in new record additions, so we'll continue to invest. With regards to is there a ceiling on there? I think that's a tough question to answer, it's one that we see a long one way of growth potential for Workforce Solutions. I think I talked about what our expectation workforce will becomes, sometime in the near future, our largest business unit, which is, we think, quite attractive for Equifax, and for our shareholders, because of its highly accretive nature of its revenue growth, as well higher accretive nature of its margins.\nJohnGamble: Only thing I'd add, obviously, is in terms of acquisitions as well, workforce an area where we're focused, as well as obviously other parts of the business but it continues to be a focus area.\nOperator: I'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrewSteinerman: Hi, there. For the sake of clarity, could you just state what the organic revenue growth is assumed for the 2021 guidance at the midpoint and has this estimate of revenue growth for 2021 change since December call, particularly just asking about the Kount revenues, I assumed Kount revenues weren't in the December call and are in it today?\nMarkBegor: Yes, so slide 18, we indicate that included in the 2021 guidance, there's about 1.2 points from acquisitions. Right, so if you think about Kount, Kount revenue, we don't have Kount revenue for the entire year, it just closed. And because of that, it's about 1.2 points. So the inorganic revenue is 1.2%, is that covered?\nAndrewSteinerman: And has your view of organic revenue growth for 2021 change between the December call and today?\nMarkBegor: It hasn't, Andrew, December call is only a few weeks ago, I think, we still think that's the right guidance for where Equifax is going to perform to 10.5% in organic growth from the business, there's still, as you know, a lot of uncertainties in the COVID recovery, we're betting on it starting in the second quarter, we've already seen some of it in December, January. So I think that's positive towards that assumption that we have and of course, our assumption is that the mortgage market, while still very strong would decline in the second half of 2021. So I think we've got the right guidance. And I think the momentum we have in the fourth quarter; we can support that 10.5%.\nJohnGamble: And just if you're asking specifically about the numbers between the frameworks we provided in December, and today, they are up about $75 million right on the top and the bottom end. A chunk of average Kount which we just talked about right continues and then also there were some FX benefit. And it also reflects the fact that we think there's obviously risk and timing of recovery of the US economy and other economies. So that $75 million improvement from both the top and bottom reflects those three factors, and obviously we performed a lot better in 2020. And we have talked about in December. So the actual calculated growth rates look different, obviously, are somewhat lower, but the absolute delivery of revenue in 2021 we think is about $75 million higher reflecting the factors that I just referenced.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevinMcVeigh: Great. Thanks. Any sense of how shift to the cloud is impacting both the pace and cost of new product innovation to dosing end of year to 134. So from the beginning of the year, how should we think about that pace in 2021? And then is there any way to reconcile as to what it can lead to organic growth? Does that have the potential to accelerate the core organic growth as you saw this new product innovation to transact infrastructure higher level and [Indiscernible], what is that?\nMarkBegor: Yes, it's a great question. And we talked about that, we really believe fundamental to our strategy is to really leverage our cloud investments, which we think are incredibly powerful, both on the technology and data side for innovation and new products. And we talked throughout 2020, we invested more in product resources to really start driving that leverage of the cloud investments, as we focus, when completing the cloud transformation, but more importantly, leveraging it. And as you point out, 134, is a really big increase from our historical product rollouts. And, of course, those rollouts are in the marketplace now, meaning that our commercial teams are starting to take those to market. So that's embedded in our core growth assumption for 2021, which is up substantially from where it was for growth in 2018, and 2019. And actually, up from our historical, kind of pretty, cyber growth rates and NPIs are clearly going to be a big factor in that. In my comment, I mentioned that, I think it was 50% of our NPI during 2020, we're really leveraging the cloud as we move into 2021, that'll be substantially all of our new products, which will speed up our delivery of new products, speed up the time of getting them into the marketplace, and then also drive the number of products that we want to bring to the market. And we have been given assumption or a target for the number of new products for 2021. I think we were clear about our vitality index, which really drives the organic growth among products have been quite substantial 7% in 2021. So that's a clear lever for growth for us. And we think this is, as we get out in 2021, 2022, 2023, this is really central to where we're taking the company is really leveraging the cloud transformation to drive revenue growth, and that's going to happen through innovation and new products.\nJohnGamble: Kevin, as you know, right, new products tend to deliver the most revenue for us, kind of in year two or three of their life cycle. So we're very excited about the fact that we have very strong obviously new product introductions in 2020, which benefit as Mark referenced 2021 vitality index and revenue contribution, which should also be tremendously beneficial if we looked at 2022. \nKevinMcVeigh: That makes sense. And then just real quick S&P back in the market with restarted buyback.\nMarkBegor: I think your question was about the buyback. But I didn't hear the rest of it. What was your question?\nKevinMcVeigh: Sorry about that. How quickly can you be back in the market?\nMarkBegor: We tend to start the buyback quite quickly. And we'll lever load that through the year. We think that's a positive step forward and reflects our confidence in the future of Equifax. And we think it's a positive step forward to start with a buyback, that will offset dilution to our employee plans, and again, it reflects our confidence in the future of Equifax and is the first step forward in returning cash to shareholders. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToniKaplan: Thank you. Assuming, once you get to the second half, assuming your mortgage market outlook is correct. And that the market slows. I know you're confident in your ability to outperform the market. But how do you think about the delta between your mortgage performance and the market? When the market is slower? Does that delta change because of the lower activity? Or does it stay similar just because of your capabilities?\nMarkBegor: I think it's a great question, Tony, I think you have to really separate USIS and EWS. Workforce Solutions for both businesses are taking advantage of new products in the mortgage space and rolling out new products in an up market is positive and rolling up new products in a down market is positive. So I think that's one, they both have the ability to grow share, meaning, grow new customers and, Workforce Solutions has more capability there just because the Workforce Solutions data is less used, using mortgage as example than the credit filer, and then workforce has just more leverage than USIS has and its ability to grow in all markets and you've seen that, not only in 2020 you've seen it in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. And you've also seen it accelerate, they're not, if their core growth, if you will, over the last year and that's driven by a more rapid increase in records, we think it's driven by the scale of the database, when you have hit rates that are north of 50% on the TWN data that becomes increasingly valuable to customers. So that's driving usage of the data, the value of predictability of income and employment data, there's just a lot more levers there. So we've got a lot of confidence in both businesses ability to outgrow the market that's underlying what Equifax does. But I think it's safe to say workforce just has a lot more leverage, and you add records on top of, as you know, adding records in an upper down market is what we do, and we added 10 million records last year, or did you know we had some records leave the database as employment was reduced by some of our contributors, so that was offset from that. And in a improving economic environment, we would expect to see hiring improved, with lots of our contributors, which is also going to drive records, along with actions like the announcement that we shared this morning that we signed another big payroll processor to an exclusive agreement, so new products are going to help both businesses, and we've got a lot of confidence in our ability going forward, to outgrow underlying markets because of the uniqueness of our data on new products and penetration, new usage, and of course, workforce with records.\nJohnGamble: And, Tony, you're certainly right, right, that lower market activity does affect growth rates and everything. But again, as Mark said, our performances has been so strong relative to the market overall, we feel very good about what that should work handy for the second half.\nToniKaplan: That's great. And then I think getting a lot of questions, I think, given the administration's recent appointments on regulators and so could you just talk about your view on what may be changed from a regulatory perspective this year? Would you expect any meaningful changes to be implemented quickly? And are there any areas in particular that you'd expect to see greater focus from regulators? Thank you.\nMarkBegor: Yes, we would argue that regulators have been quite strong for a long time including during the Trump administration, Equifax, of course, and our competitors operated through the Obama administration, when there was a level of very strong regulation, going into Biden administration, we don't expect meaningful changes, whatever they got we'll respond to them, we play an important role in the marketplace. We've been highly regulated for a long time, and we know what it takes to operate in a regulated environment. I think that's an important characteristic that we have to respond to. And we believe we'll be able to respond to the interest that the regulators have. There's another question on the legislative side is there going to be any changes legislatively around credit bureaus? And so we don't think that we provide a valuable service. And we're focused on ensuring access to credit through alternative data, which is a big priority of the current administration, and we think we have a strong response to that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzahMazari: Good morning. Thank you. My question is around the fraud business. Could you maybe just talk about what's differentiated in your offering? And specifically as it relates to Kount patent portfolio, which is pretty strong, could you maybe talk about the opportunity to repurpose some of those standards across your current portfolio?\nMarkBegor: Yes. Of course Equifax has a sizable identity fraud business. We talked a bunch about the market macro, which we think is very attractive, as digitization increases identity and authentication, really is a critically important thing that was happening pre COVID, it was accelerated during COVID, we think it's only going to continue to grow. So we like the macro space, which is why we've been in it for quite some time. And the idea of adding Kount has been on our radar for quite some time. But we know we knew Kount for four or five years. We've watched them and had the opportunity to acquire them and close the deal yesterday. And what Kount brings is that you're really combining with our differentiated data assets and identity and fraud, really just a massive increase in data capabilities signals. The 32 billion interactions they have per year are just massive and the number of addresses, IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses. just enhances the capabilities to provide higher predictability. And so the combination of Kount data with Equifax data is going to enhance Kount in the retail and ecommerce space and also enhance Equifax in our traditional spaces. And we'll this week; we're already off to the races of bringing Kount solutions to our banking and lending customers, for example. The other thing attracted to us with Kount is it moves Equifax into a new industry vertical, we were never in the retail and ecommerce space and Kount lives there quite strongly. And then as you pointed out, they have some really attractive technology beyond their data. If you combine a lot of their patent and technology capabilities, along with Equifax is including our patented AI technology NDT, we think that's another powerful combination. So we're very energized about the acquisition; excited to have it closed yesterday. And now we're off to the races, as of yesterday afternoon of integrating and really moving to the market and driving the synergies that were part of our acquisition model, as we get the business up and rolling as an Equifax company.\nHamzahMazari: Great and very helpful. Just my follow up question and I turn it over is just when you look at your core growth, pre breach, I guess it was 8% then 2%, 3% for 2018 and 2019. And then we sort of jumped to 11%. And then you're guiding for 5%. What's the normalized level of core growth? You think you can do consistently for post tech transformation? Is it sort of an 8% number? Or is it sort of 6%? Any thoughts? I know 2020 was a different year with sort of the Workforce Solutions business.\nMarkBegor: Yes, we're not ready to put our long-term framework back in place, but I can tell you we're getting to that stage, I would expect it will be something we certainly want to do in 2021. We'd like to see a little more, a few more months under our belt of this COVID recovery to make sure we see that. But I hope you get a sense that our confidence in the Equifax model is quite high. When we look at a core growth in 2020 and the core growth expectation we have for 2021 that's a very meaningful number for us. It's one that we have a lot of confidence in, and we will be ready to share our long-term framework sometime in 2021. But I hope you get a sense that the power of Workforce Solutions, obviously, it needs to be a larger part of Equifax is a positive for our core growth. The new product focus that we have, we've been very consistent with you over the past couple of years is that it's our expectation that the cloud investments that we've made will not only drive our margins and cash, but will also drive our top line is we're able to deliver new solutions we couldn't do before and really drive our new products. So those are all positives from our perspective, and how we think of the long term, growth rate of the company, and we'll be ready to share that with you in the coming future.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKylePeterson: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So just start off on the EWS segment, you guys have really strong year there. Have you guys noticed in one of your big competitors come out with an offering a few months back and had a partnership with a pretty big payroll provider as well. Have you guys notice any change in either the competitive environment, or new business wins or any momentum in the last few months in that segment?\nMarkBegor: We've not. We haven't seen any kind of commercial traction on that yet. We expect there will be but at the same time, we've got a lot of confidence in the scale of a Workforce Solutions business model, the 20,000 verification customer network that we have, it's taken a decade to build, our database is multiples of what we believe our competitors will ever be able to access given the scale of our additions. And as a reminder, of the 114 million actives we have 60% of those we've done with individual companies over a decade, it takes a long time to build that database. We also had a database that has 350 million total records including inactive and a third, close to a third of our revenue comes from inactive records, which is another characteristic is very unique to workforce solutions. So we've got a high confidence in our business model. And as we shared on this call, we signed an exclusive arrangement with another large payroll processor just last week, that's going to be coming between and they came to TWN, because of the scale of our capabilities, and what we can deliver for them, and what they can deliver to their customers. And then, of course, the revenue share opportunity, it's a very meaningful with Equifax. And it's more challenged when you're in a start up mode.\nKylePeterson: Got it. That's something very helpful color. And then just a follow up on the GCS business. I know the partner revenue is kind of in a tough spot. Just what would it take for I think some of your partners to start pumping their marketing and helping that trend kind of improve? Is it the better trends in like cars and auto markets? Or just like how should we kind of think about that business as the economy hopefully bounces back here in 2021?\nMarkBegor: You nailed it, it's really the economic recovery, it's their customer, who are primarily card issuers, P loan originators, having more confidence in building their originations, what we believe many big card companies are doing is, using their own modeling to generate new customers now, and I would characterize more cautiously and we're seeing that in our revenue directly with card companies, while it's improving, they're so cautious in this uncertain economic environment. And when you're cautious, I ran a credit card business for 10 years, you're going to be careful about, who you use for lead gen, lead gen generally focus on your own versus buying leads from someone else. So it's our expectation that as the economy improves, and as we move past the COVID pandemic to whatever the new normal is, our view is that we're starting to see that in the latter part of 2020, for sure in our non mortgage businesses and continuing in January, but that'll also show up, for our lead generation customers, and their revenue will grow.\nJohnGamble: And GCS and global work, we are excited about our Consumer Direct business, right, that continues to grow. And we've seen the first growth out of it in quite a while in the third and fourth quarter. So we think that's a very positive outcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.\nManavPatnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just had a few there. So firstly just on the organic growth, I just wanted to confirm right, so in December, the implied organic growth is close to 6%. Now it's 2.5% to 5%. And I guess what you're saying is basically the toughest comp that was created in 4Q is a reason why you just haven't updated and given the uncertainties, is that correct?\nMarkBegor: So I'm going to make sure I understand the query, I think you're asking about the difference between the framework we provided in December, and the guidance we just provided, is that correct? You're just coming through that. I apologize.\nManavPatnaik: That's all right. Just on the core organic growth, right? Because Today's guidance implies 2.5% to 5% organic, which is more than what it was in December?\nMarkBegor: So we performed much better in December than we expected, right. So our revenue came in very strong. So I understand that you're talking about a growth rate off of our much stronger 2020 performance. But our view of 2021 right is actually slightly better than it was when we talked to you in December. And we took -- we increased the bottom and top end of our range by $75 million. And that reflects Kount. It reflects some FX benefits. But it also reflects the fact that we continue to believe there's substantial risk in the timing of the recovery. So that's really what it is. So yes, we have a stronger December than we expected. So 2020 was very, very good. But our view of 2021 is actually slightly better than it was when we talked to you in December. \nManavPatnaik: Okay, fine. And then in terms of the exclusive partnerships we have with the payroll provider, I understand why the large provider would want to come to Equifax but I'm just curious, why did they sign exclusive? I was hoping for some color there because why not sign up with others as well and monetize their data multiple times.\nMarkBegor: Yes, Manav, as you probably know from prior discussions, the bulk of our relationships are exclusive. And we think that's the right arrangement between us and our partners. The partners really think having one relationship is the way to operate. And they believe that brings more value to their customer base Remember, if you're -- easy example of a payroll processor, this is not a core activity for you. But by providing the income and employment verification services to their customers, they're providing a new value added service, from a company like Equifax, they deliver that service to their customers, which are primarily their processing payroll for free, so becomes more valuable, and in our case, we just have more scale for their employees, meaning, we can access 20,000 different mortgage originators, auto originator, car originators, meaning, we can deliver more value to them than a startup could, which is why their desire around exclusive is more important. I think the scale of Equifax and Workforce Solutions also plays into it, the history we have over a decade of providing income and employment verification, the security in debt controls we have around privacy, around how the data is used is also a big part of the discussion for our partners, because they want to make sure they protect their customers data, always play into why the bulk of our relationships are exclusive and why this one is too.\nManavPatnaik: Okay, and if I could just squeeze in one quick one. You talked about a lot of things; I just want to get an update on how you see your partnership with Syco fitting into the scheme of things and how that's going. Thanks.\nMarkBegor: Yes, so it's gone well, we launched a couple years ago, we've got a couple of products in the marketplace. We're still building out some of the technology but Will and I have a monthly call with the team to talk about progress. And we still believe that that's going to be positive for Equifax and for Syco. So we're very committed to it. And we're continuing to look for more solutions that we might do together that would leverage both Equifax and Syco.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomoRosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Hey, just a few little ones to finish off. John, just as you compare like the framework to the 2021 guidance. People focus a lot on kind of the revenue growth rate change, which you stated has to do more with the outperformance in 2020 than it has to do with expectations for 2021. Redundant system processes that have gone up over 45 million to almost 60 million. I was wondering if you can tell us what's going on over there a little bit.\nJohnGamble: So was the question, what was -- can you say the end, I think that you were a little garbled. I didn't hear exactly what the end question was.\nShlomoRosenbaum: Sure. Redundant system cost seems to have gone up from $48 million -- $45 million to $58 million. I'm just wondering, what's going on over there?\nJohnGamble: Sure. So just as we continue to move through time, right, we get more clarity on the pace at which we're able to bring new systems to the cloud, which that drives the incremental costs that we're incurring. And that continues to progress really well. So as we continue to move forward, we're able to better view how those costs are going to be incurred. And then that gives us a view as to when decommissioning will occur. And just as you look to within 2020, we have a very nice pace of new systems moving into the cloud, which will -- which should drive the very good 2022 performance that we talked about, and we talked about during the framework. So we're just refining the model and continuing to work forward, slightly higher depreciation I think we talked to you about before, and slightly higher cloud costs, in the context of our total cost base, not really a very big number.\nShlomoRosenbaum: Okay, thank you and then just increase the share repurchase program, it doesn't seem like it's that aggressive, given the company's kind of return to growth. Is there potential to kind of upside down more during the year? And also what about the dividend? There hasn't been a change in the dividend in the years, as well?\nJohnGamble: Yes, I think I hope you caught the characterization that we had. This is a positive step forward. But I would also say that the last step for Equifax, but we thought it was timely to at least start to return cash to shareholders and offset employee plan dilution as we talked earlier in this call, and we've talked for quite some time. It's our expectation that we'll be rolling out our long term financial framework but will also include our capital allocation plan later in 2021. We want to see a few more months of the COVID recovery before we put that in place, but our confidence was quite strong and where we believe the company's going which is why we opted to announce this first step in our buyback and as you know like our dividend growth was not part of our long term framework prior to the cyber event and stock buyback was also and we've been quite consistent, but it's our expectation that both of those will be a part of our long-term framework and capital allocation in the future.\nShlomoRosenbaum: Okay, if you don't mind me, I might just squeeze one more, social security contract is that same one half. Does that slip at all? I kind of -- was under the impression that was going to be starting in the first quarter of this year.\nJohnGamble: Questions on the timing of this social security contract? That is starting on the technical work in the first quarter and revenue will star, as we get into second. It'll continue to ramp through the year. And I think we talked about the run rate when fully deployed, which will be in 2022 full run rate is $40 million to $50 million a year of revenue.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated.\nBrettHuff: Good morning. Thanks for all the details guys. I'll just -- just one question. So the bigger picture one, as you guys think about the analytics market versus the unique data market, you're playing in both. And can you talk about how you're thinking you attack that market? Is it more do we lead with the data and back into the analytics of the cross sell? Or do we lead with the analytics products and then use the data as a cross sell? Or am I thinking about that paradigm, kind of incorrectly? Thank you.\nMarkBegor: No. I think you are thinking about it the right way. And it really depends on the customer. If you think about the larger, more sophisticated customers, they have very sophisticated, typically analytics teams. We still help them with analytic solutions, whether it's scores or models for them, but they do a lot of that themselves, so that they would be more of a data consumer, but with a supplement of advanced analytics from Equifax, and as you go down, in the scale of customers, you quickly get into customers that are really looking for more turnkey solutions from us, meaning a full product, and that would be new products and the scores, new solutions, they really they can plug in as opposed to try to create themselves. And that's why the capabilities we have, first and foremost, continuing to expand our differentiated data assets is clearly at the heart of what we want to do. And now that we have that data in the cloud, and a single data fabric, it allows us and our customers to more easily access that data, in our case, to deliver analytic solutions that are just much more sophisticated and have multi data elements to it, that we think will be quite powerful like going forward. And you're starting to see that, ramp and NPIs last year, the 134, we delivered is really a good example of our focus on bringing those solutions to market.\nBrettHuff: Just a quick follow up from a buying behavior point of view, are we getting more kind of office of the enterprise data? Is there a data and analytics czar at? I don't know medium, large enterprises? And are they doing buying there? Or are we still selling into individual business units, and maybe the left hand and the right hand don't know that they're both buying from you guys or another analytics company?\nMarkBegor: It's again depends on the size of the company. There's a lot of companies leverage their sourcing relationships to try to package everything they do, which from our case, we view is advantageous in most cases, because of the particularly the strength of TWN. If you're bringing in that in the commercial relationship, it's just a very valuable data asset. There are still a lot of customers that buy by product line, that's who we interact with. And that's who we're working and bringing solutions to. We're bringing different solutions to the mortgage business unit inside of a financial institution than we are to the auto or card or P loan. So it does vary on what we're bringing from analytics as well as product capability. So it is varied by customer.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrewNicholas: Hi, good morning. You spent $32 million on organizational right sizing in the quarter sounds like it was necessary to enable some of that deceleration and tech transformation spend you expected this year. I'm just wondering if there are additional costs of this type of this nature you'd expect to incur in 2021. And if so, are those included in the $145 million of one time transformation expense you've outlined for the year?\nMarkBegor: So I think when we talk in December right, we indicated that we would expect to see some decline in tech transformation expense by quarter as we go through the year. And you can see that because the $45 million in the first quarter is obviously more than 25% of the total that we gave. So we will -- you'll see a decline in our tech transformation expense as we go through the year. And I think if we get into talking to more fully about 2022, we can talk about whether there could be additional right sizing costs that could come. But there would be nothing included in our guidance.\nAndrewNicholas: Got it. And then switching gears a little bit, I was hoping you could refresh us on the open banking opportunity abroad; maybe provide a bit more color on how AccountScore addresses this opportunity, specifically? And then lastly, is it your expectation that your AccountScore acquisition could benefit other capabilities or provide other capabilities that you can pull over to other regions? Or is that primarily a European business? Thank you. \nMarkBegor: Yes, great question. Open banking is as you know is really getting some traction in many markets, like the UK and Australia. And in all of our markets, we have partnerships like in the United States, we have a partnership like with Yodlee, around consented data, and we've got a partnership in Canada, we got another one in Australia and our partner in the UK with AccountScore, and there was an opportunity to acquire them, which we thought was very strategic, and very strategic for our UK business. And we also believe, as you point out that there's going to be some capabilities around categorization, assets that they have and capability and some of their technology that we may be able to use in other markets on a global basis.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrewJeffrey: Hey, guys, lots to digest here. Appreciate the insights. I have a question Mark, just specifically on EWS unemployment, I realized it's a relatively small business in the grand scheme of things, but the guidance is here, can you unpack that a little bit in terms of whether that's purely returned to something like full employment in the US, or if there was any transitory benefit from pandemic in terms of employers that might have come to you for assistance in automation that they perhaps no longer need as the economy recovers just a little more color, that would be helpful.\nMarkBegor: So we as you might imagine, we're adding customers during 2020, as we normally do, in Workforce Solutions, and Employer Services, and we provide, we have a lot of value added services that are beneficial in some regards to macro, when a company is struggling, they look for ways to improve their efficiencies, and by outsourcing to Equifax, some of those activities to workforce solutions, there's a positive there for them. So that was clearly part of our focus in 2020 it will continue in 2021. And then, of course, the big macro is less employees or reducing employees, generally is lower activity for our broader services business. And as we seen some pickup, we expect that to continue in 2021, as the COVID recovery unfolds, that'll be a positive for that business. And then on top of that, we talked about some of the products stuff that we're doing like the I-9 Anywhere is really a very, very strong growth just because the uniqueness of the solution, allowing a prospective employee to complete that process remotely, was a positive during COVID. But it's also positive, longer term, it just is faster, they don't have to come to the HR office, and we can do that so many different locations, that really drives speed and a lot of employers want to get employees on the floor or into the warehouse quickly. And this capability really helps drive that speed element.\nJohnGamble: And just specific to 2021 guidance, the decline in the unemployment insurance claims revenue that we gave was specifically just related to an assumed economic recovery and substantial reduction in unemployment claims. So there's no -- there's nothing behind it. \nAndrewJeffrey: Okay, that's helpful, John. And then just as a quick follow up, can you just speak to at a high level, how much if any of the tech report platforming savings you anticipate next year are likely to be reinvested in the business?\nMarkBegor: I think we gave some decent framework in 2022; you've seen and what we expect the savings to be, we haven't -- we're not ready to give 2022 guidance. I think we were clear in December. We have been all year that we expect the tax savings to enhance our margin but we also expect to continue to invest in Equifax going forward, whether it's a new products or other priorities. And when we're -- when we share our long-term growth framework, we'll get a real framework on that, on the long-term basis, and will certainly walk you from 2021 to 2022 to long-term growth framework that we will be putting back in place.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen.\nGeorgeMihalos: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask at a high level Mark, as you see some of this newest sort of payment products buy now pay later and the like, can you talk a little bit about the conversations that you're having with your Fi issuer customers? How are they thinking about that from a competitive standpoint? Is that something you think can have an impact on your business, either negative in terms of lower card growth or positive in terms of meeting more of your services for them to compete?\nMarkBegor: Yes, it's a latter, we're talking to all of them and providing dating services to them, they still have to do a level of underwriting is anyone who would if you're going to extend credit. And for us, we view it as a positive, macro meaning that there's more lending in essence this is a buy now pay later is a lending. Now that's positive for Equifax because we can help them it's authentication as a part of that you have to verify to the individuals who they say they are, and there's an element of underwriting that takes place. And then there's another piece around that data. And we're working with that ecosystem to collect that data, so we can add it to our existing data in order to help them in their processes.\nGeorgeMihalos: Okay, that's helpful. And just a quick follow up on the buyback, we should be thinking that this is designed to offset dilution not to actually reduce share count, is that the right way to be thinking about it from a modeling standpoint?\nMarkBegor: Correct. That's our intention with this first step in our buyback program was to offset share dilution from employee plans, and we think it's a show of confidence hopefully you do it that way by Equifax, as a step forward in our confidence in the future.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Meuler with Baird.\nJeffreyMeuler: Thank you. Good morning, Mark, you gave some good commentary on EWS record count contributor relationships and incentives. I want to try to simplify it. But obviously, there's a risk that I'm going to miss something important in that but so would love any correction if I am wrong. So the exclusivity ask is from Equifax, with common contractual relationship with a partner channel is revenue share. It's a dual sided network, and you have the biggest network of verifiers. So there's a better revenue opportunity for your partners by partnering with Equifax. Is that the primary motivation of the two sides? Or are there some other benefits to contributors to sign exclusivity with Equifax?\nMarkBegor: I think I shared that with earlier question, I don't know if you caught that. So you hit obviously very important points for the partnership. But it's also really important Jeff to understand that this is a very important relationship because it's a relationship between the partner called payroll processor and their customer meaning accompany the HR manager, and there's a lot of trust around that. So there's also an element of who you're going to partner with, and what's their history of being in the space, the fact that we have a million companies contributing to us, and they're just 60% of the data assets that we have, we've gone to company by company to collect that history plays in that conversation, very, very strongly meaning that we've done it, we do it well, we protect the privacy. And then there's also the scale to the employee. Remember, this is a real benefit for a company's employees to help them with their financial lives, how they access credit. And if you look at the alternative that payroll processors companies today, their customers, they're doing that verification individually by the HR manager, there's a lack of privacy. There's a lot of work involved. How do you know if a mortgage company calling that HR manager at that small company to verify the income and employment of one of their employees? We do that a lot for them, so it's a very important relationship. So the value added service and the idea of having two companies do it versus one our conversation with our partners is there's not a lot of interest in that, for the economic reasons you raise, but I would argue more importantly, because of the scale of Equifax, the scale of Workforce Solutions, the scale of our privacy and data capabilities, our business model and how we operate, that is as important or more important than the revenue share, which of course, we believe it's very hard to compete with Equifax from a revenue share standpoint.\nJeffreyMeuler: Got it. But I asked for couple additional color for me. And then just a definitional question is core growth, organic constant currency or this core growth includes the impacts of acquisitions and FX.\nMarkBegor: It includes the impact of acquisitions and FX. Although on that slide, we did give you what those impacts are. Right, yes. We always break them down every quarter. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities.\nSimonClinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I know we're coming quite long into this call. I was wondering if we could just go back to USIS margins in the quarter. John, I believe you talked about mix issues or the mix impact on margins there. And I was wondering if you could help us think about how to think about the incremental margins, excluding the tech transition costs, as we go forward through 2021. And specifically, if we're modeling mortgage revenue declines or headwinds in the second half, does that mean you should expect higher incremental margins and vice versa?\nJohnGamble: Yes, so you're specifically referencing USIS, yes, and as we've talked about in the past, so the margins on mortgage specifically because of mortgage solutions are lower, right, so the two factors are obviously in mortgage solutions we buy and resell the trended file from our competitors. And then also, the score cost some mortgage are just higher than they are in any other vertical. So those two factors negatively impact our gross margin on mortgage. So yes, as mortgage grows substantially, it's a negative to the margin percentage is obviously very profitable, right. But negative to margin percentage for USIS and as mortgage declines, it's somewhat of positive. Obviously, that isn't the only factor that moves that affects margin. So I can't tell you that that's the only thing that will move them around. But as you're thinking about it, yes, that's correct\nSimonClinch:  Okay, all right. Thanks. And just follow up. Maybe we could jump back to the EWS and the payroll processor agreement you have in placed. In terms of the -- well, I guess, I'm taking a step back and think bigger picture here. Is there any reason to think that say in 10 years time this market would become -- would have removed from these sort of exclusive relationships to maybe dual sourcing in any way, as it has done in other parts of the credit market for example? And if not, why wouldn't that be the case?\nMarkBegor: Yes, we don't think so. Given the scale of our capability, remember, it's quite important that only 40% of our data records and of course it is 40%, come through this partnership model. 60% are individual companies that we've added over a decade. And that takes a lot of effort to add those going into a company, convincing them you have the capabilities. And of course, we do it every day; we're adding companies every week, individually, at the same time, as we're working on these larger partnerships with payroll processors. So that scale really gives we believe Equifax a real advantage in what we delivered to our customers, and then also how a contributor meaning whether it's a company or a partnership, like payroll processor thinks about working with someone like Equifax, just because of the scale of our capabilities. And we're showing pretty clearly that we're expanding that scale, 10 million record additions last year, the conversation we had earlier about a very large, they will processor moving forward with us on an exclusive basis later this year. There's a real momentum there for the business going forward. And then the other element that I think as you know is that we're going beyond that W2, we want to expand to 1099 and self employed and gig employees. So there's a lot of work on that by Equifax there that it's just another vertical data records for us, that we think is quite attractive. And we talked also about even moving beyond our attention to move beyond income employment and look for other data records that are a part of that hiring process. As whether it's licensure or other data records. \nSimonClinch: I understand, yes. So to just follow up quickly there, in terms of the companies that provide the data, is that invariably a highly labor intensive collection or arrangement there, I'm just wondering if there's some way in future data becomes more automated and easier to collect, and so easier for new entrants to start chipping away at those individual relationships.\nMarkBegor: No, these are companies that are highly automated. We talked in a couple of questions on this call about the sensitivity they have, they're in the business of processing payroll and other services for the HR manager, that's their core business, and they want to make sure that if we're going to partner with someone on income and employment verification, that they're doing it with someone who's going to deliver real value to their customers, that's going to be done securely with real privacy. In course, we've been in this business for a decade. And then also the idea of a revenue share because of our scale, we can monetize those records, quite broadly across, the 20,000 verification customers we have that becomes an advantage in a relationship. \nOperator: Our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorgeTong: Hi, thanks, good morning. Do you expect core revenue growth to be 10.5% in 2021? Can you discuss how much of 10.5% you expect from outperformance to the mortgage market? And then break out where you expect the remaining growth to come from in detail if you have it?\nMarkBegor: Yes, so I don't think we're going to get a lot more detailed in the 10.5% that we provided but what could happen as we move through the year right, as we've talked about the fact that we expect underlying economies to improve. So we expect our non mortgage revenue growth to improve meaningfully as we go through 2021. So you'll see non mortgage be a substantially larger contributor to core revenue growth as you move through the year. So that is we do expect that to occur, and we think that's one of the contributors to the fact that we'll be able to deliver very nice core revenue growth, even in a declining mortgage market.\nGeorgeTong: And just to follow up on that first question, before on the business update call, you did say that you expected outperformance to the non mortgage market to be less than half of the core growth this upcoming year? Is that still the case here?\nMarkBegor: So you're talking about comment on the December 7 call?\nGeorgeTong: Yes.\nMarkBegor: So I think what we expect is what I just said, right, is we're expecting to see very nice improvement in our non mortgage revenue, not just in the US, not just EWS and USIS but also internationally. And I think that will provide substantially more contribution to core revenue growth in 2021.\nGeorgeTong: Got it, that's helpful. And then Mark, do you expect the US mortgage market to increase 15% in the first half of 2021 and decline 23% in the second half of the year? How would you handicap the upside downside potential to your forecasts based on the refinancing opportunity out there? And also home purchase terms?\nMarkBegor: That's a tough one, we're not economists obviously. And we're certainly not build to forecast that we tried to be really transparent with you and our investors in all throughout 2020, in the December call just went through and, tried to take all the forecasts that are out there from NBA and Black Knight and others and, bring it together in something that felt reasonable. We still think that feels reasonable that there will be a decline, certainly at some point. you could spend a long time on this call talking about the positives and negatives that might drive that obviously, low interest rates are positive. I think the Fed's position is positive. Where the COVID recovery is going, it feels a little more uncertain which is obviously a part of our forecast for guidance for 2021? And we still feel good about that framework, which is why we shared it in December and we haven't really changed it as we sit here now in February, and we still think it's the right way to start the year is we think about guidance for Equifax.\nOperator: Our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.\nGaryBisbee: Hi, good morning. Mark I just wanted to clarify something from your prepared remarks. I believe I heard you say USIS non mortgage revenue was flattish in Q4, which is improvement obviously from the prior quarter but then up five in December and up to six in January, was that right or was the up five and six something else? And if so, what's driven that sequential improvement in trend in recent months? Thank you.\nMarkBegor: So just to be clear, I think the commentary was specific around online. Okay, not around total. And if all I was trying to indicate is that basically the trend was improving through the fourth quarter, and we saw a nice performance in December and effectively, it's continuing in January, that's all.\nGaryBisbee: And what are the key underlying drivers of that? Is it more of that sort of consumer credit activity? Or is it new products or other things that you're going to deliver that? Thank you.\nMarkBegor: There's no question that there's an element of economic improvement or consumer activity by our customers. There's no question there and we talked about that in third quarter result kind of steps forward in the fourth quarter, and that's really continuing. And then on top of that we're in the marketplace, whether we're trying to gain share or roll out new products, that's a positive element on that also, but certainly underlying that is economic activity. \nGaryBisbee: Right. And then just a quick follow up to just a level set for us. Can you tell us what percent of 2020 revenue and both uses and Workforce is mortgage related?\nMarkBegor: So we will post shortly in five minutes updated views of revenue by vertical for every business, you get an echo back, so if it's okay, if I could ask you to wait five minutes, you'll see it post on the website.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the profits back to Mr. Hare for any additional and closing remarks.\nDorian Hare: Thanks everybody for joining today's conference call. We look forward to engaging with you again in April when we release our first quarter of 2021 results. In the interim, myself, Mark, as well as John looking forward to engaging with you in different forum throughout the quarter. This does conclude our conference call. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. Now let's turn to slide 14 and our economic and market assumptions for 2021. In December, we provided you with a framework for revenue and adjusted EPS for 2021, as well as the basic assumptions underlying that framework. Our current view of 2021 and the 2021 guidance we're providing are consistent with that view, as are the basic economic and market assumptions underlying them. However the progress with COVID-19 vaccines and expected substantial additional economic stimulus are promising to the 2021 economic recovery. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the timing and pace of economic recovery in the US, as well as internationally. Consistent with our discussion in December, our 2021 guidance assumes US mortgage market are proxy for which is US mortgage credit inquiries will remain strong in the first half of 2021, but declined in the second half. We assumed 2021 credit inquiries overall to be down about 5% versus 2020. The first half credit inquiries up almost 15% and second half inquiries down over 23%. For perspective, US credit inquiries in first half 2021 are assumed to grow about 6% from the strong level we saw in the second half of 2020. January was strong and confirms this trend. Equifax US b2b mortgage revenue, EWS and USIS will continue to significantly outpace the overall mortgage market growth of over 10%. US economic recovery will start early in the second quarter of 2021 with over 3.5% GDP growth for the full year. We expect USIS and Workforce Solutions, non mortgage businesses to outperform their underlying markets. EWS' talent solutions and government businesses should also significantly outperform. Workforce Solutions Unemployment Claims business should be down over 35% versus 2020. As unemployment declines with the recovering economy, and we expect the international economies will also recover in 2021 beginning in the second quarter; we expect full year GDP growth of about 2.5% in Australia over 5% in the UK and over 5% in Canada. Our international business is also expected to outperform its underlying markets. US mortgage market has continued to be very strong, driven by both record refinancings and home purchases, as shown on the left side of slide 15, as of December Black Knight, estimates that about 16.5 million US mortgages could still benefit from the refinancing based on the current record low interest rate environment. While down from September's record levels, there remain significant runway in the refi market as refinance candidates continue to be markedly higher than the previous speaking refinance activity in 2016 in the global recession of 2008, given the current pace of mortgage refinancing that almost 1 million per month based on data through August, we expect elevated levels of refinancing should continue well into 2021. As shown on the right side of slide 15, the pace of existing home purchases further strengthened in 4Q reaching 6.8 million on an annualized basis as of December, up from 6.5 million in September. The trend of families seeking more spaces work from home persistence continuing further supported by the continuation of record low mortgage rates. Slide 16 provides the specifics of our 2021 guidance, including the bridge between the midpoint of our 2021 revenue and addressed EPS guidance and our 2020 results. 2021 revenue of between $4.35 billion and $4.45 billion reflects revenue growth of about 5.4% to 7.8% versus 2020 with FX positively impacting revenue by about 1.5%. USIS revenue is expected to be at mid-single digits in 2020, which includes the benefit of Kount acquisition. EWS will continue to deliver double digit revenue growth with continued strong growth and verification services. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth in upper single digits, strong strengthening beginning in the second quarter, reflecting the assumed economic recoveries I discussed earlier. And GCS revenue will be down mid-single digits in 2021. Revenue declined to 15% plus in 1Q 2021 reflects the weakness in US lead gen partner revenue that Mark discussed earlier. We expect to see improved performance as we move through 2021 driven principally by continued growth and our Consumer Direct business. As a reminder, in 2021 Equifax will include all cloud technology transformation costs, and adjusted operating income, EBITDA and EPS, is one time costs have been excluded from our adjusted operating income EBITDA and EPS in 2017 through 2020. In 2021, Equifax will incur one time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $145 million, a reduction of about 60%, and the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $145 million in one time costs with reduced adjusted EPS by about $0.90 per share. 2021 adjusted EPS are $6.20 to $6.50 per share, which includes these tech transformation cost is down approximately 7% to 11% from 2020. Excluding these tech transformation costs of $0.90 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 would show growth of about 2% to 6% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of almost $60 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.37 per share, and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about five percentage points in 2021. Additional assumptions including the 2021 guidance are capital spending in 2020 is expected to be about $400 million. Depreciation and amortization, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to be almost $310 million. This includes about $10 million of D&A from the acquisitions completed so far in 2021. Interest and other income net are expected to be slightly negative in 2021 versus 2020. Our 2021 tax rate is expected to be up from 2020 and slightly above 24%. 2021 Combined corporate and corporate technology costs are expected to be approximately $485 million. About three quarters of the increase from 2020 is driven by the inclusion of technology transformation costs, and adjusted operating income EBITDA and EPS in 2021. These tech transformation costs are principally across the programs. Remainder of the increases principally in security and corporate technology. Slide 17 provides our guidance for 1Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.125 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 15% to 17%, including a 1.9% benefit from foreign exchange. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q 2021 to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share, compared to 1Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share. In 1Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be just over $45 million or $0.28 per share. Excluding these costs that were excluded from 1Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 1Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.73 to $1.83 per share up 21% to 28% from 1Q 2021. Slide 18 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2019 to 2021. The data provided for 1Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of the guidance ranges we have provided. In 2021, we expect core revenue growth of over 10% and turning the strong levels delivered in 4Q 2020 and building momentum for 2022. Slide 18 also provides revenue growth from acquisitions for 4Q 2020, calendar year 2020, and expected levels for 1Q 2021 and calendar 2021. For your reference in the appendix of this presentation, we've included slides that provide more detail on 2020 performance and 2021 guidance. They include 2020 revenue trend details for 2Q 2020 through 4Q 2020. Details on the pension accounting change we completed in 4Q 2020. More detail on our 2021 guidance, including both our expectation for US mortgage market credit inquiries in 1Q 2021, Q2 2021 and second half 2021, and an update to the 2020 through 2022 Cloud transformation cost benefits framework we shared with you in December. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mark. I mean government, we expect government to continue to grow very, very nicely, right, we have obviously have a substantial new contract in the government segment and also we continue to build out our suite of solutions that service not only federal but also state and local governments in their benefit system. So we feel very good really across the board in EWS and talent solutions is obviously I-9 Anywhere, but also substantial new products across the talent solutions marketplace in general. Only thing I'd add, obviously, is in terms of acquisitions as well, workforce an area where we're focused, as well as obviously other parts of the business but it continues to be a focus area. And just if you're asking specifically about the numbers between the frameworks we provided in December, and today, they are up about $75 million right on the top and the bottom end. A chunk of average Kount which we just talked about right continues and then also there were some FX benefit. And it also reflects the fact that we think there's obviously risk and timing of recovery of the US economy and other economies. So that $75 million improvement from both the top and bottom reflects those three factors, and obviously we performed a lot better in 2020. And we have talked about in December. So the actual calculated growth rates look different, obviously, are somewhat lower, but the absolute delivery of revenue in 2021 we think is about $75 million higher reflecting the factors that I just referenced. Kevin, as you know, right, new products tend to deliver the most revenue for us, kind of in year two or three of their life cycle. So we're very excited about the fact that we have very strong obviously new product introductions in 2020, which benefit as Mark referenced 2021 vitality index and revenue contribution, which should also be tremendously beneficial if we looked at 2022. And, Tony, you're certainly right, right, that lower market activity does affect growth rates and everything. But again, as Mark said, our performances has been so strong relative to the market overall, we feel very good about what that should work handy for the second half. And GCS and global work, we are excited about our Consumer Direct business, right, that continues to grow. And we've seen the first growth out of it in quite a while in the third and fourth quarter. So we think that's a very positive outcome. So was the question, what was -- can you say the end, I think that you were a little garbled. I didn't hear exactly what the end question was. Sure. So just as we continue to move through time, right, we get more clarity on the pace at which we're able to bring new systems to the cloud, which that drives the incremental costs that we're incurring. And that continues to progress really well. So as we continue to move forward, we're able to better view how those costs are going to be incurred. And then that gives us a view as to when decommissioning will occur. And just as you look to within 2020, we have a very nice pace of new systems moving into the cloud, which will -- which should drive the very good 2022 performance that we talked about, and we talked about during the framework. So we're just refining the model and continuing to work forward, slightly higher depreciation I think we talked to you about before, and slightly higher cloud costs, in the context of our total cost base, not really a very big number. Yes, I think I hope you caught the characterization that we had. This is a positive step forward. But I would also say that the last step for Equifax, but we thought it was timely to at least start to return cash to shareholders and offset employee plan dilution as we talked earlier in this call, and we've talked for quite some time. It's our expectation that we'll be rolling out our long term financial framework but will also include our capital allocation plan later in 2021. We want to see a few more months of the COVID recovery before we put that in place, but our confidence was quite strong and where we believe the company's going which is why we opted to announce this first step in our buyback and as you know like our dividend growth was not part of our long term framework prior to the cyber event and stock buyback was also and we've been quite consistent, but it's our expectation that both of those will be a part of our long-term framework and capital allocation in the future. Questions on the timing of this social security contract? That is starting on the technical work in the first quarter and revenue will star, as we get into second. It'll continue to ramp through the year. And I think we talked about the run rate when fully deployed, which will be in 2022 full run rate is $40 million to $50 million a year of revenue. And just specific to 2021 guidance, the decline in the unemployment insurance claims revenue that we gave was specifically just related to an assumed economic recovery and substantial reduction in unemployment claims. So there's no -- there's nothing behind it. Yes, so you're specifically referencing USIS, yes, and as we've talked about in the past, so the margins on mortgage specifically because of mortgage solutions are lower, right, so the two factors are obviously in mortgage solutions we buy and resell the trended file from our competitors. And then also, the score cost some mortgage are just higher than they are in any other vertical. So those two factors negatively impact our gross margin on mortgage. So yes, as mortgage grows substantially, it's a negative to the margin percentage is obviously very profitable, right. But negative to margin percentage for USIS and as mortgage declines, it's somewhat of positive. Obviously, that isn't the only factor that moves that affects margin. So I can't tell you that that's the only thing that will move them around. But as you're thinking about it, yes, that's correct"

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks Dorian. Before I address Equifax's strong fourth quarter in 2020 results, I want to take a moment to thank our 11,000 employees and families who have supported them with a tremendous dedication they showed under the challenging COVID environment during 2020. We continue to make the health and safety of our employees a top priority and I hope you and those close to you remain safe. Turning towards to slide 4, I wanted to start with a review of our business model, growth strategy and cloud investments that positions to win in the marketplace. Our highly unique and diverse data assets are at the core of Equifax's differentiation in the marketplace. We have data assets of scale that our competitors do not have. Our acquisition this week of Kount in a global identity and fraud and AccountScore for UK open banking and data categorization are examples of accelerating focus and expanding our differentiated data assets and capabilities. Expanding our differentiated data assets through organic actions, partnerships, and M&A continues to be a priority. We and our customers are benefiting from our investment over the last three years in our new Equifax cloud native technology footprint, which enabled the creation of our single data fabric and rapid implementation of best-in-class cloud based tools and capabilities. We accelerated our new product rollouts and revenue in 2020 by leveraging our new Equifax cloud and Equifax cloud native footprint is enhanced our ability to integrate new partners and acquisitions into speed the recognition of synergies, as we believe only Equifax can. Our cloud infrastructure will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace and drive our revenues and margins in the future. Data Security is deeply embedded in our culture. And we have made tremendous progress towards our goal of being an industry leader in security. We will be relentlessly focused on a customer first mentality, which moves us closer to our customers with a focus on delivering solutions to help them solve their problems and grow their businesses. And lastly, with the acquisition of Kount in our investments in the Equifax Data Fabric, we've taken substantial steps forward towards building a leading identity and fraud business while expanding our market coverage to include retail, ecommerce and transaction based markets alongside our traditional FI telco insurance markets.  Moving now to slide 5 and spoken before that key market macros that we believe are positively impacting information service industry, and Equifax. First, the dramatic acceleration of the digitization of consumer and commercial customers facing transactions and our customers' internal infrastructure with clearly accelerated during Covid, which drives rapidly growing requirements for data and insights around identity, authentication and fraud. Second, accelerating adoption of advanced analytics and machine learning is driving increasing needs for differentiated data. Third fintechs and alternative lenders are driving innovation, growing share and accelerating this digitization macro which drives data usage. Fourth, increased need for robust identity validation and fraud prevention capabilities and digital transactions is also driving data requirements. And fifth, the explosion of data drives increased requirements for data governance by our customers and control of data by consumers. These macros clearly accelerate demand for broader differentiated data assets, alternative data sources, increased requirements for data recency and integrated insights. Equifax is very well positioned to address these trends as we build on the depth of our Equifax cloud data assets, and our capabilities to deliver advanced Equifax cloud data management, and continue to leverage our Equifax cloud data and technology investments. In USIS, the depth of our assets across credit alternative credit with DataX telco and utilities with NCTUE and consumer asset data with ISI has long been Equifax strength. Workforce Solutions TWN data is our most differentiated data asset with coverage of 90 million unique individuals in the United States. EWS is expanding between data set while broadening their point focus beyond W2 income to include 1099 and other income and employment data. At the same time, EWS is broadening beyond TWN income and employment data with partnerships to deliver individuals education, licensure, and other data to our customers to use in the hiring process. With the additional Kount broad and massive scale of digital consumer data assets, including phone numbers, email and IP addresses. Equifax data assets extend substantially as your capabilities across identity and fraud globally.  Moving now to slide 6, we believe the identity validation and fraud prevention markets will deliver strong long-term growth for Equifax and that it combined Equifax and Kount are very well positioned to deliver new and differentiated solutions to this large and fast growing marketplace. E-commerce was up over 20% in 2020 alone, while online banking was up 67% and mobile wallet usage increased 56%. And fraud is a huge and growing issue with our customers transactions have shifted from cash to digital, along with increased real time payments. Online credit card fraud hit nearly $6 billion last year with 40% of ecommerce merchants reporting an increase in chargeback fraud, and over 40% of merchants say their digital fraud slows their innovation and growth. The digital market macro clearly accelerated during COVID and we see it continuing to expand. The combination of Equifax and Kount can protect these new distribution channels while evaluating high risk transactions on a real time basis. Balanced fraud with the user experience, serve as a growth platform for customer ecommerce activities while simultaneously enabling trust and confidence. Both Kount and Equifax will leverage to be extended predictability of our combined data. And Kount brings Equifax into the fast growing ecommerce and retail markets. And last, Equifax wins Kount into the banking, finance FinTech, telco and insurance markets. The scale of counter data assets, including 32 billion in your consumer interactions, 255 million identities, 400 million addresses and a billion unique devices combined with Equifax's scale data assets is a powerful combination in this fast growing market. Advanced Data Analytics, AI and machine learning capabilities are more crucial than ever before in preventing frauds. The first suite of Kount products including its next generation AI and machine learning model, combined with the cloud based Equifax Luminate platform which orchestrates multiple solutions with machine learning, and our patented NDT AI technology will provide risk managers with insights only Equifax can give across the consumer account lifecycle. Kount also provides account takeover protection and transaction dispute management, two capabilities which Equifax did not have before to address heightened cybersecurity and fraud payment activity. We were energized to close the Kount acquisition yesterday, and to have the Kount team joining Equifax and the strong growth potential the combined Kount and Equifax in the fast growing identity and fraud marketplace. As you see on slide 7, while Kount is clearly our most sizable transaction in recent years, as we ramp up our bolt-on M&A focus to expand and strengthen Equifax's capabilities and close two other transactions in recent days focused on decisioning and alternative data. We acquired the minority position we did already own of creditworks in Australia. creditworks is a low cost, flexible, modular trade credit decisioning platform that targets the SME segment, which is a key growth driver for activities in the region. In the UK we acquired AccountScore, our partner in the UK open banking solutions and a provider of bank transaction data categorization analytics and consent technology. AccountScore has also a license in the UK where open banking is accelerating. Importantly, its capabilities will be integrated into our interconnect and Ignite platforms. We're investing our 2020 outperformance and leveraging our strong balance sheet and cash generation with bolt-on M&A is central for future growth strategy. And our cloud data and technology platforms allow us to more quickly integrate acquisitions and drive synergies. Continued expansion of our data assets and capabilities through acquisitions is a priority for Equifax in 2021 and beyond. Turning now to slide 8, Equifax performance in 2020 was very strong with sequential improvements in both total and core revenue as we exited the year. Our business model is resilient in delivering in the challenging COVID recessionary environment. We're energetic about our momentum as we enter 2021. Revenue in 2020 was $4.1 billion, up 17% with organic growth of 16.3%, is the first time we've delivered over $4 billion in revenue and the highest annual organic revenue growth rate in our history. Adjusted EBITDA was just under $1.5 billion, up 25%. And EBITDA margin was 36.2%, up 240 basis points. Adjusted EPS at $6.97 was up 22%. We delivered double digit revenue growth in all four quarters of 2020 with 23% total in organic growth in the fourth quarter, a record for Equifax.  We executed on our investments to accelerate and leverage our Equifax cloud data and technology transformation, including migrating more than 47,000 customers as at the end of the year, onto our new Equifax cloud services. Leveraging is now our new cloud infrastructure we delivered a record 134 new products while decreasing our NPI development time by one third. 134 NPI, we're well in excess of the 100 anticipated coming into 2020 and above 120 we discussed with you in December. As we continue to leverage our new cloud capabilities we expect to accelerate revenue growth for new products in 2021, a key driver to our long-term growth expectations. We're energized about our 2020 performance and we're already seeing the momentum of our only Equifax model leveraging our new cloud capabilities as we move into 2021. Turning to slide 9, fourth quarter revenue at $1.12 billion was up 23% on a reported and local currency basis, which is one of our expectations in the framework of 17.5% to 20% that we shared with you in early December. M&A contributed just under 1% in the quarter. Our growth is again powered by our US b2b businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions with combined revenue of a very strong 36.6% and combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%. As a reminder, EWS and USIS are now over 70% of Equifax revenue and 80% of Equifax business unit EBITDA, their combined contribution to Equifax is up 700 basis points in revenue, and almost 750 basis points in EBITDA versus 2019, which is very powerful for the future of Equifax. Importantly, international also had a strong quarter delivering 3% revenue growth, and over 34% adjusted EBITDA margins outperforming our expectations in revenue, while maintaining strong control over costs. Fourth quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA total $422 million, up 31% with a 215 basis point expansion in our margins to 37.8%. This margin expansion was delivered while making continued investments in our cloud transformation, new products and data analytics that will drive future growth. Adjusted EPS at $2 per share was up a strong 28% versus 2019 despite incurring increased depreciation and amortization, and incremental cloud costs at $0.16 a share and increased interest expense at $0.05 a share from our second quarter bond offering. The $2 per share EPS exceeded our expectations in the framework of $1.75 to $1.85 we shared with you in early December. USIS revenue of $387 million was up a very strong 17% in the fourth quarter with M&A contributing less than 0.5%. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $153 million was up 60% in the quarter while mortgage credit inquiries grew in line with our expectations increasing 55%. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by 500 basis points driven by growth and share gains, marketing and new debt monitoring products. Non-mortgage revenue performance strengthened substantially in the quarter and was just below flat improvement from down 6% in the third quarter and down 9% in the second quarter. Importantly, non-mortgage online revenue grew slightly in the quarter versus the 5% and 11% declines we saw on the third and second quarters respectively. Banking, ID and fraud, commercial, insurance and direct-to-consumer all showed growth in fourth quarter, which is a positive sign for the future. Autos fourth quarter decline at 5% was an improvement in the third quarter decline of 7%. Non-mortgage online revenue strengthened further by 5% growth in December and 6% growth in January. Banking ID and fraud, insurance and direct-to-consumer drove the growth in December and continued into January. We also saw auto returned to positive growth in January. Financial marketing services revenue which is broadly speaking offline or data business is $70 million in the quarter down about 2% which was up sharply from the third quarter, which was down 9%. The relative improvement in the quarter was driven by double digit growth and identity and fraud related revenue. We're also seeing improving trends in marketing related revenue which was down under 10% in the quarter. As a reminder, marketing related revenue represents about 40% of FMS revenue identity and brought about 20 and risk decision about 40. USIS team continues to drive growth in their deal pipeline with the fourth quarter up 15% driven by growth in both the volume and size of new opportunities. Fourth quarter win rates finish the year at 2020 times, switching into team or on offense in the USIS and winning in the marketplace. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 43.5% in fourth quarter were down 160 basis points from last year which was principally driven by a much higher mix of mortgage revenue and mortgage products in the quarter. Margins were also impacted by redundant systems costs and investments in new products. Turning now to Workforce Solutions, they had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $406 million of a very strong 62%. EWS finished the year with revenue of $1.4 billion and extraordinary accomplishment compared to their 2019 revenue of $950 million. Customers found incredible value in Workforce Solutions unique TWN income and employment data assets and new products. While the team's focus on penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions drove growth. EWS remains our most valuable and differentiated business with revenue growth rates far in excess of the rest of Equifax and highly accretive margins. Verification service revenue and Workforce Solutions at $330 million is up 70% versus fourth quarter 2019. Verification services mortgage revenue more than doubled versus the prior year for the third quarter in a row growing almost 100 percentage points faster in the 55% growth we saw in mortgage market credit inquiries in the third quarter. Verification services non-mortgage revenue was up about 15% in the quarter up substantially from the 4% growth in third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we saw significant growth in talent solutions primarily driven by new products introduced in the second half of the year. We also saw strong growth in card and auto. In cards, we've added to two major customers that now use the work number broadly in the origination process. In auto, we're also seeing the expansion in the use of the work number in subprime loan approvals. We again saw strong growth in government verification services growth in January, continued strong levels delivered in the fourth quarter. And product services revenue of $77 million increased 35% in the quarter driven again by Unemployment Claims business which had revenue of over $50 million, up 73% compared to last year. In the fourth quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 2.6 million initial claims which are down from the 3.4 million in the third quarter. EWS continue to process roughly one in five US initial unemployment claims. And as a reminder, we expect our UC claims revenue to decline in 2021 as initial Unemployment Claims reduced from record 2020 levels. Employee services, non UC claims business and revenue down about 6% in the quarter, strong revenue growth in I-9 and onboarding services that driven by the acceleration of our new online Anywhere solutions is more than offset by declines in workforce analytics and our tax credits business. We're seeing a positive shift to our new online Anywhere product suite the new customer wins at much higher price points. We expect employee services nine UC business revenue performance in the first quarter to improve relative to fourth quarter and returned to growth in the second quarter as we move towards a more normal environment. Strong EWS verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 56.2%, which was an over 900 basis point expansion from the prior year, which reflects the power and uniqueness of the TWN dataset.  Turning down now to international, their revenue of $242 million is up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, a significant milestone is the business unit returned to growth after very challenging second and third quarters. This was nicely above our expectations from early December. Asia Pacific which is principally our Australian business had very good performance in the fourth quarter with revenue of $77 million, up about 4% in local currency versus last year and better than yet slightly we expected in early December. Australia consumer revenue was down about 5% versus last year, a significant improvement from the down 10% we saw in the third quarter. Our commercial businesses combined online and offline revenue in Australia is up 3% in the quarter. Again, a nice improvement from the up about 1% in third quarter. And fraud and identity was up almost 20% in the fourth quarter. European revenues of $79 million were up 4% in local currency in the quarter, our European credit business was down about 3%. A significant improvement from the down 7% we saw in the third quarter. The improvement was driven by Spain which saw revenue growth of 7% in the quarter. UK revenue was down about 8% in the quarter similar to third quarter. Our European debt management business grew about 20% local currency in the fourth quarter as the UK Government restarted collections activity in late September. However, following the COVID measures put in place in late in the fourth quarter by the UK Government to address the pandemic, debt collections were again halted late in the year. We expect debt management revenue to decline in the order of 10% in the first quarter reflecting these actions but to improve once vaccine are more widely distributed and we return to a more normal mode. Latin American revenues of $46 million declined about 2% in fourth quarter in local currency in line with what we expected, which was a significant improvement from the down 6% we saw in the third quarter. Positively Chile, a largest country in Latin America delivered revenue growth in the quarter. But America continues to benefit from the expansions at Ignite and the migration of customers to our global cloud based interconnects SaaS decisioning platform. And we're also seeing the benefit of the strong new product introductions in the region over the past three years. Canada revenue of $41 million was up about 3% in local currency in the fourth quarter, which was also a positive. Consumer online was down just over 5% in the quarter similar to the third quarter, improving growth in analytic and decision solutions ideally broad drove the growth in Canadian revenue in the quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 33.8% were up 150 basis points sequentially, but down 260 basis points from last year. It declined versus fourth quarter last year was principally driven by redundant systems cost from cloud investments in low income and minority investments. Global consumer solutions revenue at $76.9 million was down 13% reported in local currency basis in the quarter as we expected. Global consumer solutions performance was very strong in our Consumer Direct benefits channel and events states businesses, and they collectively grew over 10% on a combined basis in the fourth quarter. The decline in overall GCS revenue in the fourth quarter was driven by our US lead generation partner businesses. As we discussed previously, our US lead generation partner revenue was significantly impacted by the COVID recession that began in the second quarter. The declines in this revenue increasing through the fourth quarter as banking customers cut back on lead gen spending. Accordingly, we expect declines in total GCS revenue in the first quarter just over 50% similar to fourth quarter levels. We expect a decline in total GCS revenue due to lead generation declines to moderate substantially as we move into the second quarter. Our global Consumer Direct business, the business in which we sell directly to consumers through Equifax.com which represents about half of total GCS revenues was up strong 9% in fourth quarter, the highest growth rate since 2017. Our North American Consumer Direct Business revenue was up a solid 10% versus last year, and we continue to see sequential subscriber growth in the US and Canada, our two largest markets. Our GCS Consumer Direct business will principally complete migrating their customers onto the new cloud based platform renaissance in the first quarter. This will allow for a new field focus on new product and service introductions to consumers in the second half of 2021. Our benefits channel and events based businesses which now represent about 10% of global consumer also delivered about 30% growth in the quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.9% were down about 610 basis points principally reflecting the increased platforms spend as they complete their cloud systems migrations, increase marketing spend to drive future direct revenue, and the lower lead generation partner revenue we talked about. Slide 10 provides an updated view of Equifax core revenue growth. As a reminder, core revenue growth is defined as Equifax revenue growth, excluding number one, extraordinary revenue growth in our unemployment claims business in 2020, and 2021. And number two, the impact on revenue from the US mortgage market activity as measured by changes in total, US mortgage market credit inquiries. Core revenue growth is our attempt to provide a more normalized view of Equifax revenue growth to you, excluding these UC and US mortgage market factors. In the fourth quarter Equifax core revenue growth, the green section on the bars on slide 10, was up a very strong 11%. This is up to significantly from the 6% core revenue growth we delivered in third quarter due to strong Workforce Solutions in USIS outperformance where they continue to deliver mortgage revenue growth rates well in excess of US mortgage market credit inquiries, and a significant improvement in revenue performance from our non-mortgage business in the US, as well as the return to growth in international. A critical level in our ability to deliver high levels of core revenue growth is our deep and broad array of new products and solutions for the US mortgage market. And the ability to constantly outgrow -- consistently outgrow the underlying market. Slide 11 highlights the strong core growth performance and mortgage for our US b2b mortgage businesses Workforce Solutions and USIS. EWS in the USIS outgrew their underlying US mortgage market significantly in 2020, with a combined core growth of 37%. This outperformance was driven strongly by Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, with core growth at 80% in 2020, which exceeded mortgage market growth rates by an outstanding 80 points during the year. The key drivers of the strong EWS outperformance include increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates, new products and records.  EWS has a long history of outgrowing their underlying markets. USIS also delivered strong core revenue growth mortgage in 2020, the growth exceeding the market by 8% driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions, with further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow underlying markets is core to our business model in a substantial strength that should continue to benefit Equifax in 2021 and in the future. Turning now to slide 12; Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding results and is clearly our strongest and most valuable business. Workforce Solutions total revenue grew sequentially during 2020 to 62% in the fourth quarter, and 51% for the year. More importantly, core revenue growth also accelerated throughout 2020 with core growth at 37% in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter and 27% for the year. This outperformance and sequential improvements reflects the uniqueness of between data and the power of the Workforce Solutions business model. Rudy Porter and his team have built a business with strong, long-term growth levers and they continue to demonstrate the value of their scale and differentiated TWN income and employment data, is depth breadth and scale of between database and over 20,000 customer verification network and value of the Workforce Solutions and core service offerings are driving substantial growth in value. In 2020, Workforce Solutions reached 114 million active TWN records an increase of 10 million active records during a difficult period of high US unemployment. Of these 114 million active records over 60% are contributed directly by employers to Workforce Solutions that the team has built up over the past decade. The remaining 40% are contributed through partnerships, many of which are exclusive. Also in 2020, TWN reached over 1 million in core contributors, a significant milestone. As we have a dedicated team focused on TWN record additions and expects to add records again in 2021. Just last week, we signed a new exclusive partnership with a major payroll provider, that we'll be integrating their payroll system with Equifax with their work number later this year. As we're able to monetize record additions instantly from our strong network over 20,000 verification customers. And of course, the uniqueness of the TWN data. Rudy and his team continue to rapidly expand the number of mortgage companies and financial institutions with whom we have built real time system to system integrations. As we talked previously, those derive more usage of our TWN data. In mortgage for example, full 65% mortgage transactions are now system to system Workforce Solutions. These integrations are now extending into our verticals, as well as across our growing government business. We also expect our new verification solution for the Social Security Administration to go online in the first half of this year, which will deliver incremental revenue for Workforce Solutions. The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding with new products across mortgage. channel solutions, government, and I-9, a new product revenue expected to increase substantially in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, Workforce Solutions verification service infrastructure will be fully cloud native, also providing the industry's leading cloud native data and technology platform that will further accelerate data ingestion, massive additions of employee contributors to the clean database, and new product capabilities to this unique and scale TWN data asset. In slide 13, I'd like to turn into 2021 and discuss some of the favorable market and macro trends that I alluded to earlier. Before Covid, the macro trends on the left hand side of the slide had already begun to manifest themselves. As I discussed earlier, COVID driven a rapid acceleration of digital and online consumer interactions, improve real time decisioning require more complete, and more recent information from the broader set of data assets, including alternative data sets has become even more critical. This is required to reduce friction in consumer transactions while ensuring certainty of identities and minimizing credit and fraud risk. Effectively utilizing these expanded requirements for data decisioning has accelerated the need for advanced analytics, including machine learning, as well as the need for effective data governance including the ability to provide consumers with acquired control, and seamless delivery of these capabilities continues to advance. High Performance is always been table stakes in the space that we play in. Given these accelerating and continuing trends, the implications for Equifax are that the gain for our unique datasets and integrated insights has never been stronger, including those involving our powerful TWN income, income and employment data. Our ID and fraud prevention solutions and those include news acquired from Kount target ecommerce and retail space, our trust enhancing, thereby improving the overall digital experience for consumers. I'll now hand it over to John to provide our 2021 guidance, and I'll come back to wrap up. Thanks, John. Turning to slide 19; we made significant progress on our cloud data technology transformation in the second half of last year. Progressing through the data product and customer migration stages of our North American technology transformation. The pace of product and customer migrations continues to accelerate and as of year end 2020, USIS completed over 12,000 customer migrations onto cloud based services including our Intertech Ignite and API capabilities. And Workforce Solutions also completed over 26,000 customer migrations and verification services onto its cloud based portals in online fulfillment platforms. This represents over 95% of the workforce solution verification services customer base. As we discussed earlier, global consumer will complete migration of all Consumer Direct customers onto its transform Renaissance platform over the next several months. Across North America, we need to remain on track to have our US customer migrations completed principally during 2021. Our North American exchange migrations also continue to progress well toward our 2021 goals, including our major North American exchanges of the US and Canadian consumer risk, the work number and NCTUE exchanges. In 2021, we're accelerating strange migration to the data pack, Europe, LATAM and Asia Pacific. Europe and Latin America I've already made substantial progress in deploying interconnect, ignite in our API frameworks in the cloud. And as of 2020, as of the end of the year, international had migrated over 9,000 customers onto cloud based services. In 2021, our focus is on product and customer migration to accelerate the decommissioning of legacy systems and data centers to deliver the customer benefits in Equifax cost savings. We will continue to ramp our focus on delivering new products, and NPI revenue by leveraging our new cloud native data and technology infrastructure. 2021 is a critical year as we drive toward completion of our North American transformation. We remain committed to achieving the substantial top and bottom line benefits from the cloud we discussed with you previously. The Equifax cloud native data Intech infrastructures providing meaningful benefits in the marketplace today, and that will even further differentiate Equifax as we complete the transformation.  Turning out a slide 20; this highlights our continued focus on new product innovation, which is a key component of the next chapter of growth at Equifax as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation and new products. We continue to focus on transforming our company into a product led organization and powered by the best-in-class cloud native data technology to fuel our top line growth. In 2020, we further invested in NPI resources while leveraging our new Equifax cloud capabilities to deliver 134 new products above the 120 we discussed in December in our historical 70 to 90 NPIs annually. Importantly, in 2020, over 50% of the new products were delivered leveraging our cloud native data and technology.  In our December investor update, we shared with you several products introduced in 2020 that will have the opportunity to drive significant revenue in 2021 and beyond. Response Confidence, watched by USIS, offers tools that empower our customers to enable consumers to share alternative data that's currently available in credit reports. USIS also launched OneView, a configurable consumer report that will allow consumer credit data to be combined with any other Equifax consumer data asset, to create an easily consumable and configurable multi data asset report. In the first quarter, OneVew will incorporate TWN income employment data along with consumer credit and our other differentiated Equifax data assets. Workforce Solutions continues to expand its suite of new products focused on the hiring process. Our new Talent Select suite of VOE solutions products provide easy access to all or a subset of workforce solution data on a candidate across varying price points with fulfillment based pricing. In mortgage Workforce Solutions has launched new products that support lenders need to combine the TWN employment and income data to tax return data. The new product simplifies lenders processes by providing individual or multiple borrower information per loan via a single transaction from Equifax. In Employer Services our I-9 Anywhere product creates a more efficient and low touch onboarding experience. The product allows a new hire to initiate their application from any device such as a phone, tablet or computer via our I-9 app the new hire then schedules the completion of their application from a nationwide network of over 1,300 locations at a convenient time and location of their choice. The I-9 Anywhere products improves accessibility for employees and off site locations, streamlines paperwork and improves and speeds up the onboarding experience for the employee, hiring managers and human resource professionals. With our strong new product launches in 2020, we expect to accelerate our NPI revenue growth in 2021. As many of our NPI revenue is defined as the revenue delivered by new products launched over the prior three years. And our vitality index is defined as the percentage of current year revenue from new products. In 2021, we expect NPI revenue to increase by over 75% with our vitality index, exceeding 7%, which is up substantially for the past three years. Continued expansions of innovation products leveraging the Equifax cloud are central to our strategy and future growth priorities.  Wrapping up in slide 21, Equifax finished a challenging 2020 COVID environment with record revenue and earnings and strong momentum as we enter 2021. Our 11% core growth in the fourth quarter reflects the strength of our business model. Our estimated 6.6% growth in 2021 at the midpoint of our range, while still in the midst of the COVID recession reflects the resiliency, strength and momentum of the Equifax business model. We are delivering this growth in the context of our expectations that we see economic recovery in the second quarter, and that US mortgage market activity declined 5% in the second half. Core revenue growth of over 10% in 2021 reflects the strength of our business model as new products and expansion of our data assets allow us to outperform in a still uncertain, global environment. Workforce Solutions will continue to power Equifax as operating performance in 2021. Work numbers is our most differentiated data asset and Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business. And likely we will see that Workforce Solutions become our largest business in the very near future. Rudy and his team are driving outsized growth by focusing on their key levers, new records, new products, penetration and expansion into new verticals. We also expect our USIS mortgage business to continue to outgrow the underlying mortgage market. And we are energized by the outlook for USIS' non mortgage performance and momentum from the fourth quarter from both organic growth and new products and the growth we expect from Kount. USIS is competitive and winning in the marketplace and will deliver in 2021. Internationals return to growth in the fourth quarter is a little positive and we expect that to continue in 2021 as their underlying markets recover. We were encouraged by improving conditions across our international portfolio and we expect the international to outperform these underlying markets. We're also turning the corner; we're turning the corner from building our cloud capabilities to leveraging our new Equifax cloud data and technology to drive innovation, new products and growth. We remain confident in the significant top line cost and cash benefits from our new cloud capabilities. These financial benefits start to ramp in 2021 and are enabled by our always on stability, speed to market and the ability to rapidly build and move products around the globe. Our strong operating performance, strong balance sheet and Equifax cloud data and technology platforms position us to enhance our capability via M&A. We are building our acquisition pipeline as we pursue accretive bolt-on transactions that will strengthen the core of Equifax and meet our stringent mutual criteria. And given our very strong financial performance, our strong cash generation in 2020 and our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the future of Equifax, we are restarting our share repurchase program at an expected level of over $100 million in 2021 to offset dilution from employee benefit plans. We view this as a positive step forward in returning cash to shareholders. While the COVID recession and recovery is still uncertain, we have a lot of confidence in our business model and our ability to perform. We have strong momentum on all fronts as we move into 2021. Equifax is outperforming in the challenging COVID recessionary environment. We are on often in position to leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation of new products to drive future growth, margins and cash generation as a market leading data analytics internet technology company. With hat operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes, we believe in we talked about it that the workforce is clearly our most differentiated business. And when we talked about the strong performance in 2020 that follows from performance in 2017-2018 and 2019. So they've got a long history of growth and have a lot of levers for growth. I don't think we want to get into specific guidance around workforces revenue growth, except that we expect it to outgrow their underlying markets again in 2021. And as we said, we expect that to be in double digit. And we also said it will be for sure the highest growing business inside of Equifax. The levers that workforce has in front of it. And at the top of the list is their ability to add records. That's a very powerful lever and as you know we added records throughout 2020. Those are monetized right out of the chute as soon as we add them to our database. And of course, year-over-year basis those record additions drive revenue growth in 2021. And I think we also stated that we expect to grow records quite confidently in 2021. We added the large agreement we signed just last week with a large payroll processor for an exclusive agreement to contribute their records to Equifax. So that's going to help drive our record growth going forward. On the verifications, clearly they aren't the strongest and largest part of Equifax and the highest margin part. But as you point out talent solutions, it's something we're also excited about, we expect to see some recovery and elements of that business as the market improves, and the economy improves kind of post vaccine. Now we're targeting that kind of second quarter and going into third and fourth. But underlying there, we've got some really impressive growth from our I-9 solution. And we talked about the quality I-9 Anywhere that is really got a lot of traction, because of the uniqueness of the solution. And of course it drives a much higher revenue solution for Equifax. Anything else you'd add John? And as a reminder, we've talked many times during 2020 on our calls with you about the new solution, that workforce is rolling out with the Social Security Administration, and they're talking about that being at run rate of $40 million or $50 million a year contract, and that's going to ramp during our 2021, then becomes a full vendor in 2022. That's a very attractive addition to the business and just reflects, again, the uniqueness of the scale of the data set, and the uniqueness of the data itself. Yes, I don't think we need to invest just to keep margins at a certain level, we invest where we see accretive returns for our shareholders, when it comes to internal investments, and we've been doing that quite substantially, I think, over the last three years, and even in 2020, we reinvested that quite substantially in the workforce in the USIS whether it was obviously in the cloud transformation investments, but then new products and new D&A assets, investing in new record additions, so we'll continue to invest. With regards to is there a ceiling on there? I think that's a tough question to answer, it's one that we see a long one way of growth potential for Workforce Solutions. I think I talked about what our expectation workforce will becomes, sometime in the near future, our largest business unit, which is, we think, quite attractive for Equifax, and for our shareholders, because of its highly accretive nature of its revenue growth, as well higher accretive nature of its margins. Yes, so slide 18, we indicate that included in the 2021 guidance, there's about 1.2 points from acquisitions. Right, so if you think about Kount, Kount revenue, we don't have Kount revenue for the entire year, it just closed. And because of that, it's about 1.2 points. So the inorganic revenue is 1.2%, is that covered? It hasn't, Andrew, December call is only a few weeks ago, I think, we still think that's the right guidance for where Equifax is going to perform to 10.5% in organic growth from the business, there's still, as you know, a lot of uncertainties in the COVID recovery, we're betting on it starting in the second quarter, we've already seen some of it in December, January. So I think that's positive towards that assumption that we have and of course, our assumption is that the mortgage market, while still very strong would decline in the second half of 2021. So I think we've got the right guidance. And I think the momentum we have in the fourth quarter; we can support that 10.5%. Yes, it's a great question. And we talked about that, we really believe fundamental to our strategy is to really leverage our cloud investments, which we think are incredibly powerful, both on the technology and data side for innovation and new products. And we talked throughout 2020, we invested more in product resources to really start driving that leverage of the cloud investments, as we focus, when completing the cloud transformation, but more importantly, leveraging it. And as you point out, 134, is a really big increase from our historical product rollouts. And, of course, those rollouts are in the marketplace now, meaning that our commercial teams are starting to take those to market. So that's embedded in our core growth assumption for 2021, which is up substantially from where it was for growth in 2018, and 2019. And actually, up from our historical, kind of pretty, cyber growth rates and NPIs are clearly going to be a big factor in that. In my comment, I mentioned that, I think it was 50% of our NPI during 2020, we're really leveraging the cloud as we move into 2021, that'll be substantially all of our new products, which will speed up our delivery of new products, speed up the time of getting them into the marketplace, and then also drive the number of products that we want to bring to the market. And we have been given assumption or a target for the number of new products for 2021. I think we were clear about our vitality index, which really drives the organic growth among products have been quite substantial 7% in 2021. So that's a clear lever for growth for us. And we think this is, as we get out in 2021, 2022, 2023, this is really central to where we're taking the company is really leveraging the cloud transformation to drive revenue growth, and that's going to happen through innovation and new products. I think your question was about the buyback. But I didn't hear the rest of it. What was your question? We tend to start the buyback quite quickly. And we'll lever load that through the year. We think that's a positive step forward and reflects our confidence in the future of Equifax. And we think it's a positive step forward to start with a buyback, that will offset dilution to our employee plans, and again, it reflects our confidence in the future of Equifax and is the first step forward in returning cash to shareholders. I think it's a great question, Tony, I think you have to really separate USIS and EWS. Workforce Solutions for both businesses are taking advantage of new products in the mortgage space and rolling out new products in an up market is positive and rolling up new products in a down market is positive. So I think that's one, they both have the ability to grow share, meaning, grow new customers and, Workforce Solutions has more capability there just because the Workforce Solutions data is less used, using mortgage as example than the credit filer, and then workforce has just more leverage than USIS has and its ability to grow in all markets and you've seen that, not only in 2020 you've seen it in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. And you've also seen it accelerate, they're not, if their core growth, if you will, over the last year and that's driven by a more rapid increase in records, we think it's driven by the scale of the database, when you have hit rates that are north of 50% on the TWN data that becomes increasingly valuable to customers. So that's driving usage of the data, the value of predictability of income and employment data, there's just a lot more levers there. So we've got a lot of confidence in both businesses ability to outgrow the market that's underlying what Equifax does. But I think it's safe to say workforce just has a lot more leverage, and you add records on top of, as you know, adding records in an upper down market is what we do, and we added 10 million records last year, or did you know we had some records leave the database as employment was reduced by some of our contributors, so that was offset from that. And in a improving economic environment, we would expect to see hiring improved, with lots of our contributors, which is also going to drive records, along with actions like the announcement that we shared this morning that we signed another big payroll processor to an exclusive agreement, so new products are going to help both businesses, and we've got a lot of confidence in our ability going forward, to outgrow underlying markets because of the uniqueness of our data on new products and penetration, new usage, and of course, workforce with records. Yes, we would argue that regulators have been quite strong for a long time including during the Trump administration, Equifax, of course, and our competitors operated through the Obama administration, when there was a level of very strong regulation, going into Biden administration, we don't expect meaningful changes, whatever they got we'll respond to them, we play an important role in the marketplace. We've been highly regulated for a long time, and we know what it takes to operate in a regulated environment. I think that's an important characteristic that we have to respond to. And we believe we'll be able to respond to the interest that the regulators have. There's another question on the legislative side is there going to be any changes legislatively around credit bureaus? And so we don't think that we provide a valuable service. And we're focused on ensuring access to credit through alternative data, which is a big priority of the current administration, and we think we have a strong response to that. Yes. Of course Equifax has a sizable identity fraud business. We talked a bunch about the market macro, which we think is very attractive, as digitization increases identity and authentication, really is a critically important thing that was happening pre COVID, it was accelerated during COVID, we think it's only going to continue to grow. So we like the macro space, which is why we've been in it for quite some time. And the idea of adding Kount has been on our radar for quite some time. But we know we knew Kount for four or five years. We've watched them and had the opportunity to acquire them and close the deal yesterday. And what Kount brings is that you're really combining with our differentiated data assets and identity and fraud, really just a massive increase in data capabilities signals. The 32 billion interactions they have per year are just massive and the number of addresses, IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses. just enhances the capabilities to provide higher predictability. And so the combination of Kount data with Equifax data is going to enhance Kount in the retail and ecommerce space and also enhance Equifax in our traditional spaces. And we'll this week; we're already off to the races of bringing Kount solutions to our banking and lending customers, for example. The other thing attracted to us with Kount is it moves Equifax into a new industry vertical, we were never in the retail and ecommerce space and Kount lives there quite strongly. And then as you pointed out, they have some really attractive technology beyond their data. If you combine a lot of their patent and technology capabilities, along with Equifax is including our patented AI technology NDT, we think that's another powerful combination. So we're very energized about the acquisition; excited to have it closed yesterday. And now we're off to the races, as of yesterday afternoon of integrating and really moving to the market and driving the synergies that were part of our acquisition model, as we get the business up and rolling as an Equifax company. Yes, we're not ready to put our long-term framework back in place, but I can tell you we're getting to that stage, I would expect it will be something we certainly want to do in 2021. We'd like to see a little more, a few more months under our belt of this COVID recovery to make sure we see that. But I hope you get a sense that our confidence in the Equifax model is quite high. When we look at a core growth in 2020 and the core growth expectation we have for 2021 that's a very meaningful number for us. It's one that we have a lot of confidence in, and we will be ready to share our long-term framework sometime in 2021. But I hope you get a sense that the power of Workforce Solutions, obviously, it needs to be a larger part of Equifax is a positive for our core growth. The new product focus that we have, we've been very consistent with you over the past couple of years is that it's our expectation that the cloud investments that we've made will not only drive our margins and cash, but will also drive our top line is we're able to deliver new solutions we couldn't do before and really drive our new products. So those are all positives from our perspective, and how we think of the long term, growth rate of the company, and we'll be ready to share that with you in the coming future. We've not. We haven't seen any kind of commercial traction on that yet. We expect there will be but at the same time, we've got a lot of confidence in the scale of a Workforce Solutions business model, the 20,000 verification customer network that we have, it's taken a decade to build, our database is multiples of what we believe our competitors will ever be able to access given the scale of our additions. And as a reminder, of the 114 million actives we have 60% of those we've done with individual companies over a decade, it takes a long time to build that database. We also had a database that has 350 million total records including inactive and a third, close to a third of our revenue comes from inactive records, which is another characteristic is very unique to workforce solutions. So we've got a high confidence in our business model. And as we shared on this call, we signed an exclusive arrangement with another large payroll processor just last week, that's going to be coming between and they came to TWN, because of the scale of our capabilities, and what we can deliver for them, and what they can deliver to their customers. And then, of course, the revenue share opportunity, it's a very meaningful with Equifax. And it's more challenged when you're in a start up mode. You nailed it, it's really the economic recovery, it's their customer, who are primarily card issuers, P loan originators, having more confidence in building their originations, what we believe many big card companies are doing is, using their own modeling to generate new customers now, and I would characterize more cautiously and we're seeing that in our revenue directly with card companies, while it's improving, they're so cautious in this uncertain economic environment. And when you're cautious, I ran a credit card business for 10 years, you're going to be careful about, who you use for lead gen, lead gen generally focus on your own versus buying leads from someone else. So it's our expectation that as the economy improves, and as we move past the COVID pandemic to whatever the new normal is, our view is that we're starting to see that in the latter part of 2020, for sure in our non mortgage businesses and continuing in January, but that'll also show up, for our lead generation customers, and their revenue will grow. So I'm going to make sure I understand the query, I think you're asking about the difference between the framework we provided in December, and the guidance we just provided, is that correct? You're just coming through that. I apologize. So we performed much better in December than we expected, right. So our revenue came in very strong. So I understand that you're talking about a growth rate off of our much stronger 2020 performance. But our view of 2021 right is actually slightly better than it was when we talked to you in December. And we took -- we increased the bottom and top end of our range by $75 million. And that reflects Kount. It reflects some FX benefits. But it also reflects the fact that we continue to believe there's substantial risk in the timing of the recovery. So that's really what it is. So yes, we have a stronger December than we expected. So 2020 was very, very good. But our view of 2021 is actually slightly better than it was when we talked to you in December. Yes, Manav, as you probably know from prior discussions, the bulk of our relationships are exclusive. And we think that's the right arrangement between us and our partners. The partners really think having one relationship is the way to operate. And they believe that brings more value to their customer base Remember, if you're -- easy example of a payroll processor, this is not a core activity for you. But by providing the income and employment verification services to their customers, they're providing a new value added service, from a company like Equifax, they deliver that service to their customers, which are primarily their processing payroll for free, so becomes more valuable, and in our case, we just have more scale for their employees, meaning, we can access 20,000 different mortgage originators, auto originator, car originators, meaning, we can deliver more value to them than a startup could, which is why their desire around exclusive is more important. I think the scale of Equifax and Workforce Solutions also plays into it, the history we have over a decade of providing income and employment verification, the security in debt controls we have around privacy, around how the data is used is also a big part of the discussion for our partners, because they want to make sure they protect their customers data, always play into why the bulk of our relationships are exclusive and why this one is too. Yes, so it's gone well, we launched a couple years ago, we've got a couple of products in the marketplace. We're still building out some of the technology but Will and I have a monthly call with the team to talk about progress. And we still believe that that's going to be positive for Equifax and for Syco. So we're very committed to it. And we're continuing to look for more solutions that we might do together that would leverage both Equifax and Syco. No. I think you are thinking about it the right way. And it really depends on the customer. If you think about the larger, more sophisticated customers, they have very sophisticated, typically analytics teams. We still help them with analytic solutions, whether it's scores or models for them, but they do a lot of that themselves, so that they would be more of a data consumer, but with a supplement of advanced analytics from Equifax, and as you go down, in the scale of customers, you quickly get into customers that are really looking for more turnkey solutions from us, meaning a full product, and that would be new products and the scores, new solutions, they really they can plug in as opposed to try to create themselves. And that's why the capabilities we have, first and foremost, continuing to expand our differentiated data assets is clearly at the heart of what we want to do. And now that we have that data in the cloud, and a single data fabric, it allows us and our customers to more easily access that data, in our case, to deliver analytic solutions that are just much more sophisticated and have multi data elements to it, that we think will be quite powerful like going forward. And you're starting to see that, ramp and NPIs last year, the 134, we delivered is really a good example of our focus on bringing those solutions to market. It's again depends on the size of the company. There's a lot of companies leverage their sourcing relationships to try to package everything they do, which from our case, we view is advantageous in most cases, because of the particularly the strength of TWN. If you're bringing in that in the commercial relationship, it's just a very valuable data asset. There are still a lot of customers that buy by product line, that's who we interact with. And that's who we're working and bringing solutions to. We're bringing different solutions to the mortgage business unit inside of a financial institution than we are to the auto or card or P loan. So it does vary on what we're bringing from analytics as well as product capability. So it is varied by customer. So I think when we talk in December right, we indicated that we would expect to see some decline in tech transformation expense by quarter as we go through the year. And you can see that because the $45 million in the first quarter is obviously more than 25% of the total that we gave. So we will -- you'll see a decline in our tech transformation expense as we go through the year. And I think if we get into talking to more fully about 2022, we can talk about whether there could be additional right sizing costs that could come. But there would be nothing included in our guidance. Yes, great question. Open banking is as you know is really getting some traction in many markets, like the UK and Australia. And in all of our markets, we have partnerships like in the United States, we have a partnership like with Yodlee, around consented data, and we've got a partnership in Canada, we got another one in Australia and our partner in the UK with AccountScore, and there was an opportunity to acquire them, which we thought was very strategic, and very strategic for our UK business. And we also believe, as you point out that there's going to be some capabilities around categorization, assets that they have and capability and some of their technology that we may be able to use in other markets on a global basis. So we as you might imagine, we're adding customers during 2020, as we normally do, in Workforce Solutions, and Employer Services, and we provide, we have a lot of value added services that are beneficial in some regards to macro, when a company is struggling, they look for ways to improve their efficiencies, and by outsourcing to Equifax, some of those activities to workforce solutions, there's a positive there for them. So that was clearly part of our focus in 2020 it will continue in 2021. And then, of course, the big macro is less employees or reducing employees, generally is lower activity for our broader services business. And as we seen some pickup, we expect that to continue in 2021, as the COVID recovery unfolds, that'll be a positive for that business. And then on top of that, we talked about some of the products stuff that we're doing like the I-9 Anywhere is really a very, very strong growth just because the uniqueness of the solution, allowing a prospective employee to complete that process remotely, was a positive during COVID. But it's also positive, longer term, it just is faster, they don't have to come to the HR office, and we can do that so many different locations, that really drives speed and a lot of employers want to get employees on the floor or into the warehouse quickly. And this capability really helps drive that speed element. I think we gave some decent framework in 2022; you've seen and what we expect the savings to be, we haven't -- we're not ready to give 2022 guidance. I think we were clear in December. We have been all year that we expect the tax savings to enhance our margin but we also expect to continue to invest in Equifax going forward, whether it's a new products or other priorities. And when we're -- when we share our long-term growth framework, we'll get a real framework on that, on the long-term basis, and will certainly walk you from 2021 to 2022 to long-term growth framework that we will be putting back in place. Yes, it's a latter, we're talking to all of them and providing dating services to them, they still have to do a level of underwriting is anyone who would if you're going to extend credit. And for us, we view it as a positive, macro meaning that there's more lending in essence this is a buy now pay later is a lending. Now that's positive for Equifax because we can help them it's authentication as a part of that you have to verify to the individuals who they say they are, and there's an element of underwriting that takes place. And then there's another piece around that data. And we're working with that ecosystem to collect that data, so we can add it to our existing data in order to help them in their processes. Correct. That's our intention with this first step in our buyback program was to offset share dilution from employee plans, and we think it's a show of confidence hopefully you do it that way by Equifax, as a step forward in our confidence in the future. I think I shared that with earlier question, I don't know if you caught that. So you hit obviously very important points for the partnership. But it's also really important Jeff to understand that this is a very important relationship because it's a relationship between the partner called payroll processor and their customer meaning accompany the HR manager, and there's a lot of trust around that. So there's also an element of who you're going to partner with, and what's their history of being in the space, the fact that we have a million companies contributing to us, and they're just 60% of the data assets that we have, we've gone to company by company to collect that history plays in that conversation, very, very strongly meaning that we've done it, we do it well, we protect the privacy. And then there's also the scale to the employee. Remember, this is a real benefit for a company's employees to help them with their financial lives, how they access credit. And if you look at the alternative that payroll processors companies today, their customers, they're doing that verification individually by the HR manager, there's a lack of privacy. There's a lot of work involved. How do you know if a mortgage company calling that HR manager at that small company to verify the income and employment of one of their employees? We do that a lot for them, so it's a very important relationship. So the value added service and the idea of having two companies do it versus one our conversation with our partners is there's not a lot of interest in that, for the economic reasons you raise, but I would argue more importantly, because of the scale of Equifax, the scale of Workforce Solutions, the scale of our privacy and data capabilities, our business model and how we operate, that is as important or more important than the revenue share, which of course, we believe it's very hard to compete with Equifax from a revenue share standpoint. It includes the impact of acquisitions and FX. Although on that slide, we did give you what those impacts are. Right, yes. We always break them down every quarter. Yes, we don't think so. Given the scale of our capability, remember, it's quite important that only 40% of our data records and of course it is 40%, come through this partnership model. 60% are individual companies that we've added over a decade. And that takes a lot of effort to add those going into a company, convincing them you have the capabilities. And of course, we do it every day; we're adding companies every week, individually, at the same time, as we're working on these larger partnerships with payroll processors. So that scale really gives we believe Equifax a real advantage in what we delivered to our customers, and then also how a contributor meaning whether it's a company or a partnership, like payroll processor thinks about working with someone like Equifax, just because of the scale of our capabilities. And we're showing pretty clearly that we're expanding that scale, 10 million record additions last year, the conversation we had earlier about a very large, they will processor moving forward with us on an exclusive basis later this year. There's a real momentum there for the business going forward. And then the other element that I think as you know is that we're going beyond that W2, we want to expand to 1099 and self employed and gig employees. So there's a lot of work on that by Equifax there that it's just another vertical data records for us, that we think is quite attractive. And we talked also about even moving beyond our attention to move beyond income employment and look for other data records that are a part of that hiring process. As whether it's licensure or other data records. No, these are companies that are highly automated. We talked in a couple of questions on this call about the sensitivity they have, they're in the business of processing payroll and other services for the HR manager, that's their core business, and they want to make sure that if we're going to partner with someone on income and employment verification, that they're doing it with someone who's going to deliver real value to their customers, that's going to be done securely with real privacy. In course, we've been in this business for a decade. And then also the idea of a revenue share because of our scale, we can monetize those records, quite broadly across, the 20,000 verification customers we have that becomes an advantage in a relationship. Yes, so I don't think we're going to get a lot more detailed in the 10.5% that we provided but what could happen as we move through the year right, as we've talked about the fact that we expect underlying economies to improve. So we expect our non mortgage revenue growth to improve meaningfully as we go through 2021. So you'll see non mortgage be a substantially larger contributor to core revenue growth as you move through the year. So that is we do expect that to occur, and we think that's one of the contributors to the fact that we'll be able to deliver very nice core revenue growth, even in a declining mortgage market. So you're talking about comment on the December 7 call? So I think what we expect is what I just said, right, is we're expecting to see very nice improvement in our non mortgage revenue, not just in the US, not just EWS and USIS but also internationally. And I think that will provide substantially more contribution to core revenue growth in 2021. That's a tough one, we're not economists obviously. And we're certainly not build to forecast that we tried to be really transparent with you and our investors in all throughout 2020, in the December call just went through and, tried to take all the forecasts that are out there from NBA and Black Knight and others and, bring it together in something that felt reasonable. We still think that feels reasonable that there will be a decline, certainly at some point. you could spend a long time on this call talking about the positives and negatives that might drive that obviously, low interest rates are positive. I think the Fed's position is positive. Where the COVID recovery is going, it feels a little more uncertain which is obviously a part of our forecast for guidance for 2021? And we still feel good about that framework, which is why we shared it in December and we haven't really changed it as we sit here now in February, and we still think it's the right way to start the year is we think about guidance for Equifax. So just to be clear, I think the commentary was specific around online. Okay, not around total. And if all I was trying to indicate is that basically the trend was improving through the fourth quarter, and we saw a nice performance in December and effectively, it's continuing in January, that's all. There's no question that there's an element of economic improvement or consumer activity by our customers. There's no question there and we talked about that in third quarter result kind of steps forward in the fourth quarter, and that's really continuing. And then on top of that we're in the marketplace, whether we're trying to gain share or roll out new products, that's a positive element on that also, but certainly underlying that is economic activity. So we will post shortly in five minutes updated views of revenue by vertical for every business, you get an echo back, so if it's okay, if I could ask you to wait five minutes, you'll see it post on the website."

These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Dorain good everyone and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Businesses and consumers around the world continue to face challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you and your families are continuing to be safe in managing this unprecedented environment. At Equifax, we continue to make the health and safety of our 11,000 employees a top priority. Turning first to the slide deck on page number four. Before I cover our very strong third quarter performance, I wanted to recap our focus over the past 3 years to transform Equifax to drive revenue growth, margins and cash in the future. Today, we saw a unique industry and vertical customer and consumer challenges through our differentiated data assets and best-in-class, advanced analytics. Most of our differentiated and -- our most differentiated and most valuable data asset is our 2020 income and employment data. We are building an industry leading global native cloud data technology footprint enabled by best-in-class cloud-native tools that will leverage our new cloud based single data fabric. We\u2019ve taken an industry leadership position in data security by changing our culture, our technology solutions and governance to ensure customer and consumer data is safer than it has ever before. We're relentlessly focused on a customer-first mentality, and we have a market-leading position in 25 countries. In building the new Equifax, we are executing on our $1.5 billion cloud, data and technology transformation that will move our data to a single cloud-native data fabric and into our legacy applications to the Google Cloud. We\u2019re ramping up our investments in innovation and product resources to drive new product acceleration by leveraging our cloud investments. We\u2019re strengthening our differentiated data portfolio with new unique data assets that complement our view of consumers. We\u2019re leveraging advanced analytics, our patented AI technology and cloud-native technology to deliver multi-data solutions, and we\u2019re differentiating our business portfolio by acquiring new capabilities and entering new areas of growth. Turning now to slide number five, the COVID pandemic has accelerated key market macros that are positive for Equifax and for the industry. First, in our data driven economy, it's clear that both deeper insights from comprehensive data sources like the U.S. consumer credit database at Equifax and the use of multiple and alternative data types are critical for risk management, customer prospecting, employment, verification, and an array of other activities engaged by our customers. More differentiated data was a positive macro prior to COVID-19. These economic impacts of the pandemic have only accelerated this trend around differentiated data. Differentiated data and analytics are more valuable than ever to our customers. Second, providers of credit are increasingly delivering real time and advanced analytics that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver incremental insights beyond core data. This trend has been accelerated during COVID, including instances where fraudsters have expanded efforts around fraud, account takeover or activities such as loan stacking and -- such as loan stacking. Identity and fraud solutions are increasingly valuable. Third, consumers, especially those from the digital age, have expectations that their financial and workplace interactions function digitally. We\u2019ve seen this trend towards digital accelerate in the current COVID environment as face-to-face interactions have become increasingly rare. And last, Fintechs and alternative lenders are nimbly taking share of wallet from traditional financial institutions. We\u2019ve seen this trend challenge somewhat the near-term due to economic pressures, including disruptions in capital flows, but we expect it will reaccelerate as we move into 2021. The Equifax team is laser focused on delivering solutions to help our customers meet the challenging economic demands caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our new cloud-native data and applications are delivering integrated basically data solution that we were unable to execute on and our legacy environment with unprecedented data, currency and speed. We're applying advanced analytics and alternative data assets towards the creation of trended insights that can better help our customers manage in this COVID environment where the consumer credit profiles are complicated by unemployment, salary reduction, furloughs and lower combinations. Our new cloud-based Luminate identity and fraud platform that uses these advanced analytics, along with machine learning and data orchestration, providing risk managers with greater insights to better manage fraud. And our solutions enable our organizations across industries to adopt new realities using digital solutions to interact with their customers, whether it's an automotive dealership looking to convert online browsers, to online purchasers without stepping for dealership or a credit union looking for way to support members while operating with a reduced branch footprint, Equifax solutions help organization of all types to drive new digital interactions. The COVID recession has accelerated key market macros around the value of broader data assets and real-time decisioning that will benefit Equifax in the future. Turning to slide six. It highlights how Equifax goes beyond the standard credit report to give lenders, employers, marketers and other service providers a fuller, more complete 360-degree picture of a consumer's financial life to enhance decisioning. We are working with our customers to leverage the traditional credit file that lenders already rely on to understand the financial profile of candidates for loans and services. Instead of focusing only on financial activity or delinquency over the past three to six months, our trended data and analytics allow lenders to look at delinquencies over an extended period while closely monitoring indicators of financial distress, such as utilization increases and loaning combinations. We estimate that this deeper view of traditional credit reports may allow nearly 4 million consumers who have recently moved down from prime and super-prime credit categories due to credit policy tightening to move back up. Consumers that may be good candidates for cards or personal loans who may otherwise be overlooked as lenders execute their traditional recession playbook. Even more importantly, alternative data in the form of Equifax's unique twin income and employment information has become increasingly critical as uncertain job market impacts underwriting and the ability of consumer to repay their loan. Unique data we provide helps lenders and consumers together to verify that a borrower is employed when a credit decision is made. The do-it-yourself alternative requesting hard copy employment and income verifications can lengthen process workflows and cannot be verified. We estimate that the addition of twin income and employment data into credit decisioning can move more than 7 million consumers up into prime and super-prime categories so they can receive larger loans and other services with renewed lender confidence. Telco, utility, bank transaction and commercial data are further examples of Equifax's unique and differentiated data sets. Our cloud technology transformation is delivering a single day of fabric that combines our multiple databases into one environment to enable more nimble innovation, insights and analytics, while at the same time, enhancing regulatory compliance. We have incredible appetite for new and differentiated data, and we believe and commercial data that that more data delivers better decisions for our customers. I hope this gives you a strong sense of our broad range of strategic initiatives as we are transforming Equifax for the future. Turning now to slide seven, and our third quarter financial results. Equifax continued with very strong performance again in the third quarter. I'm very encouraged by the resiliency and strength of Equifax and how our teams around the world are meeting the challenges of COVID to help our customers, partners and consumers. We are operating more effectively and efficiently with more energy and momentum than I've seen since I joined Equifax, and I believe we'll be a stronger, more resilient organization when this global pandemic is over. During the third quarter, we saw very strong revenue performance, particularly at Workforce Solutions and USIS, with broad-based improving revenue trends resulting in strong cash generation in EBITDA margins, while we continue to make incremental investments in technology and product and innovation in security. Revenue growth of 19% is the highest quarterly growth in our history, and we eclipsed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time in Equifax\u2019s history, all huge milestones. I'll talk more in a minute about our financial results. We continue to make proactive customer collaboration, a key priority in order to drive engagement, deal pipelines and new product innovation. During the quarter and past several weeks, I've been engaged with our key customers. This is the most challenging environment they've ever faced. Broadly, data is more valuable today than ever and our unique data assets like TWN and Advanced Analytics are critical to helping our customers navigate through this pandemic. We continue to take advantage of our strong cash generation to accelerate our cloud data technology transformation investments. Under Bryson Koehler's leadership and with the support of thousands of technology team members, we are making continued strong progress on our $1.5 billion technology transformation, and we are seeing new customers accessing our cloud-native solutions each week as our migrations accelerate. We're also continuing to expand our investments and resources around innovation in new products that are helping our customers manage today's challenging environment, but also with an eye on -- beyond the pandemic. Our transformation into a product led organization focused on innovation and enabled by best-in-class cloud-native data assets and world class technology is becoming more real every day and will power our business in 2021 and beyond. Our team\u2019s strong execution and outperformance in the third quarter is another very positive step forward for Equifax. Turning to slide eight. Our financial results for the third quarter were strong and broad based. Revenue of was $1.07 billion was up 19% on reported in local currency basis, which is well above our expectations in the framework of 10% to 12% that we shared with you in early September. M&A contributed less than 1% in the quarter. Our growth was again powered by our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions, which had a combined revenue up a very strong 32.5% and combined adjusted EBITDA margins of over 50%. Workforce Solutions continued their exceptional performance driven by the value of the TWN database with revenues up 57% in the quarter, while generating EBITDA margins of 58%. This marked Workforce Solutions\u2019 second consecutive quarter of 50% plus revenue growth, and USIS also exhibited strong revenue growth of 15%. Our strong U.S. B2B business performance continues to be powered by our focus on growth and our differentiated data assets. U.S. mortgage revenue was up almost 90% compared to the third quarter of 2019. U.S. mortgage market inquiries, our proxy for the overall mortgage market growth, were up 51% in the third quarter, driven by strength in both the new purchase and refinancing mortgage volumes. The driver of our U.S. B2B businesses substantial outperformance versus the market continues to be Workforce Solutions, where mortgage revenue more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter in a row. This was driven by the value that our customers place on our TWN income and employment data, the rollout of new products, the addition of new customers, improved customer penetration and expansion of our TWN data records. U.S. mortgage revenue growth of 57% also outpaced the market by 600 basis points. Our unemployment insurance claims business grew over 70% in the quarter with revenue of $50 million. In the third quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about $3.4 million initial unemployment claims, which is down from $7.5 million initial claims in the second quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to process roughly one in five U.S. initial unemployment claims. We expect unemployment claims to continue above 2019 levels in the fourth quarter, but at a reduced level compared with the third quarter. Excluding the growth from unemployment claims, which we would not expect to report in 2021, Equifax revenue growth was up a very strong 17% in the third quarter and is up over 12% year-to-date. Revenue growth drove adjusted EBITDA to $391 million, up 29%, with a 270 basis point expansion in our margins to 36.6%. We prudently balance cost controls while making target investments in our cloud transformation, new products and data and analytics. Adjusted EPS at $1.87 a share was up a strong 26% despite incurring increased depreciation and amortization and incremental cloud cost of $0.15 a share and increased interest expense of $0.06 per share from our second quarter bond offering. This exceeded our expectations in the framework of $1.50 to $1.60 we shared with you in September. USIS revenue of $386 million was up a very strong 15% in the third quarter with the M&A contribution less than 0.5%. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $179 million, was up 57% in the quarter as both purchase and refi transactions remained strong throughout the quarter and better than our expectations of up about 45% from our call last month. Non-mortgage revenue also strengthened in USIS sequentially in the quarter at down 6%, up from down 7% in the second quarter. Importantly, we saw a substantial improvement in non-mortgage online revenue, which was down only 5% as compared to almost 10% decline we saw in the second quarter. We saw a very good sequential improvement in banking, insurance, rental and direct-to-consumer, with insurance turning from down double-digits to up double-digits in the quarter. We are starting to see signs of customers restarting origination efforts with several major FI's revenue up versus 2019 for the first time in the pandemic, which is a positive sign for the future. In September, we saw positive growth in both insurance and direct-to-consumer, which although still negative, we saw improvements in banking and auto, both of which had only single digit declines. Financial Marketing services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line or batch business of $46 million was down 9%, consistent with our expectations. Marketing-related revenue, which represents just under 40% of FMS continue to be down significantly, but did show some improvement as we move through the third quarter. Risk decisioning, which includes portfolio review activities and represents about 40% of FMS revenue was down slightly due to a large onetime project last year. In identity and fraud related revenue, which represents about 20% of FMS was flat. I'm very encouraged by the progress of Sid Singh in the USIS teams continue to make especially during these challenging economic times. They are competitive commercially and on offense. We continue to see very strong new deal pipeline growth at USIS, with total pipeline value up over 30% versus last year, driven by growth in the volume and average size of our USIS pipeline opportunities. Larger deal opportunities are very positive sign as we look to accelerate USIS revenue growth. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 46% were up 160 basis points from last year and up 188 basis points sequentially. The improvements both year-to-year and sequentially were driven principally by the significant growth in high-margin online revenue. Turning now to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $377 million up a very strong 57%. Year-to-date revenue is already over $1 billion at Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and EWS team continue to leverage broad structural growth drivers, including new products, penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions to fuel their above-market growth. EWS remains our most differentiated business particularly in this unprecedented consumer environment where our TWN income and employment data is immensely valuable. Verification Service revenues at $301 million was up 63% versus 2019. Verification Services mortgage revenue more than doubled for the second quarter in a row, growing more than 80 percentage points faster than the 51% growth we saw in the mortgage market, credit imposed in the third quarter. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue was up about 4% in the quarter and slightly outperformed our expectations. Similar to the second quarter we continue to see growth in government and health care as well as in the auto vertical as we increase penetration of TWN. During the third quarter, we saw a significant recovery in talent solutions, reflecting both increased U.S. hiring and the rollout of new products. Consistent with second quarter, debt management continues to be very soft. Employer Services revenue of $76 million increased 37% in the quarter, driven by our unemployment claims business, which had revenue of $50 million and was up 70% compared to last year. Adjusting for the $20 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter, Employer Services was flat with revenue growth in I-9 and onboarding services that was driven by the acceleration of I-9 Anywhere solutions offset by declines in our tax credit business. Transaction activity in our I-9 and onboarding products improved through the third quarter and sequentially versus the second quarter, driven by new hiring activity with our customers. Many of the large retail shipping and e-commerce companies utilize our I-9 onboarding products. In addition, we\u2019re seeing a positive shift to our new remote I-9 product suite with new customer wins. Strong EWS Verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins in Workforce Solutions of 57.8%, a 900 basis point expansion from the prior year. Turning now to International. Their revenue of $218 million was down 5% on a constant currency basis, a substantial improvement from the down 15% in second quarter and better than our expectations as shelter-in-place orders were lifted at many markets and economic activity resumed. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, had a very good performance in the quarter with revenue of $80 million, about flat in local currency versus last year and better than the down 5% we expected earlier in September. Australia consumer online revenue was down 5% versus last year, a significant improvement from the down double digits we saw in second quarter. Our Australian commercial business, combined online and off-line revenue, was up 1% in the quarter, again, a nice improvement from the prior period. Fraud and Identity was also up over 15% in the third quarter versus the down 12% in second quarter. These areas of improvement offset declines in consumer marketing services, our consumer offline business and HR Solutions. Consistent with second quarter they continue to be down versus last year. New Zealand revenue was down just over 10% in the quarter, significant improvement to be down 25% in the second quarter. European revenues of $59 million were down 13% in local currency in the third quarter. Our European credit business was down about 7%, with Spain performing slightly better than the U.K. In the U.K, consumer online revenue was down just over 10%, a significant improvement from the down 20% we saw in second quarter. Analytical and Decision Solutions revenue was almost flat in the quarter, a significant improvement from about -- down about 20% in second quarter. Combined consumer online and analytical decision solutions represent about 75% of our U.K. CRA business. Similar to the U.S, our consumer offline business continues to show significant declines due to reductions in economic activity and credit originations. Banking revenue, driven by new wins with top 5 U.K. banks, was up over 25% in the quarter. Our U.K. banking team is seeing real momentum. Our European debt management business declined 20% in local currency, in line with our expectations, principally driven by government enacted policies that continued to temporarily halt debt collections due to COVID-19. U.K. government debt placement activities restarted in August. We expect fourth quarter debt management revenue to improve meaningfully as September debt placements were up 5x versus pre-COVID levels. Turning to Latin America. Their revenue of $40 million decreased 6% in local currency in the third quarter, better than the down 9% we expected earlier in the quarter. Importantly, our Latin America revenues were much better than the down 14% we saw in the second quarter. In the quarter, Chile our largest country in Latin America, delivered positive revenue growth. And our Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay businesses showed significant improvements from second quarter, down about 4% in the quarter versus 2019. These markets continue to benefit from the resumption of economic activity expansion of Ignite, the migration of customers to our global cloud-based interconnect SaaS decisioning platform. We're also seeing the benefit of the strong new product introductions over the past 3 years in the region. Canada revenue of $39 million was flat to local currency in the third quarter, a significant improvement from the down 13% in second quarter and in line with our expectations from our September call. Consumer online and commercial were both down about 5% in the third quarter, and both were a substantial improvement from almost 20% declines in the second quarter. Analytical and Decision Solutions were about flat in the quarter against substantial improvement from the second quarter. We delivered nice growth in Canada in our ID and Fraud business and Property Service businesses. It's combined with the improved performance of the other segments allowed us to improve to flat in the third quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.3% were up 130 basis points from last year, despite the decline in revenue, principally reflecting benefits from cost actions taken in 2019 and strong expense management this year. Turning now to Global Solutions revenue, which was down 2% on a reported and local currency basis in the quarter. Our Global Consumer Direct business was up 6%, their highest growth since 2017. Our North American Consumer Direct business revenue was up a solid 6% versus 2019, while the U.K. Consumer Direct revenue was about flat. Importantly, we continue to see sequential subscriber growth in the U.S. and Canada, our two largest markets. Based on a continuation of these trends, we expect our Consumer Direct business to show positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Ben Anderson and the GCS team have done a good job returning our Global Direct business to a growth mode. Our remaining GCS business is principally our partner businesses as well as our benefits channel and event-based businesses decreased about 10% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. We delivered 11% growth in our benefits channel and event based businesses, but this growth was more than offset by declines in our U.S. lead gen partner business as originations continue to be soft in the third quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.8% decreased 10 basis points compared to the prior year period due to increased marketing spend to drive future direct revenue and lower lead generation revenue, offset by onetime setup costs incurred during the third quarter of 2019 related to a new multiyear contract. Slide nine highlights the acceleration of revenue growth over the last several years and quarters, broken down between the growth drivers from the extraordinary UC claims revenue in 2020 from high unemployment and the strong U.S. mortgage revenue market to help you look through the impact of these strong market factors to the underlying Equifax core growth. As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, Equifax grew 19% overall with 200 basis points of debt [ph] growth from UC claim revenue and 11 points of Equifax revenue growth from the strong U.S. mortgage market. We are very pleased with the 6% core growth with strong sequential growth versus the minus 2% in second quarter, particularly with the headwinds from the COVID session. Equifax is clearly outperforming U.S. expectations in the COVID recession. The impact of the strong U.S. mortgage market is highlighted in purple and reflects growth driven directly by the strong underlying U.S. mortgage market. To be clear, this is not the growth of Equifax U.S. mortgage revenue, but is instead only growth directly attributable to the U.S. mortgage market itself that we estimate based on mortgage market credit inputs. During the third quarter, 11 points of Equifax\u2019s 19% growth was from the strong U.S. mortgage market. The impact of the extraordinary UC claims growth in 2020 is highlighted in blue. We are providing this given the dramatic unusual growth in the year we are seeing in 2020 that we expect to normalize overtime. Equifax core growth is in green, and reflects the resiliency and breadth of our business performance in the COVID recession. Essentially this is the sum of the growth in our U.S. non-mortgage businesses, our international businesses and GCS and growth in our U.S. mortgage businesses above underlying mortgage market growth. Excluding the impact of the U.S. mortgage market and UC claims, Equifax core growth has expanded from 2% to 3% in 2018 and 2019 during the global financial crisis to 5% in the first quarter and now 6% in the third quarter while we\u2019re still in the middle of the COVID pandemic. This performance reflects the resiliency and breadth of the Equifax portfolio. As I will cover on the next slide, it\u2019s important to recognize that in the third quarter a significant portion of the 6% of Equifax core growth is being driven by our outperformance in our U.S. B2B mortgage vertical powered by Workforce Solutions core growth, which was a strong 30% and USIS, which was only down 1% on a core growth basis. This ability to substantially outgrow the underlying market is core to our business model and a substantial strength that should continue to provide significant benefits through the balance of 2020 and into 2021. Equifax is dramatically stronger in 2020 versus the 2008, 2009 recession with revenue up 19% in the quarter and 12% in second quarter versus down 6% during the global financial crisis, again, reflecting the strength of today's Equifax portfolio. A continued strategic focus and strength of Equifax is our deep and broad array of products and solutions for the U.S. mortgage market and ability to consistently outgrow the underlying market. Slide 10 highlights this through our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Both Workforce Solutions and USIS have consistently outgrown the underlying U.S. mortgage market. The driver of the acceleration of this outperformance over the past several years has been a tremendous growth in Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, which exceeded mortgage market growth rates by over 20 points in 2019, accelerating to about 80 points of our performance this year. The key drivers of the strong Workforce Solutions performance includes increased market penetration, which, by this, we mean both an increase in the percentage of mortgage applications for which the underwriter requests an income and employment verification from Equifax and an increase in the number of times a mortgage underwriter requested income and employment verification during the application process. Both of these drive increased TWN inquiries. As we view U.S. mortgage marketing -- we view U.S. mortgage inquiries as a proxy for the overall market, an important metric we track is TWN inquiries as a percent of USIS credit inquiries. In third quarter, this metric for the first time exceeded 50%, where we had one TWN mortgage market inquiry for every two USIS credit mortgage marketing inquiries. This metric has been growing substantially over the past three years and has more than doubled since early 2018. However, at only 50%, it shows that we have a lot of runway ahead of us to reach the same utilization for TWN as a credit file. We are actively working with our customers to continue to drive penetration through both expanded selling efforts across our customer ecosystem and increasing customer system-to-system integrations. Second is increased fulfillment rate. This is the percentage of times we receive a mortgage inquiry that we can\u2019t fulfill and is driven by -- that we can fulfill and is driven by growth in the TWN database. While we have real scale at over 50% of the non-farm payroll database, we only fulfill roughly for 50% of our inquiries. As we add records via our immediately monetized, which provides real leverage for Workforce Solutions. Adding new TWN contributors and records is a priority for the EWS team. And third is new products. We continue to introduce new Workforce Solutions products that provide greater value to our customers in terms of depth of data and frequency of polls with higher price points in margins. We expect NPIs to accelerated Workforce Solutions from addition of new product resources and leverage from the cloud transformation. Workforce Solutions is clearly almost powerful business. Slide 11 shows their above market strong performance, which is highly accretive to Equifax revenue growth, margins and cash flow. Through third quarter, overall Workforce revenue growth of $332 million or 48% through 13 points of Equifax revenue growth and Workforce core revenue growth of $163 million contributed six points of Equifax core revenue growth versus last year. The impact on Equifax EBITDA was even more powerful with Workforce Solutions delivering $572 million of Equifax EBITDA or 44% of our total EBITDA through the third quarter. Equifax is the powerful business and important driver of Equifax results in 2020 and in the future. As shown on Slide 12, you can see the continuing growth in our TWN database, which has been a significant driver of value to our customers and the growth in Workforce Solutions. In the third quarter, we continue to add TWN records and delivered new TWN record growth of 6 million active records in the quarter, even in the high end unemployment environment, which grow TWN database over 111 million records, up from 105 million, we had at the end of first quarter and second quarter. TWN records are up has grown 20% versus 2019. We also had significant milestone in the third quarter with contributors surpassing the 1 million level, this is our million company in the United States that are contributing to payroll records at Equifax up from 64,000 a year ago, which has moved the TWN database deeply into small ended market companies. With the TWN database now providing information on over 88 million unique individuals, firmly over half of the U.S. non-farm payroll, we view this as a catalyst for Workforce Solutions, given the increasing hit rates and uniqueness of the data. As we discussed previously, the Workforce Solutions team is expanding their focus on records beyond just W-2 payroll into areas like 1099 employees to give economy and pension income. The increasing depth of the TWN database was now over 415 million total records had the additional benefit of increasing the completeness of an individual job history that we have in the database. This also significantly increases the value of the unique TWN data for both credit decisioning as well as in Talent Solutions and other applications. As a reminder, we generated almost 20% of our verification services revenue from inactive records that we built up over the past decade, which helps to provide a full picture of individual employment history. This also expands the uniqueness and value of TWN, which is other sources of income for employment data. And what has been the most challenging economic and health environment we faced in our lifetime, Equifax delivered exceptionally strong performance again in the third quarter, while investing in our cloud transformation and new products. We are focused on finishing 2020 strong, while investing for 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the discussion over to John to discuss recent trends in revenue in our growing markets as results -- as well as reducing other financial items. After John\u2019s discussion, I will come back and review our progress on the tech transformation and new products.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks Mark. I\u2019ll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but we will refer to non-GAAP results as well. In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $155 million. Excluding non-recurring cost adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $109 million, up $38 million from 3Q 2019. Corporate function expenses, such as, finance, HR and legal were down year-to-year, reflecting the cost containment activities we outlined in April. The increase in total general corporate expense is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs in 2020 due to our strong and improving financial performance. We continue to exercise disciplined cost management across the business, while also continuing to invest in our technology transformation, data and analytics, new products and securities. We will accelerate investments in these areas in 2020 as we believe this will deliver accelerated benefits. Outside of these areas, head count additions remain at levels below attrition, and discretionary spending has been reduced. Across the company, business travel remains at very low levels. For 3Q 2020, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 21.2% and in line with our expectations. We expect the 4Q 2020 tax rate and full year effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS to be around 24%. In 3Q, 2020 and year-to-date, operating cash flow of $367 million and $645 million were up $532 million and $566 million, respectively from 2019. The increases reflect the substantial improvements and operating performance in 2020 as well as lower payments for litigation settlements in 3Q 2020 and year-to-date of $341 million and $246 million, respectively. The timing of payment of the remaining $347 million to the U.S. consumer restitution fund is principally dependent on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until early 2021. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong. At September 30, we had $1.5 billion in cash, and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility of $1.1 billion. As Mark mentioned, our 3Q results were substantially stronger than the implication of the trends through August that we discussed in our September 8 Investor Call. The improved results were predominately on our U.S. B2B business. Importantly, the improvement was in our U.S. online revenue, with significant improvement in non-mortgage revenue as well as in mortgage. We also had stronger results in international in Australia and Canada. The strength in adjusted EPS reflects the margin impact from the stronger revenue in September. Slide 13 through 15 show details of revenue trends on a local currency basis that we saw in 2Q and 3Q, as well as monthly data for July, August and September. We are also providing the view of the trends so far during the month of October, and their implications on 4Q 2020 if they were to continue throughout the quarter. For line items, for which daily trends are not available or not relevant, we did not provide monthly actuals, but did provide 2Q, 2020 and 3Q, 2020 data as well as an estimate for 4Q 2020. The monthly actuals data provided should be viewed as directional. Looking at slide 13, starting at the bottom of slide, U.S. B2B revenue growth trended very positively in September, growth into August and in 3Q 220 relative to Q2 2020 with U.S B2B revenue up 32% in 3Q 2020 year-to-year as compared to the 28% year-to-year growth we saw in 2Q 2020. This was driven by improved year-to-year growth in U.S. B2B online revenue. Mortgage year-to-year revenue growth strengthened significantly in September versus August and in 3Q 2020 year-to-year in both USIS and EWS. The stronger growth was in the context of a stronger mortgage market we saw in 3Q 2019 which grew 20% from 3Q 2018. Importantly, online non-mortgage revenue growth trends also improved meaningfully in both September and 3Q 2020. USIS non-mortgage revenue was down only 3% in September and 5% in 3Q 2020, year-to-year and EWS saw year-to-year growth and online non mortgage revenue in both September and third quarter 2020. Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business grew substantially year-to-year again in the third quarter of 2020, we expect strong growth in UC again in 4Q 2020, up about 30% year-to-year. The column on the far right of slide 13 provides a view on year to year revenue growth trends through mid-October and the implications on 4Q 2020 revenue that those trends should continue. A few reminders as we look at those trends. Fourth quarter and seasonally the lowest quarter for mortgage revenue, reducing the relative mix of mortgage revenue and overall Equifax revenue. 4Q 2019 saw a very strong growth in the US B2B online, about 18% driven by very strong 4Q 2019 online mortgage revenue growth of 34%. Again, starting at the bottom of the slide 13, implication of the revenue trends through mid-October continuing throughout 4Q 2020, U.S. B2B online year-to-year revenue continues to be extremely strong. The growth rate is just under 30%. Both USIS online and EWS online verification services growth rates will be very strong, but it levels slightly below what we saw in 3Q 2020. Mortgage revenue growth rates will be slightly weaker than in 3Q 2020, reflecting the strength in 4Q 2019 mortgage revenue, particularly in EWS. USIS non mortgage year-to-year growth rates would be about flat with 3Q 2020 and workforce non mortgage is expected to decline slightly versus a slight growth we saw in 3Q 2020. Workforce Solutions employment services year-to-year revenue would be up under 15%, but the unemployment insurance payments business continues to grow, but at levels lower than 3Q 2020. Financial Marketing Services revenue would be down consistent with the levels we saw in the third quarter. Turning to slide 14 as Mark discussed earlier, international saw significant improvements in all regions in 3Q 2020 with constant currency year-to-year revenue down that only 5%. Trends from mid-October international continues to improve and so the implementation of the revenue trends through mid-October and continuing throughout 4Q 2020, we expect International revenue to be down only slightly in the fourth quarter. GCS October trends reflect the continuation of those that Mark discussed earlier. In Consumer Direct growing total subscribers are expected to lead the second consecutive quarter of global direct revenue growth in 4Q. As we referenced last quarter, the declining partner revenue we saw in 3Q 2020 is expected to increase significantly in 4Q due to decline in the lead gen related partner business. We expect the weakness in partner revenue to continue into the first half of 2021. As with our prior two earnings calls and due to the continuing uncertainties in forecasting the direction, depth and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we are not going to provide fourth quarter guidance. However, the perspective on total Equifax 4Q 2020 performance, we will again provide an illustrative fourth quarter framework to help you think about our performance. Please turn to slide 15. To the extent, total Equifax revenue continues at the pace I described earlier, 4Q 2020 revenue would be up about 9.5% to 11.5%, or $84 million to $104 million year-to-year, resulting in 4Q 2020 revenue of $990 million to $1.01 billion. Adjusted EPS in 4Q 2020, these revenue levels could be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 a share down slightly from 4Q 2019. Slide 15 also provides a walkthrough explaining the translation versus 4Q 2019 of the revenue increase to the increase in pre-tax income and adjusted EPS. Importantly, these adjusted EPS level, Equifax to deliver over $350 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. [Indiscernible] guidance, there is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customers business activities, and therefore our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability and trends not a view of potential or outcomes. As I referenced earlier, trends in Equifax mortgage inquiry volume remain at record levels in the third quarter consistent with a very strong market data on originations. In addition to very strong refinancing activity, new purchase volume has been at record levels and the change was a period of 20% from last year. And as we referenced last quarter, for Black Knight estimates approximately 18 million household still benefits from refinancing at current average 30 in mortgage rates of under 2.9%. For perspective, current estimates of refinance originations in 2Q 2020 were under $1 million per month. As Mark referenced earlier, we continue to look to accelerate the completion of our tech transformation, including increasing investment levels in 2020. At present, we expect 2020 onetime cost related to the Equifax 2020 Technology and Data Security Transformation to be about $340 million. We expect capital spending to be about $410 million for the full year. As a reminder in 2021, we will no longer be adjusting our financial results for one-time costs related to the cloud technology transformation. The one time technology transportation costs are expected to decline substantially in 2021 and will likely be largest in 1Q 2021 decreasing throughout the remainder of 2021. These one-time technology transformation costs will impact development expense, G&A and COGS. We will continue to disclose these one-time tech transformation costs to allow you to have comparability with our financial results from 2017 through 2020. And with that I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. I\u2019ll wrap up with an update on our cloud technology and data transformation and our accelerated focus on new products. Turning to slide 16. Equifax continues to make very meaningful progress on our cloud data technology transformation. We\u2019re energized by the revenue, cost margin and cash benefits we expect from our cloud investments. Through a single cloud native data fabric and common cloud -- global cloud based infrastructure, to be able to innovate, to develop more robust Product Solutions and multi-data insights that are portable around the world enabled by our differentiated cloud data technology to be able to unlock new use cases and verticals, with our solutions for new and existing customers. Our cloud based infrastructure will also enable us to accelerate the velocity at which we can develop new products from months to weeks. Accelerating the benefits our customers receive from these products in driving our revenue growth. We\u2019re already starting to see increased system availability as we move from our legacy technology into the cloud and we expect this trend to continue. All the non-capability are table stakes and global technology company we believe that as more customers moved to the cloud -- the cloud operability will deliver best-in-class systems availability, and customer interaction seamless and faster. And lastly, we\u2019re continuing on our path to being industry leader in data security. Our security is core to everything we do that by advancements in data governance. We know that data security is a battle that we must fight alongside our industry peers and our customers every day. Starting to slide 17, we moved in the final phase of our North America technology transformation with a focus on customer migrations. We continue our progress to migrate our customers into our new cloud based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite and API capabilities. As a reminder this is the common set of services on which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. At the end -- as of the end of the third quarter, USIS has migrated over 4800 U.S. customers, and Internationals completed migrations of about 6500 customers. For USIS it is up about 4x from the about 1200 customers migrated at the end of June. We continue to expect this pace of migration to accelerate in the fourth quarter with over 10,000 U.S. customer migrations expected by year end with the remaining U.S. customer migrations completed during 2021. We continue to adapt our development priorities at platform capabilities to use our customer\u2019s ability to easily migrate to our new platforms. Our progress on the transformation since our last earnings call in July is positive. Initial and draft migration to GCP of our major North American exchange data to U.S. and Canadian consumer agro [ph] risk exchanges, the world\u2019s number in [Indiscernible] is principally complete, and we expect to have completed full migration including all data ingestion processes for these exchanges by year end. This distinct milestone with this exchange is generating about 70% of North America Online revenue. We\u2019re also making very good progress in the full migration to GDP, our secondary U.S. exchanges, the U.S. and Canadian commercial risk exchanges, property and data exchanges. These exchanges are expected to be to complete full migration as we move through 2021. Investments in Europe by TAM and Australia in deploying cloud native Data Fabric and our Ignite Interconnect API analytical decisioning framework are also progressing well. Data Fabric is live in six global cloud regions globally. We completed the initial migration of our eID identity validation system in the third quarter and started customer migrations, which we expect to complete by year-end. In our Luminate Cloud Identity [Indiscernible] it is now available to customers in the U.S. and Canada. And in eID cloud-native service is also available for U.S. as part of our newly transformed cloud Luminate offering. Additional data sources will continue to be integrated on a regular basis as we move forward. We still have plenty of work in front of us, but we are making strong progress in our cloud data and technology transformation. We remain energized about the future top and bottom line benefits. Our cloud-native data and infrastructure will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace today, and be even more valuable as we complete the transformation. Planning [ph] team highlights our expanded new product innovation focus, which is a key component of our EFS 2020 strategy in the next chapter at Equifax. As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on transforming our company to a product led organization and powered by best-in-class cloud-native data and technology to fuel growth. As we progress through 2020, we continue to make strong progress on our goals to expand our NPI rollouts, and are on track to deliver about 110 new products in 2020. Through September, we launched about 85 new products, and we have an active pipeline in various stages of the funnel. In the third quarter, we continued our strong focus on recession based product launches, including our response recovery, product offering, which provide lenders and service providers, the data and analytics they need to both care for their customers and ensure the long-term health of their portfolios. Response recovery enabled by our night market intelligence sandbox provides lenders access to point in time and trend to consumer insights in order to make better underwriting decisions during a period of economic instability, as well as get the information they need to reach out and support their existing customers already in a combination situation and other institutions. In USIS, we continue to build on our strengthening commercial business. In the third quarter, USIS launch B2B Connect, designed to help enterprises better prospect, segment and retain key business clients with intelligence on more than 150 million global companies, including 53 million U.S. businesses and 80 million B2B contracts. B2B Connects is providing an extended omni-channel view of businesses, businesses companies need to better qualified commercial prospects and improve engagement with existing customers. The commercial B2B product will be further enhanced by data from our recent acquisition of Ansonia, which brings unique commercial leasing data to our already robust set of commercial assets At Workforce Solutions, we continue to focus on the hiring process. This is as a significant growth opportunity for our business, as there are more than 70 million new hires per year in the United States. In the third quarter, Workforce Solutions launched the first -- the industry\u2019s first I-9 management service designed specifically as an e-commerce platform in the small and mid-sized business owners aligned. For years, large enterprise businesses have put their trust in the market leading I-9 management solution from Equifax. Now with the e-commerce launches of our I-9 starter and our I-9 standard packages, Equifax makes it easier than ever for businesses of any size to be manage their I-9 requirements. With an automated I-9 platform, organizations can have more confidence in their onboarding and I-9 compliance and deliver better onboarding experience for the new hires. Workforce Solutions also continue to innovate and uses new solutions to both support their financial and mortgage verticals in 2020, including our new mortgage trended income, employment and multi-borrower products. NPI continue to be an important lever for Equifax growth and a priority for me and the team. We\u2019ve expanded our focus and resources on driving NPI loss in 2020 and more recently, with a global focus on products that support our customers during the COVID recession. We will continue to prioritize new products and innovations as we move into 2021 to leverage our cloud data and technology transformation for future growth. Wrapping up on slide 19, as John outlined earlier, we\u2019re still unable to provide guidance for the fourth quarter. We still see meaningful uncertainty from the impacts from the COVID pandemic as cases rise and many markets impacting shelter in place orders, consumer confidence and economic activity. There\u2019s also a real risk of the second COVID wave and potential increased lockdowns. We also expect further impacts from our employment, furloughs and salary reductions. But even in this challenging COVID environment, Equifax is operating exceptionally well. Our strong business model is resilient in delivering while investing in the future. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and towards 2021 and beyond, we are confident in the drivers of our business model into our growth strategy. Our strong 19% growth in the third quarter affects the breath and resiliency of the Equifax business model. The strong U.S. mortgage market and UC Claims revenue was delivering incremental revenue, margin in cash that allows Equifax to continue to be aggressive about investing our cloud transformation, while expanding new investment in innovation, new products in D&A. Our strong results also strengthen our balance sheet to allow us to focus on accretive M&A. Our third quarter closed 6% revenue growth exclude the impact of U.S. mortgage market and US Claims revenue, a very strong performance in the COVID environment, with our non-mortgage in international business is still pressure from the COVID recession. We expect those markets to recover in the future with the roll-out of a broad based COVID vaccine as markets recover and economic activity improves. Workforce Solutions is clearly a franchise Equifax business that is strongly outperforming with multiple structural growth levers from new records, new product, improving product mix with new motor multiples and incremental poles driven by the growth in system and system integrations. While the mortgage market is a positive tailwind this year for Workforce Solutions, they underlined 27% core growth year-to-date excluding the impact of UC Claims and the mortgage market reflects the power and breath of the Workforce Solutions business model. Their multiple structural growth levers give us confidence in our ability to drive future incremental value for our customers and future revenue growth for Equifax. And the addition of 6 million records in the third quarter will drive revenue growth in the future. Our new SSA contract, Social Security Administration contracts that will begin generating $40 million to $50 million of annualized revenue starting next year is another feature of Workflow Solution growth driver. We are also seeing enhanced and broadened value of unique twin income and employment data given the scale and depth of the database. Turning it to USIS, they also have a strong quarter lead by growth mortgage. USIS has done offense in winning in the marketplace. USIS revenue is outperforming in the COVID recession with total third quarter growth improving to down 1%, excluding growth in the U.S. mortgage market. The USIS mortgage business continues to outgrow the market with nine points to core growth in third quarter, up from six points in the second quarter. Importantly, USIS pipelines remains our highest levels since 2017 from a new commercial focus and rollout of new products. As we look out beyond the impacts of the COVID pandemic, we believe that our non-mortgage revenues, which historically represent about 70% of USIS revenue are poised to growth, USIS is competitive in winning in the marketplace. Our international business has a well balanced portfolio of global businesses representing over 20% of Equifax revenues that have historically driven top line revenue growth through new products and analytics. Unlike our U.S. B2B businesses, most of our international markets do not have mortgage businesses, and therefore not have seen a larger decline in revenue growth in 2020. From the deeper COVID recessions in more severe GDP declines that have also impacted growth. We began to see recovery and International markets in the third quarter with Australia and Canada flat versus last year, and expect to see continued improvement as economic activity resume forward. And last, our GCS Direct business is poised for continued growth behind our disciplined investments. Our B2C [ph] businesses are improving as we invest in new products and marketing and we surpassed 7 million My Equifax members in the quarter, which is a sizable base to cross-sell financial products. Since I summarize, we're making very good progress on our cloud transformation and data transformation, with significant milestones being achieved on customer migration accelerate. We are energized about the significant top line cost and cash benefits that will come from this transformation, including always on stability, speed to market, ability to rapidly move products around the globe, which we expect will help us improve our position in the marketplace. And last, our balance sheet is strengthened in 2020 from our strong performance, allowing us to be aggressive about investing in our index 2020 Cloud Data and Technology Transformation, new products and data security, while looking for creative bolt on acquisitions that will add to our strategy. As we continue to deliver above market results in the COVID recession and focus on investing for future growth, I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market leading data, analytics and technology company. With that operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKyle Peterson : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to start on the margins. It looks really strong this quarter, especially within EWS and others have been kind of marking up over time. Do you think what we saw on the margin side could be sustainable in monolized environment? Or is there anything like one-time that we should be thinking about from this quarter?\nMark Begor: Yes. It's a great question. You've seen over the last several years, and certainly in 2020, strong top line performance from Workforce Solutions and that has certainly translated into margin growth. As you know, in our industry, internet business in particular, but in all our businesses incremental revenue growth drives very attractive incremental margins. We've seen a very strong performance in 2020. We expect that this is to continue to perform in the future. And I think we're prepared to give a guidance around margins for the future, because we can't do that broadly. But we've got a lot of confidence in the Workforce Solutions business, given the multiple levers that they have to drive future growth.\nKyle Peterson : Got it. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. I know you mentioned the [Indiscernible] increase, now that you're talking about one inquiry in twin for every two or just like mortgage origination inquiries. What do you guys find is the biggest gating factor to getting that moving that ratio higher. Is that more like lender awareness of those database or is it just that you just need to keep pushing the snowball down the hill and adding more employers and records onto the network?\nMark Begor: Yes. It's less about the employers and records. It's really what you pointed out. It's really getting into one of our customers and showing them the value of the product. It's also driven by new products. We talked about in the last couple of calls that Workforce Solutions is rolling out new products that provide multiple polls and a package for mortgage application as one purchase from Equifax. And we see that driving some of the polls. We also see the system and system integrations being a real driver, where we're getting embedded in our customer workflows. And we've got a dedicated team that works on that with our customers to show them the value of the income employment data. And then, as you pointed out just getting in front of customers, so they understand, the lift they're getting in predictability. If you're a mortgage originator, and you're going to spend, call it $4,000 in a mortgage application. When you start that application process, you want to make sure that you're working with a customer that is going to be able to be approved. Part of that is historically pulling the credit file upfront to understand what the credit profile of that customer. And that's kind of a common practice today, increasingly, the more sophisticated mortgage originators are starting to pull upfront, the income employment data, particularly in this environment, understanding where are people still employed and then pulling it multiple times. So those are just multiple opportunities that the team has in using mortgage as an example. And, of course, the same holds in other verticals where we're seeing, particularly the database becomes almost a catalyst, it's over -- well over 50% of the non-farm payroll, it's becoming an asset that the hit rates are very valuable in multiple verticals beyond mortgage.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Good morning. Maybe I can just follow-up there. The mortgage digitalization, I guess, is the big team out there. And we're seeing a lot of acquisitions for my Equifax. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on out there. And I just, besides, trying to get more penetration, the way you just described it, like how do you look at the opportunity with that team? And do you have plans with other solutions, and the name. Would you just talk there would be helpful?\nMark Begor: Manav, I apologize, I miss the first portion of the question. Can you give us a quick reference?\nManav Patnaik: Sure. It was tied to the team around mortgage digitization, I guess, and there's a lot of opportunity striving from that. And I was just wondering if you had broader plan for your mortgage business outside of just kind of seen a little bit more penetration that you just talked about?\nMark Begor: Yes. Obviously, we have a large mortgage business. We're benefiting from the market tailwinds. We've got a real focus on rolling out new products, in particularly Workforce Solutions, but also in the USIS, our UDM products, are another growth area for us. And I think what we're pleased with is the fact that both USIS and Workforce Solutions are outgrowing the mortgage market. Now, how do you do that? Will you do that with new products, new solutions, blogging more usage of your products, in particular, that's around the twin income employment database were pulled more frequently. And then just the system, the system integrations where we still have a lot of one way to work with our customers to convert them from dialing in and keying into the system on an individual applicant basis to pull the income employment data to go into system integrations, which is as you know is more on the credit file side. But it's one that's an opportunity on the income employment side. And that really we've seen big lifts in utilization, when we are embedded in the workflows and the income employment data. We've had great progress in adding those in the third quarter in 2020.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just a check on the Tech Transformation. When you started the program, you're talking about $1.25 billion is the number and it's a pretty big number you talk maybe you left some buffer room in there. But last time you said 1.4, and I think you said, it was a 1.5 billion program. So I was just curious, that incremental 250 million like, I guess where did we go over budget? Or where's that extra spend are being required today?\nMark Begor: Yes. And that's been an area that we've been clear that we're going to invest more. We see opportunities to do that to accelerate the transformation. And just to be clear, and I know you notice, but $1.5 billion we now talk about is the incremental spend in 2018, 2019 and 2020. So that's going to be behind us. And that's how much we're going to spend through the end of the year. We'll obviously be spending money on our technology as we go into 2021 and beyond that, that's going to be in our one rate spend versus the incremental spend that we talked about. And with our strong financial performance in the second half of 2019, we started investing more in the Tech Transformation. And as we continued in 2020, and performed so strongly during the COVID recession, we've made strategic decisions to accelerate our spend in order to drive it more rapidly. We think that's the right thing to do, because of the sizeable benefits that we expect to get from the transformation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Good morning. Just two questions. The first one I didn't catch if you gave the total Equifax third quarter revenues related to mortgage. So, I'd like that if you could. And6 then looking at slide 13, under EWS, non-mortgage, September stood out to me how it jumped forward. And then, sort of October kind of normalized back to July, August rates. Could just talked a little bit about that September come forward?\nMark Begor: So, in terms of total mortgage revenue, total mortgage revenues are little over a third of Equifax total revenue. So that's the best way we'll estimate that. In terms of September non-mortgage for EWS, we have substantial business with government and other participants. And so it can just be a little choppy. And obviously, the underlying revenue base isn't that large. So just movements between months can result in different growth rates between the months quite understood, so that's why we indicate that when you're looking at those numbers you can consider them indicative. And that's why we focus a lot more on the quarterly numbers.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask broadly about how you're thinking about the trends in consumer credit. On one hand, we've heard some lenders talking about borrowers, more borrowers exiting forbearance, and defaulting, which could impact the appetite for lending. But on the other hand, you have recovery trends taking hold and the economy with things opening up. So wanted to hear broadly about that? And specifically, also just wanted to ask about the sort of better September non-mortgage number within USIS. And then October getting a little bit more in between like, where September and the other months of the third quarter are?\nJohn Gamble: The first half of the question, Toni, it\u2019s obviously complicated. It\u2019s a -- economic event, a health event, like we've never seen before. Kind of broadly, the consumer is still fairly strong. Obviously, there's high-end employment, but some of the stimulus benefits that help the consumer. When we talk to our customers, their delinquencies, they are not increasing yet, because they're making minimum payments, and they're not behind in credit card payments, et cetera, kind of I'm talking broadly. So I think that's kind of what's happening so far. I think what we're all watching, is what happens as stimulus dollars one out. Are they're going to be using dollars, either pre or post the election in a few weeks, its tough to see. Where's unemployment going to go? Yes. And on top of that, what's the timing of vaccine? How quickly will it be deployed across the population, which obviously will drive economic activity. It's just a lot of challenging messages there we try to work through. What's underlying that, from our perspective, is that data is more valuable than ever for our customers. And that's what we're seeing. Obviously, our performance is quite strong. Data is being used to try to look through to who are the customers, the consumers that are still working. Who are the consumers that can take a line increase or having a mortgage refi or what is the data? So I think that's a positive for our industry. But you point out, which is why, we struggled providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. At this stage, it's still quite uncertain about where that consumer is going.\nMark Begor: In terms of your question on September at minus three and in the quarter minus five and our discussion around mid-October at above minus five. Again, the above minus five and above minus three to us are very similar numbers, right? And September's monthly data. So I think the important fact is we are seeing an improvement trend. We expect that we're seeing our business improve in non-mortgage, and we're very happy with that trend. But as we look through the rest of the fourth quarter, above 5% is can be a little bit on either side of 5%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. And appreciate all the helpful disclosure in the deck. The number one investor question I receive on Equifax is whether revenue and earnings growth is peaking given this extraordinary mortgage market expansion, which clearly benefits both USIS and EWS, along with the increased appetite for TWN employment and income data during the COVID pandemic. And clearly there are a number of positives that will sustain, the 20% growth and TWN records, the growth in NPI, the growth in the pipeline. But as you start to think about a 2021 framework, you want people to start with that 6% core growth from the third quarter. What are some of the parameters that you're starting to think about as you frame your own views for 2021?\nMark Begor: David, I think we're going to try to avoid getting you to 2021 guidance, but we were quite intentional because we're getting the same questions you're getting about what -- how do we look through Equifax is very strong performance in the year, particularly from the incremental UC claims revenue, which is meaningful, that we've highlighted will likely normalize in 2021 with unemployment, presumably coming down our unemployment claims not continuing. And then, of course, the U.S. mortgage market. U.S. mortgage market, that's one that is difficult for us to -- John talk a little bit about that one. We can't forecast what's going to happen in 2021 on the mortgage market, but the fundamentals are still quite positive for 2021 in the U.S. mortgage market with the Fed stating pretty strongly that they're going to keep interest rates at the record lows through 2021. That's a positive for refinancings and for purchase volume. We've seen purchase volume really accelerate in the last 90 days in the United States. Consumers are going out to buy homes or upgrade to get larger homes or move to the suburbs. And again, we're not forecasting, but it feels like there's some legs on that macro. And then of course, the refinance side, there's still a very sizable population, as John pointed out by consumers that have not refinance their mortgages yet, that there's multiple quarters of that benefit. With regards to 2021, you highlight some of the positives for Equifax. You can start with a lot of businesses are still challenged by the COVID pandemic and we're not forecasting 2021. But if you believe that there's going to be a vaccine, and the vaccine is going to result in more normal recovery of some sort, that's going to be good news for Equifax. International, our non-mortgage businesses in the United States, more RTGS business. So that's a positive as we go forward. You point out the power of Workforce Solutions. As we entered the pandemic USIS within a recovery mode following a cyber-event, we believe USIS is performing quite strongly on a mortgage and non-mortgage basis during the pandemic. But as we get into more of an economic recovery, we expect that to accelerating as exhibited by the deal pipelines are growing and the needs increased commercial activity. And of course, Workforce Solutions, we tested to really highlight how important that business is, how important is performance is. They've got a long list of structural levers, that they can -- that they're bit pulling and will continue to pull and you pointed our records, 6 million addition in the quarter is going to serve them well with higher hit rates and drives higher revenue in the fourth quarter and into 2021. And of course, the other elements of the business. So out attempt in providing the additional disclosures this quarter was to help you and our investors, see through the underlying performance in the COVID recession. And again, we're still in a COVID recession, Equifax delivering 6% core growth is really quite strong. And the tail winds, if you add on top of that, the benefits from the Tech Transformation as we talked about the very clear will begin really kicking in 2021, which would be another positive for us on both our top line margins and cash generation.\nDavid Togut: Appreciate that. Just a quick follow up on capital return. Will you be in a position to do more in terms of capital return as we approach 2021 in terms of dividend growth by that more M&A?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. We've been clear that, again, I don't want to give guidance. And as you know, we don't have a financial framework in place. But we've been pretty clear that our goal to get back to that. We've been investing heavily in our Tech Transformation. And we're getting the big spend in our Tech Transformation, certainly behind us in 2020. And our three-year plan. And we believe that our cash generation will accelerate as we go through 2021, 2022, 2023, which is going to provide free cash flow for us to invest in M&A, which we talked about earlier in the call. It's our intention to have more focus there. And we don't want to give any guidance around. Our intent to do a buyback or reads a dividend growth. But we've had that framework in place before. And we'll certainly consider its a right time when we put our financial framework and capital allocation plan back in place in the future.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. I just want to spend a minute on the progression of the client in EWS. Ultimately, it looks like the average client size was about 4,000 back in 2008. And that number is closer to 110, based on just specific next kind of client versus records in the work number. Do the needs of the smaller clients kind of increase? And is there any way to frame what the opportunity is as you kind of triangulate from the dollar perspective, kind of the work number with the core USIS as you look at a little bit. So just trying to get a sense of, again, the market opportunities as you build more down market, and then what that can meets the enterprise overall?\nMark Begor: Yes. First off on, more records is more value, right? And more contributors is doing, they are moving up 6 million records this quarter. We think is a big milestone where we were flat in the second quarter. But there's some bumpiness to when records come in, and we had a very strong order of execution there. We're up 20% in records year-over-year. As you know, that's going to drive hit rates and revenue growth going forward. And then to your point, you did see really the addition of some more companies. There's all kinds of numbers out there on how many companies there are in the United States, whether it's three or four or five million, but going from 69,000, a year ago to a million companies really does increase the breadth and depth of the database. So that's very, very positive for Equifax and for our customers. As you know, one area where the database is huge, is what I would call, the near-prime or sub-prime customers, and you see those customers and all kinds of companies, but adding more companies, million companies just brings more value to the database. And we're really intently focused on continuing to grow the database. We also mentioned earlier in the comments that getting to this level of scale, having 88 million uniques, or 107 million active, as well as inactive, really takes the database almost as a catalyst of being very, very valuable just because they hit rates go up. And the other thing I've commented on is that the team is expanding their focus. We've had a W2 focus on non-farm payrolls for a long, long time. And in the last year, we started to expand that focus around the gig economy 1099 that we're actually ingesting now into our database, 1099 income data. Pension data is another one that we've got our sights set on for those. We're going to hit towards non-farm payroll, that's going to take time. But we've expanded our focus to go well beyond that to get all levels of employment or other income that consumers are having. So it will become really one stop shop for all that data.\nKevin McVeigh: Got it. And then just to follow-up on that real quick. I know, obviously, the focus been on the mortgage side, seems like there's a opportunity to flush that out across other credit instruments as well? Is that so?\nMark Begor: It is. That's a big focus for us and we talk on prior calls that the values always been there. And we shared with you and others that if you take credit data, and add income employment data to what the predictability or the chaos for from that decision goes up dramatically. So that's always in the back, it's one that we've been sharing with our customers for years. The COVID crisis has created a catalyst for that. And we talked about in the last call. On the second quarter call that we're seeing, for example, credit card customers. We've got a couple of major credit card customers that are now embedding the work number data into their origination workflows, so adding it to the credit file. So that's a big deal for us to get into that space. In the auto space it\u2019s been used in closing for sub-prime customers, and now we're seeing it used more broadly because it increases the predictability of that underwriting decision. And so, it's really around our focus on differentiated data. But of course, the twin income and employment data is just very, very unique in that scale, which provide real value and of course, we didn't talk about it in this call, that government is also was very fast growing vertical for us. I talked about the new social security administration contract that extend in 2021. That's an example of how we're expanding the use cases of the twin data. And then of course, another growth area for us around the data is in employment decisions. When you're hiring someone, we call it talent solutions. So that's another area that we see future growth. So there's just a lot of levers for growth in that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.\nAshish Sabadra: Well, thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the clarification on the FMS. My question -- follow up question there was, when does that difficult comps form a big client and last year anniversary and when do you start seeing FMS get back to a more normalized growth profile? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Sorry. You're breaking up a little bit. Could you repeat that question.\nAshish Sabadra: Oh, sorry. Sorry about that. My question is on FMS. There was a difficult comp there. I was just wondering when does that difficult comp anniversary? And when do we get back to a more normalized growth in the FMS business?\nMark Begor: Yes. So your questions about the FMS business. First off, we're still in the COVID recession. And you know, that business provides data for both portfolio management and marketing. And as I pointed out my kind of say, John did too, lot of our customers have curtailed or slowed down, do account originations which affect their business. And so, when you talk about normalized growth, the first thing, or the biggest factor that's going to drive that will be a resumption of originations, which we started to see. We kind of did that. And we had a couple of customers in the quarter in September that started to originate -- started origination, and actually had origination volumes without -- revenue with us that were above last year. So we're starting to see signs those originations. John pointed out, we also add some a couple of larger deals if you will in 2019. And I would attribute that some part of the USIS recovery that haven't repeated in 2020. I would characterize most of that is driven by the COVID recession and the impact decisions our customers are making around assumption on originations. But we all know that our customers will start originating again, once their confidence grows, they have to -- that's a part of your business. You have to continue to add new customers. So it's just a matter of when they start doing that. And we would expect the business to grow there. On the portfolio management side, that's one where we've seen some increased activity. As customers are focused on managing the back book, we would expect that to continue to be a positive tailwind as we move into fourth quarter of 2021. Its typical as you're coming out of the recession, or in a recession, there's a lot of focus around managing your existing portfolio.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick follow up on the cost savings. Thanks for those details. I was wondering could you have a timeline by which we should start seeing those savings flow to the bottom line? And any incremental thoughts on how should we think about investments going forward? Thanks.\nMark Begor: That's one that we're not ready to get 2021 guidance, we're not giving guidance on. It is our plan to provide some visibility in the future -- in the near future around what we expect some of the benefits to be in 2021 as we have some level of framework for 2021. We're not sure we're going to be able to provide guidance. But we'll definitely do that. We're not ready to do that today. That said, we have been quite clear around what we expect the benefits to be, the sizing of the cost benefits that we're going to get from the cloud transformation, the cash benefits we expect to generate, which we believe are sizable. We haven't framed yet. We expect the revenue benefits to be -- those will all be firmly embedded in a long term framework when we put it back in place.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen.\nGeorge Mihalos: Great. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. I guess first to kick things off. Mark, I think you said that about 20% of verification revenues coming from inactive accounts. And I'm just curious, how long can an inactive account could be monetized? What's sort of the lifespan of an inactive account? And then, does that really skew to one vertical within EWS more than any other? So for example, mortgage where you're bundling services or something like that?\nMark Begor: That's great question. One, we haven't talked a lot about, 20% is a big percentage of our revenue. It's really going to -- every vertical has different use cases were having a multi-year period, multi-year history of someone\u2019s employment is quite valuable. There\u2019s a use case, which is someone working today, and how much did they make. And then there\u2019s other use cases as well, that they\u2019ve been working for the last 12 months, they have been working for the last two years. And as you know, people change jobs. So having a, multi-year, or a multi-job work history for someone is quite valuable. We have something like an average of 4.5 jobs per unique individual in the database, which makes sense. There\u2019s a lot of people that change more often over a five-year period, six-year period, two-year period than others, and then some that are in the same job. But that history of data is incredibly valuable. And there\u2019s some use cases where you have to have the history. So not only having what someone is doing today is less valuable, which really go down the path of like a someone who\u2019s going to provide a pay stub, that might work in some situation, most of our customers don\u2019t take those anymore. But would you have a use case, if someone wants to know, where did you work for the last two years, the only way to really prove that, and get it quickly and completely and accurately is to come to Workforce Solutions. So that\u2019s a wide data and if you go around verticals, it\u2019s really in every vertical, it\u2019s mortgages got a lot of use cases where it\u2019s very, very important to have a history of work, employment and income, auto has it, card, less so, all of those use cases where some card issuers are looking at that. In the government space, it's valuable, both today as well as history, and it just reflects the value of the business. It\u2019s taken as a decade to build up that 450 million records on individuals, it\u2019s just very, very valuable.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful color. Really appreciate it. And then just as a quick follow-up, I think obviously, within GTS partner is under increased pressure. And yes, I think if I caught the comments, you were suggesting that it will stay weak through the first half of next year. I\u2019m just curious if you could talk a little bit about the visibility that you have in that channel of the business going forward?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think we said during the first half of last year, I think we said we expected it to stay soft through the fourth quarter. We don\u2019t have visibility, just to be clear. But in our discussions with customers in that space, which is really in the lead generation space, it goes back to the origination point I had earlier around our USIS FMS business, customers, originators, whether your bank card or personal loan, clearly curtailed in the COVID recession, their origination. So that impacts our business and also impacts some of our partners to use our data in that Lead-gen space. So that'll come back over time. We don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s hard to forecast. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect it still to be weaken the fourth quarter on the Lead-gen side, just because we don\u2019t see signs. We see signs of improvement, but not to where it was a year ago.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay, great. Thank you. I misheard that one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on the tech transformation timeline. Anyway to think about the risk that that timeline bleeds into sort of 2022 with COVID?\nMark Begor: Yes, we\u2019ve been pretty clear on all of our calls during the COVID recession that, we\u2019ve been meeting our milestones. And we think that don't change our plans. And we talked a bunch on the call this already this morning around -- etcetera being in the cloud. So we\u2019re very pleased with our milestones. We\u2019re also very pleased with our migrations, remember just two people detect transpiration. One is getting the technology right and getting our data assets and application to the cloud. And then second is migrating our customers to waiting. So you saw that we\u2019re making good progress in the third quarter. And we expect to make good progress in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019re pleased with our progress, and there's still a lot of work to do, but we are meeting our internal milestones that we\u2019re trying to share with you transparently.\nJohn Gamble: And we compare that the focus is on North America, which is like 80% of the revenue. And we have indicated that some smaller properties or smaller business would trail out further into the future. But that will just become normal spend.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And you just want to follow-up on the mortgage market, specifically. Just on Fannie and Freddie any potential changes there, under either administration either more autonomy, new capital rules, privatization. Just any chatter on Fannie and Freddie and how that may impact you? Or is that not really a big deal? Thank you so much.\nMark Begor: Yes. We don\u2019t -- that there\u2019s a lot in that question. You get into what can happen, the elections versus Democratic versus Republican that you got to get into all that set in etcetera. I think that\u2019s probably a longer question. But I would say more broadly, specifically to Fannie and Freddie, we don\u2019t see any change in impacting Equifax if administration changes or not with Fannie and Freddie. Frankly, more broadly we don\u2019t see that how Equifax operates. We provide a very valuable service to U.S. consumers and to our customers. And we don\u2019t expect them to change whatever happens in November.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.\nBill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So this new I-9 product you guys introduced last week that takes the I-9 Management Suite down market to the small and midsize businesses. I realized that\u2019s part of the Employer Services, but and non-verification services. But is a strategy to use the I-9 product as a source of new leads for the work number?\nMark Begor: We like our talent solutions and Employer Services business is a compliment to our verification services business. And for us the idea of having more connections and services, with the HR manager who was providing us in making a decision to provide us their payroll records for the verification side of the business we think is positive. So, there\u2019s no question, we want to continue to expand, the services and products that we provide. On the I-9 side, we introduced a number of I-9 products that we\u2019re really pleased with in their performance on an I-9 anywhere that allows the expected employee to complete that process remotely, using a digital solution and in some of the smaller company products that we\u2019ve introduced. It\u2019s just examples of our focus on innovation and new products, hope to drive the business but to expand our relationship as I would characterize it with the HR manager. So we have more connections for the broader ecosystem that were for solutions.\nBill Warmington: Got it. And as a follow-up question. Just wanted to ask on the social security contract, that\u2019s starting up next year, the 40 million to 50 million in revenue, any additional color on the timing of the start of that revenue beginning of the year, middle of the year, something?\nMark Begor: Yes. Too early on that one. We certainly expect revenue in 2020, which is why we\u2019ve talked about it that way. A full run rate is going to be to $40 million to $50 million. It likely won\u2019t be full run rate for sure in 2021. But we\u2019re actively working on the technology elements with our customer and driving it forward. We talk about this contract just because of the size of it. It\u2019s unusual to have a contract of that size get landed. But it\u2019s just a reflection of the value of the Workforce Solutions data in so many different verticals and use cases in this case and the government space with the Social Security administration.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Andrew, you may have us on mute.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. It\u2019s been a long call, full of good information. Mark, I just wonder if you could address Equifax\u2019s position in Fintech. I know it's one of the areas in COVID that\u2019s maybe been a little bit weaker than some of the structural growth areas that you enumerated, but maybe a cyclical outlook there and also market share plans and outlook would be helpful.\nMark Begor: So, I think, we\u2019ve been clear, it\u2019s a space that we refocused on and started building out resources in the latter part of 2018. We added resources in 2019. I think from commercial resources, we\u2019re up probably between 2x and 3x what we had two years ago. So it\u2019s a space we want to be bigger in. We think we are well positioned to be bigger in it. We have pretty strong market position with most of the Fintechs with our TWN data where it\u2019s used, and of course, it\u2019s expanding usage during COVID. And we are working to take advantage of that relationship to move some of our credit data in. We\u2019ve had some positive wins. It\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, $250 million market in the United States. I think you know our competitors are much stronger than we are. But we think there\u2019s room for Equifax to grow. Many of those are single-sourced in the Fintech from starting out that way, and they\u2019re getting to scale where they could be dual source, which prevents an opportunity for Equifax, particularly when we\u2019re already in the door with our TWN data. They have been more impacted than how we characterized an FI, particularly because of their funding requirements. They typically aren\u2019t balance sheet funded. So they\u2019ve been more impacted on originations. But we stayed supporting them, and we\u2019re continuing to have some commercial wins during the last couple of quarters in that space. And it\u2019s an area that, since saying in the USIS team we are focused on, for growth in the future. We see it as a strategic market for us going forward.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Can you speak to the potential for competitors to replicate certain aspects of the work number database in the U.S. over a longer time frame? It certainly seem unlikely that they\u2019ve had the same level of integration with employers and the same number of employers. But are there other ways to gather some of the same data aspects, whether it be through some of the payroll processors or analyzing demand deposit accounts? I guess, I\u2019m just wondering, how you protect your moat there and whether alternative approaches to gathering income and employment data could result in alternatives for your customers down the road?\nMark Begor: Yes. We think we have real scale in the business, which provides a competitive advantage for us at Workforce Solutions. We\u2019ve owned this business for over a decade. And we\u2019ve invested between the acquisition of business and what we\u2019ve invested in technology and resources, a couple billion dollars over the last 10 years. And the scale of the business, we think provides some real strength in the competitive advantage. We talked about the history of the data, which is really hard to get, on an individual, worried about people or work the last two years or here at Equifax, where do you work the two years before that or the two years before that, collecting that data is quite challenging. We\u2019re participating in some of the other ways to collect data, you pointed out, bank transaction data and trying to impute it in, the net pay in someone\u2019s bank account that\u2019s a data source, but very difficult to get, the consumer have to consent to give the data. So we think that -- quite challenging. So we think there\u2019s just a lot of strengths around the business, we\u2019re always looking at who our competitors are in every business. And but this is one where we think we have similar market strength, given the scale of it. Maybe as you point out, the network of connections we have with so many customers. And then of course, we\u2019re now having a billion companies to deliver data to us on a fee per unit basis. And that makes this data set very, very valuable and tough to replicate. And if you\u2019re a company, you\u2019re likely not going to give the data to two companies. You\u2019re going to give it to the company that\u2019s been here for a long time. And we think that\u2019s another important element for Equifax, our strength of the business, our proprietary and security around it, the fact that we authenticate anyone who uses the data before they\u2019re able to use it. There\u2019s just a lot of security and protection around that, which is very important to those actually to own the data and contributed to us.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Yes. That makes sense. Thank you. And then switching gears a little bit on my follow up. So maybe you can speak to the margin performance in the international business in the third quarter? Margin expanded quite nicely year-over-year, despite the revenue decline. So I was just wondering if there\u2019s anything you point to specifically on the cost front in that segment, and they are now permanent [ph] some of those savings could potentially be?\nMark Begor: Yes, we did some costs work in International in 2019 that we\u2019re getting benefits from. And then there\u2019s been some tightening during 2020, during the COVID pandemic, as you point out, with pretty strong performance on margins. Given the revenue declines, which are still quite substantial in International because of the COVID pandemic. So, we expect those -- the COVID pandemic to get behind us economic activity improves that obviously, revenue should go with that and improve it, should be positive for the margins of that business going forward.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you. Good morning. So, John, I think you tried to print this question with the bridge you gave us on the slides. On the Q4 illustrative framework, EPS being down slightly on low double-digit revenue growth, it looks like a lot of the headwind factors are calling out in your bridge have been with you kind of all year. Yet, you had good EPS growth year-over-year, the first three quarter, so anything else to call out on Q4 EPS in the framework?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. The only other thing you see, you see although it\u2019s a little bigger than it\u2019s been in some of the other quarters, right? And that\u2019s really driven by the fact that the comment I made around corporate expenses, you\u2019re seeing a significant increase in incentive compensation because of the fact that the business has performed so incredibly well over the past two quarters. Our expected performance has improved quite significantly, and you\u2019re seeing that across different areas of incentives, including sales comp, etcetera, and that\u2019s affecting the fourth quarter because of the very, very strong performance. We continue that -- we continue to be spending related to the tech transformation and some of that\u2019s flowing through on tech expense, but those are the biggest drivers. The other thing that you\u2019ll see, and it\u2019s a footnote on the chart, right, is tax rate is actually higher in the fourth quarter, right, year-on-year. So that negatively affects -- that negatively affects the comparison as well by $0.03 or $0.04 a share. So those factors together are what drives the difference between the revenue growth and the EPS performance.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then I\u2019m struggling to understand the magnitude of the change in trends in the Q4 outlook for the GCS partner channel. Is this all about kind of activity at the lead-gens and member count not being backfilled yet on the churn side? Or was there any loss of partners or any changes of terms with sizable partners pricing or how they use you?\nMark Begor: Yes. There's a number of things in there, Jeff. And there certainly is \u2013 we\u2019re always working with our customers to help support them in tough economic events. So I think you can attribute that to changes in perhaps pricing and things like that. But then there\u2019s also the underlying volume is quite challenging, which is also a contributor as their customers and, of course, in our case, with our FMS business, still are not anywhere near pre-COVID levels with regards to originations.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Mark, you mentioned that core revenue growth was 6% in the quarter, excluding benefits from unemployment claims in the mortgage market. Can you talk a little bit about what may be driving the difference between the 6% core revenue growth and non-mortgage B2B revenue performance in the quarter that was roughly flatted down?\nMark Begor: I think if I follow your question, it's really going to be the outperformance of our mortgage businesses, which is Workforce Solutions is growing -- obviously, the mortgage market is up. As we highlighted on couple of slides in our comments, they\u2019ve got core growth in the mortgage business. So that\u2019s going to drive that. And the same with USIS at 600 basis points of growth in mortgage from core versus the mortgage market and Workforce Solutions multiples that from new records and new products, everything else. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it now, which we think is very positive in a COVID recession. And of course, the rest of the non-mortgage businesses at Equifax that are still negative in many markets and verticals because of the COVID recession, those surely will recover as economic activity comes back in the future, as we get through and past the COVID market effect.\nJohn Gamble: As Mark indicated, you\u2019re right, George, I mean it\u2019s our strategic focus to try to make sure we dramatically outgrow the mortgage market. And what that\u2019s showing is that we\u2019re achieving that very successfully even though the non-mortgage businesses are weaker because of COVID.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And looking at monthly trends, specifically in the non-mortgage business, USIS revenue has been largely consistent at down roughly 5% year-over-year moving through the quarter, and the non-mortgage EWS also consistently down about low single-digit if you exclude that jump that we saw in September. So, could you talk about some of the puts and takes around that to our non-mortgage revenue performance in 3Q that didn\u2019t seem to improve moving through the quarter. But the trend seemed relatively stable, so just some picture on that.\nMark Begor: I think it\u2019s really about those verticals really still not recovering and we expect they will. I think our competitors are seeing similar challenges with -- whether it\u2019s card originations or personal loan volume. The financial institutions are being quite conservative and that should be until they have some clarity around where the economy is going. When they do, they\u2019re going to start originating again and that will be positive for us as we go forward in our non-mortgage businesses.\nJohn Gamble: But to be clear, we did see improvement in September in the USIS non-mortgage relative to what we saw over the July, August period. It certainly did better. And we saw that improvement. We talked a little bit about that in the script. And the same is true in EWS. I think it did better. When I asked the question, I was simply trying to indicate don\u2019t expect 16% to continue, right. But we did see an improving trend both in USIS non-mortgage and EWS non-mortgage during the period.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.\nGary Bisbee: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. So I guess just to partner on innovation if I could. You have actually talked at the beginning of the tech transformation about the opportunity to decelerate innovation. I would love to just get a sense where you are with that and have you made enough progress that that is happening and if it is more of a for future opportunity, what is the timeline? And I guess the second part of that, the previous Equifax talked a lot about the concept of vitality and even use to talk annual classes of new products and sort of how the three year company forecasts for revenue on those were doing. Could you just help us think through that as well? Obviously went down from [Indiscernible] growing again is that a meaningful acceleration of innovation really that vitality going forward? Thank you.\nMark Begor: As you know, for the last couple of quarters you\u2019ve heard me talk about it because I really view it in the next chapter with Equifax really, accelerate our new product innovation. It\u2019s really levers the cloud investments that we\u2019re making. We believe that this is going to be a real catalyst for us to drive topline growth. You\u2019re seeing an EDS about the timing and you know it\u2019s really happening in 2019. We did it on the chart, we put in the in the early slides, we did 90 new products out from 16 in 2018. And that\u2019s up from in the 70 to 80, range, kind of pre cyber events. So in 2019, we\u2019re operating at higher level. And of course, we\u2019ve gone to 90 last year to around 110 in 2020. So there\u2019s clearly a renewed focus on it, you saw a few months ago, we brought in a new Chief Product Officer. We\u2019re adding new product talent resources to really scale up our ability to bring new products to market. And remember, one of the reasons we\u2019re making this cloud investments that we talked so much about it, because we\u2019re going to put all our data assets into a single data fabric. And we believe that\u2019s going to accelerate our ability to do data combinations and renew solutions to the marketplace. So that\u2019s what this new product team is going to be focused on is really leveraging the cloud investments that we\u2019re making. So what you're going to see benefits of it, you're seeing it today, you saw this quarter and we talked about some of the new products we're rolling out in the marketplace. That gives our commercial team more things to sell, and more solutions to bring to our customers. So going from 90 last year to 110 and my goal is to grow beyond the 110 in 2021, as we continue to invest in resources, and really leverage the cloud transformation. With regards to the vitality index, that\u2019s something that we've talked about before, I guess pre the cyber event. I think it\u2019s likely something we\u2019ll bring back to the dialogue with our investors. We already have plenty to talk about. But if there\u2019s interest in that, you will certainly bring that back. But new products are a key priority of ours. As I characterize it, it\u2019s the next chapter with Equifax, it\u2019s really going to drive our top line growth.\nJohn Gamble: And I mentioned this before, but absolutely our products that are launched on the new infrastructure that are benefiting us already. And Mark talked about Luminate in his script and other fraud products. That's certainly the case, eID we talked about. So, kind of the broad fraud suit is running on new infrastructure. And then we also talked about effect of the COVID response products that were built specifically on the new infrastructure, and then we couldn\u2019t have done otherwise. So, those are some examples. There are certainly more. And we are seeing benefits from it and we expected to dramatically accelerate as we get into the first quarter.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nJohn Gamble : Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.\nBrett Huff: Hey, thanks. This is a long call. So I\u2019ll just be quick. You talked a little bit about the analytics as one strategy and then unique data is another strategy. And I think we talked a lot about unique data today with EWS. Can you give us an update on sort of the next major phase of the analytics development you guys are thinking about, as we think about the economic recovery, not a position Equifax for that next phase of growth?\nMark Begor: Yes, there's a number of drivers there Brett that we\u2019ve talked about over the past couple of quarters. It starts with our Ignite, an analytics sandbox, I think, we've invested heavily in that, and we\u2019re rolling out in the marketplace. And that\u2019s a tool for our customers to access our data as well their own and really drive analytics and solution that will result in use of more of our data. So that\u2019s very, very positive for us. And of course, we have a large DNA team that is focused on creating new solutions. And we talked about some of those that really are from our analytics about combining data assets that increase the predictability in some of our COVID response products, to help our customers look at using trended data to understand how our customer outperformed in the past, to use that to create predictability to how they\u2019re going to perform in the future, adding income and employment data. Those are all part of our analytics to deliver a solution. And they result in more usage of our data or specific revenue opportunities and new scores or other ways that we deliver the analytics to drive the predictability of the decision for our customers. And we believe the cloud investments are really going to advantage us in more opportunities to bring new solutions from our DNA to the marketplace.\nBrett Huff: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in over here. Wanted to talk a little bit about the competitive environment, how you guys are doing outside of the mortgage markets in terms of like win rates and pipelines? I know John you comment about the pipeline being strong, is this kind of void space where you're able to go into it\u2019s like unique data, like the work number and credit card, or straight out and compensation are you guys kind of winning more outside the mortgage. Can you just kind of comment on that and if there\u2019s anything quantitative you can share?\nMark Begor: Yes. John shared some comments around our deal pipeline in USIS, which is your focus in orders that EWS pipeline is quite rich, as you might imagine it is an international DTH. But there is a lot of focus by our investors and/on Equifax, which is why we talk about the USIS deal pipeline in particular, the desktop dramatically over what it was last year and the year before, we're seeing increasing mid rates, you know, when I've used the term did \u2013 the USIS is a competitive marketplace now. In the COVID recession, that's harder to see, because you\u2019ve got the pressures of the economic impacts from our customers, on Equifax and on USIS, but we see the deal winds coming into the global recession, you saw the kind of strength of USIS revenue, non-mortgage numbers, using that in particular in the second half of 2019 and coming into the first quarter of 2020. And we seen competitively, during the recession -- the COVID recession impacts of the second quarter, third quarter, the USIS is performing quite well. So we still got a lot of confidence in that business and its recovery.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. I would like to now turn the conference back to Mr. Hare for any additional closing remarks.\nDorian Hare: I just want to thank everybody for joining the call and for their interest in Equifax. I just also want to let everybody know that we will be around today and in the days and weeks ahead to answer any follow up questions that you might have. So once again, thanks for joining and this does conclude the call.\nOperator: And this concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. I'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but we will refer to non-GAAP results as well. In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $155 million. Excluding non-recurring cost adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $109 million, up $38 million from 3Q 2019. Corporate function expenses, such as, finance, HR and legal were down year-to-year, reflecting the cost containment activities we outlined in April. The increase in total general corporate expense is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs in 2020 due to our strong and improving financial performance. We continue to exercise disciplined cost management across the business, while also continuing to invest in our technology transformation, data and analytics, new products and securities. We will accelerate investments in these areas in 2020 as we believe this will deliver accelerated benefits. Outside of these areas, head count additions remain at levels below attrition, and discretionary spending has been reduced. Across the company, business travel remains at very low levels. For 3Q 2020, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 21.2% and in line with our expectations. We expect the 4Q 2020 tax rate and full year effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS to be around 24%. In 3Q, 2020 and year-to-date, operating cash flow of $367 million and $645 million were up $532 million and $566 million, respectively from 2019. The increases reflect the substantial improvements and operating performance in 2020 as well as lower payments for litigation settlements in 3Q 2020 and year-to-date of $341 million and $246 million, respectively. The timing of payment of the remaining $347 million to the U.S. consumer restitution fund is principally dependent on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until early 2021. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong. At September 30, we had $1.5 billion in cash, and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility of $1.1 billion. As Mark mentioned, our 3Q results were substantially stronger than the implication of the trends through August that we discussed in our September 8 Investor Call. The improved results were predominately on our U.S. B2B business. Importantly, the improvement was in our U.S. online revenue, with significant improvement in non-mortgage revenue as well as in mortgage. We also had stronger results in international in Australia and Canada. The strength in adjusted EPS reflects the margin impact from the stronger revenue in September. Slide 13 through 15 show details of revenue trends on a local currency basis that we saw in 2Q and 3Q, as well as monthly data for July, August and September. We are also providing the view of the trends so far during the month of October, and their implications on 4Q 2020 if they were to continue throughout the quarter. For line items, for which daily trends are not available or not relevant, we did not provide monthly actuals, but did provide 2Q, 2020 and 3Q, 2020 data as well as an estimate for 4Q 2020. The monthly actuals data provided should be viewed as directional. Looking at slide 13, starting at the bottom of slide, U.S. B2B revenue growth trended very positively in September, growth into August and in 3Q 220 relative to Q2 2020 with U.S B2B revenue up 32% in 3Q 2020 year-to-year as compared to the 28% year-to-year growth we saw in 2Q 2020. This was driven by improved year-to-year growth in U.S. B2B online revenue. Mortgage year-to-year revenue growth strengthened significantly in September versus August and in 3Q 2020 year-to-year in both USIS and EWS. The stronger growth was in the context of a stronger mortgage market we saw in 3Q 2019 which grew 20% from 3Q 2018. Importantly, online non-mortgage revenue growth trends also improved meaningfully in both September and 3Q 2020. USIS non-mortgage revenue was down only 3% in September and 5% in 3Q 2020, year-to-year and EWS saw year-to-year growth and online non mortgage revenue in both September and third quarter 2020. Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business grew substantially year-to-year again in the third quarter of 2020, we expect strong growth in UC again in 4Q 2020, up about 30% year-to-year. The column on the far right of slide 13 provides a view on year to year revenue growth trends through mid-October and the implications on 4Q 2020 revenue that those trends should continue. A few reminders as we look at those trends. Fourth quarter and seasonally the lowest quarter for mortgage revenue, reducing the relative mix of mortgage revenue and overall Equifax revenue. 4Q 2019 saw a very strong growth in the US B2B online, about 18% driven by very strong 4Q 2019 online mortgage revenue growth of 34%. Again, starting at the bottom of the slide 13, implication of the revenue trends through mid-October continuing throughout 4Q 2020, U.S. B2B online year-to-year revenue continues to be extremely strong. The growth rate is just under 30%. Both USIS online and EWS online verification services growth rates will be very strong, but it levels slightly below what we saw in 3Q 2020. Mortgage revenue growth rates will be slightly weaker than in 3Q 2020, reflecting the strength in 4Q 2019 mortgage revenue, particularly in EWS. USIS non mortgage year-to-year growth rates would be about flat with 3Q 2020 and workforce non mortgage is expected to decline slightly versus a slight growth we saw in 3Q 2020. Workforce Solutions employment services year-to-year revenue would be up under 15%, but the unemployment insurance payments business continues to grow, but at levels lower than 3Q 2020. Financial Marketing Services revenue would be down consistent with the levels we saw in the third quarter. Turning to slide 14 as Mark discussed earlier, international saw significant improvements in all regions in 3Q 2020 with constant currency year-to-year revenue down that only 5%. Trends from mid-October international continues to improve and so the implementation of the revenue trends through mid-October and continuing throughout 4Q 2020, we expect International revenue to be down only slightly in the fourth quarter. GCS October trends reflect the continuation of those that Mark discussed earlier. In Consumer Direct growing total subscribers are expected to lead the second consecutive quarter of global direct revenue growth in 4Q. As we referenced last quarter, the declining partner revenue we saw in 3Q 2020 is expected to increase significantly in 4Q due to decline in the lead gen related partner business. We expect the weakness in partner revenue to continue into the first half of 2021. As with our prior two earnings calls and due to the continuing uncertainties in forecasting the direction, depth and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we are not going to provide fourth quarter guidance. However, the perspective on total Equifax 4Q 2020 performance, we will again provide an illustrative fourth quarter framework to help you think about our performance. Please turn to slide 15. To the extent, total Equifax revenue continues at the pace I described earlier, 4Q 2020 revenue would be up about 9.5% to 11.5%, or $84 million to $104 million year-to-year, resulting in 4Q 2020 revenue of $990 million to $1.01 billion. Adjusted EPS in 4Q 2020, these revenue levels could be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 a share down slightly from 4Q 2019. Slide 15 also provides a walkthrough explaining the translation versus 4Q 2019 of the revenue increase to the increase in pre-tax income and adjusted EPS. Importantly, these adjusted EPS level, Equifax to deliver over $350 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. [Indiscernible] guidance, there is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customers business activities, and therefore our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability and trends not a view of potential or outcomes. As I referenced earlier, trends in Equifax mortgage inquiry volume remain at record levels in the third quarter consistent with a very strong market data on originations. In addition to very strong refinancing activity, new purchase volume has been at record levels and the change was a period of 20% from last year. And as we referenced last quarter, for Black Knight estimates approximately 18 million household still benefits from refinancing at current average 30 in mortgage rates of under 2.9%. For perspective, current estimates of refinance originations in 2Q 2020 were under $1 million per month. As Mark referenced earlier, we continue to look to accelerate the completion of our tech transformation, including increasing investment levels in 2020. At present, we expect 2020 onetime cost related to the Equifax 2020 Technology and Data Security Transformation to be about $340 million. We expect capital spending to be about $410 million for the full year. As a reminder in 2021, we will no longer be adjusting our financial results for one-time costs related to the cloud technology transformation. The one time technology transportation costs are expected to decline substantially in 2021 and will likely be largest in 1Q 2021 decreasing throughout the remainder of 2021. These one-time technology transformation costs will impact development expense, G&A and COGS. We will continue to disclose these one-time tech transformation costs to allow you to have comparability with our financial results from 2017 through 2020. And with that I'll turn it back over to Mark. The first half of the question, Toni, it's obviously complicated. It's a -- economic event, a health event, like we've never seen before. Kind of broadly, the consumer is still fairly strong. Obviously, there's high-end employment, but some of the stimulus benefits that help the consumer. When we talk to our customers, their delinquencies, they are not increasing yet, because they're making minimum payments, and they're not behind in credit card payments, et cetera, kind of I'm talking broadly. So I think that's kind of what's happening so far. I think what we're all watching, is what happens as stimulus dollars one out. Are they're going to be using dollars, either pre or post the election in a few weeks, its tough to see. Where's unemployment going to go? Yes. And on top of that, what's the timing of vaccine? How quickly will it be deployed across the population, which obviously will drive economic activity. It's just a lot of challenging messages there we try to work through. What's underlying that, from our perspective, is that data is more valuable than ever for our customers. And that's what we're seeing. Obviously, our performance is quite strong. Data is being used to try to look through to who are the customers, the consumers that are still working. Who are the consumers that can take a line increase or having a mortgage refi or what is the data? So I think that's a positive for our industry. But you point out, which is why, we struggled providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. At this stage, it's still quite uncertain about where that consumer is going. Yes. We've been clear that, again, I don't want to give guidance. And as you know, we don't have a financial framework in place. But we've been pretty clear that our goal to get back to that. We've been investing heavily in our Tech Transformation. And we're getting the big spend in our Tech Transformation, certainly behind us in 2020. And our three-year plan. And we believe that our cash generation will accelerate as we go through 2021, 2022, 2023, which is going to provide free cash flow for us to invest in M&A, which we talked about earlier in the call. It's our intention to have more focus there. And we don't want to give any guidance around. Our intent to do a buyback or reads a dividend growth. But we've had that framework in place before. And we'll certainly consider its a right time when we put our financial framework and capital allocation plan back in place in the future. And we compare that the focus is on North America, which is like 80% of the revenue. And we have indicated that some smaller properties or smaller business would trail out further into the future. But that will just become normal spend. Yes. The only other thing you see, you see although it's a little bigger than it's been in some of the other quarters, right? And that's really driven by the fact that the comment I made around corporate expenses, you're seeing a significant increase in incentive compensation because of the fact that the business has performed so incredibly well over the past two quarters. Our expected performance has improved quite significantly, and you're seeing that across different areas of incentives, including sales comp, etcetera, and that's affecting the fourth quarter because of the very, very strong performance. We continue that -- we continue to be spending related to the tech transformation and some of that's flowing through on tech expense, but those are the biggest drivers. The other thing that you'll see, and it's a footnote on the chart, right, is tax rate is actually higher in the fourth quarter, right, year-on-year. So that negatively affects -- that negatively affects the comparison as well by $0.03 or $0.04 a share. So those factors together are what drives the difference between the revenue growth and the EPS performance. As Mark indicated, you're right, George, I mean it's our strategic focus to try to make sure we dramatically outgrow the mortgage market. And what that's showing is that we're achieving that very successfully even though the non-mortgage businesses are weaker because of COVID. But to be clear, we did see improvement in September in the USIS non-mortgage relative to what we saw over the July, August period. It certainly did better. And we saw that improvement. We talked a little bit about that in the script. And the same is true in EWS. I think it did better. When I asked the question, I was simply trying to indicate don't expect 16% to continue, right. But we did see an improving trend both in USIS non-mortgage and EWS non-mortgage during the period. And I mentioned this before, but absolutely our products that are launched on the new infrastructure that are benefiting us already. And Mark talked about Luminate in his script and other fraud products. That's certainly the case, eID we talked about. So, kind of the broad fraud suit is running on new infrastructure. And then we also talked about effect of the COVID response products that were built specifically on the new infrastructure, and then we couldn't have done otherwise. So, those are some examples. There are certainly more. And we are seeing benefits from it and we expected to dramatically accelerate as we get into the first quarter. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Dorain good everyone and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Businesses and consumers around the world continue to face challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you and your families are continuing to be safe in managing this unprecedented environment. At Equifax, we continue to make the health and safety of our 11,000 employees a top priority. Turning first to the slide deck on page number four. Before I cover our very strong third quarter performance, I wanted to recap our focus over the past 3 years to transform Equifax to drive revenue growth, margins and cash in the future. Today, we saw a unique industry and vertical customer and consumer challenges through our differentiated data assets and best-in-class, advanced analytics. Most of our differentiated and -- our most differentiated and most valuable data asset is our 2020 income and employment data. We are building an industry leading global native cloud data technology footprint enabled by best-in-class cloud-native tools that will leverage our new cloud based single data fabric. We've taken an industry leadership position in data security by changing our culture, our technology solutions and governance to ensure customer and consumer data is safer than it has ever before. We're relentlessly focused on a customer-first mentality, and we have a market-leading position in 25 countries. In building the new Equifax, we are executing on our $1.5 billion cloud, data and technology transformation that will move our data to a single cloud-native data fabric and into our legacy applications to the Google Cloud. We're ramping up our investments in innovation and product resources to drive new product acceleration by leveraging our cloud investments. We're strengthening our differentiated data portfolio with new unique data assets that complement our view of consumers. We're leveraging advanced analytics, our patented AI technology and cloud-native technology to deliver multi-data solutions, and we're differentiating our business portfolio by acquiring new capabilities and entering new areas of growth. Turning now to slide number five, the COVID pandemic has accelerated key market macros that are positive for Equifax and for the industry. First, in our data driven economy, it's clear that both deeper insights from comprehensive data sources like the U.S. consumer credit database at Equifax and the use of multiple and alternative data types are critical for risk management, customer prospecting, employment, verification, and an array of other activities engaged by our customers. More differentiated data was a positive macro prior to COVID-19. These economic impacts of the pandemic have only accelerated this trend around differentiated data. Differentiated data and analytics are more valuable than ever to our customers. Second, providers of credit are increasingly delivering real time and advanced analytics that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver incremental insights beyond core data. This trend has been accelerated during COVID, including instances where fraudsters have expanded efforts around fraud, account takeover or activities such as loan stacking and -- such as loan stacking. Identity and fraud solutions are increasingly valuable. Third, consumers, especially those from the digital age, have expectations that their financial and workplace interactions function digitally. We've seen this trend towards digital accelerate in the current COVID environment as face-to-face interactions have become increasingly rare. And last, Fintechs and alternative lenders are nimbly taking share of wallet from traditional financial institutions. We've seen this trend challenge somewhat the near-term due to economic pressures, including disruptions in capital flows, but we expect it will reaccelerate as we move into 2021. The Equifax team is laser focused on delivering solutions to help our customers meet the challenging economic demands caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our new cloud-native data and applications are delivering integrated basically data solution that we were unable to execute on and our legacy environment with unprecedented data, currency and speed. We're applying advanced analytics and alternative data assets towards the creation of trended insights that can better help our customers manage in this COVID environment where the consumer credit profiles are complicated by unemployment, salary reduction, furloughs and lower combinations. Our new cloud-based Luminate identity and fraud platform that uses these advanced analytics, along with machine learning and data orchestration, providing risk managers with greater insights to better manage fraud. And our solutions enable our organizations across industries to adopt new realities using digital solutions to interact with their customers, whether it's an automotive dealership looking to convert online browsers, to online purchasers without stepping for dealership or a credit union looking for way to support members while operating with a reduced branch footprint, Equifax solutions help organization of all types to drive new digital interactions. The COVID recession has accelerated key market macros around the value of broader data assets and real-time decisioning that will benefit Equifax in the future. Turning to slide six. It highlights how Equifax goes beyond the standard credit report to give lenders, employers, marketers and other service providers a fuller, more complete 360-degree picture of a consumer's financial life to enhance decisioning. We are working with our customers to leverage the traditional credit file that lenders already rely on to understand the financial profile of candidates for loans and services. Instead of focusing only on financial activity or delinquency over the past three to six months, our trended data and analytics allow lenders to look at delinquencies over an extended period while closely monitoring indicators of financial distress, such as utilization increases and loaning combinations. We estimate that this deeper view of traditional credit reports may allow nearly 4 million consumers who have recently moved down from prime and super-prime credit categories due to credit policy tightening to move back up. Consumers that may be good candidates for cards or personal loans who may otherwise be overlooked as lenders execute their traditional recession playbook. Even more importantly, alternative data in the form of Equifax's unique twin income and employment information has become increasingly critical as uncertain job market impacts underwriting and the ability of consumer to repay their loan. Unique data we provide helps lenders and consumers together to verify that a borrower is employed when a credit decision is made. The do-it-yourself alternative requesting hard copy employment and income verifications can lengthen process workflows and cannot be verified. We estimate that the addition of twin income and employment data into credit decisioning can move more than 7 million consumers up into prime and super-prime categories so they can receive larger loans and other services with renewed lender confidence. Telco, utility, bank transaction and commercial data are further examples of Equifax's unique and differentiated data sets. Our cloud technology transformation is delivering a single day of fabric that combines our multiple databases into one environment to enable more nimble innovation, insights and analytics, while at the same time, enhancing regulatory compliance. We have incredible appetite for new and differentiated data, and we believe and commercial data that that more data delivers better decisions for our customers. I hope this gives you a strong sense of our broad range of strategic initiatives as we are transforming Equifax for the future. Turning now to slide seven, and our third quarter financial results. Equifax continued with very strong performance again in the third quarter. I'm very encouraged by the resiliency and strength of Equifax and how our teams around the world are meeting the challenges of COVID to help our customers, partners and consumers. We are operating more effectively and efficiently with more energy and momentum than I've seen since I joined Equifax, and I believe we'll be a stronger, more resilient organization when this global pandemic is over. During the third quarter, we saw very strong revenue performance, particularly at Workforce Solutions and USIS, with broad-based improving revenue trends resulting in strong cash generation in EBITDA margins, while we continue to make incremental investments in technology and product and innovation in security. Revenue growth of 19% is the highest quarterly growth in our history, and we eclipsed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time in Equifax's history, all huge milestones. I'll talk more in a minute about our financial results. We continue to make proactive customer collaboration, a key priority in order to drive engagement, deal pipelines and new product innovation. During the quarter and past several weeks, I've been engaged with our key customers. This is the most challenging environment they've ever faced. Broadly, data is more valuable today than ever and our unique data assets like TWN and Advanced Analytics are critical to helping our customers navigate through this pandemic. We continue to take advantage of our strong cash generation to accelerate our cloud data technology transformation investments. Under Bryson Koehler's leadership and with the support of thousands of technology team members, we are making continued strong progress on our $1.5 billion technology transformation, and we are seeing new customers accessing our cloud-native solutions each week as our migrations accelerate. We're also continuing to expand our investments and resources around innovation in new products that are helping our customers manage today's challenging environment, but also with an eye on -- beyond the pandemic. Our transformation into a product led organization focused on innovation and enabled by best-in-class cloud-native data assets and world class technology is becoming more real every day and will power our business in 2021 and beyond. Our team's strong execution and outperformance in the third quarter is another very positive step forward for Equifax. Turning to slide eight. Our financial results for the third quarter were strong and broad based. Revenue of was $1.07 billion was up 19% on reported in local currency basis, which is well above our expectations in the framework of 10% to 12% that we shared with you in early September. M&A contributed less than 1% in the quarter. Our growth was again powered by our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions, which had a combined revenue up a very strong 32.5% and combined adjusted EBITDA margins of over 50%. Workforce Solutions continued their exceptional performance driven by the value of the TWN database with revenues up 57% in the quarter, while generating EBITDA margins of 58%. This marked Workforce Solutions' second consecutive quarter of 50% plus revenue growth, and USIS also exhibited strong revenue growth of 15%. Our strong U.S. B2B business performance continues to be powered by our focus on growth and our differentiated data assets. U.S. mortgage revenue was up almost 90% compared to the third quarter of 2019. U.S. mortgage market inquiries, our proxy for the overall mortgage market growth, were up 51% in the third quarter, driven by strength in both the new purchase and refinancing mortgage volumes. The driver of our U.S. B2B businesses substantial outperformance versus the market continues to be Workforce Solutions, where mortgage revenue more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter in a row. This was driven by the value that our customers place on our TWN income and employment data, the rollout of new products, the addition of new customers, improved customer penetration and expansion of our TWN data records. U.S. mortgage revenue growth of 57% also outpaced the market by 600 basis points. Our unemployment insurance claims business grew over 70% in the quarter with revenue of $50 million. In the third quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about $3.4 million initial unemployment claims, which is down from $7.5 million initial claims in the second quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to process roughly one in five U.S. initial unemployment claims. We expect unemployment claims to continue above 2019 levels in the fourth quarter, but at a reduced level compared with the third quarter. Excluding the growth from unemployment claims, which we would not expect to report in 2021, Equifax revenue growth was up a very strong 17% in the third quarter and is up over 12% year-to-date. Revenue growth drove adjusted EBITDA to $391 million, up 29%, with a 270 basis point expansion in our margins to 36.6%. We prudently balance cost controls while making target investments in our cloud transformation, new products and data and analytics. Adjusted EPS at $1.87 a share was up a strong 26% despite incurring increased depreciation and amortization and incremental cloud cost of $0.15 a share and increased interest expense of $0.06 per share from our second quarter bond offering. This exceeded our expectations in the framework of $1.50 to $1.60 we shared with you in September. USIS revenue of $386 million was up a very strong 15% in the third quarter with the M&A contribution less than 0.5%. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $179 million, was up 57% in the quarter as both purchase and refi transactions remained strong throughout the quarter and better than our expectations of up about 45% from our call last month. Non-mortgage revenue also strengthened in USIS sequentially in the quarter at down 6%, up from down 7% in the second quarter. Importantly, we saw a substantial improvement in non-mortgage online revenue, which was down only 5% as compared to almost 10% decline we saw in the second quarter. We saw a very good sequential improvement in banking, insurance, rental and direct-to-consumer, with insurance turning from down double-digits to up double-digits in the quarter. We are starting to see signs of customers restarting origination efforts with several major FI's revenue up versus 2019 for the first time in the pandemic, which is a positive sign for the future. In September, we saw positive growth in both insurance and direct-to-consumer, which although still negative, we saw improvements in banking and auto, both of which had only single digit declines. Financial Marketing services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line or batch business of $46 million was down 9%, consistent with our expectations. Marketing-related revenue, which represents just under 40% of FMS continue to be down significantly, but did show some improvement as we move through the third quarter. Risk decisioning, which includes portfolio review activities and represents about 40% of FMS revenue was down slightly due to a large onetime project last year. In identity and fraud related revenue, which represents about 20% of FMS was flat. I'm very encouraged by the progress of Sid Singh in the USIS teams continue to make especially during these challenging economic times. They are competitive commercially and on offense. We continue to see very strong new deal pipeline growth at USIS, with total pipeline value up over 30% versus last year, driven by growth in the volume and average size of our USIS pipeline opportunities. Larger deal opportunities are very positive sign as we look to accelerate USIS revenue growth. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 46% were up 160 basis points from last year and up 188 basis points sequentially. The improvements both year-to-year and sequentially were driven principally by the significant growth in high-margin online revenue. Turning now to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $377 million up a very strong 57%. Year-to-date revenue is already over $1 billion at Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and EWS team continue to leverage broad structural growth drivers, including new products, penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions to fuel their above-market growth. EWS remains our most differentiated business particularly in this unprecedented consumer environment where our TWN income and employment data is immensely valuable. Verification Service revenues at $301 million was up 63% versus 2019. Verification Services mortgage revenue more than doubled for the second quarter in a row, growing more than 80 percentage points faster than the 51% growth we saw in the mortgage market, credit imposed in the third quarter. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue was up about 4% in the quarter and slightly outperformed our expectations. Similar to the second quarter we continue to see growth in government and health care as well as in the auto vertical as we increase penetration of TWN. During the third quarter, we saw a significant recovery in talent solutions, reflecting both increased U.S. hiring and the rollout of new products. Consistent with second quarter, debt management continues to be very soft. Employer Services revenue of $76 million increased 37% in the quarter, driven by our unemployment claims business, which had revenue of $50 million and was up 70% compared to last year. Adjusting for the $20 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter, Employer Services was flat with revenue growth in I-9 and onboarding services that was driven by the acceleration of I-9 Anywhere solutions offset by declines in our tax credit business. Transaction activity in our I-9 and onboarding products improved through the third quarter and sequentially versus the second quarter, driven by new hiring activity with our customers. Many of the large retail shipping and e-commerce companies utilize our I-9 onboarding products. In addition, we're seeing a positive shift to our new remote I-9 product suite with new customer wins. Strong EWS Verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins in Workforce Solutions of 57.8%, a 900 basis point expansion from the prior year. Turning now to International. Their revenue of $218 million was down 5% on a constant currency basis, a substantial improvement from the down 15% in second quarter and better than our expectations as shelter-in-place orders were lifted at many markets and economic activity resumed. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, had a very good performance in the quarter with revenue of $80 million, about flat in local currency versus last year and better than the down 5% we expected earlier in September. Australia consumer online revenue was down 5% versus last year, a significant improvement from the down double digits we saw in second quarter. Our Australian commercial business, combined online and off-line revenue, was up 1% in the quarter, again, a nice improvement from the prior period. Fraud and Identity was also up over 15% in the third quarter versus the down 12% in second quarter. These areas of improvement offset declines in consumer marketing services, our consumer offline business and HR Solutions. Consistent with second quarter they continue to be down versus last year. New Zealand revenue was down just over 10% in the quarter, significant improvement to be down 25% in the second quarter. European revenues of $59 million were down 13% in local currency in the third quarter. Our European credit business was down about 7%, with Spain performing slightly better than the U.K. In the U.K, consumer online revenue was down just over 10%, a significant improvement from the down 20% we saw in second quarter. Analytical and Decision Solutions revenue was almost flat in the quarter, a significant improvement from about -- down about 20% in second quarter. Combined consumer online and analytical decision solutions represent about 75% of our U.K. CRA business. Similar to the U.S, our consumer offline business continues to show significant declines due to reductions in economic activity and credit originations. Banking revenue, driven by new wins with top 5 U.K. banks, was up over 25% in the quarter. Our U.K. banking team is seeing real momentum. Our European debt management business declined 20% in local currency, in line with our expectations, principally driven by government enacted policies that continued to temporarily halt debt collections due to COVID-19. U.K. government debt placement activities restarted in August. We expect fourth quarter debt management revenue to improve meaningfully as September debt placements were up 5x versus pre-COVID levels. Turning to Latin America. Their revenue of $40 million decreased 6% in local currency in the third quarter, better than the down 9% we expected earlier in the quarter. Importantly, our Latin America revenues were much better than the down 14% we saw in the second quarter. In the quarter, Chile our largest country in Latin America, delivered positive revenue growth. And our Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay businesses showed significant improvements from second quarter, down about 4% in the quarter versus 2019. These markets continue to benefit from the resumption of economic activity expansion of Ignite, the migration of customers to our global cloud-based interconnect SaaS decisioning platform. We're also seeing the benefit of the strong new product introductions over the past 3 years in the region. Canada revenue of $39 million was flat to local currency in the third quarter, a significant improvement from the down 13% in second quarter and in line with our expectations from our September call. Consumer online and commercial were both down about 5% in the third quarter, and both were a substantial improvement from almost 20% declines in the second quarter. Analytical and Decision Solutions were about flat in the quarter against substantial improvement from the second quarter. We delivered nice growth in Canada in our ID and Fraud business and Property Service businesses. It's combined with the improved performance of the other segments allowed us to improve to flat in the third quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.3% were up 130 basis points from last year, despite the decline in revenue, principally reflecting benefits from cost actions taken in 2019 and strong expense management this year. Turning now to Global Solutions revenue, which was down 2% on a reported and local currency basis in the quarter. Our Global Consumer Direct business was up 6%, their highest growth since 2017. Our North American Consumer Direct business revenue was up a solid 6% versus 2019, while the U.K. Consumer Direct revenue was about flat. Importantly, we continue to see sequential subscriber growth in the U.S. and Canada, our two largest markets. Based on a continuation of these trends, we expect our Consumer Direct business to show positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Ben Anderson and the GCS team have done a good job returning our Global Direct business to a growth mode. Our remaining GCS business is principally our partner businesses as well as our benefits channel and event-based businesses decreased about 10% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. We delivered 11% growth in our benefits channel and event based businesses, but this growth was more than offset by declines in our U.S. lead gen partner business as originations continue to be soft in the third quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.8% decreased 10 basis points compared to the prior year period due to increased marketing spend to drive future direct revenue and lower lead generation revenue, offset by onetime setup costs incurred during the third quarter of 2019 related to a new multiyear contract. Slide nine highlights the acceleration of revenue growth over the last several years and quarters, broken down between the growth drivers from the extraordinary UC claims revenue in 2020 from high unemployment and the strong U.S. mortgage revenue market to help you look through the impact of these strong market factors to the underlying Equifax core growth. As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, Equifax grew 19% overall with 200 basis points of debt [ph] growth from UC claim revenue and 11 points of Equifax revenue growth from the strong U.S. mortgage market. We are very pleased with the 6% core growth with strong sequential growth versus the minus 2% in second quarter, particularly with the headwinds from the COVID session. Equifax is clearly outperforming U.S. expectations in the COVID recession. The impact of the strong U.S. mortgage market is highlighted in purple and reflects growth driven directly by the strong underlying U.S. mortgage market. To be clear, this is not the growth of Equifax U.S. mortgage revenue, but is instead only growth directly attributable to the U.S. mortgage market itself that we estimate based on mortgage market credit inputs. During the third quarter, 11 points of Equifax's 19% growth was from the strong U.S. mortgage market. The impact of the extraordinary UC claims growth in 2020 is highlighted in blue. We are providing this given the dramatic unusual growth in the year we are seeing in 2020 that we expect to normalize overtime. Equifax core growth is in green, and reflects the resiliency and breadth of our business performance in the COVID recession. Essentially this is the sum of the growth in our U.S. non-mortgage businesses, our international businesses and GCS and growth in our U.S. mortgage businesses above underlying mortgage market growth. Excluding the impact of the U.S. mortgage market and UC claims, Equifax core growth has expanded from 2% to 3% in 2018 and 2019 during the global financial crisis to 5% in the first quarter and now 6% in the third quarter while we're still in the middle of the COVID pandemic. This performance reflects the resiliency and breadth of the Equifax portfolio. As I will cover on the next slide, it's important to recognize that in the third quarter a significant portion of the 6% of Equifax core growth is being driven by our outperformance in our U.S. B2B mortgage vertical powered by Workforce Solutions core growth, which was a strong 30% and USIS, which was only down 1% on a core growth basis. This ability to substantially outgrow the underlying market is core to our business model and a substantial strength that should continue to provide significant benefits through the balance of 2020 and into 2021. Equifax is dramatically stronger in 2020 versus the 2008, 2009 recession with revenue up 19% in the quarter and 12% in second quarter versus down 6% during the global financial crisis, again, reflecting the strength of today's Equifax portfolio. A continued strategic focus and strength of Equifax is our deep and broad array of products and solutions for the U.S. mortgage market and ability to consistently outgrow the underlying market. Slide 10 highlights this through our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Both Workforce Solutions and USIS have consistently outgrown the underlying U.S. mortgage market. The driver of the acceleration of this outperformance over the past several years has been a tremendous growth in Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, which exceeded mortgage market growth rates by over 20 points in 2019, accelerating to about 80 points of our performance this year. The key drivers of the strong Workforce Solutions performance includes increased market penetration, which, by this, we mean both an increase in the percentage of mortgage applications for which the underwriter requests an income and employment verification from Equifax and an increase in the number of times a mortgage underwriter requested income and employment verification during the application process. Both of these drive increased TWN inquiries. As we view U.S. mortgage marketing -- we view U.S. mortgage inquiries as a proxy for the overall market, an important metric we track is TWN inquiries as a percent of USIS credit inquiries. In third quarter, this metric for the first time exceeded 50%, where we had one TWN mortgage market inquiry for every two USIS credit mortgage marketing inquiries. This metric has been growing substantially over the past three years and has more than doubled since early 2018. However, at only 50%, it shows that we have a lot of runway ahead of us to reach the same utilization for TWN as a credit file. We are actively working with our customers to continue to drive penetration through both expanded selling efforts across our customer ecosystem and increasing customer system-to-system integrations. Second is increased fulfillment rate. This is the percentage of times we receive a mortgage inquiry that we can't fulfill and is driven by -- that we can fulfill and is driven by growth in the TWN database. While we have real scale at over 50% of the non-farm payroll database, we only fulfill roughly for 50% of our inquiries. As we add records via our immediately monetized, which provides real leverage for Workforce Solutions. Adding new TWN contributors and records is a priority for the EWS team. And third is new products. We continue to introduce new Workforce Solutions products that provide greater value to our customers in terms of depth of data and frequency of polls with higher price points in margins. We expect NPIs to accelerated Workforce Solutions from addition of new product resources and leverage from the cloud transformation. Workforce Solutions is clearly almost powerful business. Slide 11 shows their above market strong performance, which is highly accretive to Equifax revenue growth, margins and cash flow. Through third quarter, overall Workforce revenue growth of $332 million or 48% through 13 points of Equifax revenue growth and Workforce core revenue growth of $163 million contributed six points of Equifax core revenue growth versus last year. The impact on Equifax EBITDA was even more powerful with Workforce Solutions delivering $572 million of Equifax EBITDA or 44% of our total EBITDA through the third quarter. Equifax is the powerful business and important driver of Equifax results in 2020 and in the future. As shown on Slide 12, you can see the continuing growth in our TWN database, which has been a significant driver of value to our customers and the growth in Workforce Solutions. In the third quarter, we continue to add TWN records and delivered new TWN record growth of 6 million active records in the quarter, even in the high end unemployment environment, which grow TWN database over 111 million records, up from 105 million, we had at the end of first quarter and second quarter. TWN records are up has grown 20% versus 2019. We also had significant milestone in the third quarter with contributors surpassing the 1 million level, this is our million company in the United States that are contributing to payroll records at Equifax up from 64,000 a year ago, which has moved the TWN database deeply into small ended market companies. With the TWN database now providing information on over 88 million unique individuals, firmly over half of the U.S. non-farm payroll, we view this as a catalyst for Workforce Solutions, given the increasing hit rates and uniqueness of the data. As we discussed previously, the Workforce Solutions team is expanding their focus on records beyond just W-2 payroll into areas like 1099 employees to give economy and pension income. The increasing depth of the TWN database was now over 415 million total records had the additional benefit of increasing the completeness of an individual job history that we have in the database. This also significantly increases the value of the unique TWN data for both credit decisioning as well as in Talent Solutions and other applications. As a reminder, we generated almost 20% of our verification services revenue from inactive records that we built up over the past decade, which helps to provide a full picture of individual employment history. This also expands the uniqueness and value of TWN, which is other sources of income for employment data. And what has been the most challenging economic and health environment we faced in our lifetime, Equifax delivered exceptionally strong performance again in the third quarter, while investing in our cloud transformation and new products. We are focused on finishing 2020 strong, while investing for 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the discussion over to John to discuss recent trends in revenue in our growing markets as results -- as well as reducing other financial items. After John's discussion, I will come back and review our progress on the tech transformation and new products. Thanks, John. I'll wrap up with an update on our cloud technology and data transformation and our accelerated focus on new products. Turning to slide 16. Equifax continues to make very meaningful progress on our cloud data technology transformation. We're energized by the revenue, cost margin and cash benefits we expect from our cloud investments. Through a single cloud native data fabric and common cloud -- global cloud based infrastructure, to be able to innovate, to develop more robust Product Solutions and multi-data insights that are portable around the world enabled by our differentiated cloud data technology to be able to unlock new use cases and verticals, with our solutions for new and existing customers. Our cloud based infrastructure will also enable us to accelerate the velocity at which we can develop new products from months to weeks. Accelerating the benefits our customers receive from these products in driving our revenue growth. We're already starting to see increased system availability as we move from our legacy technology into the cloud and we expect this trend to continue. All the non-capability are table stakes and global technology company we believe that as more customers moved to the cloud -- the cloud operability will deliver best-in-class systems availability, and customer interaction seamless and faster. And lastly, we're continuing on our path to being industry leader in data security. Our security is core to everything we do that by advancements in data governance. We know that data security is a battle that we must fight alongside our industry peers and our customers every day. Starting to slide 17, we moved in the final phase of our North America technology transformation with a focus on customer migrations. We continue our progress to migrate our customers into our new cloud based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite and API capabilities. As a reminder this is the common set of services on which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. At the end -- as of the end of the third quarter, USIS has migrated over 4800 U.S. customers, and Internationals completed migrations of about 6500 customers. For USIS it is up about 4x from the about 1200 customers migrated at the end of June. We continue to expect this pace of migration to accelerate in the fourth quarter with over 10,000 U.S. customer migrations expected by year end with the remaining U.S. customer migrations completed during 2021. We continue to adapt our development priorities at platform capabilities to use our customer's ability to easily migrate to our new platforms. Our progress on the transformation since our last earnings call in July is positive. Initial and draft migration to GCP of our major North American exchange data to U.S. and Canadian consumer agro [ph] risk exchanges, the world's number in [Indiscernible] is principally complete, and we expect to have completed full migration including all data ingestion processes for these exchanges by year end. This distinct milestone with this exchange is generating about 70% of North America Online revenue. We're also making very good progress in the full migration to GDP, our secondary U.S. exchanges, the U.S. and Canadian commercial risk exchanges, property and data exchanges. These exchanges are expected to be to complete full migration as we move through 2021. Investments in Europe by TAM and Australia in deploying cloud native Data Fabric and our Ignite Interconnect API analytical decisioning framework are also progressing well. Data Fabric is live in six global cloud regions globally. We completed the initial migration of our eID identity validation system in the third quarter and started customer migrations, which we expect to complete by year-end. In our Luminate Cloud Identity [Indiscernible] it is now available to customers in the U.S. and Canada. And in eID cloud-native service is also available for U.S. as part of our newly transformed cloud Luminate offering. Additional data sources will continue to be integrated on a regular basis as we move forward. We still have plenty of work in front of us, but we are making strong progress in our cloud data and technology transformation. We remain energized about the future top and bottom line benefits. Our cloud-native data and infrastructure will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace today, and be even more valuable as we complete the transformation. Planning [ph] team highlights our expanded new product innovation focus, which is a key component of our EFS 2020 strategy in the next chapter at Equifax. As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on transforming our company to a product led organization and powered by best-in-class cloud-native data and technology to fuel growth. As we progress through 2020, we continue to make strong progress on our goals to expand our NPI rollouts, and are on track to deliver about 110 new products in 2020. Through September, we launched about 85 new products, and we have an active pipeline in various stages of the funnel. In the third quarter, we continued our strong focus on recession based product launches, including our response recovery, product offering, which provide lenders and service providers, the data and analytics they need to both care for their customers and ensure the long-term health of their portfolios. Response recovery enabled by our night market intelligence sandbox provides lenders access to point in time and trend to consumer insights in order to make better underwriting decisions during a period of economic instability, as well as get the information they need to reach out and support their existing customers already in a combination situation and other institutions. In USIS, we continue to build on our strengthening commercial business. In the third quarter, USIS launch B2B Connect, designed to help enterprises better prospect, segment and retain key business clients with intelligence on more than 150 million global companies, including 53 million U.S. businesses and 80 million B2B contracts. B2B Connects is providing an extended omni-channel view of businesses, businesses companies need to better qualified commercial prospects and improve engagement with existing customers. The commercial B2B product will be further enhanced by data from our recent acquisition of Ansonia, which brings unique commercial leasing data to our already robust set of commercial assets At Workforce Solutions, we continue to focus on the hiring process. This is as a significant growth opportunity for our business, as there are more than 70 million new hires per year in the United States. In the third quarter, Workforce Solutions launched the first -- the industry's first I-9 management service designed specifically as an e-commerce platform in the small and mid-sized business owners aligned. For years, large enterprise businesses have put their trust in the market leading I-9 management solution from Equifax. Now with the e-commerce launches of our I-9 starter and our I-9 standard packages, Equifax makes it easier than ever for businesses of any size to be manage their I-9 requirements. With an automated I-9 platform, organizations can have more confidence in their onboarding and I-9 compliance and deliver better onboarding experience for the new hires. Workforce Solutions also continue to innovate and uses new solutions to both support their financial and mortgage verticals in 2020, including our new mortgage trended income, employment and multi-borrower products. NPI continue to be an important lever for Equifax growth and a priority for me and the team. We've expanded our focus and resources on driving NPI loss in 2020 and more recently, with a global focus on products that support our customers during the COVID recession. We will continue to prioritize new products and innovations as we move into 2021 to leverage our cloud data and technology transformation for future growth. Wrapping up on slide 19, as John outlined earlier, we're still unable to provide guidance for the fourth quarter. We still see meaningful uncertainty from the impacts from the COVID pandemic as cases rise and many markets impacting shelter in place orders, consumer confidence and economic activity. There's also a real risk of the second COVID wave and potential increased lockdowns. We also expect further impacts from our employment, furloughs and salary reductions. But even in this challenging COVID environment, Equifax is operating exceptionally well. Our strong business model is resilient in delivering while investing in the future. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and towards 2021 and beyond, we are confident in the drivers of our business model into our growth strategy. Our strong 19% growth in the third quarter affects the breath and resiliency of the Equifax business model. The strong U.S. mortgage market and UC Claims revenue was delivering incremental revenue, margin in cash that allows Equifax to continue to be aggressive about investing our cloud transformation, while expanding new investment in innovation, new products in D&A. Our strong results also strengthen our balance sheet to allow us to focus on accretive M&A. Our third quarter closed 6% revenue growth exclude the impact of U.S. mortgage market and US Claims revenue, a very strong performance in the COVID environment, with our non-mortgage in international business is still pressure from the COVID recession. We expect those markets to recover in the future with the roll-out of a broad based COVID vaccine as markets recover and economic activity improves. Workforce Solutions is clearly a franchise Equifax business that is strongly outperforming with multiple structural growth levers from new records, new product, improving product mix with new motor multiples and incremental poles driven by the growth in system and system integrations. While the mortgage market is a positive tailwind this year for Workforce Solutions, they underlined 27% core growth year-to-date excluding the impact of UC Claims and the mortgage market reflects the power and breath of the Workforce Solutions business model. Their multiple structural growth levers give us confidence in our ability to drive future incremental value for our customers and future revenue growth for Equifax. And the addition of 6 million records in the third quarter will drive revenue growth in the future. Our new SSA contract, Social Security Administration contracts that will begin generating $40 million to $50 million of annualized revenue starting next year is another feature of Workflow Solution growth driver. We are also seeing enhanced and broadened value of unique twin income and employment data given the scale and depth of the database. Turning it to USIS, they also have a strong quarter lead by growth mortgage. USIS has done offense in winning in the marketplace. USIS revenue is outperforming in the COVID recession with total third quarter growth improving to down 1%, excluding growth in the U.S. mortgage market. The USIS mortgage business continues to outgrow the market with nine points to core growth in third quarter, up from six points in the second quarter. Importantly, USIS pipelines remains our highest levels since 2017 from a new commercial focus and rollout of new products. As we look out beyond the impacts of the COVID pandemic, we believe that our non-mortgage revenues, which historically represent about 70% of USIS revenue are poised to growth, USIS is competitive in winning in the marketplace. Our international business has a well balanced portfolio of global businesses representing over 20% of Equifax revenues that have historically driven top line revenue growth through new products and analytics. Unlike our U.S. B2B businesses, most of our international markets do not have mortgage businesses, and therefore not have seen a larger decline in revenue growth in 2020. From the deeper COVID recessions in more severe GDP declines that have also impacted growth. We began to see recovery and International markets in the third quarter with Australia and Canada flat versus last year, and expect to see continued improvement as economic activity resume forward. And last, our GCS Direct business is poised for continued growth behind our disciplined investments. Our B2C [ph] businesses are improving as we invest in new products and marketing and we surpassed 7 million My Equifax members in the quarter, which is a sizable base to cross-sell financial products. Since I summarize, we're making very good progress on our cloud transformation and data transformation, with significant milestones being achieved on customer migration accelerate. We are energized about the significant top line cost and cash benefits that will come from this transformation, including always on stability, speed to market, ability to rapidly move products around the globe, which we expect will help us improve our position in the marketplace. And last, our balance sheet is strengthened in 2020 from our strong performance, allowing us to be aggressive about investing in our index 2020 Cloud Data and Technology Transformation, new products and data security, while looking for creative bolt on acquisitions that will add to our strategy. As we continue to deliver above market results in the COVID recession and focus on investing for future growth, I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market leading data, analytics and technology company. With that operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes. It's a great question. You've seen over the last several years, and certainly in 2020, strong top line performance from Workforce Solutions and that has certainly translated into margin growth. As you know, in our industry, internet business in particular, but in all our businesses incremental revenue growth drives very attractive incremental margins. We've seen a very strong performance in 2020. We expect that this is to continue to perform in the future. And I think we're prepared to give a guidance around margins for the future, because we can't do that broadly. But we've got a lot of confidence in the Workforce Solutions business, given the multiple levers that they have to drive future growth. Yes. It's less about the employers and records. It's really what you pointed out. It's really getting into one of our customers and showing them the value of the product. It's also driven by new products. We talked about in the last couple of calls that Workforce Solutions is rolling out new products that provide multiple polls and a package for mortgage application as one purchase from Equifax. And we see that driving some of the polls. We also see the system and system integrations being a real driver, where we're getting embedded in our customer workflows. And we've got a dedicated team that works on that with our customers to show them the value of the income employment data. And then, as you pointed out just getting in front of customers, so they understand, the lift they're getting in predictability. If you're a mortgage originator, and you're going to spend, call it $4,000 in a mortgage application. When you start that application process, you want to make sure that you're working with a customer that is going to be able to be approved. Part of that is historically pulling the credit file upfront to understand what the credit profile of that customer. And that's kind of a common practice today, increasingly, the more sophisticated mortgage originators are starting to pull upfront, the income employment data, particularly in this environment, understanding where are people still employed and then pulling it multiple times. So those are just multiple opportunities that the team has in using mortgage as an example. And, of course, the same holds in other verticals where we're seeing, particularly the database becomes almost a catalyst, it's over -- well over 50% of the non-farm payroll, it's becoming an asset that the hit rates are very valuable in multiple verticals beyond mortgage. Manav, I apologize, I miss the first portion of the question. Can you give us a quick reference? Yes. Obviously, we have a large mortgage business. We're benefiting from the market tailwinds. We've got a real focus on rolling out new products, in particularly Workforce Solutions, but also in the USIS, our UDM products, are another growth area for us. And I think what we're pleased with is the fact that both USIS and Workforce Solutions are outgrowing the mortgage market. Now, how do you do that? Will you do that with new products, new solutions, blogging more usage of your products, in particular, that's around the twin income employment database were pulled more frequently. And then just the system, the system integrations where we still have a lot of one way to work with our customers to convert them from dialing in and keying into the system on an individual applicant basis to pull the income employment data to go into system integrations, which is as you know is more on the credit file side. But it's one that's an opportunity on the income employment side. And that really we've seen big lifts in utilization, when we are embedded in the workflows and the income employment data. We've had great progress in adding those in the third quarter in 2020. Yes. And that's been an area that we've been clear that we're going to invest more. We see opportunities to do that to accelerate the transformation. And just to be clear, and I know you notice, but $1.5 billion we now talk about is the incremental spend in 2018, 2019 and 2020. So that's going to be behind us. And that's how much we're going to spend through the end of the year. We'll obviously be spending money on our technology as we go into 2021 and beyond that, that's going to be in our one rate spend versus the incremental spend that we talked about. And with our strong financial performance in the second half of 2019, we started investing more in the Tech Transformation. And as we continued in 2020, and performed so strongly during the COVID recession, we've made strategic decisions to accelerate our spend in order to drive it more rapidly. We think that's the right thing to do, because of the sizeable benefits that we expect to get from the transformation. So, in terms of total mortgage revenue, total mortgage revenues are little over a third of Equifax total revenue. So that's the best way we'll estimate that. In terms of September non-mortgage for EWS, we have substantial business with government and other participants. And so it can just be a little choppy. And obviously, the underlying revenue base isn't that large. So just movements between months can result in different growth rates between the months quite understood, so that's why we indicate that when you're looking at those numbers you can consider them indicative. And that's why we focus a lot more on the quarterly numbers. In terms of your question on September at minus three and in the quarter minus five and our discussion around mid-October at above minus five. Again, the above minus five and above minus three to us are very similar numbers, right? And September's monthly data. So I think the important fact is we are seeing an improvement trend. We expect that we're seeing our business improve in non-mortgage, and we're very happy with that trend. But as we look through the rest of the fourth quarter, above 5% is can be a little bit on either side of 5%. David, I think we're going to try to avoid getting you to 2021 guidance, but we were quite intentional because we're getting the same questions you're getting about what -- how do we look through Equifax is very strong performance in the year, particularly from the incremental UC claims revenue, which is meaningful, that we've highlighted will likely normalize in 2021 with unemployment, presumably coming down our unemployment claims not continuing. And then, of course, the U.S. mortgage market. U.S. mortgage market, that's one that is difficult for us to -- John talk a little bit about that one. We can't forecast what's going to happen in 2021 on the mortgage market, but the fundamentals are still quite positive for 2021 in the U.S. mortgage market with the Fed stating pretty strongly that they're going to keep interest rates at the record lows through 2021. That's a positive for refinancings and for purchase volume. We've seen purchase volume really accelerate in the last 90 days in the United States. Consumers are going out to buy homes or upgrade to get larger homes or move to the suburbs. And again, we're not forecasting, but it feels like there's some legs on that macro. And then of course, the refinance side, there's still a very sizable population, as John pointed out by consumers that have not refinance their mortgages yet, that there's multiple quarters of that benefit. With regards to 2021, you highlight some of the positives for Equifax. You can start with a lot of businesses are still challenged by the COVID pandemic and we're not forecasting 2021. But if you believe that there's going to be a vaccine, and the vaccine is going to result in more normal recovery of some sort, that's going to be good news for Equifax. International, our non-mortgage businesses in the United States, more RTGS business. So that's a positive as we go forward. You point out the power of Workforce Solutions. As we entered the pandemic USIS within a recovery mode following a cyber-event, we believe USIS is performing quite strongly on a mortgage and non-mortgage basis during the pandemic. But as we get into more of an economic recovery, we expect that to accelerating as exhibited by the deal pipelines are growing and the needs increased commercial activity. And of course, Workforce Solutions, we tested to really highlight how important that business is, how important is performance is. They've got a long list of structural levers, that they can -- that they're bit pulling and will continue to pull and you pointed our records, 6 million addition in the quarter is going to serve them well with higher hit rates and drives higher revenue in the fourth quarter and into 2021. And of course, the other elements of the business. So out attempt in providing the additional disclosures this quarter was to help you and our investors, see through the underlying performance in the COVID recession. And again, we're still in a COVID recession, Equifax delivering 6% core growth is really quite strong. And the tail winds, if you add on top of that, the benefits from the Tech Transformation as we talked about the very clear will begin really kicking in 2021, which would be another positive for us on both our top line margins and cash generation. Yes. First off on, more records is more value, right? And more contributors is doing, they are moving up 6 million records this quarter. We think is a big milestone where we were flat in the second quarter. But there's some bumpiness to when records come in, and we had a very strong order of execution there. We're up 20% in records year-over-year. As you know, that's going to drive hit rates and revenue growth going forward. And then to your point, you did see really the addition of some more companies. There's all kinds of numbers out there on how many companies there are in the United States, whether it's three or four or five million, but going from 69,000, a year ago to a million companies really does increase the breadth and depth of the database. So that's very, very positive for Equifax and for our customers. As you know, one area where the database is huge, is what I would call, the near-prime or sub-prime customers, and you see those customers and all kinds of companies, but adding more companies, million companies just brings more value to the database. And we're really intently focused on continuing to grow the database. We also mentioned earlier in the comments that getting to this level of scale, having 88 million uniques, or 107 million active, as well as inactive, really takes the database almost as a catalyst of being very, very valuable just because they hit rates go up. And the other thing I've commented on is that the team is expanding their focus. We've had a W2 focus on non-farm payrolls for a long, long time. And in the last year, we started to expand that focus around the gig economy 1099 that we're actually ingesting now into our database, 1099 income data. Pension data is another one that we've got our sights set on for those. We're going to hit towards non-farm payroll, that's going to take time. But we've expanded our focus to go well beyond that to get all levels of employment or other income that consumers are having. So it will become really one stop shop for all that data. It is. That's a big focus for us and we talk on prior calls that the values always been there. And we shared with you and others that if you take credit data, and add income employment data to what the predictability or the chaos for from that decision goes up dramatically. So that's always in the back, it's one that we've been sharing with our customers for years. The COVID crisis has created a catalyst for that. And we talked about in the last call. On the second quarter call that we're seeing, for example, credit card customers. We've got a couple of major credit card customers that are now embedding the work number data into their origination workflows, so adding it to the credit file. So that's a big deal for us to get into that space. In the auto space it's been used in closing for sub-prime customers, and now we're seeing it used more broadly because it increases the predictability of that underwriting decision. And so, it's really around our focus on differentiated data. But of course, the twin income and employment data is just very, very unique in that scale, which provide real value and of course, we didn't talk about it in this call, that government is also was very fast growing vertical for us. I talked about the new social security administration contract that extend in 2021. That's an example of how we're expanding the use cases of the twin data. And then of course, another growth area for us around the data is in employment decisions. When you're hiring someone, we call it talent solutions. So that's another area that we see future growth. So there's just a lot of levers for growth in that business. Sorry. You're breaking up a little bit. Could you repeat that question. Yes. So your questions about the FMS business. First off, we're still in the COVID recession. And you know, that business provides data for both portfolio management and marketing. And as I pointed out my kind of say, John did too, lot of our customers have curtailed or slowed down, do account originations which affect their business. And so, when you talk about normalized growth, the first thing, or the biggest factor that's going to drive that will be a resumption of originations, which we started to see. We kind of did that. And we had a couple of customers in the quarter in September that started to originate -- started origination, and actually had origination volumes without -- revenue with us that were above last year. So we're starting to see signs those originations. John pointed out, we also add some a couple of larger deals if you will in 2019. And I would attribute that some part of the USIS recovery that haven't repeated in 2020. I would characterize most of that is driven by the COVID recession and the impact decisions our customers are making around assumption on originations. But we all know that our customers will start originating again, once their confidence grows, they have to -- that's a part of your business. You have to continue to add new customers. So it's just a matter of when they start doing that. And we would expect the business to grow there. On the portfolio management side, that's one where we've seen some increased activity. As customers are focused on managing the back book, we would expect that to continue to be a positive tailwind as we move into fourth quarter of 2021. Its typical as you're coming out of the recession, or in a recession, there's a lot of focus around managing your existing portfolio. That's one that we're not ready to get 2021 guidance, we're not giving guidance on. It is our plan to provide some visibility in the future -- in the near future around what we expect some of the benefits to be in 2021 as we have some level of framework for 2021. We're not sure we're going to be able to provide guidance. But we'll definitely do that. We're not ready to do that today. That said, we have been quite clear around what we expect the benefits to be, the sizing of the cost benefits that we're going to get from the cloud transformation, the cash benefits we expect to generate, which we believe are sizable. We haven't framed yet. We expect the revenue benefits to be -- those will all be firmly embedded in a long term framework when we put it back in place. That's great question. One, we haven't talked a lot about, 20% is a big percentage of our revenue. It's really going to -- every vertical has different use cases were having a multi-year period, multi-year history of someone's employment is quite valuable. There's a use case, which is someone working today, and how much did they make. And then there's other use cases as well, that they've been working for the last 12 months, they have been working for the last two years. And as you know, people change jobs. So having a, multi-year, or a multi-job work history for someone is quite valuable. We have something like an average of 4.5 jobs per unique individual in the database, which makes sense. There's a lot of people that change more often over a five-year period, six-year period, two-year period than others, and then some that are in the same job. But that history of data is incredibly valuable. And there's some use cases where you have to have the history. So not only having what someone is doing today is less valuable, which really go down the path of like a someone who's going to provide a pay stub, that might work in some situation, most of our customers don't take those anymore. But would you have a use case, if someone wants to know, where did you work for the last two years, the only way to really prove that, and get it quickly and completely and accurately is to come to Workforce Solutions. So that's a wide data and if you go around verticals, it's really in every vertical, it's mortgages got a lot of use cases where it's very, very important to have a history of work, employment and income, auto has it, card, less so, all of those use cases where some card issuers are looking at that. In the government space, it's valuable, both today as well as history, and it just reflects the value of the business. It's taken as a decade to build up that 450 million records on individuals, it's just very, very valuable. Yes. I think we said during the first half of last year, I think we said we expected it to stay soft through the fourth quarter. We don't have visibility, just to be clear. But in our discussions with customers in that space, which is really in the lead generation space, it goes back to the origination point I had earlier around our USIS FMS business, customers, originators, whether your bank card or personal loan, clearly curtailed in the COVID recession, their origination. So that impacts our business and also impacts some of our partners to use our data in that Lead-gen space. So that'll come back over time. We don't know what it is. It's hard to forecast. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect it still to be weaken the fourth quarter on the Lead-gen side, just because we don't see signs. We see signs of improvement, but not to where it was a year ago. Yes, we've been pretty clear on all of our calls during the COVID recession that, we've been meeting our milestones. And we think that don't change our plans. And we talked a bunch on the call this already this morning around -- etcetera being in the cloud. So we're very pleased with our milestones. We're also very pleased with our migrations, remember just two people detect transpiration. One is getting the technology right and getting our data assets and application to the cloud. And then second is migrating our customers to waiting. So you saw that we're making good progress in the third quarter. And we expect to make good progress in the fourth quarter. So, we're pleased with our progress, and there's still a lot of work to do, but we are meeting our internal milestones that we're trying to share with you transparently. Yes. We don't -- that there's a lot in that question. You get into what can happen, the elections versus Democratic versus Republican that you got to get into all that set in etcetera. I think that's probably a longer question. But I would say more broadly, specifically to Fannie and Freddie, we don't see any change in impacting Equifax if administration changes or not with Fannie and Freddie. Frankly, more broadly we don't see that how Equifax operates. We provide a very valuable service to U.S. consumers and to our customers. And we don't expect them to change whatever happens in November. We like our talent solutions and Employer Services business is a compliment to our verification services business. And for us the idea of having more connections and services, with the HR manager who was providing us in making a decision to provide us their payroll records for the verification side of the business we think is positive. So, there's no question, we want to continue to expand, the services and products that we provide. On the I-9 side, we introduced a number of I-9 products that we're really pleased with in their performance on an I-9 anywhere that allows the expected employee to complete that process remotely, using a digital solution and in some of the smaller company products that we've introduced. It's just examples of our focus on innovation and new products, hope to drive the business but to expand our relationship as I would characterize it with the HR manager. So we have more connections for the broader ecosystem that were for solutions. Yes. Too early on that one. We certainly expect revenue in 2020, which is why we've talked about it that way. A full run rate is going to be to $40 million to $50 million. It likely won't be full run rate for sure in 2021. But we're actively working on the technology elements with our customer and driving it forward. We talk about this contract just because of the size of it. It's unusual to have a contract of that size get landed. But it's just a reflection of the value of the Workforce Solutions data in so many different verticals and use cases in this case and the government space with the Social Security administration. So, I think, we've been clear, it's a space that we refocused on and started building out resources in the latter part of 2018. We added resources in 2019. I think from commercial resources, we're up probably between 2x and 3x what we had two years ago. So it's a space we want to be bigger in. We think we are well positioned to be bigger in it. We have pretty strong market position with most of the Fintechs with our TWN data where it's used, and of course, it's expanding usage during COVID. And we are working to take advantage of that relationship to move some of our credit data in. We've had some positive wins. It's, I don't know, $250 million market in the United States. I think you know our competitors are much stronger than we are. But we think there's room for Equifax to grow. Many of those are single-sourced in the Fintech from starting out that way, and they're getting to scale where they could be dual source, which prevents an opportunity for Equifax, particularly when we're already in the door with our TWN data. They have been more impacted than how we characterized an FI, particularly because of their funding requirements. They typically aren't balance sheet funded. So they've been more impacted on originations. But we stayed supporting them, and we're continuing to have some commercial wins during the last couple of quarters in that space. And it's an area that, since saying in the USIS team we are focused on, for growth in the future. We see it as a strategic market for us going forward. Yes. We think we have real scale in the business, which provides a competitive advantage for us at Workforce Solutions. We've owned this business for over a decade. And we've invested between the acquisition of business and what we've invested in technology and resources, a couple billion dollars over the last 10 years. And the scale of the business, we think provides some real strength in the competitive advantage. We talked about the history of the data, which is really hard to get, on an individual, worried about people or work the last two years or here at Equifax, where do you work the two years before that or the two years before that, collecting that data is quite challenging. We're participating in some of the other ways to collect data, you pointed out, bank transaction data and trying to impute it in, the net pay in someone's bank account that's a data source, but very difficult to get, the consumer have to consent to give the data. So we think that -- quite challenging. So we think there's just a lot of strengths around the business, we're always looking at who our competitors are in every business. And but this is one where we think we have similar market strength, given the scale of it. Maybe as you point out, the network of connections we have with so many customers. And then of course, we're now having a billion companies to deliver data to us on a fee per unit basis. And that makes this data set very, very valuable and tough to replicate. And if you're a company, you're likely not going to give the data to two companies. You're going to give it to the company that's been here for a long time. And we think that's another important element for Equifax, our strength of the business, our proprietary and security around it, the fact that we authenticate anyone who uses the data before they're able to use it. There's just a lot of security and protection around that, which is very important to those actually to own the data and contributed to us. Yes, we did some costs work in International in 2019 that we're getting benefits from. And then there's been some tightening during 2020, during the COVID pandemic, as you point out, with pretty strong performance on margins. Given the revenue declines, which are still quite substantial in International because of the COVID pandemic. So, we expect those -- the COVID pandemic to get behind us economic activity improves that obviously, revenue should go with that and improve it, should be positive for the margins of that business going forward. Yes. There's a number of things in there, Jeff. And there certainly is \u2013 we're always working with our customers to help support them in tough economic events. So I think you can attribute that to changes in perhaps pricing and things like that. But then there's also the underlying volume is quite challenging, which is also a contributor as their customers and, of course, in our case, with our FMS business, still are not anywhere near pre-COVID levels with regards to originations. I think if I follow your question, it's really going to be the outperformance of our mortgage businesses, which is Workforce Solutions is growing -- obviously, the mortgage market is up. As we highlighted on couple of slides in our comments, they've got core growth in the mortgage business. So that's going to drive that. And the same with USIS at 600 basis points of growth in mortgage from core versus the mortgage market and Workforce Solutions multiples that from new records and new products, everything else. So that's really what's driving it now, which we think is very positive in a COVID recession. And of course, the rest of the non-mortgage businesses at Equifax that are still negative in many markets and verticals because of the COVID recession, those surely will recover as economic activity comes back in the future, as we get through and past the COVID market effect. I think it's really about those verticals really still not recovering and we expect they will. I think our competitors are seeing similar challenges with -- whether it's card originations or personal loan volume. The financial institutions are being quite conservative and that should be until they have some clarity around where the economy is going. When they do, they're going to start originating again and that will be positive for us as we go forward in our non-mortgage businesses. As you know, for the last couple of quarters you've heard me talk about it because I really view it in the next chapter with Equifax really, accelerate our new product innovation. It's really levers the cloud investments that we're making. We believe that this is going to be a real catalyst for us to drive topline growth. You're seeing an EDS about the timing and you know it's really happening in 2019. We did it on the chart, we put in the in the early slides, we did 90 new products out from 16 in 2018. And that's up from in the 70 to 80, range, kind of pre cyber events. So in 2019, we're operating at higher level. And of course, we've gone to 90 last year to around 110 in 2020. So there's clearly a renewed focus on it, you saw a few months ago, we brought in a new Chief Product Officer. We're adding new product talent resources to really scale up our ability to bring new products to market. And remember, one of the reasons we're making this cloud investments that we talked so much about it, because we're going to put all our data assets into a single data fabric. And we believe that's going to accelerate our ability to do data combinations and renew solutions to the marketplace. So that's what this new product team is going to be focused on is really leveraging the cloud investments that we're making. So what you're going to see benefits of it, you're seeing it today, you saw this quarter and we talked about some of the new products we're rolling out in the marketplace. That gives our commercial team more things to sell, and more solutions to bring to our customers. So going from 90 last year to 110 and my goal is to grow beyond the 110 in 2021, as we continue to invest in resources, and really leverage the cloud transformation. With regards to the vitality index, that's something that we've talked about before, I guess pre the cyber event. I think it's likely something we'll bring back to the dialogue with our investors. We already have plenty to talk about. But if there's interest in that, you will certainly bring that back. But new products are a key priority of ours. As I characterize it, it's the next chapter with Equifax, it's really going to drive our top line growth. Yes, there's a number of drivers there Brett that we've talked about over the past couple of quarters. It starts with our Ignite, an analytics sandbox, I think, we've invested heavily in that, and we're rolling out in the marketplace. And that's a tool for our customers to access our data as well their own and really drive analytics and solution that will result in use of more of our data. So that's very, very positive for us. And of course, we have a large DNA team that is focused on creating new solutions. And we talked about some of those that really are from our analytics about combining data assets that increase the predictability in some of our COVID response products, to help our customers look at using trended data to understand how our customer outperformed in the past, to use that to create predictability to how they're going to perform in the future, adding income and employment data. Those are all part of our analytics to deliver a solution. And they result in more usage of our data or specific revenue opportunities and new scores or other ways that we deliver the analytics to drive the predictability of the decision for our customers. And we believe the cloud investments are really going to advantage us in more opportunities to bring new solutions from our DNA to the marketplace. Yes. John shared some comments around our deal pipeline in USIS, which is your focus in orders that EWS pipeline is quite rich, as you might imagine it is an international DTH. But there is a lot of focus by our investors and/on Equifax, which is why we talk about the USIS deal pipeline in particular, the desktop dramatically over what it was last year and the year before, we're seeing increasing mid rates, you know, when I've used the term did \u2013 the USIS is a competitive marketplace now. In the COVID recession, that's harder to see, because you've got the pressures of the economic impacts from our customers, on Equifax and on USIS, but we see the deal winds coming into the global recession, you saw the kind of strength of USIS revenue, non-mortgage numbers, using that in particular in the second half of 2019 and coming into the first quarter of 2020. And we seen competitively, during the recession -- the COVID recession impacts of the second quarter, third quarter, the USIS is performing quite well. So we still got a lot of confidence in that business and its recovery."

At this time, I would like to now turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.\nJeff Dodge: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge and with me are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Burns with Investor Relations. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Earnings Calls, Presentations and Webcasts. These materials are labeled Q2 2020 Earnings Release Presentation. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings update. Businesses and consumers around the world continue to face challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you and your families are continuing to be safe in managing in this unusual environment. We'd like to once again thank the dedicated and selfless healthcare professionals, first responders, volunteers, and others around the world who are on the frontline fighting this pandemic, and we sympathize with the millions of people in the U.S. and around the world that are been affected. The health impact of the COVID pandemic is devastating, but what is equally challenging to our customers is the unprecedented impact from the COVID pandemic. It is unlike anything in our lifetimes with record unemployment, furloughs, and salary reductions. Data and analytics in this environment is more valuable than ever. During the second quarter, we operated very effectively in our work-from-home mode after COVID restrictions were put in place in late March. After a shelter-in-place orders started to lift in early June, we opened up our offices in markets like Atlanta and began to return to office on a 50% density in Red-Blue team rotational basis. Currently, we have 34 of 51 offices opened and are operating in that mode. We expect to stay in stay in the 50% density in our Red-Blue rotation mode until a vaccine is available. We are operating at a very high level and have realized meaningful productivity and engagement with customers and across our Equifax team through video collaboration, including meeting all of our cloud technology and data transformation milestones. Turning now to slide four, our financial results for the second quarter were very strong and our second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion driven by Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage market, and our positive performance in the marketplace. The results follow our momentum in the second half of 2019 and the strong first quarter and were well above our expectations. Our performance in the challenging COVID economic environment reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model, our differentiated data assets, including the TWN income and employment data, health care utility and commercial data, and the value of data analytics in the unprecedented times. Revenue at $983 million was up 12% on a reported basis and 13% on a local and organic local currency basis, which is well above our expectations and above the framework of 3.5% to 5.5% that we shared with you in early June. If you adjust for the $48 million of incremental Workforce Solution\u2019s unemployment claims revenue in the quarter, our revenue increased a strong 8% in local currency. As the quarter unfolded in June, our revenue on all fronts continue to improve from the trends we shared on the June 8th call as shelter in place orders lifted and economic activity improved. These strong results position us well as we move into third quarter in the second half. Our growth in the quarter was powered by our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions. They both performed extremely well with combined U.S. revenue up 28% and a combined adjusted EBITDA margins of over 50%. Workforce Solutions revenue was exceptionally strong, up 53%; and EBITDA margins were 56%, which was their strongest quarterly results since the acquisition almost 13 years ago and followed strong first quarter and second half of 2019. USIS revenue was up a strong 10%, which reinforced their return to a competitive market position. International revenue was down 15% in local currency but continue to show broad-based sequential improvement throughout the quarter. And global consumer revenue was down just under 5%, principally in our U.S. partner business. The revenue growth drove adjusted EBITDA of $353 million, up 19%, with an over 200 basis point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 35.9% as we balance cost controls while executing our cloud data and technology transformation and making targeted investments in new products and data and analytics. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 a share was up over 14% despite incurring increased data analytics and incremental cloud costs of $0.12 per share and increased interest expense of $0.06 per share for our April bond offering. EBITDA and EPS were both above our expectations and EPS framework of $1.22 to $1.32 we shared with you in early June. The very strong U.S. B2B revenue growth was driven principally by three factors; first, U.S. mortgage revenue was up over 70% versus 2019, was extremely strong in the current record low interest rate environment as Equifax outperformed the overall mortgage market growth on the order of 30 percentage points, principally in Workforce Solutions. As you know, we over-indexed in mortgage versus our competitors due to Workforce Solutions in our U.S. tribe your mortgage business. U.S. mortgage market inquiries, our proxy for the overall mortgage market growth, were up 41% in second quarter versus our 70% combined growth in Workforce Solutions and USIS mortgage. Although USIS mortgage revenue growth of 44% grew 30 -- 300 basis points above the mortgage market, the driver of the substantial outperformance versus the overall market was Workforce Solutions, where mortgage revenue more than doubled in the quarter, driven by the value of our unique twin income and employment data and new products, new customers, improved customer penetration and the expansion of our twin database. We expect continued strong mortgage growth in the third quarter. Second, our unemployment insurance claims business also part of Workforce Solutions, delivered more than 150% growth in the quarter to $76 million. Incremental revenue growth of $43 million in the quarter was driven by a significant increase in unemployment claims that we all know about during the second quarter, which added 5 percentage points to overall Equifax revenue growth. As you know, Workforce Solutions processes close one in five unemployment claims in the U.S. We expect unemployment claims to continue above 2019 levels in the third quarter, but at a rate below the second quarter. Third, our U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue, excluding unemployment insurance claims-based revenue, showed substantial improvement as we move through the second quarter and was down only about 7%. Our U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue, excluding U.S. UC claims impact showed sequential improvements during the quarter, from down 10% in April to down just 2% in June, as shelter-in-place restrictions were lifted and economic activity improved, which reflects our competitive market position and provides good momentum going in the third quarter. I'll provide more detail on these factors as we discuss each of our business units on slide five. Starting with USIS, their revenue was $366 million, was up 10% in the second quarter on a reported and organic basis, and their 12% first half revenue growth was their strongest 2014. Mortgage revenue grew 44%, 300 basis points faster than the overall market inquiries that were up 41%, driven by new products, new customers, and pricing. Total mortgage revenue growth from both purchase and refi transactions strengthened significantly through the quarter, exiting June at over 60% above 2019. Total non-mortgage revenue, online and offline combined decreased 7%, much better than expected when we entered the quarter at down 13% in April. In total, non-mortgage revenue was down only 1% in June as economic activity improved sequentially during the quarter, which is above our expectations and a reflection of the USIS competitive position in the marketplace. For the quarter, online revenue was up 7%. Online non-mortgage revenue was down 10% in the quarter, but strengthened significantly during the second quarter, with June just down over 2% versus down 17% in April. In June, we had positive growth in auto, insurance, ID and fraud, and direct-to-consumer, with commercial declining high single-digits as U.S. economic activity improved. Telco and banking were both down mid-single-digits in June and showed improvement during the quarter. Banking remains down as customer marketing continues to be at a reduced level until the direction of the economy and the consumer becomes clear. Mortgage solutions, our mortgage and tribal business was up 44% in the quarter, outgrowing market by 300 basis points from new products, new customers, and pricing. Financial marketing services revenue was up 1% compared to last year and better than our expectations. Risk decisioning, which includes portfolio review revenue and makes up over 30% of total financial marketing services was up over 15% in second quarter as companies expanded their portfolio review activities. Marketing revenue, which also makes up about half of FMS in the quarter, was down just under 20%. The remainder of FMS, which includes our ID and collections products, was up over 25% in the quarter. These general trends are consistent with our expectations; however, portfolio review revenue was stronger than expected. We expect portfolio review activity to remain strong as customers manage challenging customer collections and take proactive portfolio management actions. We are also starting to see increased activity from customers for our marketing services at quarter ended, although at much lower levels than 2019. USIS is winning competitively and continues to accelerate commercial activity, and their new deal pipeline remains strong. USIS' new deal pipeline opportunities as of the end of June was at their largest level since 2017, up almost 10% over last year. Equally positive, USIS\u2019s win rates in the quarter were up quarter were up over 300 basis points from last year. USIS\u2019s new deal pipeline growth and win rates were both above our expectations and reflect fitting's commercial focus in leadership as USIS returns to market competitiveness. USIS\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margins of 44.1% were down 150 basis points from last year and 60 -- and down 60 basis points sequentially. The decline is principally driven by the higher mix of lower margin mortgage revenue, and resulting higher royalty costs and data purchases bandwidth our non-mortgage online revenue. USIS also continued to invest in commercial resources and NPI resources during the quarter for future growth. Following USIS\u2019s commercial momentum in the second half of 2019 and strong above-expectation results in first and second quarter, we are confident that fitting leadership has moved USIS back into a competitive position in the U.S. market. Shifting to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $353 million, up 53%. This is the strongest revenue growth since we acquired TALX in 2007. EWS results were up a strong 33%, excluding the $48 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter. Trailing 12 months revenue was $1.15 billion, up 32%, with 49.6% EBITDA margins up 350 basis points. Rudy Ploder and his EWS team gave you a deep dive on our EWS business and growth outlook in early June. They continue to leverage core growth, new products, penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions to fuel their growth. EWS is on track to be well over $1 billion of revenue in 2020 for the first time, with 50% plus margins. Workforce Solutions is clearly our strongest business, particularly in this unprecedented consumer environment, where TWN income and employment data is immensely valuable. Verification Services revenue of $252 million was up 46% versus 2019. Verification Services mortgage revenue more than doubled in the quarter, growing more than 60 percentage points faster than the 41% growth we saw in the mortgage market credit inquiries in the quarter. This dramatic outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is driven by the strategic and operational focus on new products, penetration, usage and record additions that we discussed on our June investor call. As a reminder, the presentation from our June call is available on the Equifax website. Several growth levers are driving this outperformance of Verification Services mortgage revenue relative to the overall mortgage market, including growth in TWN contributor and records. During the quarter, the number of companies contributing to the TWN database increased substantially to over 900,000 from over 700,000 in March and 37,000 a year ago as we expand into more mid- and smaller market companies. Due to this growth in new contributors, Workforce Solutions was able to offset the negative impact on active TWN records of increasing unemployment. Total active records were 105 million at the end of the quarter, with over 80 million unique individuals, which is just over 50% of the U.S. non-farm payroll. Total active records were up over 15% from a year ago, but flat with March due to impacts on the database from unemployment. The TWN database now includes about 435 million active and inactive records. And as you know, we are able to monetize both active and inactive TWN records. In addition to growth in employer contributors and overall TWN records and a focus on adding new customers, several new critical strategies are an important component of driving the verification service mortgage revenue growth in excess of the overall mortgage market. First, direct-to-consumer integrations with mortgage underwriters continue to grow with the work number integrated directly into our customers' underwriting processes. These integrations increased the usage of TWN records and the frequency of TWN polls in the mortgage origination, underwriting, and closing process, which drives TWN verification revenue. Second, new products focused on increasing the number of times of TWN income and employment verification is used during the mortgage application approval process. We shared some of the new solutions we are bringing to marketplace that drive TWN usage and provide value to our customers with you in the June call, and many of these products have pricing that is two to four times our based TWN full product cost. Number three, expanding real-time access to additional income sources to include the increasing number of people that work as individual contractors or 1099 self-employed consumers to deepen and broaden the TWN database beyond non-payroll. Shifting to Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth, it was down less than 5% in second quarter and delivered 2% growth in June. The decline in the quarter was driven by substantial weakness in talent solutions, our hiring rate services business, to where companies across the U.S. cutback on hiring in during the quarter, and in debt management services where temporary reductions in collections activity were implemented by many companies. Partially offsetting this were new product rollouts in talent solutions, strength in government verticals related to government healthcare and support services, as well as the growth in records in the TWN database. We also saw growth in the second quarter in auto through increased TWN penetration with auto loan originators and increased use of TWN with higher credit score applicants. We also saw growth in our TWN ID product and in portfolio review product solutions, principally for card and personal loans, which we expect to continue to grow in the second half given the unique value of income and employment data in the current environment. Employer Services revenue of $101 million increased a strong 75% in the quarter, driven by our unemployment claims business, which grew over 150% versus last year to $76 million. Adjusting for the $48 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter, Employer Service was down about 8% as companies cut back on hiring. As a reminder, our UC businesses manage the process of providing the required unemployment data to state and local agency for employers. Our typical contract is an annual subscription with volume limits and incremental fees as UC claims are above those above those ones. We operate in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. In the second quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 7.5 million claims, which is roughly one in five initial U.S. claims during the second quarter. Claims spiked in April and May to about 5.8 million from a monthly run rate of $300,000 per month in the first quarter. In June, we saw a steady decline in new clients from the elevated April and May rates to 1.7 million claims processed for the month, which was still up dramatically over pre-COVID in 2019 levels. The remainder of Employer Services saw revenue decline 17% in the second quarter because of lower new employee hiring activity in the quarter. I-9 and onboarding in our Workforce Analytics business make up the bulk of the remainder of Employer Services. We saw 9% growth in our I-9 and onboarding business, which partially offset the decline in Workforce Analytics in our Tax Services business. The strong EWS verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 56.3% in the quarter, which was a record for Workforce Solutions and the expansion of 710 basis points versus last year. The strong margin growth was partially offset by incremental costs incurred in the quarter for new TWN records. Workforce Solutions is clearly our most differentiated business with their unique TWN income and employment records. The TWN data assets are increasingly valuable in this COVID consumer environment where verification of income and employment is critical. As we discussed in June, we think about EWS being in the second or third inning, with multiple growth levers for future growth in 2021 and beyond. International revenue of $181 million was down 15% in local currency and down 21% on a reported basis and in line with our expectations. COVID shelter in place orders have been deeper and longer in our international markets, with some markets, including Australia, the U.K. and Canada, still not open. This has impacted their revenue, but we've seen sequential revenue improvements from down 20% in April, improving to down 7% in June. Asia Pacific, which is our Australia, New Zealand and India business delivered second quarter revenue of $65 million, down 9% in local, and 10% in organic local currency versus last year. The revenue growth was much stronger than the revenue trends of down 20% we experienced in April as revenue trends continued to improve, with June down 4%, adjusted for a large collections deal that closed late in the second quarter. In Australia, revenue growth in fraud and ID and collections partially offset declines in our consumer and marketing services businesses, and to a lesser degree, in our commercial business. European revenues of $48 million were down 25% in local currency in the quarter. Our European credit business was down about 20%, with Spain performing slightly better than the U.K. In the U.K. credit business, revenue improved meaningfully during the quarter from down 27% in April, but they were still down 15% in June as the U.K. is still in a lockdown. Spain credit revenue also improved during the quarter from down 21% in April, but was still down 9% in June as shelter in place orders have just begun to be lifted a few weeks ago. Our European debt management business declined 34% in local currency, as expected, principally driven by government enacted policy that temporarily halted consumer debt collections. We expect debt collection activity to resume in the second half. Our Latin American revenues of $34 million decreased 14% in local currency in the quarter. Our two largest markets in Latin America, Chile and Argentina, make up over 50% of the revenue. Importantly, these two markets performed relatively well in the quarter, with Chile down six and Argentina down 10 in local currency compared to last year. April revenue decline for Chile and Argentina were elevated levels in COVID lockdowns, however, June revenue declines were in the low to mid-single digits. These markets continue to benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS customer rollouts and strong new product introductions in the past three years. Most of our other Latin American markets were down over 20% consistently through the quarter from the economic impact of the strong COVID lockdowns in those markets. Canada revenue of $33 million declined 13% in local currency in the second quarter. Revenue improved from a decline of about 25% in April to down only about 1% in June as economic activity improved. But shelter-in-place orders still have not been fully lifted in many parts of Canada. Fraud and ID revenue grew in the second quarter from higher government volumes associated with increased applications for government and social services. And we saw growth in June revenue in our mortgage, auto, and small business verticals in Canada. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.7% were down 690 basis points from last year, principally reflecting the lower revenue across all regions, partially offset by cost savings achieved during the quarter. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 5% on a reported and local currency basis in the quarter. Our Global Consumer Direct business, which is just under half of our GCS business, was down about 3%. Our U.S. Consumer Direct business had revenue declining about 5% versus 2019, but increased sequentially from the first quarter by about 200 basis points. Canada and the U.K. combined consumer direct revenue was about flat in the quarter. Importantly, we are seeing substantial subscriber growth in the U.S. and Canada, our two largest markets. Based on a continuation of these trends, we expect our consumer direct business to show positive revenue growth in the second half, which will be our first growth since 2017 in this market segment. GCS also continues to grow with myEquifax member base with over 6 million consumer members, up from about 2 million a year ago, which provides a foundation for new product offerings. Our remaining GCS business, principally our partner business as well as our benefits channel and event-based business decreased by 5% in the quarter. We delivered high-single-digit growth in our benefits channel and events-based business, but this growth was more than offset by declines in our U.S. Lead Gen partner business as banks pulled back on card and P loan marketing and originations. As we look to the second half of 2020, declines in our U.S. Lead Gen partner revenue are likely to accelerate as consumer marketing remains at reduced levels more than offsetting the expected growth in Global Consumer Direct, our benefits channel, and events-based business. This will likely result in second half revenue decline in GCS greater than the 5% decline we delivered in the second quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.8% decreased 210 basis points compared with the prior year due to the effect of revenue decline, partially offset by operating cost efficiencies. In what has been the most challenging economics and health environment we faced in our lifetime, Equifax delivered a very strong performance, with revenue up 12% and adjusted EBITDA -- EPS up 14% in the first half. Our resilient business model, differentiated data assets, cloud data and technology transformation, new products, and focus on commercial execution, has driven our broad outperformance. Our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS, and EWS, delivered mortgage revenue growth that outperformed the overall mortgage market, substantial growth in our UC revenue, and improving revenue trends across our non-mortgage businesses, the U.S. and international, drove our results. Shifting now to slide six, this page highlights the uniqueness and challenges of the current COVID recession. It is clear that this is the most challenging consumer environment in our lifetime. Compared to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, unemployment rates are up almost 500 basis points with over 20 million Americans out of work. And for the 10% of Americans with negative wage impacts where wages are down 5% to 6%, with many households struggling to manage 25% or more salary reductions or even larger if they're in a furlough. These unprecedented consumer impacts significantly cloud the ability for our customers to manage their business, including marketing, underwriting, and portfolio management. We've seen a significant performance deterioration of prime and near-prime credit portfolio, driven by these job losses and wage reductions. Many project a continuation in job losses or wage reductions as government support programs expire in the coming weeks. In April of this year, approximately 50% of those who suffered a decrease in pay in excess of 25% were individuals with a credit score of 680 or higher, which further complicates the environment for our customers. Forbearances are also driving material loss of predictiveness of traditional credit scores in the sub-prime market. And further, the CARES Act -- with the CARES Act, loan accommodation PE delinquency rates artificially low and make them not representative of the actual portfolio health. Accommodations have grown from 2.8% pre-COVID in March to 9% of balances today. In these challenging times, differentiated data is more valuable than ever. We're seeing a meaningful increase in customer discussions in this unique environment about data solutions broadly, but with a particular focus on our unique TWN income and employment data, which is sourced every paper. Turning now to slide 7. We updated the comparison of our performance in the current COVID pandemic driven recession to our performance in the 2008-2009 global financial crises. Based on the growth of Workforce Solutions and our U.S. mortgage business, we are seeing significantly stronger performance in the current COVID recession, with our 13% revenue growth in the second quarter, and in the early stages of the 2008 and 2009 global financial crisis where Equifax revenue was down 7% to 10% quarterly during that recession. The key drivers of our strong outperformance relative to 2008-2009 include a resilient business model and stronger mix of businesses, with 50% -- 55% of Equifax delivering growth or countercyclical performance in 2020 versus only 40% in 2008-2009. Second, U.S. mortgage revenue is at very high levels with refi and purchase transactions continuing historic levels driven by record low interest rates. We saw mortgage application purchase volume rebound as we exited second quarter as consumers take advantage of record low interest rates. The MBA application purchase index was up 15% versus 2019 in the last week of June. This strength continued into July. Based on current rates, over 15 million existing mortgages would benefit from the refinancing, which is up about 70% higher than the available refi population in 2008-2009, John will give you some further perspective on the second half U.S. mortgage market outlook shortly. Mortgage is clearly much stronger today with revenue in the second quarter for Equifax up over 70%, which is significantly higher than the 20% peak revenue growth we delivered during 2008-2009. Third, Workforce Solutions growth has been accelerated from record growth penetration, new products and new verticals. Their 53% growth in second quarter significantly outperformed their peak quarterly growth performance of about 20% in the 2008-2009 global financial crises. In addition to growth in verifications of 46%, the unemployment claims processing business is seeing record volumes, resulting in the $48 million of incremental UC revenue in the second quarter I talked about earlier. Then last, our commercial momentum from the second half of 2019 and strong first quarter performance as we entered the COVID environment in late March, is clearly also driving our results. The Equifax business model and recession resiliency is clearly much stronger than the last recession in 2008-2009. I'll turn the discussion over to John to discuss recent trends in revenue and our underlying markets, as well as review some of our other financial items. But looking at trends at a high level, USIS and Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue continues to be very strong and relatively stable at the elevated levels we saw in June. While we expect mortgage revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis to remain strong in the second quarter, we do expect growth rates in the third quarter and second quarter to decline versus second quarter as we saw growth -- strong growth in mortgage markets in the second half of 2019. In USIS, the improvement in non-mortgage revenue has flattened over the past few weeks after consistent sequential improvement throughout the second quarter. And in some markets and verticals, we've started to see some slight declines in the last few weeks as COVID case counts increase and some shelter-in-place orders return. In Workforce Solutions, Verification Services trends in non-mortgage revenue remains slightly positive to prior trends, driven by the strategic dynamics of the business and new products rollouts, as we discussed earlier. Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims revenue remains at elevated levels at a run rate of over $40 million for the quarter, which is, while positive over 2019, will be substantially lower than the employment claims, we expect to be substantially lower than the unemployment claims volume we saw in the second quarter. And given the continued uncertainty regarding the direction and pace of the U.S. and global economy, we do not expect to provide guidance throughout the remainder of 2020. As we did last quarter and in June, we'll provide details on the trends we are seeing in an indicative view of their implications. After John's discussion, I'll come back and review our progress on the technology transformation, new products, and our focus on the second half in 2021. John?\nJohn Gamble: Thanks Mark. I will generally be referring to the results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. In the second quarter, general corporate expenses was $122 million, excluding non-recurring costs. Adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $75 million, up $8 million from Q2 2019. Corporate functional expenses, such as finance, HR, and legal are down year-to-year, reflecting the cost containment activity Mark discussed in April. The increase in total general corporate expense is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs in 2020 due to the very strong financial performance as well as increased depreciation and amortization. We continue to exercise disciplined cost management across the business. We are and will continue to invest in our technology transformation, data and analytics, new products and security, and will accelerate investment in these areas as we believe we can deliver accelerated benefits. Outside of these areas, headcount additions are being held at levels below attrition, and discretionary spending has been reduced. Across the company, business travel remains at virtually zero. We're in the process of reviewing our real estate footprint as well as other areas that may allow further structural cost improvements. We expect to begin implementing cost improvement items over the next several quarters. We do not expect meaningful cost improvements in 2020. For Q2 2020, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 24.4% and about 1% higher than we expected for the quarter. We expect the 3Q 2020 tax rate to be about 21%. Full year effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS is expected to be about 24%. In 2Q 2020 and year-to-date, operating cash flow of $251 million and $282 million respectively were both up $34 million from 2019. Increases in operating cash flow in 2Q 2020 and first half 2020 were partially offset by $48 million and $95 million of legal settlement payments in 2Q 2020 and year-to-date, respectively. The timing of payments of the remaining $347 million to the U.S. Consumer Restitution Fund is principally dependent on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until late 2020 or early 2021. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. As indicated on slide eight, we had almost $2.7 billion in available liquidity at June 30th, including $1.4 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit NAR facilities of $1.3 billion. As Mark mentioned, our 2Q results were substantially stronger than the implication of the trends through May that we discussed in our June investor call. The improved results were about 70% in our U.S. B2B business, with the bulk of the remainder in International, broad-based across our geographies. In U.S. B2B, online was about two-thirds of the improvement, split evenly between mortgage and non-mortgage. The remainder of the strength in the USIS Financial Marketing Services and Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business. The strength in adjusted EPS reflects the margin impact from the stronger revenue. Slides 9 through 12 show details of revenue trends on a local currency basis that we saw in 1Q and 2Q, as well as in April, May and June. There were two more business days in June this year versus 2019, which benefited growth rate on the order of 3%. We are also providing the view of the trends so far during the month of July and their implications on 3Q 2020 if they were to continue throughout the quarter. The line items, for which daily trends are not available or not relevant, we did not provide monthly actuals, but did provide 1Q and 2Q data, as well as an estimate for 3Q 2020. The monthly actual provided should be viewed as directional. Starting with slide 9. U.S. B2B revenue trended very positively through June as online strengthened across USIS and EWS driven by strength in mortgage online and improving trends in non-mortgage online revenue. This, coupled with a very strong 2Q performance in Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business and the growth in USIS Financial Marketing Services and much better performance than yet expected, resulted in a very strong U.S. B2B revenue growth in 2Q. Trends in U.S. online over the past month have approximately flattened. Online mortgage daily revenue levels continue to be strong but are somewhat variable by week and have been about on average consistent over the past month. The July trends for mortgage reflect a continuation of the current daily revenue trend adjusted for seasonality, with a lower growth rate due to significant increase in mortgage revenue we saw last year in 3Q and 4Q. Online mortgage -- sorry, online non-mortgage revenue growth was flattened over the past month. USIS non-mortgage online revenue growth levels have shown slight declines, while EWS non-mortgage revenue has remained relatively flat. July trends provided for online non-mortgage revenue reflect these trends. Workforce Solutions and Employer Services driven by unemployment insurance claims activity is expected to show growth in 3Q again, but at levels much lower than in 2Q. USIS financial marketing services in 2Q benefited from new business, both in portfolio review and marketing services. Given the uncertainty in the economy, the mid-July estimate provided for USIS marketing services does not assume that this recurs again. In total for U.S. B2B, if the trends and assumptions hold for 2Q, we should see another very strong quarter. Turning to slide 10. As Mark discussed earlier, International saw improvements in all regions as we moved through 2Q, with June revenue down only 7% versus 2019. This consistent improvement across all regions resulted in a much smaller revenue decline in the quarter than anticipated. The July revenue growth trend shared reflects, in general, a continuation of the daily revenue trends seen over the past month through the rest of the third quarter. GCS, July trend shared with you reflect the trends Mark discussed earlier. In consumer direct, growing total subscribers are expected to lead to slight revenue growth in 3Q. Partner revenue, which includes our benefits channel and event-based business, is expected to decline about 10% in 3Q with a significantly larger decline likely in 4Q. As Mark mentioned, GCS total revenue in second half 2020 is expected to decline by more than 5%, with a decline in 4Q much larger than 3Q due to expected significant declines in Lead Gen related partner business. Slide 11 provides a comparison of economic factors impacting the mortgage market in the current environment during environment during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the 2013-2014 mortgage downturn. We are sharing this information to provide you with additional information for your use as you estimate Equifax second half 2020 results. Based on data provided by Black Knight, at current 30-year mortgage rates of about 3%, there are over 18 million mortgages likely eligible for refinance. This is the highest level we have seen over the past year and much higher than in 2008 through 2010 or 2013 and 2014. The refi potential is highly dependent on a number of factors, including interest rates. For example, again, based on Black Knight's data, an increase in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 3.5% will reduced refi potential to $10 million and an increase to 4% in the interest would reduce the refi potentials under $5 million. As you saw last week, mortgage rates were at an all-time low of just under 3%. The current U.S. unemployment at 11% is higher than we saw in either 2008 through 2010 or 2013 through 2014. The forecast for unemployment in second half 2020 that is provided in this chart is by Moody's analytics. In addition, we'll continue to watch key metrics, including mortgage delinquency rates, credit scores, leverage levels, both in terms of debt-to-income and loan-to-value closely. As it is still early in the current crisis, the impact on consumer employment income and the direction of ongoing government support are still evolving. Due to the continuing uncertainties in forecasting the direction, depth, and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we're not going to provide third quarter guidance and do not expect to provide guidance for the remainder of 2020. However, for perspective on total Equifax 3Q 2020 performance, we will again provide an illustrative third quarter framework to help you think about our performance. Please turn to slide 12. To the extent total Equifax revenue continued at the pace I described earlier, 3Q 2020 revenue would be up 4% to 6% year-to-year, resulting in 3Q 2020 revenue of $930 million to $950 million. Adjusted EPS in 3Q 2020 at these revenue levels could be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share, down 6% to 12% from 3Q 2019. Slide 19 also provides a walk-through, explaining the translation versus 3Q 2019 of the revenue growth to the decline in pretax income and therefore, adjusted EPS. Importantly, at these adjusted EPS levels, Equifax will deliver over $325 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is not guidance as there is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customers, business activity, the path to opening the economy, and therefore, our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability in trends, not a view of potential quarter outcomes. As a reminder, in our April earnings call, we provided detail on the cost and capital spending savings we expect to generate and the tech transformation is complete. As shown on slide 13, total cost savings, excluding D&A, are expected to be on the order of $125 million from the reduction of cost of goods sold and lower development expense. There will also be substantial capital spending savings as capital spending as a percentage declines on the order of 7%, a level that is at or slightly below that of our peers. We expect to begin seeing net to begin seeing net COG savings, excluding D&A in late 2021, and are targeting approaching the run rate of COGS development expense and capital savings during 2022. We will certainly reinvest in some of the savings, so it will not all fall to margin. As Mark referenced earlier, we continue to look to accelerate the completion of our tech transformation, including increasing investment levels in 2020. At present, we expect 2021 time costs related to the Equifax 2020 Technology and Data Security Transformation, exclusive of legal accruals to be about $340 million. We expect capital spending to be about $390 million for the full year. As a reminder, in 2021, we will no longer be adjusting our financial results for one-time costs related to the technology transformation. These one-time technology transformation costs are expected to decline substantially from the levels seen in 2020 and the likely be largest in 1Q 2021 decreasing throughout the remainder of 2021. These one-time technology transformation costs will impact development expense, G&A and COGS. We will continue to disclose these one-time tech transformation costs to allow you to have comparability with our adjusted financial results from 2017 through 2020. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. I'll wrap up by giving you an update on our cloud transformation -- cloud technology and data transformation and our accelerated focus on new products. First, moving to our EFX 2020 Technology Transformation. During 2020, we focused the bulk of our efforts in the cloud technology data transformation on our North American operations, which represent over 80% of our revenue and even higher percentage of our income. Investments in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific and deploying cloud-native data fabric and our Ignite and InterConnect API analytical and decisioning framework are also progressing well. Initial migration to GCP of our major North American data exchange, the U.S. Canadian consumer ACRO list changes, the work number in NTT is principally complete, and we expect to have complete full migration, including all data ingestion processes for the exchanges in place by year-end. It is at this point that these migrated exchanges become our system of record with our customers. These are critical deliverables for 2020, and completing in this plan remains a strategic focus and priority. These exchanges generate about 70% of North American online revenue. We're also making very good progress in the full migration to GCP of our secondary U.S. exchanges, the commercial risk exchanges, IXI, property and DataX exchanges. We expect a number of these exchanges that have completed full migration by year-end, with the remainder completed in the first half of 2021. And the Canadian commercial risk exchange for migration will also occur in early 2021. In April, we discussed with you the initial migration of our eID identity validation systems, which we expect complete in the third quarter. Customer migrations are expected to start in the second half, and we expect to have fully migrated all eID customers by year-end. Our new Luminate cloud identity and fraud suite being deployed as a cloud-native solution will be available to customers in the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter. And a new eID cloud-native service is also available for the U.S. as part of the new transformed Luminate offering. We are continuing our progress to migrate our customers onto our new cloud based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite API framework. As a reminder, this is a common set of services on, which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. At the end of the second quarter, USIS had migrated 1,200 U.S. customers, and International completed migrations of about 2,000 customers. We expect to continue this pace of migration. We expect this pace of migration to accelerate in the second half of 2020, with over 10,000 USIS customer migrations completed by year-end, and the majority of the remaining U.S. customer migrations completed by mid-2021. We continue to adjust our development priorities to add platform capabilities to ease our customers' ability to easily migrate to our new platforms. As we discussed in April, our new Ignite analytics and machine learning platform is available and in production at EWS and will be available at GCP this quarter. We continue to make strong progress globally, rolling out our Ignite analytics platform with over 200 customers using Ignite, direct and marketplace, including two new Fintech customers added in the second quarter. An additional substantial benefit from transforming our own and on-premise infrastructure to Google, will be a significant reduction in our carbon footprint, which is a focus area of our ESG strategy. Google remains the only cloud provider that uses 100% renewable energy in their centers, which we will benefit from. We are making strong progress in our cloud technology and data transformation and remain energized about the future top and bottom-line benefits John discussed earlier. Our cloud-native data and infrastructure is and will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace. Shifting to slide 14, which highlights our new product initiative focus, which is a key component of our EFX2020 Strategy and is our next chapter as we leverage our cloud, data and technology transformation for growth. To strengthen our capabilities and product management and API, we recently added a new Chief Product Officer, Cecilia Mao, who has deep product expertise from prior roles with FICO, Verisk, and Oracle. Cecilia joined Mark Luber, our new USIS Product Officer, with a goal of accelerating our product management capability to drive new product growth. We expect to continue to add product resources in the second half to position half to position us for growth in 2021 and beyond. We continue to launch new and refined existing products to support our customer-specific needs during the COVID pandemic. This includes our Equifax Response NOW product initiative in USIS and tailored I-9 and UC Solutions and Workforce Solutions. USIS recently announced the addition of an industry-specific FICO score segmentation data to our weekly consumer trends reports. With this integration, Equifax is the first company to weekly industry-specific FICO score segmentation reports, enabling businesses across the industry to better track anonimized consumer trends, behaviors, and credit performance across the U.S., which allows our customers to better anticipate consumer behavior changes as a result of the COVID recession. As we progress through the year, we continue to make strong progress on our goal to expand our NPI rollouts and deliver over 100 new products in 2020, which is up from about 90 last year in 60 in 2018. Through June, we've launched 70 new products, and we have an active pipeline of new products at various stages in the pipeline funnel. Some of the new product launches include a USIS launched FICO 10-T. The FICO 10-T score incorporates trended data for strategies and use cases that benefit from additional trended data insights into consumer behavior. We work with FICO to incorporate trended credit bureau data to offer a view on the trajectory of certain data fields over time, such as account balance amounts reported over the past 24 months. Consumer behavior -- consumer payment behavior and credit limit information can also be captured via the trended data. Workforce Solutions also have a strong NPI focus. As we discussed on our June 8th call, Workforce Solutions recently launched a number of new mortgage solutions, including mortgage TWN ID and I-9 Anywhere products. Both are seeing strong market growth. Another area of focus is the expansion of the data sets in our talent reports. New multi-data solutions incorporating employment, ID verification, and degree verification can add value to hiring decisions in high turnover industries such as retail, restaurants, manufacturing, and hospitality, especially as we look at the post-COVID recovery period. We also continue to make good progress with our positive data in Australia and now have over 80% of positive data from contributors, with about 90% of the credit card and mortgage data and more than 50% of the auto and P loan data in our database. We've begun to use this positive data in Australia to provide analytical insights to our customers and expect to launch additional new products later this year. NPIs continue to be an important lever for Equifax growth and a priority for me and to the team. We prioritize our focus and resources on driving NPI rollouts in 2020, and more recently, a global focus on products to support our customers during the COVID recession. We will continue to prioritize new products and innovation in the second half to leverage our cloud data and technology transformation for future growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain actively engaged with stakeholders in the public and private sectors regarding Equifax solutions that accurately portray the risk profile of consumers, while recognizing the unique and likely temporary nature of the financial impact of the pandemic. In every country where we do business, Equifax is in discussions with lawmakers and regulators to enable continued credit reporting that captures the status of consumer payments and lender accommodations. Depending on the geography, we've worked independently in conjunction with our peers and our trade associations to provide proactive assistance to financial institutions seeking guidance on how to report during this time frame. In U.S., we're in regular communications with federal regulators, including the CFPB, where we're sharing data trends with the bureau regarding both consumers and publisher [ph]. We're proud that our import has contributed to regulatory guidance at the bureau is published a broadly inform the marketplace. Furthermore, at least three of our most significant markets around the world, Equifax is providing data and insights directly to federal governments to help policymakers understand the pandemic\u2019s consequences on consumers in the credit economy. We recognize that many consumers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and our experienced economic distress. Equifax has established a COVID resource section on our website to assist consumers looking to manage their epidemics potential impact on their credit standing. In April, we joined the other U.S. credit bureaus and announcing that we're providing free credit reports to all U. S. consumers through April 2021. We're also offering free credit reports to Canadian consumers. More recently, Bev Anderson, our Business Unit Leader for GCS, hosted a series of informational webinars for consumers on managing credit during COVID pandemic. Our GCS team is also participating in industry webinars and events to educate stakeholders regarding the options, as well as the reporting standards. We will continue to support consumers and remain engaged as a constructive partner to help consumers businesses in the overall economy during this challenging time. Wrapping up, turning to slide 15. As John outlined earlier, we're still unable to provide guidance for the third quarter or the second half. We still see meaningful uncertainty from the impacts of the COVID pandemic as cases rise tragically in many markets, impacting shelter in place orders, consumer confidence and economic activity. There's also a real risk for the second COVID wave in the fall and potential for increased lockdowns. We also expect further impacts from unemployment, furloughs and salary reductions as government support programs expire in the coming weeks. Like other companies, we have very limited visibility in the depth and breadth and length of the COVID recession or the timing or strength of recovery until we have a broadly available vaccine. This uncertainty makes it challenge to provide our traditional guidance for the third quarter and second half. We hope the framework John provided is helpful as you think about the range of outcomes for Equifax in the third quarter and second half. Even in this challenging environment, Equifax is operating extremely well. Our strong business model is resilient and delivering in the COVID environment while investing -- while allowing us to invest in the future. Our performance in the second quarter followed a strong first quarter and our momentum in the second half of 2019. Our strong results allow Equifax to continue to invest in our cloud data technology transformation, data and analytics, and new products to position Equifax for future growth in 2021 and beyond. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and towards 2021 and 2022, we are confident in our business model, strategy for growth, cloud, data, and technology investments and the ability to perform in a challenging COVID environment. We have a very strong team with deep domain expertise, and we continue to strengthen that team. We delivered strong financial results again in the second quarter, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, with over 200 basis points of margin expansion, while continuing to invest in our cloud, data, and technology transformation, data and analytics, and new products. Workforce Solutions is a franchise business that is strongly outperforming. We gave you a deep dive in Workforce a few weeks ago and expect continued strong performance from Workforce Solutions in the COVID recession with strong growth potential in the long-term. Workforce delivered exceptionally strong revenue growth in the second quarter, up over 50% of adjusted EBITDA in our margins of 55%. These results are the strongest since we acquired the business in 2007, driven by macro events and mortgage and unemployment claims businesses and new claims businesses and new TWN record growth, increased penetration in launching new products. And Workforce Solutions is strongly outgrowing the mortgage market. Our unique TWN income unemployment data is even more valuable in this unprecedented economic event due to the scale, accuracy, and latency of that unique data. We believe Workforce Solutions is well positioned for attractive long-term growth. USIS had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 10% and the strongest first half revenue growth since 2013 led by strong growth in U.S. mortgage. USIS' pipeline are the strongest since 2017 from the renewed commercial focus and rollout of new products. The business is operating well and winning in the marketplace. International executed well against a challenging global economic environment and our GCS direct business is poised for growth in the second half of the year. And as I outlined, we're making very good progress on our cloud, technology, and data transformation and beginning to take advantage of the new cloud-based capabilities. Execution of the cloud investment is a clear priority for our team in 2020. We've accelerated some of our spending, and our focus on the cloud transformation remains strong. We expect a number of our data exchange migrations to completed by year-end, and are well down the path on customer migrations. We know we still have a lot of work to do. We are energized about the strong benefits that will come from this transformation, including always-on-stability, speed-to-market, ability to rapidly new products around the globe, and the strong top of line benefits John talked about. We are continuing to invest in new products and innovation by investing in new product leadership and resources to drive innovative new product rollouts. Our NPI capabilities are being accelerated by our cloud transformation, and we expect to launch over 100 NPIs in 2020. NPI remains a top priority for 2020 in the future, and we continue to expand our investments in new products, leveraging our cloud transformation. We're also making proactive investments in technology and DNA, new products and security, while balancing cost controls across the rest of Equifax. And our balance sheet, as John pointed out, remains strong, ensuring we are prepared to make the necessary investments in our EFX 2020 cloud data and technology transformation, new products and data security, while looking for attractive bolt-on acquisitions. And we continue to support consumers through these challenging times with free credit reports and consumer education on our website. As we look to the second half of 2020 and towards 2021 and 2022, I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market-leading data, analytics and technology company. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Congratulations on the quarter. I was hoping you could talk about the trend of non-mortgage USIS, and how it improved significantly in June, but then it looks like it got a little bit weaker in July. So just wanted to understand what you're hearing from customers in terms of what's led to the slower July, and how we should be thinking about going forward?\nMark Begor: Yeah. Toni, I'll start and then John can jump in. We were pleased with the kind of sequential improvement in USIS broadly, and then, of course, in non-mortgages we went through the quarter, particularly a shelter in place orders were listed and economic activity improved. So that was a positive. We just wanted to point out there's still real uncertainties in the marketplace. We've seen markets like Florida, and Texas and California that it had some of the recent COVID spikes from our online volumes, seeing some impact on that. It's not meaningful, but it's not continuing the sequential trend. So we really just wanted to point out that we expect some uncertainties going forward. One of the other positives that I pointed out a couple of times is the fact that the USIS new deal pipeline in their win rate continue to grow through the second quarter off of the first quarter and off of last year. And for us, that's probably the most important element. It's quite challenging to forecast the economic outlook. But seeing Workforce Solutions accelerate their new product rollouts, and really winning in the marketplace competitively is quite positive for us as we think about the third quarter.\nJohn Gamble: And Toni, if you're looking at slide 9, right, just as a reminder, as you look at June, June, because of the number of business days in the month, right, was -- there's about a 3% benefit, or a little over 3% that you see in June that doesn't really continue into July. So that can help you understand the trend the trend better between June and July. So, for example, if you look at banking and lending, Mark mentioned banking and lending, there, we adjusted that 3 point, you're probably looking at, banking lending was down 10% to 15% in the June period. And what we have seen is slight weakening as you go into the very end of July -- into June and July and the trends across several USIS verticals. It wasn't substantial, but the substantial improving trends we've seen from April through June flattened and then weakened slightly.\nMark Begor: Just -- make one last point Toni is that the biggest challenge right now is when will our customers restart marketing. And we've seen some increased activity from a below 2019. But there's just so much uncertainty for our customers around the consumer and the economy. Many of them have pulled back on marketing. In counter to that, we've seen a significant increase in activity and dialogues around portfolio management, which is typical in an economic downturn. A lot of resource is shift to managing the backlog, managing existing customers, managing credit lines. So we've got that positive going in marketing. When will our customers get comfortable to market again, I think, is the big question, and I think there's a lot of uncertainty on that.\nToni Kaplan: That's very helpful. For my follow-up, just wanted to ask about the really strong margins in Workforce Solutions, Obviously, you had a very strong verifications quarter. So, was that the real driver, or are you also getting some additional leverage from the employer services vertical as well? Just wanted to understand the strength of margins and the sustainability of that?\nMark Begor: Yes. You get the two items that are very strong, obviously. UC claims is high incremental margin as is the growth in verification, so both of those are driving our margins. We've got -- as you know, revenue growth broadly in our business and in Workforce Solutions, incremental revenue growth delivers very, very high incremental margins, which is driving that. And the other thing of workforce that we pointed out that we were pleased with is how we outgrew the mortgage market. That really is a reflection of the power and the weakness of the data assets they have and the multiple levers we talked about on the June call with Workforce Solutions.\nJohn Gamble: The other thing I would mention is that this is happening in a period when we have strong cost controls in place. So, you're seeing costs are being managed very, very tightly while they're seeing very high revenue growth.\nToni Kaplan: Makes sense. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next up, from Credit Suisse is Kevin McVeigh.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Hey Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Hey, how are you? It not a really nice detail in terms of how EWS positively impacts mortgage. Can you kind of help us frame how it impacts the rest of the credit products that you kind of offer right now? And as we think about that into 2021 as income start to tick up the core USIS, more broadly, first mortgage in that EWS?\nMark Begor: Yes. We've talked, Kevin, before. I think you're talking about the fact that we go to market as one Equifax with our customers. And as you know, USIS sells to all of our financial institutions, the USIS credit products as well as the Workforce Solutions' verification product. So that kind of bundled approach to our customers, we think is a smart way to go-to-market. It gives us the ability to incent our commercial team to sell a full Equifax solution. It gives us the ability to leverage product positions on both the credit and verification side when we're in discussions with customers. And so we're clearly seeing the ability seeing the ability to approach customers with a broad Equifax solution that would include credit data, wealth, and employment data, our NTT data and then, of course, our verification data from Workforce Solutions and bundled solutions in many cases, which we think is attractive for Equifax.\nKevin McVeigh: Got it. And then just real quick, you talked about kind of 100 new NTIs and part of that being just positively impacted by your cloud transformation. In the cloud transformation, is it the expense benefit that allows you to do that, or do they become more seamless through the cloud, or just could you just help us frame that a little bit more from an NPI perspective?\nMark Begor: Yes. We've been consistently talking about this, Kevin, for the last couple of years. That was our expectation that the cloud transformation would allow us to accelerate the ability to get more new products to market and also getting the product to market more quickly and we're starting to see that. The good news is we're already -- really in the last six months as we've gotten deep into the cloud transformation, we've been able to roll out new products and we talked about this on the April call. We're putting new products in the marketplace that we couldn't do two years ago because of the single-data fabric, our ability to combine data assets, our ability to ingest new solutions, having a simpler application infrastructure, speeding up our ability to bring products to market. And we're excited about starting to see the early benefits of that. And we do believe those benefits will accelerate, meaning our ability to do more new products in the future. And you're seeing that as we go from 60 products to 90 last year to over 100 this year. And our goal, and we're putting resources around it to really leverage our massive investment in the cloud transformation for both data and our technology to accelerate our new products rollouts in 2021 and 2022. I think as you know, that's a real fuel for growth in our industry and for Equifax. So we've got a really big focus on it, we've brought some great new talent in, we're going to add resources and people against it in the second half, because we really look at new products as being the next chapter for Equifax around driving our growth and really leveraging our cloud, data and technology transformation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, it's actually [indiscernible] hey guys. The first question I have for you is the commercial. You mentioned that you talked about typically in the USIS business. I was just wondering you could give us some color. Is that pipelines and win that you talked about coming from your competitive, or is it stuff that maybe was just, kind of, put on hold or independent box till you got back the way you left to do? I was just hoping for a little bit more color on some of the mix there?\nMark Begor: Yeah. It's all of the above. I think you've got -- we've got not a new leader anymore, but since he\u2019s been on the ground now for 18 months. He really remade the commercial organization that's been in place for six months. There's a real increased focus commercially in the marketplace. So I think that's positive number one. The pipelines are a combination of new products. When you go from 60 to 90 and then towards 100, there's just more opportunities for his team to bring new solutions to our customers. The pipeline growth, we also believe that is from the COVID response products that we've rolled out. This is a -- we tried to highlight on the call earlier; this is a really unprecedented time for our customers. And the value of data broadly for all of us in the industry is even more valuable. And actually, if you go back to 2008-2009, they're just more options for our customers to use data and manage in recession. So I think that's driving all of our capabilities in our conversations with our customers. And then there's no question, we talked about our win rates being up on a year-over-year basis. We're clearly more competitive in the marketplace. There's -- the overhang that was perhaps here a year ago from the cyber event, we believe, is way behind us. And we're really just focused on a normal node, that I would call it a fairly aggressive mode in the marketplace to really support our customers in this challenging time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And just on the new products, 70 to 100 the new products a year. I know all the creditors have actually had the cadence revive and just been impressive. But I was just wondering, how do you define what a new product is? And I think in the past that has actually talked about how you would expect the NPI to contribute, kind of, 10% of revenues in a two-year time frame or something. Do you have any such goals of that to provide some perspective?\nMark Begor: Yeah. We have a very standard rigorous process around what is the new product, it's got to be new. And we've been -- had a consistent process. John, I think, for five-plus years\u2026\nJohn Gamble: It's five years.\nMark Begor: \u2026on how we define new products and we try to be transparent with you and others about our new product rollouts because of the importance to our future growth. We think they're quite accretive to the future. And that's why we're doubling down on people and resources to really leverage the cloud transformation. I know there was a framework in the past in our financial framework around the contribution of new products to our revenue growth. As you know, we don't have a financial framework in place today. So, we probably don't want to talk about how we think about that. But I hope you appreciate the focus that I have and we have around new products because we believe it's a really important lever for growth that is going to be accelerated by our call transformation. When you think about why did we do the cloud transformation, there's a lot of reasons. One for sure is to accelerate our topline and the way to accelerate your topline from the cloud transformation is to bring new solutions to market more quickly and more creatively and we believe more uniquely than our competitors. And that's the focus that we have with the cloud. And of course, you get all the cost and cash benefits that John talked about that will start rolling in, in 2021 and 2022 as we complete the execution of the cloud transformation.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next up is Hamzah Mazari, Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the international business. Specifically, just margins in the international business. How much of the gap between the USIS business and international? Do you think is just structural and how much can be closed over time, especially as you complete the tech transformation?\nMark Begor: Yes. There's no question. Our international margins are lower than our U.S. margins. We have just so much scale in Workforce Solutions in USIS, as you know, versus many of our smaller markets. And some of that is going to be structural, just given the scale of those businesses. We do believe the cloud transformation is going to be accretive to that, improve those margins. And of course, we're focused on other actions and we have been. This isn't new on other actions and we have been. This isn't new to improve those margins, whether it's from new products or incremental growth. And the biggest way to improve margins internationally is topline growth because of the incremental margin impact that comes from that topline growth. And of course, they were impacted most significantly in the second quarter because of the depth and breadth and how severe the lockdowns were. And of course, many of our international markets are still in lockdown.\nJohn Gamble: And another meaningful difference is at this point, we don't have Workforce Solutions outside the U.S., and it's a very high-margin business. So, it negatively impacts the margins relative to the U.S. -- outside the U.S.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Very helpful. And just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. Could you maybe comment on your exposure to Fintech and how that compares to maybe some of your peers, whether that's an opportunity for you going forward? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes, I think as you know we talked about this many times, our competitors are much stronger in Fintech. That's been a priority focus of our team since I joined two years and change ago. We had two years a handful of people covering Fintech. And today, we've got, I think, 15 or 16. So, it's a clear focus. We've more than tripled our commercial resources in the last couple of years. We see it as an opportunity. We're having wins there. I talked about in my notes that we had two U.S. Fintech customers at Ignite in the second quarter. So, we're actively engaged with Fintech. And Fintech is a couple of hundred million dollars space in the U.S., growing faster than the core market. It's actually a bit more impacted in COVID recession right now than the broader market, but it's a space that we want to be bigger in, and we're focused on.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is David Togut, Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. I would appreciate your thoughts on Joe Biden's plan to mandate that federal agencies use a new public credit bureau. Could you just walk through your exposures to, kind of, government revenue, and over what time frame this new bureau might be developed?\nMark Begor: Yes. You have two different questions there, David. First on the government revenues, from our perspective are unrelated to Vice President Biden's and Senator Sanders proposal. And our government revenues are really at for social services, so our government revenues won't be impacted. And as you might imagine, we think the current credit bureau system in the U. S. well serves consumers and publishers. There's plenty of competition between the large three credit bureaus. We don't see a need for what was outlined in that proposal. We would suspect it's perhaps more positioning in an election cycle versus something that would have broad bipartisan support. And if you look around the globe, the few global markets where there is a government credit bureau, over time, either they've been privatized or private credit bureaus have operated against next to them. So we think the system in the United States today serves the market extremely well in a very competitive way.\nDavid Togut: Got it. And to the extent the government and credit bureau were to be developed, how long do you think it would take to build it? Just trying to assess the overall risk to Equifax?\nMark Begor: Yeah. I think that's a tough question, too, David. Equifax, we're spending $1 billion a year in technology in 2020, and we have for a long time to go to the industry. This is an extremely complex set. There's trillions of records, there's thousands and thousands of contributors. It will be a very long road. And again, from our perspective, that may be a reason why there wouldn't be bipartisan support for it. I think the broader perspective on why there would be bipartisan support as the system works today. It services the industry well, it services consumers well, there's great transparency. And if you look at the increase in alternative data, there's just more opportunities to support consumers, which is really what I believe Vice President Biden is focused on is how do you ensure that credit access to those that need it is available in the marketplace. And we believe the bureau today provides great support and great focus on that.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Greatly appreciate your insights.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo.\nMark Begor: Hi, Bill.\nBill Warmington: Good morning, everyone.\nMark Begor: Morning.\nBill Warmington: So first question for you. What percent -- what was total mortgage exposure as a percent of total Equifax revenue in Q2?\nJohn Gamble: Actually off the top of my head, I don't know, Bill, it's up substantially. I think it's on the order of 30%. But if you take a look at slide 9 and slide 10, I think we give plenty of data there for you to come up with that number yet.\nBill Warmington: Got it. Okay. And then it sounds like the new product pipeline is pretty full. I know you guys were the first bureau to do the beta test on the FICO Resilience index. I wanted to ask if there was a way to tie the work number more closely into the FICO score.\nMark Begor: It's a good question. I think we talked, Bill, broadly about our focus on one of the benefits we expect from our cloud-native transformation, as you know, it's a technology transformation and a data transformation, but the single-data fabric that we're going to, we believe, is going to allow we're going to, we believe, is going to allow us to do many more data combinations then we're able to do easily today. And that's one of the many reasons we're doing the cloud transformation. That would be an example of using income employment data with some of our other our other data assets to bring unique solutions that are on the Equifax because of our Workforce Solutions business to the marketplace. And we have those not in our current pipeline, but those kind of things on our to-do list in our pipeline in the future. And it's another reason, Bill; why I'm expanding our product resources across Equifax in the second quarter, and we're going to expand them further in the second half is really to really fuel up that new product engine, not only for the second half, but for 2021 and 2022. That's a big focus of mine is to take advantage of the single data fabric in the cloud, in the cloud technology we're going to have to really accelerate our new product rollouts.\nBill Warmington: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And Andrew Nicholas from William Blair is up next.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to first talk about operating expenses. I think now we're a few months into this, I want to understand that you already committed to; I believe it was $90 million of cost cuts. I was just wondering if you could speak a bit more about how you're thinking about that line in the medium to long-term. And I guess I'm wondering to what extent you've identified additional areas for cost rationalization over the past couple of months as the Workforce gets more and more comfortable working from home, whether it be on the real estate side, TME, so on and so forth?\nMark Begor: Yes, I hope you got the tone of our conversation. We're keeping a tight belt here because we still see meaningful uncertainty in the second half about the pandemic. At the same time, I hope you got our tone that we're making targeted investments. With our financial strength, we want to make sure we're making those investments for the future. But we are accruing kind of net benefits on a year-over-year basis on our cost structure. And certainly, during our plan we had in place early in the year, from some of the belt tightening we've done. You point out P&L travel. When you think about the near-term, no one's traveling at Equifax. And so that's a clear savings on a year-over-year basis. On a long-term run rate, I suspect the way we use video will meaningfully change our travel spend going forward. We spend -- about half of our P&L is spent in internal travel, meaning between Equifax sites. My view is post-COVID, that will go to zero. We just won't need to do it because we're so much more a depth at working together and collaborating through the use of Google Hangouts and other video tools. So, I think that's kind of a change that will be permitting. I think our business travel to customers will likely be lower just because of the efficiency of video. Instead of making three trips to a customer to work on a new product, you might make one post-COVID. And then have four or five video calls and do the whole project quicker just because of how we're working. So, I think there's the efficiency and collaboration on video, I do think will have a significant change. On the real estate side, we're going to go through -- we've got a handful of small offices that really got highlighted for us in the COVID recession. We're going to close those. It just doesn't make sense to have 20, 30, 40-person offices. Those seems to either work-from-home or be consolidated in other sites. So there'll be some real estate benefit there. We haven't gone off the next step of deciding whether we change our broader real estate footprint, so I suspect we'll look at that as the year progresses. But as you point out, we're -- we operated very effectively in a work-from-home mode, and we're still operating with our Red-Blue teams in a 50%, we're actually higher work-from-home mode, meaning we only have less than half of the team in our offices every week and the other house working from home, and Equifax is operating extremely well. So that will be something that we'll look at in the second half. Do you have anything to add?\nJohn Gamble: Nothing. You covered all.\nMark Begor: Okay. Does that cover where you were heading?\nAndrew Nicholas: Yeah -- no, that's really helpful. Thank you. And then just one more for my follow-up. It looks like in the case of Canada and Asia Pacific, you had a little bit of a spike in growth in June, or at least less abrupt decline in June before slowing down again in July. Any color on what might be driving that spike? And then how you're thinking about International recovery timeline more broadly in the second half? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yeah, it's tough, as you know, to predict. I think what we've seen pretty consistently in all markets. If you look at April and May, fairly severe lockdowns, not a lot of economic activity, as you got into May and June, in most markets, our customers figured out how to operate in a lockdown environment. And we're having commercial activity. Selling cars without showrooms being open and that's happening around the globe, so that, kind of, adaptability to a lockdown. I think the challenging international is their lockdown. We've seen U.S. lockdowns, kind of, relax in the last four, five weeks in many, many markets. Of course, you've seen some tightening or consumer confidence issues around the spikes in the last couple of weeks in many markets. But international lockdowns have just been extended. It is just much longer. We have markets like Australia. I think Melbourne -- in our Melbourne market is not going to open until late August. So those delays, we believe, and the depth of the lockdowns in many international markets really dampened their economic activity, which impacted our revenue. As those markets open up, we would expect to see improvements, but we just can't predict when and how much. So we would expect to see those improve as companies adapt and as actually restrictions are lifted, and there's some level of kind of COVID normalcy.\nJohn Gamble: If you're looking at slide 10, also, just looking at APAC, it was a positive number. But as Mark said in his comments, there was a one-time sale to a government entity there that resulted in that positive step. So excluding that, it was down single digits. And then again, just as a reminder, looking at June, right, there's probably a three to four point benefit from the fact that the number of business days in June is higher. So when you compare June to July, that's something you have to take into account.\nAndrew Nicholas: Yeah. I must have missed it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is George Milhalos of Cowen.\nMark Begor: Hey, George.\nGeorge Milhalos: Hey, good morning guys. Congrats and thanks for taking my question. Mark, just wanted to talk a little bit about Workforce Solutions, and obviously, tremendous momentum there, particularly this year, within mortgage and on the unemployment side, and you talked about it being still in, sort of, the second or third inning, if we're looking at longer term from a growth perspective. I'm just curious, if we would have thought of Workforce as at least being a high single digit top line growing, probably low double digit top line grower. Should we be thinking that as we look out over the next year or two that some of that growth or a substantial part of that growth has been kind of pulled forward now in 2020, so that it may be sort of a sub-trend for a year or two before sort of normalizing longer term for the growth perspective?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. I don't -- we don't want to get into giving 2021 or 2022 guidance, but we've talked at length on the June 8th call and more this morning about the multiple levers Workforce Solutions has. And as you know, one of the very unique levers they have versus most of our businesses, and I think most of the industry is the ability to grow their revenue by driving hit rate through increased records. And I think that's a very unique element to that business. And if you think quite simply, which sometimes I do, the business will be over $1 billion this year and it has, call it, roughly 50% of the non-farm payroll in a database. Now, our long-term goal is to get all of non-farm payroll in our database. And we've shown a pretty consistent ability to add those records. If we get from half to all of the non-farm payroll, you double the size of that business over a timeframe, extended for sure, but that's a lever that's unique. There's no question that there'll be -- we're in the middle of middle -- I don't know what portion we're in of the U.S. mortgage refi and purchase market that is exceptionally strong. There's going to be a grow over challenge on that for Equifax in 2021, as you point out. But if you saw in our comments, Workforce Solutions, in particular, significantly outgrew the mortgage market because of new products, because of new records, because of new customers, they have all those levers in new verticals that they can get into outside of mortgage, those give us a lot of confidence in Workforce Solutions' long-term growth, which is why I characterize it as being in early innings, meaning this is a mature business, it's a well operating business, but it just has a lot of runway for growth opportunities.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that color. And then just a quick question for you, John, as it relates to corporate expense and the outlook there. I mean those numbers came in a little bit better than what we were looking for. Is this sort of 2Q corporate expense run rate a good way to think about 3Q, absent, I think, a $5 million increase in redundant system costs relative to 2Q?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So, I think we're going to continue to perform well, relatively speaking, against corporate expenses. Within corporate expenses, there obviously some things that are a little more variable, like incentive compensation and things that drive movement period-to-period. So, I'm not going to really give a forecast for 3Q and 4Q. But in terms of the cost reduction actions we have in place, I think those are going to stay very firm in place around corporate, so you should see improving performance on our corporate expenses pretty consistently.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay, great. Thank you guys.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks.\nOperator: Next up is Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I just wanted to clarify a quick thing on International. I definitely collect that you're saying stricter and longer lockdowns in some key international geographies like Australia. My thought was that Europe went into lockdown earlier and started reopening earlier. And so when I look on slide 10 on the European CRA line for Equifax, is that what you're seeing, or are you saying something about lockdowns that I'm not catching about Europe?\nMark Begor: Yes. From our perspective, Andrew, like the U.K. is still in lockdown, meaning our office is not open. Our customers' offices aren't open. They're still working from home. Economic activity, we believe, is depressed because of that versus if you look at like Georgia, which is opened, and other markets in the United States. Spain opened just a couple of weeks ago. Canada is particularly a Toronto market is still in lockdown, meaning they're not open. For most commercial activity in Australia is still in lockdown. So our experience is that -- and our perspective is that the international markets lockdown sooner, and they lockdown longer, and of course, we don't see business in Italy, which, as you know, lockdown opens up quicker, but the markets that we're in are the ones I'm referencing.\nAndrew Steinerman: I got it.\nMark Begor: And we're heavily U.K. based, right? So for us, the bulk of the CRA is U.K.\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. I know. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next up is Jeff Meuler, Baird.\nMark Begor: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up, Mark, on that answer you just recently gave on the ability to consistently add records -- TWN records. Just how is the pipeline there? Is it being positively or negatively impacted by the current environment? And then on -- there was a comment in the prepared remarks about active records. I think being more flattish than much. I tried to kind of initial top of claims and unemployment. Is that a headwind that is at all a headwind that is at all meaningful, or are the individuals that are rolling off active records, just not particularly active, I guess, from a credit application perspective, so it doesn't really impact you. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yeah. First, on the pipeline, we have -- as you know, we have a dedicated team. We talked about that at June 8. This is all they do is focused on records at either as I would call it, going door-to-door to companies that they are not a part of our database or working on partnerships with payroll processors and others that we do revenue share with. And they have a very active pipeline. We -- what I would characterize is put them on offense in the second quarter. They were before, but we're deliberately leaning in. And on both sides, if you think about your company and you're under some financial pressure, today, you do that yourself in many cases, meaning you're taking calls from mortgage originators into the HR department and you've got a handful of people staffing a call center to respond to your employee calls on that. If we go in and can share our value prop, where we'll do it for free for them, we'll do it securely, it becomes a productivity improvement for that company. So that's a positive. So from a climate standpoint, it's always a good discussion. It's maybe better now. And then in the partnerships, the idea of getting an incremental revenue share from Equifax from a -- to a payroll processor. Those conversations are positive, too. So we like the pipeline. As you know, it's a bit choppy sometimes. We added a large processor last September. We're benefiting from that now. Those can be clunky or chunky. But we have a consistent focus on adding records, and we've shown a pretty good trend of adding them. On your question about the impact of unemployment is something we're watching. We expect there to be some pressure on actives in there. We had some decline in the latter half of the second quarter that were offset by additions that we have with new contributors and new employees or records coming in, and we expect to keep that focus going in the third quarter, but we\u2019re definitely watching it. And I think lastly, I think, as you know, we not only sell active records, meaning those that are working, but we also have a pretty large portion of our revenue Workforce Solutions is inactive records, meaning where with someone working two weeks ago, two months ago, three weeks ago, because people change jobs. And if we don't have an active, many times, we're able to sell the inactive, meaning what they were doing six months ago before they change jobs, and that becomes -- that's another part of our revenue.\nOperator: We'll go next to George Tong, Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi thanks. Good morning. So, USIS online mortgage revenue growth moderated from 62% in June to 35% in July, and then EWS mortgage growth went from over 100% in June to 70% in July. Presumably, this is all due to tougher comps. Any other factors that you might point out that could have contributed to the slowing growth? And if it was due truly to tougher comps, can you help frame how comps will evolve over the next two to three quarters?\nMark Begor: You want to take it John?\nJohn Gamble: Sure. It's principally tougher comps. A little bit of a seasonality, right? I take a look at the way the mortgage market tends to run. You tend to see a weaker mortgage market as you get towards the back half of the year. But in terms of tougher comps, the mortgage market really started to strengthen in 2019 August and was very strong in September and was very strong in the fourth quarter. So, you're going to see those tougher comps run through third quarter and fourth quarter and then obviously, you know how strong the mortgage market was in the first quarter and second quarter of 2020.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the technology transformation program, could you provide a timeline on when you expect to sunset your legacy systems, and perhaps frame the timing of when you systems, and perhaps frame the timing of when you expect to fully realize your cost savings that you outlined in the presentation?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, I think for today, we're not ready to do that. We tried to give indications on it. That's really probably getting more into our long-term framework as well as our outlook for 2021 or something, which, as you know, we're not providing guidance. But I think we try to be clear about -- we've got a lot of confidence in the benefits. We tried to talk about when we're bringing applications online and databases into the cloud and then how we're progressing on customer migrations because, as you know, we've got to complete migrations in order to sunset our legacy infrastructure. So, I think we're going to hold off in much more detail than we already have until we get closer to 2021 and we're putting our long-term financial framework back in place.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next is Gary Bisbee, Bank of America Securities.\nMark Begor: Hey Gary.\nGary Bisbee: Hi. Thank you. So, I understand you're not giving guidance, and there's a lot of uncertainty around mortgage trends it's trends in general. But if we think about, at some point, the mortgage business softening and obviously, unemployment claims as well, can you help us think through how the decremental margins would be on softer sales from those two end markets?\nMark Begor: So Gary, again, I think that's kind of getting into kind of a longer term view in the 2021 outlook, and we're just not ready to do that yet. We've given a fair amount of commentary even in this discussion around the fact that our margins in mortgage are obviously not nearly as strong as they are in the normal online business, principally because of mortgage solutions, right, because mortgage solutions, we purchase files from our two competitors. So, there's -- those margins are still good in our mortgage business on average, but not nearly as high as we'd see in a normal online poll. And -- but there's a lot of moving parts that are going to go into what 2021 and 2022 look like. So, I think we're all going to have to see how the markets evolve and we'll give you a lot more view as to what we expect for that as we get toward the end of the year.\nGary Bisbee: Let me take another cut at that and if you can't answer, that's fine. But as I look at the incremental margin on revenue growth in the last five years at Workforce Solutions, it's obviously been terrific and it's been relatively stable within a range, including the last few quarters, where there's been a major benefit to revenue. Is there any reason -- and I'm not asking you when, and asking about 2021, but any reason to think when revenue -- if revenue were to weaken in that business temporarily that you would see a very different incremental margin on the downside than you've seen on the upside?\nJohn Gamble: So again, I don't think we're really going to answer that in detail, right? But what also goes into that is what actions we would take to manage the cost of the business that we have across the entire portfolio, not just specific to Workforce Solutions. So again, I think we're, kind of, getting into more of a long-term outlook here. And at this point, we're going to -- I think we're going to have to ask you to wait until we get toward the end of the year.\nGary Bisbee: All right. Fair enough. If I could just sneak in one then on the pipeline, encouraging commentary on the win rates as well. Can you just level set for us, is the pipeline back to the pre-breach levels, or are you still in the process of rebuilding that? And same question for win rates. Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: So I think with the pipeline, what we're seeing is it improved a lot over the past three years. Comparing pre and post-breach pipelines is a little bit difficult, right. But I think the really promising things that we're seeing is the pipeline is growing consistently. And then the win rate we're seeing against the pipeline is continuing to grow as well. Again, we're speaking about us is here, right. So I'd say that's what it looks like, and I think we feel good about that trending.\nGary Bisbee: Thanks.\nOperator: And that's all the time we have for questions today at this time. I'll hand things back to Jeff Dodge for any additional or closing remarks.\nJeff Dodge: I'd like to thank everybody for their time today. And I think with that, operator, we can terminate the call. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. I will generally be referring to the results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. In the second quarter, general corporate expenses was $122 million, excluding non-recurring costs. Adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $75 million, up $8 million from Q2 2019. Corporate functional expenses, such as finance, HR, and legal are down year-to-year, reflecting the cost containment activity Mark discussed in April. The increase in total general corporate expense is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs in 2020 due to the very strong financial performance as well as increased depreciation and amortization. We continue to exercise disciplined cost management across the business. We are and will continue to invest in our technology transformation, data and analytics, new products and security, and will accelerate investment in these areas as we believe we can deliver accelerated benefits. Outside of these areas, headcount additions are being held at levels below attrition, and discretionary spending has been reduced. Across the company, business travel remains at virtually zero. We're in the process of reviewing our real estate footprint as well as other areas that may allow further structural cost improvements. We expect to begin implementing cost improvement items over the next several quarters. We do not expect meaningful cost improvements in 2020. For Q2 2020, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 24.4% and about 1% higher than we expected for the quarter. We expect the 3Q 2020 tax rate to be about 21%. Full year effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS is expected to be about 24%. In 2Q 2020 and year-to-date, operating cash flow of $251 million and $282 million respectively were both up $34 million from 2019. Increases in operating cash flow in 2Q 2020 and first half 2020 were partially offset by $48 million and $95 million of legal settlement payments in 2Q 2020 and year-to-date, respectively. The timing of payments of the remaining $347 million to the U.S. Consumer Restitution Fund is principally dependent on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until late 2020 or early 2021. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. As indicated on slide eight, we had almost $2.7 billion in available liquidity at June 30th, including $1.4 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit NAR facilities of $1.3 billion. As Mark mentioned, our 2Q results were substantially stronger than the implication of the trends through May that we discussed in our June investor call. The improved results were about 70% in our U.S. B2B business, with the bulk of the remainder in International, broad-based across our geographies. In U.S. B2B, online was about two-thirds of the improvement, split evenly between mortgage and non-mortgage. The remainder of the strength in the USIS Financial Marketing Services and Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business. The strength in adjusted EPS reflects the margin impact from the stronger revenue. Slides 9 through 12 show details of revenue trends on a local currency basis that we saw in 1Q and 2Q, as well as in April, May and June. There were two more business days in June this year versus 2019, which benefited growth rate on the order of 3%. We are also providing the view of the trends so far during the month of July and their implications on 3Q 2020 if they were to continue throughout the quarter. The line items, for which daily trends are not available or not relevant, we did not provide monthly actuals, but did provide 1Q and 2Q data, as well as an estimate for 3Q 2020. The monthly actual provided should be viewed as directional. Starting with slide 9. U.S. B2B revenue trended very positively through June as online strengthened across USIS and EWS driven by strength in mortgage online and improving trends in non-mortgage online revenue. This, coupled with a very strong 2Q performance in Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business and the growth in USIS Financial Marketing Services and much better performance than yet expected, resulted in a very strong U.S. B2B revenue growth in 2Q. Trends in U.S. online over the past month have approximately flattened. Online mortgage daily revenue levels continue to be strong but are somewhat variable by week and have been about on average consistent over the past month. The July trends for mortgage reflect a continuation of the current daily revenue trend adjusted for seasonality, with a lower growth rate due to significant increase in mortgage revenue we saw last year in 3Q and 4Q. Online mortgage -- sorry, online non-mortgage revenue growth was flattened over the past month. USIS non-mortgage online revenue growth levels have shown slight declines, while EWS non-mortgage revenue has remained relatively flat. July trends provided for online non-mortgage revenue reflect these trends. Workforce Solutions and Employer Services driven by unemployment insurance claims activity is expected to show growth in 3Q again, but at levels much lower than in 2Q. USIS financial marketing services in 2Q benefited from new business, both in portfolio review and marketing services. Given the uncertainty in the economy, the mid-July estimate provided for USIS marketing services does not assume that this recurs again. In total for U.S. B2B, if the trends and assumptions hold for 2Q, we should see another very strong quarter. Turning to slide 10. As Mark discussed earlier, International saw improvements in all regions as we moved through 2Q, with June revenue down only 7% versus 2019. This consistent improvement across all regions resulted in a much smaller revenue decline in the quarter than anticipated. The July revenue growth trend shared reflects, in general, a continuation of the daily revenue trends seen over the past month through the rest of the third quarter. GCS, July trend shared with you reflect the trends Mark discussed earlier. In consumer direct, growing total subscribers are expected to lead to slight revenue growth in 3Q. Partner revenue, which includes our benefits channel and event-based business, is expected to decline about 10% in 3Q with a significantly larger decline likely in 4Q. As Mark mentioned, GCS total revenue in second half 2020 is expected to decline by more than 5%, with a decline in 4Q much larger than 3Q due to expected significant declines in Lead Gen related partner business. Slide 11 provides a comparison of economic factors impacting the mortgage market in the current environment during environment during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the 2013-2014 mortgage downturn. We are sharing this information to provide you with additional information for your use as you estimate Equifax second half 2020 results. Based on data provided by Black Knight, at current 30-year mortgage rates of about 3%, there are over 18 million mortgages likely eligible for refinance. This is the highest level we have seen over the past year and much higher than in 2008 through 2010 or 2013 and 2014. The refi potential is highly dependent on a number of factors, including interest rates. For example, again, based on Black Knight's data, an increase in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 3.5% will reduced refi potential to $10 million and an increase to 4% in the interest would reduce the refi potentials under $5 million. As you saw last week, mortgage rates were at an all-time low of just under 3%. The current U.S. unemployment at 11% is higher than we saw in either 2008 through 2010 or 2013 through 2014. The forecast for unemployment in second half 2020 that is provided in this chart is by Moody's analytics. In addition, we'll continue to watch key metrics, including mortgage delinquency rates, credit scores, leverage levels, both in terms of debt-to-income and loan-to-value closely. As it is still early in the current crisis, the impact on consumer employment income and the direction of ongoing government support are still evolving. Due to the continuing uncertainties in forecasting the direction, depth, and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we're not going to provide third quarter guidance and do not expect to provide guidance for the remainder of 2020. However, for perspective on total Equifax 3Q 2020 performance, we will again provide an illustrative third quarter framework to help you think about our performance. Please turn to slide 12. To the extent total Equifax revenue continued at the pace I described earlier, 3Q 2020 revenue would be up 4% to 6% year-to-year, resulting in 3Q 2020 revenue of $930 million to $950 million. Adjusted EPS in 3Q 2020 at these revenue levels could be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share, down 6% to 12% from 3Q 2019. Slide 19 also provides a walk-through, explaining the translation versus 3Q 2019 of the revenue growth to the decline in pretax income and therefore, adjusted EPS. Importantly, at these adjusted EPS levels, Equifax will deliver over $325 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is not guidance as there is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customers, business activity, the path to opening the economy, and therefore, our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability in trends, not a view of potential quarter outcomes. As a reminder, in our April earnings call, we provided detail on the cost and capital spending savings we expect to generate and the tech transformation is complete. As shown on slide 13, total cost savings, excluding D&A, are expected to be on the order of $125 million from the reduction of cost of goods sold and lower development expense. There will also be substantial capital spending savings as capital spending as a percentage declines on the order of 7%, a level that is at or slightly below that of our peers. We expect to begin seeing net to begin seeing net COG savings, excluding D&A in late 2021, and are targeting approaching the run rate of COGS development expense and capital savings during 2022. We will certainly reinvest in some of the savings, so it will not all fall to margin. As Mark referenced earlier, we continue to look to accelerate the completion of our tech transformation, including increasing investment levels in 2020. At present, we expect 2021 time costs related to the Equifax 2020 Technology and Data Security Transformation, exclusive of legal accruals to be about $340 million. We expect capital spending to be about $390 million for the full year. As a reminder, in 2021, we will no longer be adjusting our financial results for one-time costs related to the technology transformation. These one-time technology transformation costs are expected to decline substantially from the levels seen in 2020 and the likely be largest in 1Q 2021 decreasing throughout the remainder of 2021. These one-time technology transformation costs will impact development expense, G&A and COGS. We will continue to disclose these one-time tech transformation costs to allow you to have comparability with our adjusted financial results from 2017 through 2020. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. And Toni, if you're looking at slide 9, right, just as a reminder, as you look at June, June, because of the number of business days in the month, right, was -- there's about a 3% benefit, or a little over 3% that you see in June that doesn't really continue into July. So that can help you understand the trend the trend better between June and July. So, for example, if you look at banking and lending, Mark mentioned banking and lending, there, we adjusted that 3 point, you're probably looking at, banking lending was down 10% to 15% in the June period. And what we have seen is slight weakening as you go into the very end of July -- into June and July and the trends across several USIS verticals. It wasn't substantial, but the substantial improving trends we've seen from April through June flattened and then weakened slightly. The other thing I would mention is that this is happening in a period when we have strong cost controls in place. So, you're seeing costs are being managed very, very tightly while they're seeing very high revenue growth. It's five years. And another meaningful difference is at this point, we don't have Workforce Solutions outside the U.S., and it's a very high-margin business. So, it negatively impacts the margins relative to the U.S. -- outside the U.S. Actually off the top of my head, I don't know, Bill, it's up substantially. I think it's on the order of 30%. But if you take a look at slide 9 and slide 10, I think we give plenty of data there for you to come up with that number yet. Nothing. You covered all. If you're looking at slide 10, also, just looking at APAC, it was a positive number. But as Mark said in his comments, there was a one-time sale to a government entity there that resulted in that positive step. So excluding that, it was down single digits. And then again, just as a reminder, looking at June, right, there's probably a three to four point benefit from the fact that the number of business days in June is higher. So when you compare June to July, that's something you have to take into account. Yes. I don't -- we don't want to get into giving 2021 or 2022 guidance, but we've talked at length on the June 8th call and more this morning about the multiple levers Workforce Solutions has. And as you know, one of the very unique levers they have versus most of our businesses, and I think most of the industry is the ability to grow their revenue by driving hit rate through increased records. And I think that's a very unique element to that business. And if you think quite simply, which sometimes I do, the business will be over $1 billion this year and it has, call it, roughly 50% of the non-farm payroll in a database. Now, our long-term goal is to get all of non-farm payroll in our database. And we've shown a pretty consistent ability to add those records. If we get from half to all of the non-farm payroll, you double the size of that business over a timeframe, extended for sure, but that's a lever that's unique. There's no question that there'll be -- we're in the middle of middle -- I don't know what portion we're in of the U.S. mortgage refi and purchase market that is exceptionally strong. There's going to be a grow over challenge on that for Equifax in 2021, as you point out. But if you saw in our comments, Workforce Solutions, in particular, significantly outgrew the mortgage market because of new products, because of new records, because of new customers, they have all those levers in new verticals that they can get into outside of mortgage, those give us a lot of confidence in Workforce Solutions' long-term growth, which is why I characterize it as being in early innings, meaning this is a mature business, it's a well operating business, but it just has a lot of runway for growth opportunities. Yes. So, I think we're going to continue to perform well, relatively speaking, against corporate expenses. Within corporate expenses, there obviously some things that are a little more variable, like incentive compensation and things that drive movement period-to-period. So, I'm not going to really give a forecast for 3Q and 4Q. But in terms of the cost reduction actions we have in place, I think those are going to stay very firm in place around corporate, so you should see improving performance on our corporate expenses pretty consistently. Thanks. Sure. It's principally tougher comps. A little bit of a seasonality, right? I take a look at the way the mortgage market tends to run. You tend to see a weaker mortgage market as you get towards the back half of the year. But in terms of tougher comps, the mortgage market really started to strengthen in 2019 August and was very strong in September and was very strong in the fourth quarter. So, you're going to see those tougher comps run through third quarter and fourth quarter and then obviously, you know how strong the mortgage market was in the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. Yes, I think for today, we're not ready to do that. We tried to give indications on it. That's really probably getting more into our long-term framework as well as our outlook for 2021 or something, which, as you know, we're not providing guidance. But I think we try to be clear about -- we've got a lot of confidence in the benefits. We tried to talk about when we're bringing applications online and databases into the cloud and then how we're progressing on customer migrations because, as you know, we've got to complete migrations in order to sunset our legacy infrastructure. So, I think we're going to hold off in much more detail than we already have until we get closer to 2021 and we're putting our long-term financial framework back in place. So again, I don't think we're really going to answer that in detail, right? But what also goes into that is what actions we would take to manage the cost of the business that we have across the entire portfolio, not just specific to Workforce Solutions. So again, I think we're, kind of, getting into more of a long-term outlook here. And at this point, we're going to -- I think we're going to have to ask you to wait until we get toward the end of the year. So I think with the pipeline, what we're seeing is it improved a lot over the past three years. Comparing pre and post-breach pipelines is a little bit difficult, right. But I think the really promising things that we're seeing is the pipeline is growing consistently. And then the win rate we're seeing against the pipeline is continuing to grow as well. Again, we're speaking about us is here, right. So I'd say that's what it looks like, and I think we feel good about that trending."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings update. Businesses and consumers around the world continue to face challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you and your families are continuing to be safe in managing in this unusual environment. We'd like to once again thank the dedicated and selfless healthcare professionals, first responders, volunteers, and others around the world who are on the frontline fighting this pandemic, and we sympathize with the millions of people in the U.S. and around the world that are been affected. The health impact of the COVID pandemic is devastating, but what is equally challenging to our customers is the unprecedented impact from the COVID pandemic. It is unlike anything in our lifetimes with record unemployment, furloughs, and salary reductions. Data and analytics in this environment is more valuable than ever. During the second quarter, we operated very effectively in our work-from-home mode after COVID restrictions were put in place in late March. After a shelter-in-place orders started to lift in early June, we opened up our offices in markets like Atlanta and began to return to office on a 50% density in Red-Blue team rotational basis. Currently, we have 34 of 51 offices opened and are operating in that mode. We expect to stay in stay in the 50% density in our Red-Blue rotation mode until a vaccine is available. We are operating at a very high level and have realized meaningful productivity and engagement with customers and across our Equifax team through video collaboration, including meeting all of our cloud technology and data transformation milestones. Turning now to slide four, our financial results for the second quarter were very strong and our second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion driven by Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage market, and our positive performance in the marketplace. The results follow our momentum in the second half of 2019 and the strong first quarter and were well above our expectations. Our performance in the challenging COVID economic environment reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model, our differentiated data assets, including the TWN income and employment data, health care utility and commercial data, and the value of data analytics in the unprecedented times. Revenue at $983 million was up 12% on a reported basis and 13% on a local and organic local currency basis, which is well above our expectations and above the framework of 3.5% to 5.5% that we shared with you in early June. If you adjust for the $48 million of incremental Workforce Solution's unemployment claims revenue in the quarter, our revenue increased a strong 8% in local currency. As the quarter unfolded in June, our revenue on all fronts continue to improve from the trends we shared on the June 8th call as shelter in place orders lifted and economic activity improved. These strong results position us well as we move into third quarter in the second half. Our growth in the quarter was powered by our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions. They both performed extremely well with combined U.S. revenue up 28% and a combined adjusted EBITDA margins of over 50%. Workforce Solutions revenue was exceptionally strong, up 53%; and EBITDA margins were 56%, which was their strongest quarterly results since the acquisition almost 13 years ago and followed strong first quarter and second half of 2019. USIS revenue was up a strong 10%, which reinforced their return to a competitive market position. International revenue was down 15% in local currency but continue to show broad-based sequential improvement throughout the quarter. And global consumer revenue was down just under 5%, principally in our U.S. partner business. The revenue growth drove adjusted EBITDA of $353 million, up 19%, with an over 200 basis point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 35.9% as we balance cost controls while executing our cloud data and technology transformation and making targeted investments in new products and data and analytics. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 a share was up over 14% despite incurring increased data analytics and incremental cloud costs of $0.12 per share and increased interest expense of $0.06 per share for our April bond offering. EBITDA and EPS were both above our expectations and EPS framework of $1.22 to $1.32 we shared with you in early June. The very strong U.S. B2B revenue growth was driven principally by three factors; first, U.S. mortgage revenue was up over 70% versus 2019, was extremely strong in the current record low interest rate environment as Equifax outperformed the overall mortgage market growth on the order of 30 percentage points, principally in Workforce Solutions. As you know, we over-indexed in mortgage versus our competitors due to Workforce Solutions in our U.S. tribe your mortgage business. U.S. mortgage market inquiries, our proxy for the overall mortgage market growth, were up 41% in second quarter versus our 70% combined growth in Workforce Solutions and USIS mortgage. Although USIS mortgage revenue growth of 44% grew 30 -- 300 basis points above the mortgage market, the driver of the substantial outperformance versus the overall market was Workforce Solutions, where mortgage revenue more than doubled in the quarter, driven by the value of our unique twin income and employment data and new products, new customers, improved customer penetration and the expansion of our twin database. We expect continued strong mortgage growth in the third quarter. Second, our unemployment insurance claims business also part of Workforce Solutions, delivered more than 150% growth in the quarter to $76 million. Incremental revenue growth of $43 million in the quarter was driven by a significant increase in unemployment claims that we all know about during the second quarter, which added 5 percentage points to overall Equifax revenue growth. As you know, Workforce Solutions processes close one in five unemployment claims in the U.S. We expect unemployment claims to continue above 2019 levels in the third quarter, but at a rate below the second quarter. Third, our U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue, excluding unemployment insurance claims-based revenue, showed substantial improvement as we move through the second quarter and was down only about 7%. Our U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue, excluding U.S. UC claims impact showed sequential improvements during the quarter, from down 10% in April to down just 2% in June, as shelter-in-place restrictions were lifted and economic activity improved, which reflects our competitive market position and provides good momentum going in the third quarter. I'll provide more detail on these factors as we discuss each of our business units on slide five. Starting with USIS, their revenue was $366 million, was up 10% in the second quarter on a reported and organic basis, and their 12% first half revenue growth was their strongest 2014. Mortgage revenue grew 44%, 300 basis points faster than the overall market inquiries that were up 41%, driven by new products, new customers, and pricing. Total mortgage revenue growth from both purchase and refi transactions strengthened significantly through the quarter, exiting June at over 60% above 2019. Total non-mortgage revenue, online and offline combined decreased 7%, much better than expected when we entered the quarter at down 13% in April. In total, non-mortgage revenue was down only 1% in June as economic activity improved sequentially during the quarter, which is above our expectations and a reflection of the USIS competitive position in the marketplace. For the quarter, online revenue was up 7%. Online non-mortgage revenue was down 10% in the quarter, but strengthened significantly during the second quarter, with June just down over 2% versus down 17% in April. In June, we had positive growth in auto, insurance, ID and fraud, and direct-to-consumer, with commercial declining high single-digits as U.S. economic activity improved. Telco and banking were both down mid-single-digits in June and showed improvement during the quarter. Banking remains down as customer marketing continues to be at a reduced level until the direction of the economy and the consumer becomes clear. Mortgage solutions, our mortgage and tribal business was up 44% in the quarter, outgrowing market by 300 basis points from new products, new customers, and pricing. Financial marketing services revenue was up 1% compared to last year and better than our expectations. Risk decisioning, which includes portfolio review revenue and makes up over 30% of total financial marketing services was up over 15% in second quarter as companies expanded their portfolio review activities. Marketing revenue, which also makes up about half of FMS in the quarter, was down just under 20%. The remainder of FMS, which includes our ID and collections products, was up over 25% in the quarter. These general trends are consistent with our expectations; however, portfolio review revenue was stronger than expected. We expect portfolio review activity to remain strong as customers manage challenging customer collections and take proactive portfolio management actions. We are also starting to see increased activity from customers for our marketing services at quarter ended, although at much lower levels than 2019. USIS is winning competitively and continues to accelerate commercial activity, and their new deal pipeline remains strong. USIS' new deal pipeline opportunities as of the end of June was at their largest level since 2017, up almost 10% over last year. Equally positive, USIS's win rates in the quarter were up quarter were up over 300 basis points from last year. USIS's new deal pipeline growth and win rates were both above our expectations and reflect fitting's commercial focus in leadership as USIS returns to market competitiveness. USIS's adjusted EBITDA margins of 44.1% were down 150 basis points from last year and 60 -- and down 60 basis points sequentially. The decline is principally driven by the higher mix of lower margin mortgage revenue, and resulting higher royalty costs and data purchases bandwidth our non-mortgage online revenue. USIS also continued to invest in commercial resources and NPI resources during the quarter for future growth. Following USIS's commercial momentum in the second half of 2019 and strong above-expectation results in first and second quarter, we are confident that fitting leadership has moved USIS back into a competitive position in the U.S. market. Shifting to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $353 million, up 53%. This is the strongest revenue growth since we acquired TALX in 2007. EWS results were up a strong 33%, excluding the $48 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter. Trailing 12 months revenue was $1.15 billion, up 32%, with 49.6% EBITDA margins up 350 basis points. Rudy Ploder and his EWS team gave you a deep dive on our EWS business and growth outlook in early June. They continue to leverage core growth, new products, penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions to fuel their growth. EWS is on track to be well over $1 billion of revenue in 2020 for the first time, with 50% plus margins. Workforce Solutions is clearly our strongest business, particularly in this unprecedented consumer environment, where TWN income and employment data is immensely valuable. Verification Services revenue of $252 million was up 46% versus 2019. Verification Services mortgage revenue more than doubled in the quarter, growing more than 60 percentage points faster than the 41% growth we saw in the mortgage market credit inquiries in the quarter. This dramatic outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is driven by the strategic and operational focus on new products, penetration, usage and record additions that we discussed on our June investor call. As a reminder, the presentation from our June call is available on the Equifax website. Several growth levers are driving this outperformance of Verification Services mortgage revenue relative to the overall mortgage market, including growth in TWN contributor and records. During the quarter, the number of companies contributing to the TWN database increased substantially to over 900,000 from over 700,000 in March and 37,000 a year ago as we expand into more mid- and smaller market companies. Due to this growth in new contributors, Workforce Solutions was able to offset the negative impact on active TWN records of increasing unemployment. Total active records were 105 million at the end of the quarter, with over 80 million unique individuals, which is just over 50% of the U.S. non-farm payroll. Total active records were up over 15% from a year ago, but flat with March due to impacts on the database from unemployment. The TWN database now includes about 435 million active and inactive records. And as you know, we are able to monetize both active and inactive TWN records. In addition to growth in employer contributors and overall TWN records and a focus on adding new customers, several new critical strategies are an important component of driving the verification service mortgage revenue growth in excess of the overall mortgage market. First, direct-to-consumer integrations with mortgage underwriters continue to grow with the work number integrated directly into our customers' underwriting processes. These integrations increased the usage of TWN records and the frequency of TWN polls in the mortgage origination, underwriting, and closing process, which drives TWN verification revenue. Second, new products focused on increasing the number of times of TWN income and employment verification is used during the mortgage application approval process. We shared some of the new solutions we are bringing to marketplace that drive TWN usage and provide value to our customers with you in the June call, and many of these products have pricing that is two to four times our based TWN full product cost. Number three, expanding real-time access to additional income sources to include the increasing number of people that work as individual contractors or 1099 self-employed consumers to deepen and broaden the TWN database beyond non-payroll. Shifting to Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth, it was down less than 5% in second quarter and delivered 2% growth in June. The decline in the quarter was driven by substantial weakness in talent solutions, our hiring rate services business, to where companies across the U.S. cutback on hiring in during the quarter, and in debt management services where temporary reductions in collections activity were implemented by many companies. Partially offsetting this were new product rollouts in talent solutions, strength in government verticals related to government healthcare and support services, as well as the growth in records in the TWN database. We also saw growth in the second quarter in auto through increased TWN penetration with auto loan originators and increased use of TWN with higher credit score applicants. We also saw growth in our TWN ID product and in portfolio review product solutions, principally for card and personal loans, which we expect to continue to grow in the second half given the unique value of income and employment data in the current environment. Employer Services revenue of $101 million increased a strong 75% in the quarter, driven by our unemployment claims business, which grew over 150% versus last year to $76 million. Adjusting for the $48 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter, Employer Service was down about 8% as companies cut back on hiring. As a reminder, our UC businesses manage the process of providing the required unemployment data to state and local agency for employers. Our typical contract is an annual subscription with volume limits and incremental fees as UC claims are above those above those ones. We operate in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. In the second quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 7.5 million claims, which is roughly one in five initial U.S. claims during the second quarter. Claims spiked in April and May to about 5.8 million from a monthly run rate of $300,000 per month in the first quarter. In June, we saw a steady decline in new clients from the elevated April and May rates to 1.7 million claims processed for the month, which was still up dramatically over pre-COVID in 2019 levels. The remainder of Employer Services saw revenue decline 17% in the second quarter because of lower new employee hiring activity in the quarter. I-9 and onboarding in our Workforce Analytics business make up the bulk of the remainder of Employer Services. We saw 9% growth in our I-9 and onboarding business, which partially offset the decline in Workforce Analytics in our Tax Services business. The strong EWS verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 56.3% in the quarter, which was a record for Workforce Solutions and the expansion of 710 basis points versus last year. The strong margin growth was partially offset by incremental costs incurred in the quarter for new TWN records. Workforce Solutions is clearly our most differentiated business with their unique TWN income and employment records. The TWN data assets are increasingly valuable in this COVID consumer environment where verification of income and employment is critical. As we discussed in June, we think about EWS being in the second or third inning, with multiple growth levers for future growth in 2021 and beyond. International revenue of $181 million was down 15% in local currency and down 21% on a reported basis and in line with our expectations. COVID shelter in place orders have been deeper and longer in our international markets, with some markets, including Australia, the U.K. and Canada, still not open. This has impacted their revenue, but we've seen sequential revenue improvements from down 20% in April, improving to down 7% in June. Asia Pacific, which is our Australia, New Zealand and India business delivered second quarter revenue of $65 million, down 9% in local, and 10% in organic local currency versus last year. The revenue growth was much stronger than the revenue trends of down 20% we experienced in April as revenue trends continued to improve, with June down 4%, adjusted for a large collections deal that closed late in the second quarter. In Australia, revenue growth in fraud and ID and collections partially offset declines in our consumer and marketing services businesses, and to a lesser degree, in our commercial business. European revenues of $48 million were down 25% in local currency in the quarter. Our European credit business was down about 20%, with Spain performing slightly better than the U.K. In the U.K. credit business, revenue improved meaningfully during the quarter from down 27% in April, but they were still down 15% in June as the U.K. is still in a lockdown. Spain credit revenue also improved during the quarter from down 21% in April, but was still down 9% in June as shelter in place orders have just begun to be lifted a few weeks ago. Our European debt management business declined 34% in local currency, as expected, principally driven by government enacted policy that temporarily halted consumer debt collections. We expect debt collection activity to resume in the second half. Our Latin American revenues of $34 million decreased 14% in local currency in the quarter. Our two largest markets in Latin America, Chile and Argentina, make up over 50% of the revenue. Importantly, these two markets performed relatively well in the quarter, with Chile down six and Argentina down 10 in local currency compared to last year. April revenue decline for Chile and Argentina were elevated levels in COVID lockdowns, however, June revenue declines were in the low to mid-single digits. These markets continue to benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS customer rollouts and strong new product introductions in the past three years. Most of our other Latin American markets were down over 20% consistently through the quarter from the economic impact of the strong COVID lockdowns in those markets. Canada revenue of $33 million declined 13% in local currency in the second quarter. Revenue improved from a decline of about 25% in April to down only about 1% in June as economic activity improved. But shelter-in-place orders still have not been fully lifted in many parts of Canada. Fraud and ID revenue grew in the second quarter from higher government volumes associated with increased applications for government and social services. And we saw growth in June revenue in our mortgage, auto, and small business verticals in Canada. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.7% were down 690 basis points from last year, principally reflecting the lower revenue across all regions, partially offset by cost savings achieved during the quarter. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 5% on a reported and local currency basis in the quarter. Our Global Consumer Direct business, which is just under half of our GCS business, was down about 3%. Our U.S. Consumer Direct business had revenue declining about 5% versus 2019, but increased sequentially from the first quarter by about 200 basis points. Canada and the U.K. combined consumer direct revenue was about flat in the quarter. Importantly, we are seeing substantial subscriber growth in the U.S. and Canada, our two largest markets. Based on a continuation of these trends, we expect our consumer direct business to show positive revenue growth in the second half, which will be our first growth since 2017 in this market segment. GCS also continues to grow with myEquifax member base with over 6 million consumer members, up from about 2 million a year ago, which provides a foundation for new product offerings. Our remaining GCS business, principally our partner business as well as our benefits channel and event-based business decreased by 5% in the quarter. We delivered high-single-digit growth in our benefits channel and events-based business, but this growth was more than offset by declines in our U.S. Lead Gen partner business as banks pulled back on card and P loan marketing and originations. As we look to the second half of 2020, declines in our U.S. Lead Gen partner revenue are likely to accelerate as consumer marketing remains at reduced levels more than offsetting the expected growth in Global Consumer Direct, our benefits channel, and events-based business. This will likely result in second half revenue decline in GCS greater than the 5% decline we delivered in the second quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.8% decreased 210 basis points compared with the prior year due to the effect of revenue decline, partially offset by operating cost efficiencies. In what has been the most challenging economics and health environment we faced in our lifetime, Equifax delivered a very strong performance, with revenue up 12% and adjusted EBITDA -- EPS up 14% in the first half. Our resilient business model, differentiated data assets, cloud data and technology transformation, new products, and focus on commercial execution, has driven our broad outperformance. Our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS, and EWS, delivered mortgage revenue growth that outperformed the overall mortgage market, substantial growth in our UC revenue, and improving revenue trends across our non-mortgage businesses, the U.S. and international, drove our results. Shifting now to slide six, this page highlights the uniqueness and challenges of the current COVID recession. It is clear that this is the most challenging consumer environment in our lifetime. Compared to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, unemployment rates are up almost 500 basis points with over 20 million Americans out of work. And for the 10% of Americans with negative wage impacts where wages are down 5% to 6%, with many households struggling to manage 25% or more salary reductions or even larger if they're in a furlough. These unprecedented consumer impacts significantly cloud the ability for our customers to manage their business, including marketing, underwriting, and portfolio management. We've seen a significant performance deterioration of prime and near-prime credit portfolio, driven by these job losses and wage reductions. Many project a continuation in job losses or wage reductions as government support programs expire in the coming weeks. In April of this year, approximately 50% of those who suffered a decrease in pay in excess of 25% were individuals with a credit score of 680 or higher, which further complicates the environment for our customers. Forbearances are also driving material loss of predictiveness of traditional credit scores in the sub-prime market. And further, the CARES Act -- with the CARES Act, loan accommodation PE delinquency rates artificially low and make them not representative of the actual portfolio health. Accommodations have grown from 2.8% pre-COVID in March to 9% of balances today. In these challenging times, differentiated data is more valuable than ever. We're seeing a meaningful increase in customer discussions in this unique environment about data solutions broadly, but with a particular focus on our unique TWN income and employment data, which is sourced every paper. Turning now to slide 7. We updated the comparison of our performance in the current COVID pandemic driven recession to our performance in the 2008-2009 global financial crises. Based on the growth of Workforce Solutions and our U.S. mortgage business, we are seeing significantly stronger performance in the current COVID recession, with our 13% revenue growth in the second quarter, and in the early stages of the 2008 and 2009 global financial crisis where Equifax revenue was down 7% to 10% quarterly during that recession. The key drivers of our strong outperformance relative to 2008-2009 include a resilient business model and stronger mix of businesses, with 50% -- 55% of Equifax delivering growth or countercyclical performance in 2020 versus only 40% in 2008-2009. Second, U.S. mortgage revenue is at very high levels with refi and purchase transactions continuing historic levels driven by record low interest rates. We saw mortgage application purchase volume rebound as we exited second quarter as consumers take advantage of record low interest rates. The MBA application purchase index was up 15% versus 2019 in the last week of June. This strength continued into July. Based on current rates, over 15 million existing mortgages would benefit from the refinancing, which is up about 70% higher than the available refi population in 2008-2009, John will give you some further perspective on the second half U.S. mortgage market outlook shortly. Mortgage is clearly much stronger today with revenue in the second quarter for Equifax up over 70%, which is significantly higher than the 20% peak revenue growth we delivered during 2008-2009. Third, Workforce Solutions growth has been accelerated from record growth penetration, new products and new verticals. Their 53% growth in second quarter significantly outperformed their peak quarterly growth performance of about 20% in the 2008-2009 global financial crises. In addition to growth in verifications of 46%, the unemployment claims processing business is seeing record volumes, resulting in the $48 million of incremental UC revenue in the second quarter I talked about earlier. Then last, our commercial momentum from the second half of 2019 and strong first quarter performance as we entered the COVID environment in late March, is clearly also driving our results. The Equifax business model and recession resiliency is clearly much stronger than the last recession in 2008-2009. I'll turn the discussion over to John to discuss recent trends in revenue and our underlying markets, as well as review some of our other financial items. But looking at trends at a high level, USIS and Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue continues to be very strong and relatively stable at the elevated levels we saw in June. While we expect mortgage revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis to remain strong in the second quarter, we do expect growth rates in the third quarter and second quarter to decline versus second quarter as we saw growth -- strong growth in mortgage markets in the second half of 2019. In USIS, the improvement in non-mortgage revenue has flattened over the past few weeks after consistent sequential improvement throughout the second quarter. And in some markets and verticals, we've started to see some slight declines in the last few weeks as COVID case counts increase and some shelter-in-place orders return. In Workforce Solutions, Verification Services trends in non-mortgage revenue remains slightly positive to prior trends, driven by the strategic dynamics of the business and new products rollouts, as we discussed earlier. Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims revenue remains at elevated levels at a run rate of over $40 million for the quarter, which is, while positive over 2019, will be substantially lower than the employment claims, we expect to be substantially lower than the unemployment claims volume we saw in the second quarter. And given the continued uncertainty regarding the direction and pace of the U.S. and global economy, we do not expect to provide guidance throughout the remainder of 2020. As we did last quarter and in June, we'll provide details on the trends we are seeing in an indicative view of their implications. After John's discussion, I'll come back and review our progress on the technology transformation, new products, and our focus on the second half in 2021. John? Thanks, John. I'll wrap up by giving you an update on our cloud transformation -- cloud technology and data transformation and our accelerated focus on new products. First, moving to our EFX 2020 Technology Transformation. During 2020, we focused the bulk of our efforts in the cloud technology data transformation on our North American operations, which represent over 80% of our revenue and even higher percentage of our income. Investments in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific and deploying cloud-native data fabric and our Ignite and InterConnect API analytical and decisioning framework are also progressing well. Initial migration to GCP of our major North American data exchange, the U.S. Canadian consumer ACRO list changes, the work number in NTT is principally complete, and we expect to have complete full migration, including all data ingestion processes for the exchanges in place by year-end. It is at this point that these migrated exchanges become our system of record with our customers. These are critical deliverables for 2020, and completing in this plan remains a strategic focus and priority. These exchanges generate about 70% of North American online revenue. We're also making very good progress in the full migration to GCP of our secondary U.S. exchanges, the commercial risk exchanges, IXI, property and DataX exchanges. We expect a number of these exchanges that have completed full migration by year-end, with the remainder completed in the first half of 2021. And the Canadian commercial risk exchange for migration will also occur in early 2021. In April, we discussed with you the initial migration of our eID identity validation systems, which we expect complete in the third quarter. Customer migrations are expected to start in the second half, and we expect to have fully migrated all eID customers by year-end. Our new Luminate cloud identity and fraud suite being deployed as a cloud-native solution will be available to customers in the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter. And a new eID cloud-native service is also available for the U.S. as part of the new transformed Luminate offering. We are continuing our progress to migrate our customers onto our new cloud based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite API framework. As a reminder, this is a common set of services on, which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. At the end of the second quarter, USIS had migrated 1,200 U.S. customers, and International completed migrations of about 2,000 customers. We expect to continue this pace of migration. We expect this pace of migration to accelerate in the second half of 2020, with over 10,000 USIS customer migrations completed by year-end, and the majority of the remaining U.S. customer migrations completed by mid-2021. We continue to adjust our development priorities to add platform capabilities to ease our customers' ability to easily migrate to our new platforms. As we discussed in April, our new Ignite analytics and machine learning platform is available and in production at EWS and will be available at GCP this quarter. We continue to make strong progress globally, rolling out our Ignite analytics platform with over 200 customers using Ignite, direct and marketplace, including two new Fintech customers added in the second quarter. An additional substantial benefit from transforming our own and on-premise infrastructure to Google, will be a significant reduction in our carbon footprint, which is a focus area of our ESG strategy. Google remains the only cloud provider that uses 100% renewable energy in their centers, which we will benefit from. We are making strong progress in our cloud technology and data transformation and remain energized about the future top and bottom-line benefits John discussed earlier. Our cloud-native data and infrastructure is and will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace. Shifting to slide 14, which highlights our new product initiative focus, which is a key component of our EFX2020 Strategy and is our next chapter as we leverage our cloud, data and technology transformation for growth. To strengthen our capabilities and product management and API, we recently added a new Chief Product Officer, Cecilia Mao, who has deep product expertise from prior roles with FICO, Verisk, and Oracle. Cecilia joined Mark Luber, our new USIS Product Officer, with a goal of accelerating our product management capability to drive new product growth. We expect to continue to add product resources in the second half to position half to position us for growth in 2021 and beyond. We continue to launch new and refined existing products to support our customer-specific needs during the COVID pandemic. This includes our Equifax Response NOW product initiative in USIS and tailored I-9 and UC Solutions and Workforce Solutions. USIS recently announced the addition of an industry-specific FICO score segmentation data to our weekly consumer trends reports. With this integration, Equifax is the first company to weekly industry-specific FICO score segmentation reports, enabling businesses across the industry to better track anonimized consumer trends, behaviors, and credit performance across the U.S., which allows our customers to better anticipate consumer behavior changes as a result of the COVID recession. As we progress through the year, we continue to make strong progress on our goal to expand our NPI rollouts and deliver over 100 new products in 2020, which is up from about 90 last year in 60 in 2018. Through June, we've launched 70 new products, and we have an active pipeline of new products at various stages in the pipeline funnel. Some of the new product launches include a USIS launched FICO 10-T. The FICO 10-T score incorporates trended data for strategies and use cases that benefit from additional trended data insights into consumer behavior. We work with FICO to incorporate trended credit bureau data to offer a view on the trajectory of certain data fields over time, such as account balance amounts reported over the past 24 months. Consumer behavior -- consumer payment behavior and credit limit information can also be captured via the trended data. Workforce Solutions also have a strong NPI focus. As we discussed on our June 8th call, Workforce Solutions recently launched a number of new mortgage solutions, including mortgage TWN ID and I-9 Anywhere products. Both are seeing strong market growth. Another area of focus is the expansion of the data sets in our talent reports. New multi-data solutions incorporating employment, ID verification, and degree verification can add value to hiring decisions in high turnover industries such as retail, restaurants, manufacturing, and hospitality, especially as we look at the post-COVID recovery period. We also continue to make good progress with our positive data in Australia and now have over 80% of positive data from contributors, with about 90% of the credit card and mortgage data and more than 50% of the auto and P loan data in our database. We've begun to use this positive data in Australia to provide analytical insights to our customers and expect to launch additional new products later this year. NPIs continue to be an important lever for Equifax growth and a priority for me and to the team. We prioritize our focus and resources on driving NPI rollouts in 2020, and more recently, a global focus on products to support our customers during the COVID recession. We will continue to prioritize new products and innovation in the second half to leverage our cloud data and technology transformation for future growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain actively engaged with stakeholders in the public and private sectors regarding Equifax solutions that accurately portray the risk profile of consumers, while recognizing the unique and likely temporary nature of the financial impact of the pandemic. In every country where we do business, Equifax is in discussions with lawmakers and regulators to enable continued credit reporting that captures the status of consumer payments and lender accommodations. Depending on the geography, we've worked independently in conjunction with our peers and our trade associations to provide proactive assistance to financial institutions seeking guidance on how to report during this time frame. In U.S., we're in regular communications with federal regulators, including the CFPB, where we're sharing data trends with the bureau regarding both consumers and publisher [ph]. We're proud that our import has contributed to regulatory guidance at the bureau is published a broadly inform the marketplace. Furthermore, at least three of our most significant markets around the world, Equifax is providing data and insights directly to federal governments to help policymakers understand the pandemic's consequences on consumers in the credit economy. We recognize that many consumers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and our experienced economic distress. Equifax has established a COVID resource section on our website to assist consumers looking to manage their epidemics potential impact on their credit standing. In April, we joined the other U.S. credit bureaus and announcing that we're providing free credit reports to all U. S. consumers through April 2021. We're also offering free credit reports to Canadian consumers. More recently, Bev Anderson, our Business Unit Leader for GCS, hosted a series of informational webinars for consumers on managing credit during COVID pandemic. Our GCS team is also participating in industry webinars and events to educate stakeholders regarding the options, as well as the reporting standards. We will continue to support consumers and remain engaged as a constructive partner to help consumers businesses in the overall economy during this challenging time. Wrapping up, turning to slide 15. As John outlined earlier, we're still unable to provide guidance for the third quarter or the second half. We still see meaningful uncertainty from the impacts of the COVID pandemic as cases rise tragically in many markets, impacting shelter in place orders, consumer confidence and economic activity. There's also a real risk for the second COVID wave in the fall and potential for increased lockdowns. We also expect further impacts from unemployment, furloughs and salary reductions as government support programs expire in the coming weeks. Like other companies, we have very limited visibility in the depth and breadth and length of the COVID recession or the timing or strength of recovery until we have a broadly available vaccine. This uncertainty makes it challenge to provide our traditional guidance for the third quarter and second half. We hope the framework John provided is helpful as you think about the range of outcomes for Equifax in the third quarter and second half. Even in this challenging environment, Equifax is operating extremely well. Our strong business model is resilient and delivering in the COVID environment while investing -- while allowing us to invest in the future. Our performance in the second quarter followed a strong first quarter and our momentum in the second half of 2019. Our strong results allow Equifax to continue to invest in our cloud data technology transformation, data and analytics, and new products to position Equifax for future growth in 2021 and beyond. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and towards 2021 and 2022, we are confident in our business model, strategy for growth, cloud, data, and technology investments and the ability to perform in a challenging COVID environment. We have a very strong team with deep domain expertise, and we continue to strengthen that team. We delivered strong financial results again in the second quarter, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, with over 200 basis points of margin expansion, while continuing to invest in our cloud, data, and technology transformation, data and analytics, and new products. Workforce Solutions is a franchise business that is strongly outperforming. We gave you a deep dive in Workforce a few weeks ago and expect continued strong performance from Workforce Solutions in the COVID recession with strong growth potential in the long-term. Workforce delivered exceptionally strong revenue growth in the second quarter, up over 50% of adjusted EBITDA in our margins of 55%. These results are the strongest since we acquired the business in 2007, driven by macro events and mortgage and unemployment claims businesses and new claims businesses and new TWN record growth, increased penetration in launching new products. And Workforce Solutions is strongly outgrowing the mortgage market. Our unique TWN income unemployment data is even more valuable in this unprecedented economic event due to the scale, accuracy, and latency of that unique data. We believe Workforce Solutions is well positioned for attractive long-term growth. USIS had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 10% and the strongest first half revenue growth since 2013 led by strong growth in U.S. mortgage. USIS' pipeline are the strongest since 2017 from the renewed commercial focus and rollout of new products. The business is operating well and winning in the marketplace. International executed well against a challenging global economic environment and our GCS direct business is poised for growth in the second half of the year. And as I outlined, we're making very good progress on our cloud, technology, and data transformation and beginning to take advantage of the new cloud-based capabilities. Execution of the cloud investment is a clear priority for our team in 2020. We've accelerated some of our spending, and our focus on the cloud transformation remains strong. We expect a number of our data exchange migrations to completed by year-end, and are well down the path on customer migrations. We know we still have a lot of work to do. We are energized about the strong benefits that will come from this transformation, including always-on-stability, speed-to-market, ability to rapidly new products around the globe, and the strong top of line benefits John talked about. We are continuing to invest in new products and innovation by investing in new product leadership and resources to drive innovative new product rollouts. Our NPI capabilities are being accelerated by our cloud transformation, and we expect to launch over 100 NPIs in 2020. NPI remains a top priority for 2020 in the future, and we continue to expand our investments in new products, leveraging our cloud transformation. We're also making proactive investments in technology and DNA, new products and security, while balancing cost controls across the rest of Equifax. And our balance sheet, as John pointed out, remains strong, ensuring we are prepared to make the necessary investments in our EFX 2020 cloud data and technology transformation, new products and data security, while looking for attractive bolt-on acquisitions. And we continue to support consumers through these challenging times with free credit reports and consumer education on our website. As we look to the second half of 2020 and towards 2021 and 2022, I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market-leading data, analytics and technology company. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Yeah. Toni, I'll start and then John can jump in. We were pleased with the kind of sequential improvement in USIS broadly, and then, of course, in non-mortgages we went through the quarter, particularly a shelter in place orders were listed and economic activity improved. So that was a positive. We just wanted to point out there's still real uncertainties in the marketplace. We've seen markets like Florida, and Texas and California that it had some of the recent COVID spikes from our online volumes, seeing some impact on that. It's not meaningful, but it's not continuing the sequential trend. So we really just wanted to point out that we expect some uncertainties going forward. One of the other positives that I pointed out a couple of times is the fact that the USIS new deal pipeline in their win rate continue to grow through the second quarter off of the first quarter and off of last year. And for us, that's probably the most important element. It's quite challenging to forecast the economic outlook. But seeing Workforce Solutions accelerate their new product rollouts, and really winning in the marketplace competitively is quite positive for us as we think about the third quarter. Just -- make one last point Toni is that the biggest challenge right now is when will our customers restart marketing. And we've seen some increased activity from a below 2019. But there's just so much uncertainty for our customers around the consumer and the economy. Many of them have pulled back on marketing. In counter to that, we've seen a significant increase in activity and dialogues around portfolio management, which is typical in an economic downturn. A lot of resource is shift to managing the backlog, managing existing customers, managing credit lines. So we've got that positive going in marketing. When will our customers get comfortable to market again, I think, is the big question, and I think there's a lot of uncertainty on that. Yes. You get the two items that are very strong, obviously. UC claims is high incremental margin as is the growth in verification, so both of those are driving our margins. We've got -- as you know, revenue growth broadly in our business and in Workforce Solutions, incremental revenue growth delivers very, very high incremental margins, which is driving that. And the other thing of workforce that we pointed out that we were pleased with is how we outgrew the mortgage market. That really is a reflection of the power and the weakness of the data assets they have and the multiple levers we talked about on the June call with Workforce Solutions. Hey Kevin. Yes. We've talked, Kevin, before. I think you're talking about the fact that we go to market as one Equifax with our customers. And as you know, USIS sells to all of our financial institutions, the USIS credit products as well as the Workforce Solutions' verification product. So that kind of bundled approach to our customers, we think is a smart way to go-to-market. It gives us the ability to incent our commercial team to sell a full Equifax solution. It gives us the ability to leverage product positions on both the credit and verification side when we're in discussions with customers. And so we're clearly seeing the ability seeing the ability to approach customers with a broad Equifax solution that would include credit data, wealth, and employment data, our NTT data and then, of course, our verification data from Workforce Solutions and bundled solutions in many cases, which we think is attractive for Equifax. Yes. We've been consistently talking about this, Kevin, for the last couple of years. That was our expectation that the cloud transformation would allow us to accelerate the ability to get more new products to market and also getting the product to market more quickly and we're starting to see that. The good news is we're already -- really in the last six months as we've gotten deep into the cloud transformation, we've been able to roll out new products and we talked about this on the April call. We're putting new products in the marketplace that we couldn't do two years ago because of the single-data fabric, our ability to combine data assets, our ability to ingest new solutions, having a simpler application infrastructure, speeding up our ability to bring products to market. And we're excited about starting to see the early benefits of that. And we do believe those benefits will accelerate, meaning our ability to do more new products in the future. And you're seeing that as we go from 60 products to 90 last year to over 100 this year. And our goal, and we're putting resources around it to really leverage our massive investment in the cloud transformation for both data and our technology to accelerate our new products rollouts in 2021 and 2022. I think as you know, that's a real fuel for growth in our industry and for Equifax. So we've got a really big focus on it, we've brought some great new talent in, we're going to add resources and people against it in the second half, because we really look at new products as being the next chapter for Equifax around driving our growth and really leveraging our cloud, data and technology transformation. Yeah. It's all of the above. I think you've got -- we've got not a new leader anymore, but since he's been on the ground now for 18 months. He really remade the commercial organization that's been in place for six months. There's a real increased focus commercially in the marketplace. So I think that's positive number one. The pipelines are a combination of new products. When you go from 60 to 90 and then towards 100, there's just more opportunities for his team to bring new solutions to our customers. The pipeline growth, we also believe that is from the COVID response products that we've rolled out. This is a -- we tried to highlight on the call earlier; this is a really unprecedented time for our customers. And the value of data broadly for all of us in the industry is even more valuable. And actually, if you go back to 2008-2009, they're just more options for our customers to use data and manage in recession. So I think that's driving all of our capabilities in our conversations with our customers. And then there's no question, we talked about our win rates being up on a year-over-year basis. We're clearly more competitive in the marketplace. There's -- the overhang that was perhaps here a year ago from the cyber event, we believe, is way behind us. And we're really just focused on a normal node, that I would call it a fairly aggressive mode in the marketplace to really support our customers in this challenging time. Yeah. We have a very standard rigorous process around what is the new product, it's got to be new. And we've been -- had a consistent process. John, I think, for five-plus years... ...on how we define new products and we try to be transparent with you and others about our new product rollouts because of the importance to our future growth. We think they're quite accretive to the future. And that's why we're doubling down on people and resources to really leverage the cloud transformation. I know there was a framework in the past in our financial framework around the contribution of new products to our revenue growth. As you know, we don't have a financial framework in place today. So, we probably don't want to talk about how we think about that. But I hope you appreciate the focus that I have and we have around new products because we believe it's a really important lever for growth that is going to be accelerated by our call transformation. When you think about why did we do the cloud transformation, there's a lot of reasons. One for sure is to accelerate our topline and the way to accelerate your topline from the cloud transformation is to bring new solutions to market more quickly and more creatively and we believe more uniquely than our competitors. And that's the focus that we have with the cloud. And of course, you get all the cost and cash benefits that John talked about that will start rolling in, in 2021 and 2022 as we complete the execution of the cloud transformation. Yes. There's no question. Our international margins are lower than our U.S. margins. We have just so much scale in Workforce Solutions in USIS, as you know, versus many of our smaller markets. And some of that is going to be structural, just given the scale of those businesses. We do believe the cloud transformation is going to be accretive to that, improve those margins. And of course, we're focused on other actions and we have been. This isn't new on other actions and we have been. This isn't new to improve those margins, whether it's from new products or incremental growth. And the biggest way to improve margins internationally is topline growth because of the incremental margin impact that comes from that topline growth. And of course, they were impacted most significantly in the second quarter because of the depth and breadth and how severe the lockdowns were. And of course, many of our international markets are still in lockdown. Yes, I think as you know we talked about this many times, our competitors are much stronger in Fintech. That's been a priority focus of our team since I joined two years and change ago. We had two years a handful of people covering Fintech. And today, we've got, I think, 15 or 16. So, it's a clear focus. We've more than tripled our commercial resources in the last couple of years. We see it as an opportunity. We're having wins there. I talked about in my notes that we had two U.S. Fintech customers at Ignite in the second quarter. So, we're actively engaged with Fintech. And Fintech is a couple of hundred million dollars space in the U.S., growing faster than the core market. It's actually a bit more impacted in COVID recession right now than the broader market, but it's a space that we want to be bigger in, and we're focused on. Yes. You have two different questions there, David. First on the government revenues, from our perspective are unrelated to Vice President Biden's and Senator Sanders proposal. And our government revenues are really at for social services, so our government revenues won't be impacted. And as you might imagine, we think the current credit bureau system in the U. S. well serves consumers and publishers. There's plenty of competition between the large three credit bureaus. We don't see a need for what was outlined in that proposal. We would suspect it's perhaps more positioning in an election cycle versus something that would have broad bipartisan support. And if you look around the globe, the few global markets where there is a government credit bureau, over time, either they've been privatized or private credit bureaus have operated against next to them. So we think the system in the United States today serves the market extremely well in a very competitive way. Yeah. I think that's a tough question, too, David. Equifax, we're spending $1 billion a year in technology in 2020, and we have for a long time to go to the industry. This is an extremely complex set. There's trillions of records, there's thousands and thousands of contributors. It will be a very long road. And again, from our perspective, that may be a reason why there wouldn't be bipartisan support for it. I think the broader perspective on why there would be bipartisan support as the system works today. It services the industry well, it services consumers well, there's great transparency. And if you look at the increase in alternative data, there's just more opportunities to support consumers, which is really what I believe Vice President Biden is focused on is how do you ensure that credit access to those that need it is available in the marketplace. And we believe the bureau today provides great support and great focus on that. Hi, Bill. Morning. It's a good question. I think we talked, Bill, broadly about our focus on one of the benefits we expect from our cloud-native transformation, as you know, it's a technology transformation and a data transformation, but the single-data fabric that we're going to, we believe, is going to allow we're going to, we believe, is going to allow us to do many more data combinations then we're able to do easily today. And that's one of the many reasons we're doing the cloud transformation. That would be an example of using income employment data with some of our other our other data assets to bring unique solutions that are on the Equifax because of our Workforce Solutions business to the marketplace. And we have those not in our current pipeline, but those kind of things on our to-do list in our pipeline in the future. And it's another reason, Bill; why I'm expanding our product resources across Equifax in the second quarter, and we're going to expand them further in the second half is really to really fuel up that new product engine, not only for the second half, but for 2021 and 2022. That's a big focus of mine is to take advantage of the single data fabric in the cloud, in the cloud technology we're going to have to really accelerate our new product rollouts. Yes, I hope you got the tone of our conversation. We're keeping a tight belt here because we still see meaningful uncertainty in the second half about the pandemic. At the same time, I hope you got our tone that we're making targeted investments. With our financial strength, we want to make sure we're making those investments for the future. But we are accruing kind of net benefits on a year-over-year basis on our cost structure. And certainly, during our plan we had in place early in the year, from some of the belt tightening we've done. You point out P&L travel. When you think about the near-term, no one's traveling at Equifax. And so that's a clear savings on a year-over-year basis. On a long-term run rate, I suspect the way we use video will meaningfully change our travel spend going forward. We spend -- about half of our P&L is spent in internal travel, meaning between Equifax sites. My view is post-COVID, that will go to zero. We just won't need to do it because we're so much more a depth at working together and collaborating through the use of Google Hangouts and other video tools. So, I think that's kind of a change that will be permitting. I think our business travel to customers will likely be lower just because of the efficiency of video. Instead of making three trips to a customer to work on a new product, you might make one post-COVID. And then have four or five video calls and do the whole project quicker just because of how we're working. So, I think there's the efficiency and collaboration on video, I do think will have a significant change. On the real estate side, we're going to go through -- we've got a handful of small offices that really got highlighted for us in the COVID recession. We're going to close those. It just doesn't make sense to have 20, 30, 40-person offices. Those seems to either work-from-home or be consolidated in other sites. So there'll be some real estate benefit there. We haven't gone off the next step of deciding whether we change our broader real estate footprint, so I suspect we'll look at that as the year progresses. But as you point out, we're -- we operated very effectively in a work-from-home mode, and we're still operating with our Red-Blue teams in a 50%, we're actually higher work-from-home mode, meaning we only have less than half of the team in our offices every week and the other house working from home, and Equifax is operating extremely well. So that will be something that we'll look at in the second half. Do you have anything to add? Okay. Does that cover where you were heading? Yeah, it's tough, as you know, to predict. I think what we've seen pretty consistently in all markets. If you look at April and May, fairly severe lockdowns, not a lot of economic activity, as you got into May and June, in most markets, our customers figured out how to operate in a lockdown environment. And we're having commercial activity. Selling cars without showrooms being open and that's happening around the globe, so that, kind of, adaptability to a lockdown. I think the challenging international is their lockdown. We've seen U.S. lockdowns, kind of, relax in the last four, five weeks in many, many markets. Of course, you've seen some tightening or consumer confidence issues around the spikes in the last couple of weeks in many markets. But international lockdowns have just been extended. It is just much longer. We have markets like Australia. I think Melbourne -- in our Melbourne market is not going to open until late August. So those delays, we believe, and the depth of the lockdowns in many international markets really dampened their economic activity, which impacted our revenue. As those markets open up, we would expect to see improvements, but we just can't predict when and how much. So we would expect to see those improve as companies adapt and as actually restrictions are lifted, and there's some level of kind of COVID normalcy. Hey, George. Yes. From our perspective, Andrew, like the U.K. is still in lockdown, meaning our office is not open. Our customers' offices aren't open. They're still working from home. Economic activity, we believe, is depressed because of that versus if you look at like Georgia, which is opened, and other markets in the United States. Spain opened just a couple of weeks ago. Canada is particularly a Toronto market is still in lockdown, meaning they're not open. For most commercial activity in Australia is still in lockdown. So our experience is that -- and our perspective is that the international markets lockdown sooner, and they lockdown longer, and of course, we don't see business in Italy, which, as you know, lockdown opens up quicker, but the markets that we're in are the ones I'm referencing. And we're heavily U.K. based, right? So for us, the bulk of the CRA is U.K. Hi, Jeff. Yeah. First, on the pipeline, we have -- as you know, we have a dedicated team. We talked about that at June 8. This is all they do is focused on records at either as I would call it, going door-to-door to companies that they are not a part of our database or working on partnerships with payroll processors and others that we do revenue share with. And they have a very active pipeline. We -- what I would characterize is put them on offense in the second quarter. They were before, but we're deliberately leaning in. And on both sides, if you think about your company and you're under some financial pressure, today, you do that yourself in many cases, meaning you're taking calls from mortgage originators into the HR department and you've got a handful of people staffing a call center to respond to your employee calls on that. If we go in and can share our value prop, where we'll do it for free for them, we'll do it securely, it becomes a productivity improvement for that company. So that's a positive. So from a climate standpoint, it's always a good discussion. It's maybe better now. And then in the partnerships, the idea of getting an incremental revenue share from Equifax from a -- to a payroll processor. Those conversations are positive, too. So we like the pipeline. As you know, it's a bit choppy sometimes. We added a large processor last September. We're benefiting from that now. Those can be clunky or chunky. But we have a consistent focus on adding records, and we've shown a pretty good trend of adding them. On your question about the impact of unemployment is something we're watching. We expect there to be some pressure on actives in there. We had some decline in the latter half of the second quarter that were offset by additions that we have with new contributors and new employees or records coming in, and we expect to keep that focus going in the third quarter, but we're definitely watching it. And I think lastly, I think, as you know, we not only sell active records, meaning those that are working, but we also have a pretty large portion of our revenue Workforce Solutions is inactive records, meaning where with someone working two weeks ago, two months ago, three weeks ago, because people change jobs. And if we don't have an active, many times, we're able to sell the inactive, meaning what they were doing six months ago before they change jobs, and that becomes -- that's another part of our revenue. You want to take it John? Hey Gary. So Gary, again, I think that's kind of getting into kind of a longer term view in the 2021 outlook, and we're just not ready to do that yet. We've given a fair amount of commentary even in this discussion around the fact that our margins in mortgage are obviously not nearly as strong as they are in the normal online business, principally because of mortgage solutions, right, because mortgage solutions, we purchase files from our two competitors. So, there's -- those margins are still good in our mortgage business on average, but not nearly as high as we'd see in a normal online poll. And -- but there's a lot of moving parts that are going to go into what 2021 and 2022 look like. So, I think we're all going to have to see how the markets evolve and we'll give you a lot more view as to what we expect for that as we get toward the end of the year."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Equifax First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I\u2019d like to now turn the conference to your host, Mr. Jeffrey Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.\nJeffrey Dodge: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge and on today\u2019s call with me are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today on our website at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under Earnings Calls, Presentations and Webcasts. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found under the Earnings Calls, Presentations and Webcast section. These materials are labeled Q1 2020 Earnings Release Presentation. During this call, we\u2019ll also be making some certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19, and economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the first quarter of 2020, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes costs associated with acquisition-related amortization expense, gains on fair market value adjustments of equity investments, the foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans, a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, a tax benefit on a legal settlement related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses for remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax - excuse me, also excludes legal and professional fees related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations, as well as the incremental nonrecurring project costs designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global network and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and 2019 and are expected to occur in 2020 and 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back interest expense net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and also, as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, gains on fair market value adjustments and equity investments, the foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. We are all facing unprecedented times during the COVID global pandemic. I hope you and your families are safe in managing in this unusual environment. We\u2019d like to start by thanking the dedicated and selfless health care professionals, first responders, volunteers and others around the world who are fighting the frontline pandemic. Their dedication and sacrifice is nothing less than heroic. The economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding and will clearly be deeper than anything we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes. To help with today\u2019s discussion, we posted a first quarter 2020 Investor Relations presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentations. We plan to walk through the presentation on today\u2019s call if you want to pull it up. At Equifax, as we execute during this pandemic at our work from home protocol and business continuity plans, we\u2019re focused on five critical priorities highlighted on slide four. Number one, the health and safety of our employees and their families, number two, continuing to deliver for our customers with the highest level of service and supporting our customers with new data and analytical services they will need as they respond to the pandemic and economic impacts and their business \u2013 their businesses and priorities change. Number three, supporting consumers as they are challenged by the economic impacts of COVID-19 by providing free credit reports and financial education, number four, executing on our cloud technology, data and security transformation. Our focus and investment in our cloud-native technology data and security transformation are continuing at the same levels we had originally planned for 2020, with a goal of accelerating our cloud-based data and technology capabilities to make them available more rapidly to our customers. Funding and executing of our cloud technology transformation continues to be a priority for Equifax. And number five, continuing on the new product momentum from 2019 with NPIs tailored off Equifax\u2019s unique data assets for the recession environment. We started to accelerate new product rollouts in 2019, and that focus is continuing in 2020. Like most companies, we initiated our COVID-19 business continuity plans in mid-March, which included activating our crisis management team reporting directly to me, as well as instituting ongoing interaction with our Board to keep them apprised of our plans. We have over 9,000 employees working from home across our global workforce. Only essential roles in customer support and data center operations continue to work from our facilities. We virtually eliminated travel with limited exceptions for essential customer or regulatory business needs. For our close to 2,000 associates and essential roles that are still working from our facilities, we have implemented social distancing of workspaces, aggressive cleaning and sanitizing and other actions to make sure our sites are as safe as possible. We\u2019ve been in the work from home mode and no-travel environment for five weeks, actually now going on six weeks, and are operated continuously and effectively for our customers. We believe our team\u2019s efficiency and productivity is continuing at levels at or better than pre-crisis. We are seeing tremendous benefits from our move to cloud-native tools that are driving significant collaboration as a part of our cloud technology and data transformation. Our development teams are working almost exclusively on Google Cloud platform and Amazon Cloud services, and their efficiency continues at very high levels. And our movement to cloud-based security tools over the past 30 months has also proven to be highly beneficial in this new work from home environment. I hope this gives you a strong sense that Equifax is executing and delivering well during these challenging times for our customers and consumers, while continuing our cloud and new product investments for the future. I\u2019m also pleased with the team we have in place to manage through these challenging COVID-19 crisis. They are battle-tested with deep domain and experience. My personal experience leading GE Capital\u2019s card business during the 2009 global financial crisis gives me a very unique customer lens on the value of data and analytics in a recession environment. Moving now to our results for the first quarter. Let\u2019s turn to slide five. We\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter as both revenue and adjusted EPS significantly exceeded our expectations and our guidance for the quarter. The first quarter delivered our strongest performance since the 2017 cyber event and continued our strong momentum from the second half of 2019, where our organic growth revenue rate jumped to over 9% during the last 6 months of 2019. First quarter revenue of $958 million was up over 15% in constant currency and up 14% on an organic constant currency basis. We had strong revenue growth driven by our US B2B businesses, USIS and EWS that collectively were up a very strong 22% overall with Workforce Solutions up an outstanding 32% and USIS up a very strong 15%. US mortgage market inquiries were at historic high levels given the low interest rate environment with inquiries up almost 42%. International revenue was up 3% in constant currency, and global consumer continued their path back to growth with revenue up over 3% consistent with fourth quarter and their third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. These results were dampened by the COVID-19 lockdown impacts during the last two weeks of March, which reduced first quarter revenue by around $20 million. Adjusted EPS of $1.40 per share was up 16% and well above our expectations and the top end of the guidance we provided in February. As we discussed on prior calls, we incurred redundant systems costs in the quarter, including incremental D&A, cloud and other operating costs of $15 million or about $0.09 a share, which dampened our earnings growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA was up a strong 20% with margins of 32.4% that were up 190 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2019 given our strong revenue growth and the cost actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, with strong margin growth in USIS, EWS and International.  As we discussed on prior calls, we expect our EBITDA to grow more rapidly than EPS in the coming years due to the increased amortization of our incremental cloud transformation investments. FX movements in the quarter were more negative to revenue and adjusted EPS than expected by $13 million and $0.02 per share, respectively. Our constant dollar revenue growth through February of 15% provides a good view of the continued strong progress we are making across all of our businesses and the positive momentum of Equifax over the past three quarters. This performance positions us well to navigate the COVID-19 economic headwinds. I\u2019ll shift now to a discussion of the first quarter performance of each of the four business units, as highlighted on slide six. Later in my comments, I will discuss in some detail the impacts we are seeing in April as the coronavirus lockdown impact portions of our business and their implications for our financial performance in the second quarter. USIS revenue of $343 million in the first quarter was up 15% versus the first quarter of 2019 on a reported basis, and 13% on an organic basis. For the quarter, online revenue was up 16%. Online non-mortgage revenue was up 3% in the quarter. And online non-mortgage organic revenue declined 1%, reflecting the decline in March volumes associated with declines in economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, USIS online non-mortgage revenue was up 7% in total and a solid 2.5% on an organic basis. We saw nice growth across auto, direct-to-consumer, banking, insurance, which was partially offset by declines in telco in the first two months of the first quarter. In telco, we won back primary share with a major customer beginning in March, which is a positive going into second quarter. The strengthening of online revenue through February is very positive and another sign of our continued progress in USIS commercially. This positive momentum in the first quarter and second half of 2019 will serve USIS well as we enter the COVID-19 economic environment. Mortgage solutions were up a very strong 33% in the quarter, and lower than mortgage market inquiry growth given the mix shift in the quarter from mortgage solutions to online. Mortgage solutions continue to perform very well in this low interest rate environment. USIS' Financial Marketing Service business revenue was down 2% in the quarter compared to last year. Revenue declines were due to lower-than-expected project revenue in March brought on by the COVID-19 lockdowns. I\u2019m very encouraged by the performance of Sid Singh and his USIS team in the first quarter, both in their strong growth through February, and in the speed at which they are adapting product offerings and their selling efforts in March to meet the substantial change in customer needs from the COVID-19 pandemic. This follows USIS' momentum in the second half of 2019. Later in my comments, I\u2019ll discuss the success we are having across Equifax in focusing our efforts with customers on solutions leveraging our unique data assets to help them manage through this new COVID-19 recession environment. US is accelerating commercial activity and new deal pipelines remain strong. During the current market conditions, the number of pipeline opportunities as of the end of March was up 6% compared to December 2019 and up 33% from March 2019. And our win rate in the first quarter was up about 500 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. We are continuing to close new deals with customers in the past few weeks, even with the COVID-19 work environment. And we expect strong mortgage growth in the second quarter in the current low interest rate environment. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 44.7% were up 170 basis points from the first quarter of 2019, driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by increased royalty costs, as well as the increased investments in new product development, data analytics, increased consumer support costs and redundant systems costs. Turning now to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue up a very strong 32% versus the first quarter of 2019. Rudy Ploder and his EWS team delivered the highest growth quarter for EWS since we acquired the business in 2007. And on a run rate basis for the 12 months ended March 31st, EWS crossed the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time in their history, both huge milestones. Verification Services revenue was up an extremely strong 48% compared with the prior year, driven by outstanding revenue growth in verification and mortgage. The strong Verification Services revenue growth also reflects continued year-over-year growth in work number active records, as well as the rollout of new products in mortgage, talent solutions and other verticals and continued expansion of system-to-system integration with customers, which you know is really critical. EWS and Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth was a strong 9% and 15% respectively, compared to last year. Through February, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth was up 18% with strong double-digit growth across key non-mortgage verticals, including government, auto, talent solutions and debt management. Non-mortgage verifier revenue growth for the quarter was up 15%, but down from the 18% run rate we saw in February, reflecting the COVID-19 impact in the latter half of March, principally in auto, debt management and talent solutions. Work number database closed the first quarter with 105 million active records and 80 million active unique individuals, up 18% compared to March 2019. And the database now represents about half of US non-farm payroll. Our contributors are also growing rapidly from just under 30,000 a year ago to over 700,000 companies contributing in the first quarter. Growing TWN [ph] records drive hit rates that translates into revenue almost immediately. We expect to continue TWN contributor and record growth in second quarter in 2020. The work number database is Equifax\u2019s most unique and differentiated asset, particularly with the scale and currency of the database that can provide incremental value to our customers in today\u2019s challenging times, where there is so much income and employment uncertainty around consumers in the US. Through February, our Employer Services business revenues were flat compared to first quarter 2019. This was slightly better than the performance we saw over much of 2019 and reflected growth in our I-9 and other talent management businesses, offset by declines in unemployment insurance claims management and our Workforce Analytics business. For the quarter, Employer Services revenue was up 2%, with our unemployment insurance claims management business up 8% organically in the quarter due to very substantial - due to a very substantial increase in unemployment claims volume in the second half of March, with daily volumes up six fold during the last two weeks of March or the quarter given the rise in US unemployment filings. We expect continued substantial growth in unemployment claims in the second quarter. John will discuss this in more detail when he covers March and April trends in a few minutes. The strong verifier revenue growth resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5%, an increase of 210 basis points compared to last year due to the strong revenue growth and proactive cost management, which more than offset increased royalty costs and our redundant system costs from the technology transformation. Workforce Solutions is an outstanding business that continues to deliver very strong results even in challenging times. John will discuss later that we expect Workforce Solutions to deliver strong growth again in the second quarter. International revenue of $216 million was up 3% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis. Through February, International constant currency revenue was up a strong 8% with organic revenue growth also up 7.5%. The strong growth through February was a continuation of International\u2019s strong second half 2019 momentum. Their commercial momentum in the first quarter positions the International business to operate well in the new COVID-19 environment. Asia Pacific, which is primarily our Australian and New Zealand business and now also includes our India business had first quarter revenue of $70 million, up 3% in constant currency year-over-year. Through February however, Asia Pacific was up a strong 5% in local currency and Australia grew over 4%, both stronger than our expectations. Broad and ID and commercial online were both very strong in Australia, up 20% and 9%, respectively and marketing services continues to decline but at a much slower rate than in 2019. Shifting now to Europe. Our European business with revenue of $66 million was down 1% year-over-year in constant currency, with the credit business and debt management businesses also down 1%. And our credit business is negatively impacted by the decline in the economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of March. Through February in Europe, we showed strong constant currency growth of 8.5%. Our UK and Spain credit businesses grew 7% in total through February. In the UK, we saw growth in our financial services vertical, both direct and through reseller partners. We also saw growth in the gaming vertical and from new products launched in 2019 in open banking and digital marketing. European debt management revenue was up over 10% through February as we saw higher debt placements with the UK government. As John will discuss shortly, we are expecting a significant decline in debt management revenue in the UK in the second quarter as the UK government has suspended tax collection activities during the COVID crisis, as well as declines in our European credit businesses due to customers pausing on collection activities during the early phases of COVID-19. Shifting now to Latin America. Our business in Latin America delivered revenue of $43 million in the first quarter and was up 9% in local currency. However, through February, Latin America was up a strong 15% in local currency, led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Mexico, low-teens growth in Chile and Ecuador and high single growth in Uruguay. Our Latin American businesses are adding new logos and benefiting from the rapid adoption of Ignite and Interconnect in their markets. Canada revenue of $37 million was up 2% in local currency in the first quarter. Unlike most of our international markets, Canada has a mortgage business that benefits like the US from lower interest rates. Revenue growth in our Canadian mortgage business in the first quarter which makes up just over 10% of Canadian revenue were largely offset by declines in our consumer and commercial businesses during the last two weeks of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, Canada was up 5%, driven by consumer credit, specifically mortgage, and our commercial and ID and fraud businesses. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 27.8% were up a strong 250 basis points compared to last year. The strong growth in margins reflects the benefit of revenue growth and the cost actions implemented by the International team in the fourth quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019. Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions, their revenue was up 3% on a reported basis in the quarter and constant currency basis in the quarter. Their third - this was their third consecutive quarter of growth. Global Consumer direct revenue, which represents about 40% of total GCS revenue, was down about 2% year-over-year in the quarter. We saw mid single digit growth across the UK and Canada\u2019s combined consumer direct businesses. While the US consumer direct business declined 7% in the first quarter, it continued to improve from the fourth quarter of 2019 and still represents a substantial improvement from the double-digit decline in the US Consumer Direct business we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and since the cyber event in 2017. Sequentially versus fourth quarter, total subscribers are stable to slightly increasing across the US, Canada and UK, which is an encouraging sign as we move into second quarter. Our GCS partner businesses increased 8% in the quarter as a result of growth from our US free model partners, our benefits channel and our breach business, offset by revenue declines with some of our paid model partners. Our partners business was up a solid 9% through February as we saw nice growth in our benefits business and event-based businesses, as well as our traditional partners. Revenue was negatively impacted in the last couple of weeks of March by declines at some partners, particularly in the lead gen space, and we expect COVID-19 impacts at our partners to affect our second quarter partner revenue. John will discuss this in a few minutes, when he discusses April trends. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1% decreased 80 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by mix shifts and increased COVID-19 consumer call center support costs in late March. We also increased marketing spend in the US and Canada in the quarter. With the substantial weakening in several of our business units and verticals that began in the second half of March from the coronavirus pandemic, we took actions to tight cost - to tighten controls all over our cost and to dramatically reduce travel. We\u2019ve frozen hiring except for roles directly related to consumer support. The EFX2020 technology and data transformation or new products will also continue at current levels, and we\u2019ve also reduced discretionary spending across the company. At this stage, we\u2019re looking at $90 million of discretionary cost takeout versus our business plan for 2020 and, if necessary, we\u2019re prepared to take additional cost actions as required. That said, we will take actions to protect our franchise during this economic event. As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing our cloud technology and data transformation investment spending at planned levels and our new product growth initiatives, because of the significant strategic and operational value from both initiatives. These strategic priorities will benefit Equifax during the COVID economic impacts and power us into recovery. Shifting now to trends we are seeing post the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Starting in mid-March, Equifax began seeing revenue impacts in several of our business units and verticals from the broad lockdown actions taken globally to slow the spread of COVID-19. To help as you form your view on the potential impact of this pandemic, we wanted to provide you with a couple of things. First, our perspective on which portions of our businesses are recession-resilient today. Second, our performance during the global financial crisis and a comparison of our business mix in 2009 compared to today or 2020. And then last, John will cover current revenue trends we\u2019re seeing in our daily transactions in over the past few weeks. To estimate the impact the recession could have on Equifax or will have on Equifax, we assigned our line of businesses into three categories. First, recession-resistant. These businesses have drivers that are not directly aligned with economic activity in the recession and we expect them to grow through COVID-19. The best examples of these businesses are Workforce Solutions, our US mortgage business and our government lines of businesses that we expect will continue to grow from the uniqueness of the data, including TWN or from the low interest rate environments, including mortgage. Second, countercyclical businesses and these are businesses that perform better during the recession, and the best example is our Unemployment Claims Management business and Workforce Solutions, where we expect significant growth in Workforce Solutions revenue from growing unemployment claims in the United States. And third, our recession-impacted businesses. These are businesses that are directly impacted by economic activity in contraction and recession and include auto, cards and P loans, where both consumer activity declines or lender activity is contracted for risk containment reasons. We expect these business lines to have negative revenue growth in a recession. Today, about 65% of Equifax' US businesses are either recession-resistant or countercyclical and about 55% of our global business is recession-resistant or countercyclical. This compares in the 2009 global financial crisis where only about 40% of our businesses were either recession-resistant or countercyclical compared to the 55% today. This meaningful growth - the meaningful growth in EWS and US mortgage since 2009 positions Equifax well for the COVID-19 recession. As shown on slide seven, during the 2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency you would expect from a data analytics business. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue for the year, with our largest single quarterly decline at 10% in the first quarter of 2009 at the deepest point of the recession. The largest declines in 2009 were in international, with smaller declines in USIS as we benefited from growth in mortgage from low interest rates. Importantly, Workforce Solutions grew throughout the period and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009, both as the work number continued to grow records and contributors during the global financial crisis, which drove verification hit rates and we saw strong unemployment insurance claims revenue growth from growing unemployment levels in the US in 2009, and we expect a similar pattern in 2020. Shifting now to slide eight. Equifax business mix is better positioned for an economic event today than it was during the global financial crisis. Strong Workforce Solutions growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 10% of revenue in 2009 to 27% percent of revenue today. And US mortgage has grown from 12% of Equifax revenue in 2009 to over 20% today. In addition, Workforce Solutions growth in revenue and significant margin expansion has their - increased their percentage of total Equifax EBITDA to 30% today from only 11% in 2008. Over the last 12 years, Workforce Solutions' outsized revenue growth and the expansion of US mortgage, as well as the growth of less cyclical government-related businesses, including the growth of Workforce Analytics has increased Equifax recessions resistancy and countercyclical businesses from 40% of revenue in 2009 to over 15% - over 55% today, which we believe has significantly improved our capability to continue to invest and execute during the COVID-19 economic impacts. Our cloud technology and data transformation execution is well-timed as the benefits begin to roll in during 2020 and accelerate in \u201821 and \u201822. The cloud transformation investments have allowed us to more rapidly access multi-data assets in the new cloud data fabric environment and deliver new products to market with speed to address the new COVID economic challenges for our customers. The cloud transformation will improve our revenue growth, cost structure, margins and cash generation in the future. Clearly, the COVID-19 recession is much different than 2009 and like anything we\u2019ve ever seen before, but Equifax is a stronger business with the scale of Workforce Solutions and US mortgage and much better positioned to weather the COVID-19 economic impacts with our unique data and technology leadership. Our financial performance and strength allows us to continue to invest in the cloud transformation and new products, which will benefit us in the future. I\u2019ll now turn the discussion over to John, so he can cover recent financial trends we are seeing in the business units, as well as an update on our liquidity, technology cost savings and some other financial items. I\u2019ll come back and review our progress on the cloud, technology and data transformation, new products and our vision for the future of Equifax in \u201821 and \u201822. John?\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. As a reminder, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. First, a few items in 1Q \u201820. In the first quarter, total non-recurring or one-time costs principally related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation were $81 million, a decrease of $16 million compared to the prior year. The cost includes $78 million of technology and security and $3 million for legal fees. In the first quarter, general corporate expense was $134 million. Excluding non-recurring costs, adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $91 million, up $17 million from 1Q \u201819. The increase reflects the higher security technology and equity compensation costs in 2020 as compared to 2019 that we discussed with you in February. For 1Q \u201820, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 25.3% and in line with the rate we guided to in February. Interest expense for the quarter was $31 million, an increase of $4 million from 1Q \u201819 and in line with our expectations due to financing the $341 million of legal settlements payments made during 3Q \u201819. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. As indicated on slide nine, we had almost $1.6 billion in available liquidity at March 31, including $370 million cash and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit NAR facilities of $1.2 billion. We have no debt maturities in 2020. In 2021, we have debt maturities beginning in June and we\u2019ll likely pay the remaining $355 million of our US comprehensive consumer settlement in the first quarter of \u201821. In addition, we recently worked with our credit facility lenders to modify our covenants beginning in 2Q \u201820 through 2021. At March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.7 on the basis of our amended credit agreement, well inside of our new leverage covenant of 4.5 times. This amendment provides us with significant and enhanced financial flexibility to support the continued execution of our Equifax 2020 cloud technology and data transformation and investment in new products and capabilities during this recession. We are watching current trends closely and will continue to manage proactively to protect these critical investments. This also gives us the ability to manage our liquidity and balance sheet. 1Q \u201820 operating cash flow of $31 million was flat with 1Q \u201819. As you know, our cash flow in the first quarter of each year is low as we make bonus payments or annual 401(k) match, dividends and interest payments all in 1Q. We also made legal settlement payments related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident in 1Q \u201820 of $47 million related to the $100 million accrued in 4Q \u201819. Capital expenditures in 1Q \u201820 was $88 million, down $27 million from 2019. We have approximately $400 million of remaining payments on litigation and regulatory outcomes related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. About $53 million will be paid in 2020, predominantly in 2Q. The timing of when the remaining approximately $350 million of the US consumer restitution fund is paid depends on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case, which timing is uncertain at this time. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until early 2021. Details on the status of all outstanding regulatory and legal issues will be provided in our 1Q 2020 Form 10-Q. Turning to slide 10, entitled Cloud Technology and Data Transformation 2020 impacts. As we discussed in our February call, as we put our new cloud-native systems into production, we begin to depreciate these new systems and incur the cloud and other operating costs of running these new cloud-native systems. It will generally - as well as the costs related to our legacy systems. It will generally take 6 to 12 months from the time the cloud-native system is fully in production to transition a legacy exchange or decisioning system to a new cloud-native system. During that time period, in addition to the depreciation on the new cloud-native systems, we incur the cloud and other operating costs of the new system, as well as the operating costs of the legacy systems. As 2020 is a transition year and the decommissioning of legacy systems is not expected to substantially occur until late 4Q \u201820 and 2021, we will incur these additional redundant system transition costs for much of 2020. For 2020, we continue to expect these additional redundant system transition costs to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share, with increased depreciation representing about two thirds of this additional cost and cloud costs, net of any legacy system decommissioning savings, representing approximately one third of this additional cost. At the midpoint of this range, this is a total of about $75 million, with $50 million of increased depreciation and $25 million of incremental cloud and other operating costs. In 1Q \u201820, these additional redundant systems costs were about $15 million or $0.09 per share. As we move into 2021, we expect the savings from the decommissioning of legacy systems to begin to exceed the cloud and other operating costs from our new cloud-native systems, resulting in a net benefit to COGS at some point in the second half of 2021. This net benefit to COGS will continue to grow in 2021 and through 2022, as well as customers migrating to our transform infrastructure and we fully decommission our legacy systems. As we have said, and is shown in slide 11, we expect to generate significant cost savings from our cloud technology and data transformation. A 15% plus savings in the technology cost, excluding depreciation and amortization of our cost of goods sold, excluding onetime items. In 2019, technology costs represent about 45% of total COGS and full run rate savings in COGS from the completion of the technology transformation on a 2019 basis would have been about $90 million. A 25% reduction in our development expense is expected to be generated when we complete the transformation. Again, at 2019 development expense run rate levels, this is a savings of about $35 million per year. At 2019 cost levels, these two items would drive cost savings of up to $125 million and margins to invest in new products and growth, as well as higher EBITDA. And capital spending levels are expected to decrease 35% from the 10.5% of revenue we saw in 2019. We believe our cloud-native infrastructure and dramatically reduced application footprint should allow us to be more capital-efficient than our peers to at or under 7% of revenue. From 2019\u2019s elevated spend levels this is a reduction in capital spending of about $115 million per year, which will enhance our long-term cash flow. In total, that is a pre-tax cash savings of about $240 million per year on a full run rate basis using 2019 spend levels as a proxy, substantially strengthening our financial profile and giving us the capability to further invest in new products and capabilities, while enhancing our margins. In addition to the cost and cash benefits from the cloud transformation, we expect our new single data fabric and cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation and new products that will be accretive to our revenue growth rate. We expect to begin to see net COGS savings during second half of \u201821 and are targeting reaching the full run rate of COGS, development expense and capital savings during \u201822. We will certainly reinvest some of the savings, so we will all not follow the margin. We have come a long way since 2018, and are seeing accelerating progress on our cloud technology and data transformation. We are becoming increasingly confident we will achieve our goals. Now let\u2019s take a few minutes to talk about the trends we were seeing in the markets over the past few weeks. Given the very unique nature of the COVID-19 led recession, the best perspective we can provide on the impact on our business is to share the trends we are seeing so far in the month of April. We are unable to forecast the economic event of COVID-19 in our markets. So we are not providing 2020 - sorry, 2Q \u201820 guidance and are removing our guidance for 2020 until we have more visibility on the economy. Slides 12 through 14 show details of revenue trends on a constant currency basis so far during the month of April and their implications on 2Q \u201820 if they were to continue. As you would expect, we have daily transaction reporting broadly available across our business, which we turn into daily revenue estimates. The trends I am sharing are based on this reporting and our view of these directional trends, which principally covers our online business activities, which is about 80% of revenue in the US with lesser coverage in international. As shown on slide 12, USIS represents about 37% of our revenue in the first quarter, of which about 85% is online between OCIS and Mortgage Solutions. Looking at the trend in April, total USIS online revenue is pointed toward down a little over 10% versus 2019. Online mortgage revenue, the sum of tri-merge and online single file, has continued to show strong year-to-year growth in April, up about 15%. Online non-mortgage revenue over the month of April is currently pointed at a decline of about 30% versus last year. As expected, the greatest declines are occurring in auto, banking and insurance verticals from declines in economic activity, with better performance in telco as we regained the primary position with a major customer. The remaining revenue in USIS is Financial Marketing Services, which is offline batch revenue, which performed relatively well in the first quarter and was down about 4% in March. Our assumption is FMS will be down over 20% in the second quarter of \u201820 as it is a blend of marketing-related activity, which we expect to decline consistent with online non-mortgage, offset by portfolio reviews volume, which we expect to perform much better than marketing as the recession unfolds. We do not have a meaningful daily trend for FMS. Workforce Solutions represented about 31% of Equifax revenue in the first quarter of which over 75% is online for Verification Services. Over the last three weeks, Verification Services has showed high growth, but at a level below the 48% increase we saw in 1Q. Based on the April trends and movement growth rates, Verification Services growth appears to be pointed at about a 25% increase over 2019. Mortgage, which is the largest of the Verification Services verticals has been extremely strong, up over 50% over the past three weeks showing substantial growth versus 2019. Non-mortgage verification services is about half government services related to our contract with the Center for Medicare Services and the provisioning of benefits at the state level, with the remaining being talent management, debt services and banking, principally in auto. Non-mortgage verification services, based on the April trends we have seen is pointed toward a decline of about 15%. Government verification services revenue is performing better than commercial verticals as CMS has reopened for applications and we are seeing more benefits activity at the state level. The non-government verticals, principally debt management, talent management and banking have been down consistent with levels seen at USIS with debt management performing much weaker than expected in a traditional recession as our customer base is weighted towards student loans. In Employer Services, unemployment insurance claims management represents about half of the revenue. We expect meaningful revenue growth in UC in the second quarter as we process about one in six unemployment claim filings in the US. Over the past three weeks, claims filings by EWS have averaged about 600,000 per week versus an average in 2019 of 20,000 per week. We expect our UC business to increase by well over 50% versus the just under $30 million of revenue we saw in 2Q \u201819. Workforce Analytics, our W2 business and our Talent Management businesses are principally subscription-based businesses and make up the bulk of the remainder of Employer Services. These businesses are expected to see low single digit percentage declines year-to-year in the second quarter due to limited new customer acquisition. In total, if people trends hold and as well as these assumptions, we expect Employer Services revenue to be up over 35% in the second quarter. Our US B2B businesses, USIS and EWS make up about 67% of Equifax' revenue. The online portion of these businesses make up 54% of Equifax revenue. And based on April trends, online is trending to be up low single digit percent. Overall, based on April trends and assuming they hold throughout 2Q, our US B2B should be up a little under 5% in 2Q \u201820. Moving to slide 13. International represents about 25% of Equifax' revenue of which under half is online across its four regions. Based on April revenue trends, Asia Pacific is pointed to be down about 20 - between 20% and 25%. This excludes revenue from our recent acquisition of the remainder of our India operations, which will be about $2 million in the second quarter. LATAM's April revenue trends also point to a decline of a little over 20%. In April, Canada is seeing more significant declines, pointing to revenue declines of about 40%. In Europe, we have both the CRA business and the debt management business. The CRA business has seen a weakening trend in April and is pointing to a decline at current trends of about 40%. Although not an online business, our debt management business will be significantly impacted in the second quarter with revenue expected to be down almost 60%, reflecting the UK government's suspension of tax-related debt collection activities during the pandemic. Debt management is about one-third of our European business. On the basis of these metrics, in total, International revenue is pacing down over 30% in April. GCS represents about 10% of Equifax revenue. GCS consumer direct, which represents about 40% of the GCS business, saw very limited impact on revenue in the second half of March. Total subscriptions in the US, Canada and the UK are down slightly versus 1Q \u201820 averages with these trends holding relatively stable. Versus 2Q \u201819, US Consumer Direct is expected to be down, reflecting subscriber declines that occurred in 2019. We are seeing overall declines in partner revenue run rate in the high single digit percent range as our partners businesses are impacted by the pandemic. In total, GCS is seeing revenue declines in the high single digit percent so far in April. Although we are certainly seeing meaningful impact in the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past month, the resiliency of our business model and strength of Workforce Solutions and our US mortgage business, as well as GCS to a degree is mitigating this impact, particularly in the US. Due to the uncertainties and forecasting the depth and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we are not going to provide second quarter guidance and are retracting our full year guidance, as we indicated earlier. We will reinstate guidance when the path of recovery from the COVID-19 recession becomes more clear. However, for perspective on total Equifax 2Q \u20180 performance, as shown on slide 14, we are providing an illustrative second quarter framework to help you think about our performance. To the extent total Equifax revenue continued at the pace I described earlier, based on April trends, 2Q \u201820 revenue would be down about 6.5% to 8.5% on a constant currency basis or $55 million to $75 million versus 2Q \u201819. Based on current FX rates, revenue would be down 8.5% to 10.5% or $75 million to $95 million year-to-year, resulting in 2Q \u201820 revenue of $785 million to $805 million. Adjusted EPS in 2Q \u201820 at these revenue levels could be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88 per share, down 37% to 44% from 2Q \u201819. Slide 19 also provides a walk through explaining the translation versus 2Q \u201819 of the revenue decline to the decline in pretax income and adjusted EPS. Importantly, at these adjusted EPS levels, Equifax will still deliver about $225 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is not guidance. There is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customer\u2019s business activities, any path to opening up the economy and therefore our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability in trends, not a view of potential quarter outcomes. We are offering this framework as you determine your view of the possible impacts to Equifax revenue in 2Q \u201820 and think about your modeling for Equifax. We hope the detail and framework we provided on the impacts we have seen to date are helpful as you estimate Equifax\u2019s second quarter results. Let me turn it back to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. I hope our transparency on recent revenue trends and the framework for the second quarter is helpful. Let me wrap up with a discussion on our future. Our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 cloud technology and data transformation and our continuing investment in new products. Turning first to the cloud transformation. As it has only been two months since we last discussed our progress with you on the technology transformation, my discussion today will be abbreviated, and I\u2019ll return to a full update in July. Our investment in the transformation continues to be a top priority during 2020 as we work towards completing the strategic transformation and delivering the topline revenue, cost and cash benefits that John talked about from the investment. We are not seeing any negative impacts on the cloud transformation progress from the new working environment as our technology team was already well versed in remote working capabilities. We remain on track to complete the initial migrations of several large data exchanges by end of the third quarter, including the work number, NCTUE, US Consumer Risk or Acro, IXI Wealth, US Commercial, auto and property data assets. Our DataX exchange will follow in the fourth quarter as we made the decision to migrate DataX to the new cloud environment after the ACRO database conversion or transformation is completed to allow us to leverage the ACRO Cloud exchange for DataX integration. In addition, initial migration of our eID identity validation systems will be completed in April, with customer migrations expected to be completed over the next three to four months. Our new Luminate cloud identity and fraud suite, which includes a new eID as a service, is being developed as a cloud-native solution and is expected to be available to customers in the US and Canada beginning in the third quarter. Our Ignite analytics and machine learning platform that includes attribute and model management capability, as well as the ability for customers to easily and securely ingest their own data is integrated with InterConnect and is now available for customer migrations at AWS and on track to be available at GCP by the end of the second quarter. We continue to make strong progress globally, rolling out Ignite analytics platform with almost 200 customers now using Ignite Direct and Marketplace and more than 30 customers using our patented explainable machine learning or NDT-based models. We are continuing our progress in the migration of our customers on to our new cloud-based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite API framework. As a reminder, this is a common set of services on which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. As of the end of the first quarter, USIS had migrated over 1,200 US customers and International completed migrations with almost 1,000 customers. This is slightly ahead of the pace we discussed with you back in February. We expect this pace to accelerate significantly through 2020 with over 10,000 US customer migrations expected by year end and the vast majority of US customer migrations completed in early 2021. Customer migrations are an important part of our technology transformation and we continue to work closely with customers to define and execute migration plans and speed their access to the events products and services we can increasingly offer with our new cloud-native services. We are seeing the customer migration work continue at a normal pace in the past five weeks of the COVID-19 environment, which is encouraging. We are focused on the execution and where possible, accelerating our cloud technology and data transformation roadmap in 2020 to ensure we deliver the customer and commercial benefits from the transformation and achieve the revenue cost and cash benefits in \u201821 and \u201822. This is a top priority for Equifax. Turning now to slide 15. New product innovation remains a key component of our EFX 2020 strategy and accelerating new product generation is key to our long-term revenue growth. We have an active pipeline of new products with over 100 launches forecast for 2020, which is up from about 90 in 2019 and 60 in 2018. We\u2019re off to a strong start to the year with 34 new product launches in 2020, which is up 2x from the 14 we delivered in the first quarter last year. Increasingly, our new products are leveraging the broad scope and capabilities of our cloud-native production systems, including a rapid acceleration in time to market. This quarter, Workforce Solutions launched several new products, including an expanded suite of mortgage products that provide access to richer employment and income data to customers, as well as access to pull data throughout the mortgage application life cycle and enhanced talent reports that provide a more complete view of candidate employment, income, education credentials and licenses, as well as identity validation, all critical in the hiring process. In March, as the depth of the COVID-19 pandemic initiated recession became clear, our data and analytics product and commercial teams quickly refocused their activities to work with customers and partners to leverage Equifax' unique and differentiated data assets and capabilities to support all elements of our customers operations in this challenging work environment. Central to that effort is the work number. Our unique and differentiated employment and income data asset becomes increasingly essential in this environment with unprecedented consumer income and employment dynamics from accelerating unemployment, salary reductions and furloughs in the United States. Our teams focused on how to refine existing products, as well as generate new products to utilize these differentiated capabilities to meet these new customer needs. Our data and analytics teams reacted immediately to enhance our credit trends reporting that has long been utilized by our customers to evaluate trends across consumer and commercial lending, as well as the changes in overall consumer and small business credit standing. We immediately moved from a monthly update to weekly reporting service and added more proprietary Equifax data to help customers have more real-time data to make critical decisions. This product is now available on our Ignite marketplace analytics platform. We also customize this capability for specific needs of our customers. This includes making it available over secure Ignite application that includes advanced visualization of analytics across our diverse data assets, including over 11 industry groups, eight different vantage score bands for 11 loan products with three delinquency stages across 55 states and territories, as well as over 350 metropolitan areas in the United States. In the mortgage market, we are working across the industry to utilize our data to meet the requirements for the more current employment and income data and originations using TWN and enhancing off-line analysis using - including the use of income and employment data again to help mitigate portfolio risk and help customers identify consumers that may require specific collections treatment or support. We are in discussions with customers about weekly and monthly versus quarterly or annual, portfolio reviews using our differentiated data given the rapidly changing financial condition of the consumer. We\u2019ve also launched a product we call Response Now [ph] a premium portfolio review solution across auto, credit card, personal loan and other product lines, which incorporates credit trends weekly reporting, economic data, consumer financial behavior and income and employment solutions, allowing customers to proactively manage their risk portfolio and lower credit losses while factoring in current economic - the current economic environment. These models are highly predictive and calibrated to the current economic environment to help lenders identify deteriorating credit risks. We also launched a Capital Markets Economic Suite, a suite of products to provide insight to the credit health of US consumers and small businesses, including delinquency, default and loss severity analytics for mortgage and other products, as well as the loan detail level across ZIP codes, vintages and market segments. Our ability to bring these new capabilities to market so quickly is accelerated by our progress for moving our data assets into a cloud-native data fabric. This is just the beginning of the new product and analytic offerings in front of us from our cloud data and technology investments. We will continue to prioritize and invest in new products, including recession-based product solutions during the second quarter and beyond. We recognize that Equifax - we recognize the important role that Equifax plays in the markets around the world where we do business. During this COVID-19 pandemic, we are working with consumers and other stakeholders in the public and private sectors on creative solutions that ease the burdens on consumers and businesses, while assisting in recovery efforts. In every country where we do business, Equifax is actively engaged with national and local governments to ensure continued credit reporting that captures the status of consumer payments and lender accommodations, while recognizing the intentions of policymakers to minimize negative impacts to consumers credit ratings caused by COVID-19 hardships. In the US, we worked independently and in conjunction with Experian and TransUnion to provide assistance to financial institutions seeking guidance on how to report during this challenging time period. We recognize that many consumers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will experience economic distress, particularly in the short term. Equifax is offering support through our website and other channels to consumers looking to minimize the pandemic\u2019s potential impact on their credit standing. Yesterday, we announced that the three US credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, would be making free weekly credit reports available to all US customers, all US consumers, for one year through April 2021. We are also offering free credit reports to Canadian consumers. We encourage consumers to take advantage of ongoing educational support, regarding how credit reports and scores work. And for small businesses, we are partnering with policymakers and others to support small businesses as they navigate the current environment. I\u2019m proud of the many steps that we\u2019ve taken to support consumers and small businesses and look forward to engaging as a constructive partner to help with additional solutions to help consumers and businesses in the overall economy during this challenging time. Wrapping up, let\u2019s turn to slide 16 on the future of Equifax in 2021 and \u201822. As we battle through the economic impacts of COVID-19, we remain confident that the future of Equifax is strong. Our financial performance allows us to continue on offense and invest in our cloud transformation and new products. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and into \u201821 and \u201822, we are confident in our business model, our investments and our ability to perform in this challenging COVID-19 economic environment. First, we have the right team in place, with seasoned leaders who understand data and analytics and how to operate in a recessionary environment. Second, our unique and differentiated data assets, including consumer credit, employment and income, utilities and property data assets, along with unique commercial credit data assets, position us to deliver the products and analytics our customers will demand as they manage through this unprecedented environment. Third, Workforce Solutions is a powerful business that we expect to grow through the COVID-19 recession and had strong growth potential in the long term. Our very unique TWN income and employment data is even more valuable in this unprecedented economic environment due to the scale, accuracy and latency of the data. EWS will continue to grow and monetize the TWN database and has real scale, with half of the US non-farm payroll in the database today, which drives hit rates and Workforce Solutions revenue. At 105 million records, the TWN database is up more than 2x from 2009, making it even more valuable than the global financial crisis many years ago. We expect TWN record growth to continue and to enhance the value of the database as hit rates continue to increase.  Fourth, the momentum of the US recovery and USIS, International and GCS performance in the second half of \u201819 and the first quarter give us confidence that our businesses are competitive and well down the path of recovery [Technical Difficulty] contracts in our history from the US Social Security Administration that is expected to deliver $40 million to $50 million of revenue per year over five years, starting in 2021. This contract reinforces the unique capabilities of our TWN data assets and will deliver strong growth and margins in the future. Sixth, we are continuing to invest in new products. As you know, NPIs fuel our growth not only in the current year, but in the future. In 2019, we increased our NPI spending and delivered 90 new products. We are continuing to invest in 2020 and expect over 100 new products this year. Our NPI capabilities are being accelerated by our cloud transformation and remain a top priority for 2020 and the future. We will continue to expand our investments in new products and expect the cloud transformation to accelerate our growth from NPIs in the future. And seventh and last, we\u2019re making strong progress on our cloud transformation, and the execution of the cloud investments is a clear priority for our team in 2020. There is no change in our spending or focus on the cloud transformation. We are continuing our investments and expect to make continued progress in 2020 and be substantially complete in the North America transformation in early \u201821 with International to follow. Our new cloud-native data and applications and always-on stability and speed to market and ability to market products around the globe will deliver significant benefits to Equifax that John discussed earlier. They will enhance our competitiveness and drive our market share, new products and accelerate our revenue growth. They will reduce our technology, COGS and development expense by over 15%, delivering $125 million of savings in \u201821 and \u201822. These savings ramp through \u201821 and \u201822 and allow us to reinvest further in new products and growth, while expanding EBITDA margins. And they also reduce our capital spending to below 7% of revenue in the \u201821 and \u201822 period from the 10.5% of revenue we saw in 2019 and during the last couple of years. This is equivalent to about $115 million reduction in capital spending from 2019 levels, which provides additional cash for investments or distribution to shareholders. We believe Equifax is well positioned to weather the economic challenges with strong revenues for growth in \u201821 and \u201822. We are still working towards re-establishing our long-term financial framework and an Investor Day in the second half of 2020. Wrapping up, these are challenging and unprecedented times for everyone. None of us know the depth or duration of this economic event, but Equifax is operating well. We\u2019re prepared for the crisis, and we\u2019re well positioned to weather the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on protecting the health and safety of our team, supporting consumers and delivering for our customers worldwide. We remain confident that the future of Equifax is strong. Our financial performance allows us to continue to invest in our future. Our business model is resilient, and we\u2019ve seen a strong - and we have a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest and accelerate our cloud transformation and new product investments for future growth, cost improvements, margin expansion and cash generation in \u201821 and \u201822. We hope for the continued health of our employees and the consumers, customers, partners, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. And again, we thank the health care professionals, first responders and others on the front line of this pandemic for their bravery and dedication. We will continue to be transparent with you and our investors as the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic fallout unfolds. We plan to reinstate our 2020 guidance as soon as we have more clarity on the economic impact from COVID-19 and the path to recovery. And with that operator, please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Good morning. First, I want to thank you for that slide deck. That disclosure is like industry-best. I want to go back to slide seven, when you really went over the great financial crisis [Technical Difficulty] Mark, you kind of segued to talking about you know, how EWS might do through this crisis. And my feeling is, thinking back to 2009, 2009 is really just two years after TALX [ph] was acquired in 2007. And I remember, it was benefiting - getting a lot of benefit, initial benefit from just being part of the Equifax ecosystem. And now, obviously, a decade later, that\u2019s sort of like a standard. And so I\u2019m thinking, just about Verifier, do you feel like it might just be more subject to end market volatility now than it was in 2009, just because, again, that benefit has been kind of in place for a decade now?\nMark Begor: Yeah, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And you\u2019re right, the Workforce Solutions or TALX was only a couple of years into Equifax at the point and it was a different scale of the business. Their database was a fraction of the size it is today. It\u2019s 2x the scale of it. There is no question that there will be pockets in our perspective. And I think John showed you some of the trends in April, where income employment data is used in personal loans or in auto, subprime auto, where we\u2019re seeing some pressure there or declines in the recent weeks as a result of reductions in originations. There aren\u2019t many people buying cars in the last five weeks for example. But if you look at the broader perspective of the business and where income and employment data is used, we believe that the TWN data or income and employment data is more valuable today in this economic event from COVID-19 than it was in the global financial crisis. In the global financial crisis, you had unemployment levels that were quite high. We\u2019re going to have that again. But you didn\u2019t have the uncertainty around consumers that were on, furlough, that had reduced salaries. You didn\u2019t have the salary reductions that are so widespread today. And you didn\u2019t have the pace of the scale of the unemployment waves going through the economy. And what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is that the value of knowing if someone is working and the value of knowing how much they\u2019re making is more important today in this economic cycle because of the unprecedented impact on consumer\u2019s incomes in the United States is really just changes dramatically. You add to it the scale of the use of the product in mortgage, which is much larger today than it was back then, the system, the system connections that we have. We have a low interest environment today that\u2019s going to drive refis. The purchase volume, we expect to be down during the pandemic, but with low interest rate environments and stimulus will that increase in the future. And then you have the ability of the business to continue to add data records. We\u2019ve really scaled our capability to add records. And as you know, while we have hit rates that vary from 30% to 40%, we have 50%, 60%, 70% situations where we can\u2019t meet a customers request for income and employment data because our database is only 50% of non-farm payroll. So as we grow the database, the revenue in that business just grows from hit rates because of the systems impact there. So that\u2019s a bit of a long-winded discussion that - first off, we think Workforce Solutions has a really strong position in this COVID pandemic environment. And we think it has a lot of levers to continue to strengthen that position going forward. And then last, is that we really believe that if you think about data assets and value in the COVID pandemic versus the global financial crisis or prior recessions, understanding someone\u2019s income and employment is critical. I hope that helps.\nAndrew Steinerman: I agree. Thank you.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate all the - all the detail, guys. Mark, a couple of questions for you, I guess. First, when I think about Verifier, I think you touched on it in response to Andrew\u2019s question. Could you discuss how much of the business is SMB? It seems like much of the disruption we\u2019re seeing is at that level. So I wonder if that - how much in terms of the employer business, how much you wind up capturing based on mix?\nMark Begor: Do you mean on the contributor side or on the verification side, Andrew?\nAndrew Jeffrey: On the contributor side?\nMark Begor: Yeah. Well, there is no question. You look back, I think we shared some stats back, in 2009 we had 30,000 contributors. Those were largely - primarily large businesses. And I think you know we\u2019ve had an intentional strategy of not only adding large businesses over the last decade and last year and current months, but also really getting to small businesses because that\u2019s where a lot of the workforce is. And we ended the quarter I think with 700,000 companies contributing data to us. So we\u2019re clearly getting more small businesses contributing. Where the impact of the pandemic is, it\u2019s really going to be widespread. You think about large companies, whether they\u2019re airlines or hotels or hospitality, restaurants, there is large companies out there that are furloughing lots of their employees, their executive team and very - and salaried employees are taking large salary reductions. So this is a pretty broad-based economic event. And as I discussed with Andrew, what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is that understanding the impact of forbearances and delinquencies is a challenge. And it\u2019s more challenging now than it was in the global financial crisis. But understanding, who's working? How much they're making? Has their salary been reduced? Are they on furlough at 30% reduction? Are they in a salary reduction and down 50%, is really critically important. And the pace of those changes are so rapid, meaning salary reductions happening last week. And if you think about the data assets we have and the industry has, this is the most current data asset in the industry, meaning we\u2019re updated every pay cycle. So we have data every week or two weeks from our contributors, which makes that data incredibly valuable because of its currency. So that\u2019s why that business is doing so well and why we expect it to do well in this economic environment. And we're not going to slow down our strategy around adding new records. As you know, we have a dedicated team, that\u2019s all they do, is work with big companies and payroll processors to increase our data contributors, and that\u2019s clearly a part of our strategy. You saw the growth that we had in the last year, up to 105 million records or 80 million uniques [ph] and that\u2019s going to continue. So that\u2019s another lever for that business in April and May and June and in the second half of 2020 as we continue to add data records going forward. While we\u2019re pleased we have close to half of the non-farm payroll in our database, we don't have the other half. And that\u2019s our opportunity to go work on that, which is a unique lever for growth because, as you know, the business model, the system, the system integrations, when a mortgage originator\u2019s saving our file, if they get a hit rate on our 80 million uniques, then they use that for the income and employment verification. If they don\u2019t, they have to go down another path. So every day that we\u2019re adding new records, that revenue goes up in any economic cycle as they hit our database.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on mortgage, and I know you\u2019re not making any projections. But as you look into the back half, do you think the MBA forecast is the right way to think about your business?\nMark Begor: Yeah. As you know and I\u2019ll let John jump in. We don\u2019t forecast mortgage. It\u2019s not our gig. There is others that do that quite well. We look at all the mortgage forecasts when we\u2019re doing our normal modeling, I think, as you know, and we translate that through in a pretty formulaic way into our typical forecast and guidance. And I think as John pointed out, with where the future is, it\u2019s very hard, I think even for them to forecast what\u2019s going to happen. So we\u2019re not really using that beyond \u2013 we\u2019re really focused on daily trends at this point.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: And as you know, right, between MBA, Fannie and Freddie that their forecasts are extremely divergent right now. So it\u2019s made it more difficult to rely on those. We obviously talk to them a great deal, understanding what their economists think. But as Mark said, given that no one can really forecast the economy right now, we\u2019re heavily focused on trends.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Right.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Well, thank you. Good morning gentlemen. My first question is to your point you just made around the wide impact of the COVID crisis with lower salaries furloughed across the board. I was just curious why you bucketed a mortgage as a recession resilient bucket. I mean, I understand the trends early on with the rate of the refis. But I\u2019m just curious how you think about how that will perform resilient and maybe compared to \u201808 or \u201809 when the new lines of between purchase in site probably?\nMark Begor: Okay. I think - Manav, thanks for the question. I think we and I don\u2019t think there is any company out there that can forecast where this is going to go. How long are these lockdowns going to last? When are these going to be relaxing with economic activity? Consumers are stuck in their homes, how can they buy a car? Or how can they do a lot of financial activity? And that\u2019s why we don't see a way to forecast 2020 versus 2009. We tried to point out some of the very powerful differences in Equifax versus the global financial crisis, which we think serves us well as we enter this COVID crisis. But we don\u2019t know what the next stimulus package is going to be. We don\u2019t know what's going to happen when the payroll protection program ends in September. Is there going to be another wave of layoffs? Likely, you would think. It\u2019s hard to tell. Are people going to start flying again and going to hotels? Are they going to go to restaurants? Those things, there\u2019s so many uncertainties. So what we focused on was try to be really transparent with you, try to help you understand the significant changes in Equifax versus 2009 with Workforce Solutions up to 37% of our business and a sizable part of our EBITDA. US mortgage which we expect to continue to grow through this pandemic because of low interest rates and refis driving that and the cost actions that we\u2019ve taken. We\u2019ve tried to give you the best framework we can. And as soon as we have some visibility around where we think 2020 or 2021 is going, we\u2019ll certainly provide it. But we think we\u2019re better positioned today than we certainly were in 2009 because of the mix of our businesses.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just to clarify on the Employer Services business and the business tied to unemployment premiums. John, I think you mentioned you guys do 1 in 6 claims. So I was just curious, is the revenue model just simply you get paid for each claim? Or is there some other nuance? I think there's just some confusion around that?\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So the way the business model works is it\u2019s a subscription business in effect, where when people sign up for a subscription, they get a certain number of claims as part of the subscription. And then as they run through the subscription, they pay overages. So what\u2019s occurring, right, is obviously is no one anticipated this level of claims. So customers are running through their annual subscription. And then when they run through that they start to pay overages. And the reason you\u2019re seeing the revenue start to grow. But it\u2019s at a - it isn\u2019t consistent necessarily with movements in unemployment, it\u2019s because of the fact that the - that as employers run through their subscription level, then they start paying for overages based on when their subscription effectively started. So that\u2019s what you're seeing, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the growth rates that we\u2019re talking about.\nMark Begor: And those, John, are happening as we speak, meaning, just with the massive spike in unemployment claims coming in and off, we\u2019re certainly in revenue mode with those subscription agreements that we have.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to George Mihalos with Cowen.\nMark Begor: Good morning, George.\nGeorge Mihalos: Good morning, John. Let me add my thanks for the presentation you put out this morning. I guess where I\u2019d like to start is, if we look at slide number 12, where you\u2019re talking about the 2020 April revenue trend. Like for the US business, USIS and EWS, can you maybe give us a sense of how those trends have trended throughout the month of April? Were they dramatically different last week versus, say, the first week of the month?\nMark Begor: John, maybe I\u2019ll start a little bit and then maybe you can jump in. There was a difference between the last two weeks of March and as we got into April, for sure. And if you remember, the last two weeks in March, all of us were schooling up our BCP plans, going to work from home, and there just was, I think, a different level of activity with our customers and with consumers. As we got into April, if you want to call the work from home, shelter in place mode being some level of normal. It was more normal in April. But John, I don\u2019t think there was much difference outside of like unemployment claims coming in and stuff like that?\nJohn Gamble: I guess, the only thing I would add to that is it has been relatively variable, right? So we look at the trends daily. And you will see meaningful changes in any given day in the level of revenue when you look year-over-year, right? And that's why we tend to look over the longer periods. But I don't think there were any really distinct trends. Probably if you looked at USIS online mortgage, you\u2019d say it was probably somewhat trending a little bit negative. But quite honestly, we consider that in the chart that we put forward. So - but other than that, the trends, I\u2019d say the trends are a bit variable and that\u2019s quite honestly why we put a range on what we provided on slide 14, not because it\u2019s a guidance range, but because there\u2019s variability in the activity we\u2019re seeing in the month. And the only other place we\u2019re probably seeing some trends where we mentioned is seeing a little bit of a trend in the UK, it\u2019s trending negatively. And in some countries, we\u2019re seeing some stability, right? So we started to see stability in let\u2019s say, Australia. So that\u2019s been somewhat of a positive. But overall, the trends are relatively consistent, but they are highly variable in the period, although wobbling around the averages we gave.\nMark Begor: I think what will be interesting is that next couple of weeks, I think as everyone is watching, you\u2019re seeing some markets start to relax the shelter in place. Chile, I think, where we have a business is starting next week. And New Zealand is starting. You see some states in the United States that are talking about relaxing that in the coming weeks. And I think that will be indicative of, you know, as we have this walk back from a shelter in place to having some levels of economic activity of what that does to our current run rates.\nJohn Gamble: The other point to make is we\u2019re clear on, right, is that International, right, the percentage of online business is just lower. So the clarity on the impact of the rates that we\u2019re giving you, the percentages we\u2019re giving you, on the entire business is less. We think what we\u2019ve done is reasonable, but the level of online reporting is just lower.\nGeorge Mihalos: Understood. Understood. I appreciate that color. And then John, just two numbers questions, if I may. Just on slide 11, the $125 million of potential savings which obviously would go into EBITDA once they\u2019re consummated. Is it right to think that from an earnings perspective there will also be additional savings coming through from lower depreciation and amortization? And then, I know you\u2019re not giving guidance on slide 14, but looking at that negative $85 million to $100 million impact, is it reasonable to assume that there will be some offsets from the $90 million of annualized cost-cutting that Mark talked about earlier in the call? Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: Yeah. So just looking at slide 11, right? I mean, what we tried to do was just provide some indicative levels of dollars based on 2019 actual cost levels, since that\u2019s what we \u2013 that\u2019s the only data that we have, that\u2019s a complete year and available. So, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, right? So the COGS savings or ex D&A, and those are things that will ramp in as we start shutting systems down, right? So, as things decommission, principally starting very late this year and then going into 2021 and then 2022, you\u2019ll see those ramp. The development expense, obviously, next year, we stop with Sierra reporting in 2021. So our development expense, you\u2019ll actually see an increase in 2021, not because the spending is higher, the spending will actually be lower. It\u2019s just because in 2020 and 2019, we were showing - we included some of this development spending in Sierra in separate recording, right, which we had separated. So, it wasn't included in our adjusted - in our adjusted EPS. So you\u2019ll see an increase in dev expense, but then as we complete the transformation, you will see the dev expense starts to decline principally as we get into 2022 and to Mark\u2019s comments. Same thing with capital, right? As you complete the US transformation, which Mark talked about completing in 2021, once that\u2019s complete, that\u2019s when you start seeing the capital reduction start to occur. So these things will phase in over time. D&A, D&A, I think we\u2019d indicated was a big step-up this year. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball into 2021. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll see a big reduction in 2021. You could actually see somewhat of an increase based on the spending we\u2019re seeing now. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that. But again, that - we don\u2019t have a crystal ball. That\u2019s a difficult thing at this point to forecast. In terms of near term, if you\u2019re talking about second quarter, getting some benefit from this in the second quarter, now we\u2019ve included everything that we believe that will occur in the second quarter. And it\u2019s the prior slide, which gives a view as to the impact on the transformation in 2020. And there, we\u2019re actually incurring the incremental cost of transformation because we\u2019re seeing the duplicate costs that we\u2019ve talked about in the past and that we\u2019ve shown on slide 10. So, hopefully, that covered your question.\nMark Begor: John, maybe I could just add. I think the group on the call knows that up until today\u2019s call, we\u2019ve kind of talked about percentages that we see from savings from the cloud transformation. But now that we\u2019re at kind of the end of the first quarter and heading towards the last three quarters of the year, we thought it was helpful to put some dollars in of what we expect those benefits to be in \u201821 and \u201822 and going forward.\nGeorge Mihalos: Thank you.\nMark Begor: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. And thanks again for the added disclosure. Mark, you called out a 500 basis point increase year-over-year in the win rate in the first quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit on where you\u2019re seeing the biggest increases in your win rate by business segment? And at this point, do you feel that you\u2019re completely back to where you were pre-breach in terms of win rates in USIS?\nMark Begor: Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. And there\u2019s clearly been momentum. We\u2019ve seen fairly steady, but there\u2019s been some bumpy sequential improvement over the last couple of years post the cyber event in 2017. And as you know, USIS was impacted most significantly. And as we got into the second half of 2019 and the first quarter, you can see the non-mortgage online responding there. The win rates have been pretty broad-based. I think you know we\u2019ve got a really strong commercially oriented leader in Sid Singh that was kind of a year and change into his role. So he\u2019s really taking hold. He\u2019s restructured the commercial organization in the last few months, and that\u2019s bringing some new energy into how they\u2019re focused in the marketplace. The new product rollouts are helpful, growing products last year, gives him more stuff to sell and his team, which I think is quite helpful. So really, there isn\u2019t a segment that stands out. We\u2019re focused on all of them. And I think you know we put a particular focus on fintech because that\u2019s a space where our competitors are much stronger than we are. We\u2019ve spooled up, I think, we\u2019ve gone probably from a year or 18 months ago from a couple of people calling on fintech to close to a dozen today that are in that space. And of course, that has historically been growing pre-COVID much more rapidly than the normal market. So it was a space that we wanted to play in. So no good answer on anything that really stands out except that there\u2019s just been a real focus around driving that. And the second half of your question is, are we back yet? The question, no, of course, USIS, our competitors pre-COVID, and I don\u2019t know what their first quarter numbers look like, but I expect their non-mortgage growth - organic growth would be higher than USIS' in the United States. So that\u2019s a growth rate we're still chasing. We still believe that our team has the potential to get back and be competitive, as exhibited by the win rates that they\u2019re having in the marketplace. And when I think about going into the COVID pandemic and the economic impacts having that momentum from USIS still in recovery mode is positive. The fact that they have had the sequential growth and the performance in the second half of \u201819 and the first quarter performance gives me confidence that they\u2019re going to react and support our customers in the marketplace. And then you couple that with having the - some of the unique data assets we have like TWN that the USIS team can sell in the marketplace, that can bundle with the existing credit file sales or other ways to go to market and bring value to our customers and using our new single data fabric with integrated solutions that combine our USIS data with our TWN data, those are more opportunities for that team to have more wins in the marketplace.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nJohn Gamble: The only thing I\u2019d throw in there is, as you know, and I\u2019m sure every business is dealing with, as we now work through April, May and June, we\u2019re evaluating the funnel very closely given the effects that are happening to our customers around - because of the pandemic, so.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Just I wanted to talk through, I guess, the margin impacts and the cost-cutting a bit more. So what\u2019s all in the $90 million of annualized? Are you reflecting any of the benefit in the Q2 illustrative examples? And is it just like the cost actions? Or does it also include savings from things like variable compensation that might be impacted or like the higher increase? Just what\u2019s all in there? And is it impacting Q2 at all? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yeah. Like most companies, we took actions as soon as we saw the pandemic hit. As I said in my comments, we\u2019ve got a hiring freeze in place at Equifax. But that excludes where we see we need resources for the cloud transformation or for new products. So there\u2019s some benefits from that, that you expect, Jeff, would roll through. There\u2019s the travel benefits. No one\u2019s traveling. We\u2019ll -- I would guess there\u2019ll be no internal travel at Equifax for the rest of the year until there\u2019s some clarity around the vaccine and there\u2019ll be limited commercial travel. So that rolls in there. And then we also are tightening our belt around our other discretionary costs with third parties, advisers, consultants, others that are doing work that are not integral to the cloud transformation or to the - our new product rollouts. Those are areas that we\u2019re trimming back and that - John can answer the question around the framework, and I\u2019ll let John take that.\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So you also specifically mentioned variable compensation. And no, it doesn\u2019t include savings on variable compensation since the first quarter was so strong. Obviously, if that was to occur, that would be in the future. So I think Mark covered it, right? Effectively, what it is, it\u2019s the removal of any growth we had in spending in the plan that we would have shared with you back in February. And then the real reductions come in, in the reductions in discretionary spend, which we have taken some and we\u2019re continuing to work, and we\u2019ll expect to have more progress there, and then also substantial reductions in T&E. And then in terms of our employee expense, effectively, we\u2019re holding everything flat, as Mark said. So no new hiring and we\u2019ll see the benefit of attrition. But that\u2019s what's in the numbers today and that\u2019s what the second quarter reflects. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve done our longer term scenario planning as we plan our business through the end of 2020. Beyond that, there is no incremental benefits to cost savings in the illustrative view that we provided you on slide 14.\nMark Begor: Jeff, maybe I\u2019ll add one more comment. From our perspective, when you think about how we're running the company, I said in my comments quite clearly and hopefully clearly, that we\u2019re going to protect our franchise. We\u2019ve got the financial strength to continue to make strategic investments even in this challenging economic time, and that includes the cloud transformation, which John and I both said, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re spending what we plan to spend in 2020. And frankly, if we could find a way to accelerate the spending to accelerate the savings and benefits, we might do that. And the same with NPI. As you know, last year, we increased our spending in NPI, and that resulted in more new products. If we find opportunities to increase our spending around new products in 2020, we will do that in order to deliver in the near term you know, new products related to the recession impacts, but also for the future of Equifax. And then on the discretionary cost side, these are belt tightenings that are obviously meaningful, but are focused on areas where we won\u2019t, in my words, impact the franchise in the future of Equifax in \u201821 and \u201822.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then I understand the subscription with overages model for the UE claims business. But can you just kind of help me better understand the timing factor? Like when do you recognize revenue relative to when the initial claim is filed?\nMark Begor: Well, if they\u2019re outside of their subscription, pretty quickly. Meaning they\u2019re on the clock. That\u2019s how the economics work.\nJohn Gamble: Yeah. It's just - tactically, it\u2019s when we deliver the service, right? So when this is delivered and the claim would be filed and then the overage has occurred and we can bill for it, then the revenue would be recognized in period.\nMark Begor: But we\u2019re clearly in that mode with a whole bunch of like a lot of the customers in the last couple of weeks.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.\nMark Begor: Hi, Bill.\nBill Warmington: Good morning everyone. So first, just want to say congratulations on the Social Security contract. And I wanted to ask, when in 2021 you start generating revenue? Is that a Jan 1st start?\nMark Begor: Yeah. We don\u2019t have a specific timetable for that. It\u2019s a very significant contract for us, as I mentioned. It\u2019s the largest contract in our history if we look back. It\u2019s one that really represents the power of that income and employment data that we have in EWS. And we wanted to give you some visibility as we were talking about \u201821 and \u201822, and obviously, \u201823 and \u201824, because it\u2019s a five year contract, that contract is going to be rolling in. And as we get closer to either the next few quarters or closer to our \u201821 guidance or the financial framework that we plan to put in place later in the year, we\u2019ll certainly give you more specifics on that.\nBill Warmington: Okay. And then for my follow-up, I was going to ask if you could put some numbers around what you\u2019re seeing in terms of volume originations for credit card, for auto and for insurance. And it would also be helpful in terms of doing our modeling if you could get a sense of what that represents as a percentage of total Equifax revenue?\nMark Begor: Yeah. John, you\u2019re going to have to help me on that one. I don\u2019t know if we have handy that kind of data. I think you probably know that when it comes to cards and P loans, we\u2019re smaller than our competitors in the United States in that space. They\u2019re much larger than we are. And we\u2019ve clearly globally seen the largest impacts in cards, P loans and auto, just because it\u2019s common sense, right? If consumers can\u2019t get out of their homes, they can\u2019t go to a car dealership and buy a car and then they can\u2019t use the financing on it. So there\u2019s clearly been impacts in every market in those spaces. John, would you add to that in any way?\nJohn Gamble: No. I just \u2013 I\u2019d say, I think we gave quite good detail on non-mortgage in total, but, no, we haven\u2019t broken it down for everybody by line of business. So I think that\u2019s a level of granularity we\u2019re going to hold back on. We\u2019re okay where we are.\nMark Begor: I think maybe just - as you might imagine, what we are seeing is that the customers we deal with have pulled back on prescreens or originations. They\u2019re raising risk scores because of the uncertainty around the consumer, which impacts their volume. And as I mentioned in my comments, you may recall that I was running GE Capital\u2019s credit card business, which is now Synchrony, back in 2009 and those are the actions we took. Until you have some clarity around the consumer in those kind of businesses, whether it\u2019s P loan, auto or cards, you\u2019re going to be more conservative on your originations. On the flip side of that is, as I mentioned, which is the beauty of the business that we\u2019re in, is the countercyclical side is in my experience, we spent more money on portfolio management and credit line increase and decrease actions in order to manage the existing book that you have because the consumer is changing so rapidly. And one area we see that we\u2019re seeing some real traction on is increased discussions and activity around our income and employment data from Workforce Solutions in some of those spaces where we historically had less penetration or market share.\nBill Warmington: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. You talked quite a bit about the new product enhancements you\u2019ve rolled out to address the recessionary environment, many of which seem to prioritize more frequent data updates. Do you think demand for this level of frequency could persist coming out of the crisis? And then maybe relatedly are there any other changes to customer behavior that you've seen that you think could have a more lasting impact on the demand side?\nMark Begor: Yeah. I think it\u2019s really tough to predict what's going to happen because we\u2019ve never seen anything like this and there\u2019s so many uncertainties about how is the consumer going to come back? What's the stimulus going to look like? Is there going to be a second wave after the payroll protection plans here in the United States of unemployment action? So you have all those things layered in there which really impact how long this cycle is going to be and how much stimulus is going to be put at it. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen unprecedented amounts that will be helpful. But the depth of this one, when you think about travel and the impacts from unemployment in so many sectors is just massive. Whether it will persist on the frequency post this economic event, hard to predict, I do expect the frequency of refreshing your data, refreshing your portfolio to be much more in this economic event than it was in 2009, just because there\u2019s so many more uncertainties in this environment. The second thing I would say that I mentioned earlier in my comments that I think is going to be uniquely valuable for Equifax is income and employment data, who\u2019 working and who\u2019s not, is going to be - we didn\u2019t have the database and the scale that we had in 2009 [ph]. We do today, but the volatility of people\u2019s salaries and ability to repay their debt is so much different in this economic environment than last one. And then to your point, does that result in work number or our TWN income and employment data becoming more of the workflows going forward? I think it\u2019s really possible. And we\u2019re opportunistically trying to work on that. When you think about mortgage, every mortgage in the United States that\u2019s originated for the most part pulls all three credit files and most - and they all have to really verify income and employment. We\u2019re very integrated in that workflow, but we still have more opportunities for system to system integration. We don\u2019t have - we only have - I say only, we only have half of the non-farm payroll. So there is a 50% of the originations or whatever the percentage is, something like that, that have to be verified in another way. So we\u2019ll be able to grow going in that space. We don't have that same penetration in some of the other sectors. And this could result in an extended period for Workforce Solutions to increase its market share in some of those other spaces like auto, like P loans and like cards, which we\u2019ve been working on pre-pandemic and we\u2019re really spooling up now.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then one quick one. As the Workforce Solutions business mix potentially stabilizes a bit this year with a faster growing Employer Services business, could you refresh us on the margin profile of the Verification Employer Services businesses? Just trying to gain appreciation for how a stronger Employer Services business might impact margin expansion trends over the next handful of quarters? Thanks.\nMark Begor: John, maybe you could take that one.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So we haven't given specific margin differences. What we have said is that Verification Services looks somewhat like the online portions of USIS, somewhat lower, right, because they have some royalty payments that are larger than what USIS might pay and that Employer Services is quite a bit below that, okay? But we haven't actually given a specific breakdown. Although given the detail we gave on split of revenue and then total margin for the BU, I think you can probably get pretty close.\nMark Begor: John, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the incremental margins on this incremental unemployment claim volume is quite high.\nJohn Gamble: It is. It is. Not quite the size of verification, but it\u2019s high. It is relatively high, yeah.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.\nGary Bisbee: Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess, two part question. First, on your Employer services - I'm sorry, Workforce Solutions business, how do we think about the 22 million jobs lost in the last couple of weeks on the record? How does that - you talked about continuing to grow records, but it would take the active records go down as people lose their jobs. How does that flow through to revenue?\nMark Begor: Well, there will clearly be some impact there. We don\u2019 process all unemployment claims. We pick up that data which is valuable on the claims that we do process. So there could be some impact, but I think it\u2019s quite minimal. John?\nJohn Gamble: Yeah. So I mean, effectively, the dynamic that's occurring, right, is that as we get payroll files to the extent that we have a given employer that has done a layoff so that the employment is much lower, which I think is what you\u2019re referring to, then, yes, work number records would decline. What\u2019s been offsetting that, right, I mean, certainly, year-on-year, but also continuing through this quarter - sorry, last quarter in the first quarter is there was a substantial increase in the number of subscribers starting really, as we talked about kind of September through the end of last year and a very large increase in records. So what you\u2019re looking at is very large increases in records year-on-year and absolutely some offset from unemployment increasing once individuals become unemployed. And I think the dynamic that's benefiting us is the year-over-year benefit we have from what I just referenced and then also the continued work that the team is doing to add new contributors at a relatively rapid pace. So as we go through this year, we\u2019ll have to see how those two dynamics play out in terms of our ability to add new contributors and then also the negative effect, which is - which as our contributors have lower employee bases that you see our - that impact the record base. But so far, because of the large additions in new contributors we\u2019ve seen over the past five plus six to seven months that continues to be a net positive. As we go through the year, we\u2019ll keep you up-to-date on what it looks like.\nMark Begor: And maybe, John, just to add to that, as you probably know or you may know, we sell various flavors of our Workforce Solutions TWN data. We sell system to system integration if the consumer\u2019s going through a mortgage process and the originator hits our file, if there\u2019s a consumer in that file, then they pull that record in the - we charge them for it, whether they\u2019re working today or they were working six months ago, nine months ago, 12 months ago, et cetera, dependent upon the product that they pull in. We also \u2013 there\u2019s applications or customer use cases where so-called inactive records, meaning someone was working or on our database a year ago or six months ago or two months ago and is not active today is another revenue source for us that we sell. So there\u2019s multiple ways that we're able to sell the data, including the active records.\nGary Bisbee: Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. We\u2019ve seen a number of reports out there about tighter bank underwriting standards beginning to impact refinancing volumes and potentially consumer lending more broadly. Have you - are you seeing that in the data? Is that incorporated at all in the mortgage strength that\u2019s implied by that April trend data? Thank you.\nMark Begor: I think it\u2019s hard for us to see that in mortgage because that\u2019s - mortgage is fairly strong, both in the credit file in USIS and then with the verification and Workforce Solutions. I think, as John pointed out, in USIS, our non-mortgage volume is, obviously, trends are down versus first quarter and last year. And those are going to reflect things like auto and P loans and credit cards, and it\u2019s going to be a combination. It\u2019s going to be primarily of them reducing originations. Part of it is just from economic activity or foot traffic, meaning with people in shelter in place, you can't buy a car. Or you can, but it\u2019s not as much happening. And then some of it is going to be, as you described of lenders, which some I\u2019ve talked to, and I know that's what I did in 2009, when I was running GE Capital's business, you tighten up originations, so you figure out where that - where the consumer is going to be. So you raise score cut-offs or different ways to make sure you\u2019re protecting your book while you\u2019re still doing some originations. But we\u2019ve clearly seen declines in those markets, not only in the United States but in other markets around the globe.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated.\nBrett Huff: Good morning, and thanks for the exit rate data, guys. I hope you\u2019re all doing well. A couple of questions from me. I\u2019m looking back at my model, and I think you guys bottomed out in the USIS online about minus 13% in one of the quarters in \u201809, if I'm remembering right. And I think you said you\u2019re seeing about minus 30% now. I\u2019m just wondering kind of the compare contrast between those two numbers, if I\u2019ve got those right. What\u2019s different and what\u2019s similar between those two, and why more today?\nMark Begor: Well, there\u2019s nothing similar about 2009. There is but I\u2019m being a little sharp on that. This is so different. In 2009 there wasn\u2019t shelter in place and there wasn\u2019t every retail operation, auto dealers, you name it, shut down for months at a time. That\u2019s dramatically different, just the economic activity. And as I mentioned earlier, as we\u2019re starting to see some relaxation in states like here in Georgia, they\u2019re going to allow restaurants to open in a week or two and things like that. That to me is what is one point that\u2019s just dramatically different and you really can't compare how we performed until we get back to what I would call normal economic activity, meaning consumers are allowed to go to stores and want to go to stores and so on. Even with that, it's my view that this is going to be dramatically different than 2009 from an economic standpoint, just because of how consumers are going to operate. Are they going to go on a plane on vacation? That drives economic activity and credit cards. Are they going to put off buying a new car? The waves of unemployment are very different now than they were in 2009, and we\u2019ve never seen, in our lifetimes, the waves of furloughs or salary reductions. It\u2019s just never been at that scale, which obviously changes how the consumer is operating and can operate. So that\u2019s just dramatically different. Now why we thought it was important to share that with you of what we looked like in 2009 was not about the specific percentages, but really how our - the resiliency of our business is, and we try to give you our view of how we categorize the businesses and a business like Workforce Solutions powered through the 2009 crisis is currently powering through the COVID crisis. We expect that to continue. The same with US mortgage. With low interest rates, us being over-indexed to mortgage in the United States is a good thing. It\u2019s generating margin that we can use to reinvest in the business as that business goes forward. So I think there is more differences in similarities, but the difference is around the scale of our recession-resistant businesses being dramatically larger in this economic event versus 2009, which was the worst we\u2019ve ever seen until now, I think, serves us well as we get deeper into this COVID economic recession.\nBrett Huff: Okay\u2026\nJohn Gamble: Sorry, just for clarity, we said non-mortgage is down 30% online. Total online, we said down just over 10%. I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re comparing the right numbers, that\u2019s all.\nBrett Huff: Got you. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then the second question is, John, you mentioned kind of having the online kind of daily tally, if you will. Do you have any insight into the credit files that are being pulled or the data that\u2019s being used, kind of what use cases are being more or less impacted? And I\u2019m thinking sort of the difference between maybe marketing, credit offers versus originating credit offers versus doing kind of portfolio management type stuff. Any sort of hints in the data on that? Or is that too opaque still?\nJohn Gamble: So for us, most, not all, marketing and portfolio management would be batched. So that would be an FMS. And that\u2019s a place where we would have less visibility now, I think, as you mentioned in the call, because that batch business tends to happen for end of periods and it isn\u2019t really as subject to reliable trends. So we\u2019ve made assumptions about what will happen there, but they are far less based on trends. And they are based on the trends we're seeing in online. Within online, we do know by general industry type. And I think there is some detail within industry type deeper than that. But in terms of a specific use case within a lender, no, not so much, right. So for example, if someone pulls a mortgage file, we\u2019ll certainly know who hold it. But we don\u2019t necessarily know if it's for a refi or not or we don\u2019t - or versus a new purchase or in some cases it\u2019s difficult to tell if it's even for HELOC [ph].\nBrett Huff: Great. Understood. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks.\nOperator: And now I would like to turn the call over to Jeffrey Dodge. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Dodge: Okay. That will conclude our call for today. I appreciate everybody\u2019s time. I know the call went a little bit longer than normal, but again, refer you to the material that is on our website. And with that, operator, we will conclude our call. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.+",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As a reminder, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. First, a few items in 1Q \u201820. In the first quarter, total non-recurring or one-time costs principally related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation were $81 million, a decrease of $16 million compared to the prior year. The cost includes $78 million of technology and security and $3 million for legal fees. In the first quarter, general corporate expense was $134 million. Excluding non-recurring costs, adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $91 million, up $17 million from 1Q \u201819. The increase reflects the higher security technology and equity compensation costs in 2020 as compared to 2019 that we discussed with you in February. For 1Q \u201820, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 25.3% and in line with the rate we guided to in February. Interest expense for the quarter was $31 million, an increase of $4 million from 1Q \u201819 and in line with our expectations due to financing the $341 million of legal settlements payments made during 3Q \u201819. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. As indicated on slide nine, we had almost $1.6 billion in available liquidity at March 31, including $370 million cash and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit NAR facilities of $1.2 billion. We have no debt maturities in 2020. In 2021, we have debt maturities beginning in June and we'll likely pay the remaining $355 million of our US comprehensive consumer settlement in the first quarter of \u201821. In addition, we recently worked with our credit facility lenders to modify our covenants beginning in 2Q \u201820 through 2021. At March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.7 on the basis of our amended credit agreement, well inside of our new leverage covenant of 4.5 times. This amendment provides us with significant and enhanced financial flexibility to support the continued execution of our Equifax 2020 cloud technology and data transformation and investment in new products and capabilities during this recession. We are watching current trends closely and will continue to manage proactively to protect these critical investments. This also gives us the ability to manage our liquidity and balance sheet. 1Q \u201820 operating cash flow of $31 million was flat with 1Q \u201819. As you know, our cash flow in the first quarter of each year is low as we make bonus payments or annual 401(k) match, dividends and interest payments all in 1Q. We also made legal settlement payments related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident in 1Q \u201820 of $47 million related to the $100 million accrued in 4Q \u201819. Capital expenditures in 1Q \u201820 was $88 million, down $27 million from 2019. We have approximately $400 million of remaining payments on litigation and regulatory outcomes related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. About $53 million will be paid in 2020, predominantly in 2Q. The timing of when the remaining approximately $350 million of the US consumer restitution fund is paid depends on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case, which timing is uncertain at this time. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until early 2021. Details on the status of all outstanding regulatory and legal issues will be provided in our 1Q 2020 Form 10-Q. Turning to slide 10, entitled Cloud Technology and Data Transformation 2020 impacts. As we discussed in our February call, as we put our new cloud-native systems into production, we begin to depreciate these new systems and incur the cloud and other operating costs of running these new cloud-native systems. It will generally - as well as the costs related to our legacy systems. It will generally take 6 to 12 months from the time the cloud-native system is fully in production to transition a legacy exchange or decisioning system to a new cloud-native system. During that time period, in addition to the depreciation on the new cloud-native systems, we incur the cloud and other operating costs of the new system, as well as the operating costs of the legacy systems. As 2020 is a transition year and the decommissioning of legacy systems is not expected to substantially occur until late 4Q \u201820 and 2021, we will incur these additional redundant system transition costs for much of 2020. For 2020, we continue to expect these additional redundant system transition costs to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share, with increased depreciation representing about two thirds of this additional cost and cloud costs, net of any legacy system decommissioning savings, representing approximately one third of this additional cost. At the midpoint of this range, this is a total of about $75 million, with $50 million of increased depreciation and $25 million of incremental cloud and other operating costs. In 1Q \u201820, these additional redundant systems costs were about $15 million or $0.09 per share. As we move into 2021, we expect the savings from the decommissioning of legacy systems to begin to exceed the cloud and other operating costs from our new cloud-native systems, resulting in a net benefit to COGS at some point in the second half of 2021. This net benefit to COGS will continue to grow in 2021 and through 2022, as well as customers migrating to our transform infrastructure and we fully decommission our legacy systems. As we have said, and is shown in slide 11, we expect to generate significant cost savings from our cloud technology and data transformation. A 15% plus savings in the technology cost, excluding depreciation and amortization of our cost of goods sold, excluding onetime items. In 2019, technology costs represent about 45% of total COGS and full run rate savings in COGS from the completion of the technology transformation on a 2019 basis would have been about $90 million. A 25% reduction in our development expense is expected to be generated when we complete the transformation. Again, at 2019 development expense run rate levels, this is a savings of about $35 million per year. At 2019 cost levels, these two items would drive cost savings of up to $125 million and margins to invest in new products and growth, as well as higher EBITDA. And capital spending levels are expected to decrease 35% from the 10.5% of revenue we saw in 2019. We believe our cloud-native infrastructure and dramatically reduced application footprint should allow us to be more capital-efficient than our peers to at or under 7% of revenue. From 2019's elevated spend levels this is a reduction in capital spending of about $115 million per year, which will enhance our long-term cash flow. In total, that is a pre-tax cash savings of about $240 million per year on a full run rate basis using 2019 spend levels as a proxy, substantially strengthening our financial profile and giving us the capability to further invest in new products and capabilities, while enhancing our margins. In addition to the cost and cash benefits from the cloud transformation, we expect our new single data fabric and cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation and new products that will be accretive to our revenue growth rate. We expect to begin to see net COGS savings during second half of \u201821 and are targeting reaching the full run rate of COGS, development expense and capital savings during \u201822. We will certainly reinvest some of the savings, so we will all not follow the margin. We have come a long way since 2018, and are seeing accelerating progress on our cloud technology and data transformation. We are becoming increasingly confident we will achieve our goals. Now let's take a few minutes to talk about the trends we were seeing in the markets over the past few weeks. Given the very unique nature of the COVID-19 led recession, the best perspective we can provide on the impact on our business is to share the trends we are seeing so far in the month of April. We are unable to forecast the economic event of COVID-19 in our markets. So we are not providing 2020 - sorry, 2Q \u201820 guidance and are removing our guidance for 2020 until we have more visibility on the economy. Slides 12 through 14 show details of revenue trends on a constant currency basis so far during the month of April and their implications on 2Q \u201820 if they were to continue. As you would expect, we have daily transaction reporting broadly available across our business, which we turn into daily revenue estimates. The trends I am sharing are based on this reporting and our view of these directional trends, which principally covers our online business activities, which is about 80% of revenue in the US with lesser coverage in international. As shown on slide 12, USIS represents about 37% of our revenue in the first quarter, of which about 85% is online between OCIS and Mortgage Solutions. Looking at the trend in April, total USIS online revenue is pointed toward down a little over 10% versus 2019. Online mortgage revenue, the sum of tri-merge and online single file, has continued to show strong year-to-year growth in April, up about 15%. Online non-mortgage revenue over the month of April is currently pointed at a decline of about 30% versus last year. As expected, the greatest declines are occurring in auto, banking and insurance verticals from declines in economic activity, with better performance in telco as we regained the primary position with a major customer. The remaining revenue in USIS is Financial Marketing Services, which is offline batch revenue, which performed relatively well in the first quarter and was down about 4% in March. Our assumption is FMS will be down over 20% in the second quarter of \u201820 as it is a blend of marketing-related activity, which we expect to decline consistent with online non-mortgage, offset by portfolio reviews volume, which we expect to perform much better than marketing as the recession unfolds. We do not have a meaningful daily trend for FMS. Workforce Solutions represented about 31% of Equifax revenue in the first quarter of which over 75% is online for Verification Services. Over the last three weeks, Verification Services has showed high growth, but at a level below the 48% increase we saw in 1Q. Based on the April trends and movement growth rates, Verification Services growth appears to be pointed at about a 25% increase over 2019. Mortgage, which is the largest of the Verification Services verticals has been extremely strong, up over 50% over the past three weeks showing substantial growth versus 2019. Non-mortgage verification services is about half government services related to our contract with the Center for Medicare Services and the provisioning of benefits at the state level, with the remaining being talent management, debt services and banking, principally in auto. Non-mortgage verification services, based on the April trends we have seen is pointed toward a decline of about 15%. Government verification services revenue is performing better than commercial verticals as CMS has reopened for applications and we are seeing more benefits activity at the state level. The non-government verticals, principally debt management, talent management and banking have been down consistent with levels seen at USIS with debt management performing much weaker than expected in a traditional recession as our customer base is weighted towards student loans. In Employer Services, unemployment insurance claims management represents about half of the revenue. We expect meaningful revenue growth in UC in the second quarter as we process about one in six unemployment claim filings in the US. Over the past three weeks, claims filings by EWS have averaged about 600,000 per week versus an average in 2019 of 20,000 per week. We expect our UC business to increase by well over 50% versus the just under $30 million of revenue we saw in 2Q \u201819. Workforce Analytics, our W2 business and our Talent Management businesses are principally subscription-based businesses and make up the bulk of the remainder of Employer Services. These businesses are expected to see low single digit percentage declines year-to-year in the second quarter due to limited new customer acquisition. In total, if people trends hold and as well as these assumptions, we expect Employer Services revenue to be up over 35% in the second quarter. Our US B2B businesses, USIS and EWS make up about 67% of Equifax' revenue. The online portion of these businesses make up 54% of Equifax revenue. And based on April trends, online is trending to be up low single digit percent. Overall, based on April trends and assuming they hold throughout 2Q, our US B2B should be up a little under 5% in 2Q \u201820. Moving to slide 13. International represents about 25% of Equifax' revenue of which under half is online across its four regions. Based on April revenue trends, Asia Pacific is pointed to be down about 20 - between 20% and 25%. This excludes revenue from our recent acquisition of the remainder of our India operations, which will be about $2 million in the second quarter. LATAM's April revenue trends also point to a decline of a little over 20%. In April, Canada is seeing more significant declines, pointing to revenue declines of about 40%. In Europe, we have both the CRA business and the debt management business. The CRA business has seen a weakening trend in April and is pointing to a decline at current trends of about 40%. Although not an online business, our debt management business will be significantly impacted in the second quarter with revenue expected to be down almost 60%, reflecting the UK government's suspension of tax-related debt collection activities during the pandemic. Debt management is about one-third of our European business. On the basis of these metrics, in total, International revenue is pacing down over 30% in April. GCS represents about 10% of Equifax revenue. GCS consumer direct, which represents about 40% of the GCS business, saw very limited impact on revenue in the second half of March. Total subscriptions in the US, Canada and the UK are down slightly versus 1Q \u201820 averages with these trends holding relatively stable. Versus 2Q \u201819, US Consumer Direct is expected to be down, reflecting subscriber declines that occurred in 2019. We are seeing overall declines in partner revenue run rate in the high single digit percent range as our partners businesses are impacted by the pandemic. In total, GCS is seeing revenue declines in the high single digit percent so far in April. Although we are certainly seeing meaningful impact in the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past month, the resiliency of our business model and strength of Workforce Solutions and our US mortgage business, as well as GCS to a degree is mitigating this impact, particularly in the US. Due to the uncertainties and forecasting the depth and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we are not going to provide second quarter guidance and are retracting our full year guidance, as we indicated earlier. We will reinstate guidance when the path of recovery from the COVID-19 recession becomes more clear. However, for perspective on total Equifax 2Q \u20180 performance, as shown on slide 14, we are providing an illustrative second quarter framework to help you think about our performance. To the extent total Equifax revenue continued at the pace I described earlier, based on April trends, 2Q \u201820 revenue would be down about 6.5% to 8.5% on a constant currency basis or $55 million to $75 million versus 2Q \u201819. Based on current FX rates, revenue would be down 8.5% to 10.5% or $75 million to $95 million year-to-year, resulting in 2Q \u201820 revenue of $785 million to $805 million. Adjusted EPS in 2Q \u201820 at these revenue levels could be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88 per share, down 37% to 44% from 2Q \u201819. Slide 19 also provides a walk through explaining the translation versus 2Q \u201819 of the revenue decline to the decline in pretax income and adjusted EPS. Importantly, at these adjusted EPS levels, Equifax will still deliver about $225 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is not guidance. There is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customer's business activities, any path to opening up the economy and therefore our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability in trends, not a view of potential quarter outcomes. We are offering this framework as you determine your view of the possible impacts to Equifax revenue in 2Q \u201820 and think about your modeling for Equifax. We hope the detail and framework we provided on the impacts we have seen to date are helpful as you estimate Equifax's second quarter results. Let me turn it back to Mark. And as you know, right, between MBA, Fannie and Freddie that their forecasts are extremely divergent right now. So it's made it more difficult to rely on those. We obviously talk to them a great deal, understanding what their economists think. But as Mark said, given that no one can really forecast the economy right now, we're heavily focused on trends. Sure. So the way the business model works is it's a subscription business in effect, where when people sign up for a subscription, they get a certain number of claims as part of the subscription. And then as they run through the subscription, they pay overages. So what's occurring, right, is obviously is no one anticipated this level of claims. So customers are running through their annual subscription. And then when they run through that they start to pay overages. And the reason you're seeing the revenue start to grow. But it's at a - it isn't consistent necessarily with movements in unemployment, it's because of the fact that the - that as employers run through their subscription level, then they start paying for overages based on when their subscription effectively started. So that's what you're seeing, and that's why you're seeing the growth rates that we're talking about. I guess, the only thing I would add to that is it has been relatively variable, right? So we look at the trends daily. And you will see meaningful changes in any given day in the level of revenue when you look year-over-year, right? And that's why we tend to look over the longer periods. But I don't think there were any really distinct trends. Probably if you looked at USIS online mortgage, you'd say it was probably somewhat trending a little bit negative. But quite honestly, we consider that in the chart that we put forward. So - but other than that, the trends, I'd say the trends are a bit variable and that's quite honestly why we put a range on what we provided on slide 14, not because it's a guidance range, but because there's variability in the activity we're seeing in the month. And the only other place we're probably seeing some trends where we mentioned is seeing a little bit of a trend in the UK, it's trending negatively. And in some countries, we're seeing some stability, right? So we started to see stability in let's say, Australia. So that's been somewhat of a positive. But overall, the trends are relatively consistent, but they are highly variable in the period, although wobbling around the averages we gave. The other point to make is we're clear on, right, is that International, right, the percentage of online business is just lower. So the clarity on the impact of the rates that we're giving you, the percentages we're giving you, on the entire business is less. We think what we've done is reasonable, but the level of online reporting is just lower. Yeah. So just looking at slide 11, right? I mean, what we tried to do was just provide some indicative levels of dollars based on 2019 actual cost levels, since that's what we \u2013 that's the only data that we have, that's a complete year and available. So, we've talked about this in the past, right? So the COGS savings or ex D&A, and those are things that will ramp in as we start shutting systems down, right? So, as things decommission, principally starting very late this year and then going into 2021 and then 2022, you'll see those ramp. The development expense, obviously, next year, we stop with Sierra reporting in 2021. So our development expense, you'll actually see an increase in 2021, not because the spending is higher, the spending will actually be lower. It's just because in 2020 and 2019, we were showing - we included some of this development spending in Sierra in separate recording, right, which we had separated. So, it wasn't included in our adjusted - in our adjusted EPS. So you'll see an increase in dev expense, but then as we complete the transformation, you will see the dev expense starts to decline principally as we get into 2022 and to Mark's comments. Same thing with capital, right? As you complete the US transformation, which Mark talked about completing in 2021, once that's complete, that's when you start seeing the capital reduction start to occur. So these things will phase in over time. D&A, D&A, I think we'd indicated was a big step-up this year. We don't have a crystal ball into 2021. It's unlikely you'll see a big reduction in 2021. You could actually see somewhat of an increase based on the spending we're seeing now. So I wouldn't expect that. But again, that - we don't have a crystal ball. That's a difficult thing at this point to forecast. In terms of near term, if you're talking about second quarter, getting some benefit from this in the second quarter, now we've included everything that we believe that will occur in the second quarter. And it's the prior slide, which gives a view as to the impact on the transformation in 2020. And there, we're actually incurring the incremental cost of transformation because we're seeing the duplicate costs that we've talked about in the past and that we've shown on slide 10. So, hopefully, that covered your question. The only thing I'd throw in there is, as you know, and I'm sure every business is dealing with, as we now work through April, May and June, we're evaluating the funnel very closely given the effects that are happening to our customers around - because of the pandemic, so. Sure. So you also specifically mentioned variable compensation. And no, it doesn't include savings on variable compensation since the first quarter was so strong. Obviously, if that was to occur, that would be in the future. So I think Mark covered it, right? Effectively, what it is, it's the removal of any growth we had in spending in the plan that we would have shared with you back in February. And then the real reductions come in, in the reductions in discretionary spend, which we have taken some and we're continuing to work, and we'll expect to have more progress there, and then also substantial reductions in T&E. And then in terms of our employee expense, effectively, we're holding everything flat, as Mark said. So no new hiring and we'll see the benefit of attrition. But that's what's in the numbers today and that's what the second quarter reflects. And that's how we've done our longer term scenario planning as we plan our business through the end of 2020. Beyond that, there is no incremental benefits to cost savings in the illustrative view that we provided you on slide 14. Yeah. It's just - tactically, it's when we deliver the service, right? So when this is delivered and the claim would be filed and then the overage has occurred and we can bill for it, then the revenue would be recognized in period. No. I just \u2013 I'd say, I think we gave quite good detail on non-mortgage in total, but, no, we haven't broken it down for everybody by line of business. So I think that's a level of granularity we're going to hold back on. We're okay where we are. Yes. So we haven't given specific margin differences. What we have said is that Verification Services looks somewhat like the online portions of USIS, somewhat lower, right, because they have some royalty payments that are larger than what USIS might pay and that Employer Services is quite a bit below that, okay? But we haven't actually given a specific breakdown. Although given the detail we gave on split of revenue and then total margin for the BU, I think you can probably get pretty close. It is. It is. Not quite the size of verification, but it's high. It is relatively high, yeah. Yeah. So I mean, effectively, the dynamic that's occurring, right, is that as we get payroll files to the extent that we have a given employer that has done a layoff so that the employment is much lower, which I think is what you're referring to, then, yes, work number records would decline. What's been offsetting that, right, I mean, certainly, year-on-year, but also continuing through this quarter - sorry, last quarter in the first quarter is there was a substantial increase in the number of subscribers starting really, as we talked about kind of September through the end of last year and a very large increase in records. So what you're looking at is very large increases in records year-on-year and absolutely some offset from unemployment increasing once individuals become unemployed. And I think the dynamic that's benefiting us is the year-over-year benefit we have from what I just referenced and then also the continued work that the team is doing to add new contributors at a relatively rapid pace. So as we go through this year, we'll have to see how those two dynamics play out in terms of our ability to add new contributors and then also the negative effect, which is - which as our contributors have lower employee bases that you see our - that impact the record base. But so far, because of the large additions in new contributors we've seen over the past five plus six to seven months that continues to be a net positive. As we go through the year, we'll keep you up-to-date on what it looks like. Sorry, just for clarity, we said non-mortgage is down 30% online. Total online, we said down just over 10%. I just wanted to make sure you're comparing the right numbers, that's all. So for us, most, not all, marketing and portfolio management would be batched. So that would be an FMS. And that's a place where we would have less visibility now, I think, as you mentioned in the call, because that batch business tends to happen for end of periods and it isn't really as subject to reliable trends. So we've made assumptions about what will happen there, but they are far less based on trends. And they are based on the trends we're seeing in online. Within online, we do know by general industry type. And I think there is some detail within industry type deeper than that. But in terms of a specific use case within a lender, no, not so much, right. So for example, if someone pulls a mortgage file, we'll certainly know who hold it. But we don't necessarily know if it's for a refi or not or we don't - or versus a new purchase or in some cases it's difficult to tell if it's even for HELOC [ph]. Thanks."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. We are all facing unprecedented times during the COVID global pandemic. I hope you and your families are safe in managing in this unusual environment. We'd like to start by thanking the dedicated and selfless health care professionals, first responders, volunteers and others around the world who are fighting the frontline pandemic. Their dedication and sacrifice is nothing less than heroic. The economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding and will clearly be deeper than anything we've seen in our lifetimes. To help with today's discussion, we posted a first quarter 2020 Investor Relations presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentations. We plan to walk through the presentation on today's call if you want to pull it up. At Equifax, as we execute during this pandemic at our work from home protocol and business continuity plans, we're focused on five critical priorities highlighted on slide four. Number one, the health and safety of our employees and their families, number two, continuing to deliver for our customers with the highest level of service and supporting our customers with new data and analytical services they will need as they respond to the pandemic and economic impacts and their business \u2013 their businesses and priorities change. Number three, supporting consumers as they are challenged by the economic impacts of COVID-19 by providing free credit reports and financial education, number four, executing on our cloud technology, data and security transformation. Our focus and investment in our cloud-native technology data and security transformation are continuing at the same levels we had originally planned for 2020, with a goal of accelerating our cloud-based data and technology capabilities to make them available more rapidly to our customers. Funding and executing of our cloud technology transformation continues to be a priority for Equifax. And number five, continuing on the new product momentum from 2019 with NPIs tailored off Equifax's unique data assets for the recession environment. We started to accelerate new product rollouts in 2019, and that focus is continuing in 2020. Like most companies, we initiated our COVID-19 business continuity plans in mid-March, which included activating our crisis management team reporting directly to me, as well as instituting ongoing interaction with our Board to keep them apprised of our plans. We have over 9,000 employees working from home across our global workforce. Only essential roles in customer support and data center operations continue to work from our facilities. We virtually eliminated travel with limited exceptions for essential customer or regulatory business needs. For our close to 2,000 associates and essential roles that are still working from our facilities, we have implemented social distancing of workspaces, aggressive cleaning and sanitizing and other actions to make sure our sites are as safe as possible. We've been in the work from home mode and no-travel environment for five weeks, actually now going on six weeks, and are operated continuously and effectively for our customers. We believe our team's efficiency and productivity is continuing at levels at or better than pre-crisis. We are seeing tremendous benefits from our move to cloud-native tools that are driving significant collaboration as a part of our cloud technology and data transformation. Our development teams are working almost exclusively on Google Cloud platform and Amazon Cloud services, and their efficiency continues at very high levels. And our movement to cloud-based security tools over the past 30 months has also proven to be highly beneficial in this new work from home environment. I hope this gives you a strong sense that Equifax is executing and delivering well during these challenging times for our customers and consumers, while continuing our cloud and new product investments for the future. I'm also pleased with the team we have in place to manage through these challenging COVID-19 crisis. They are battle-tested with deep domain and experience. My personal experience leading GE Capital's card business during the 2009 global financial crisis gives me a very unique customer lens on the value of data and analytics in a recession environment. Moving now to our results for the first quarter. Let's turn to slide five. We're very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter as both revenue and adjusted EPS significantly exceeded our expectations and our guidance for the quarter. The first quarter delivered our strongest performance since the 2017 cyber event and continued our strong momentum from the second half of 2019, where our organic growth revenue rate jumped to over 9% during the last 6 months of 2019. First quarter revenue of $958 million was up over 15% in constant currency and up 14% on an organic constant currency basis. We had strong revenue growth driven by our US B2B businesses, USIS and EWS that collectively were up a very strong 22% overall with Workforce Solutions up an outstanding 32% and USIS up a very strong 15%. US mortgage market inquiries were at historic high levels given the low interest rate environment with inquiries up almost 42%. International revenue was up 3% in constant currency, and global consumer continued their path back to growth with revenue up over 3% consistent with fourth quarter and their third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. These results were dampened by the COVID-19 lockdown impacts during the last two weeks of March, which reduced first quarter revenue by around $20 million. Adjusted EPS of $1.40 per share was up 16% and well above our expectations and the top end of the guidance we provided in February. As we discussed on prior calls, we incurred redundant systems costs in the quarter, including incremental D&A, cloud and other operating costs of $15 million or about $0.09 a share, which dampened our earnings growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA was up a strong 20% with margins of 32.4% that were up 190 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2019 given our strong revenue growth and the cost actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, with strong margin growth in USIS, EWS and International.  As we discussed on prior calls, we expect our EBITDA to grow more rapidly than EPS in the coming years due to the increased amortization of our incremental cloud transformation investments. FX movements in the quarter were more negative to revenue and adjusted EPS than expected by $13 million and $0.02 per share, respectively. Our constant dollar revenue growth through February of 15% provides a good view of the continued strong progress we are making across all of our businesses and the positive momentum of Equifax over the past three quarters. This performance positions us well to navigate the COVID-19 economic headwinds. I'll shift now to a discussion of the first quarter performance of each of the four business units, as highlighted on slide six. Later in my comments, I will discuss in some detail the impacts we are seeing in April as the coronavirus lockdown impact portions of our business and their implications for our financial performance in the second quarter. USIS revenue of $343 million in the first quarter was up 15% versus the first quarter of 2019 on a reported basis, and 13% on an organic basis. For the quarter, online revenue was up 16%. Online non-mortgage revenue was up 3% in the quarter. And online non-mortgage organic revenue declined 1%, reflecting the decline in March volumes associated with declines in economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, USIS online non-mortgage revenue was up 7% in total and a solid 2.5% on an organic basis. We saw nice growth across auto, direct-to-consumer, banking, insurance, which was partially offset by declines in telco in the first two months of the first quarter. In telco, we won back primary share with a major customer beginning in March, which is a positive going into second quarter. The strengthening of online revenue through February is very positive and another sign of our continued progress in USIS commercially. This positive momentum in the first quarter and second half of 2019 will serve USIS well as we enter the COVID-19 economic environment. Mortgage solutions were up a very strong 33% in the quarter, and lower than mortgage market inquiry growth given the mix shift in the quarter from mortgage solutions to online. Mortgage solutions continue to perform very well in this low interest rate environment. USIS' Financial Marketing Service business revenue was down 2% in the quarter compared to last year. Revenue declines were due to lower-than-expected project revenue in March brought on by the COVID-19 lockdowns. I'm very encouraged by the performance of Sid Singh and his USIS team in the first quarter, both in their strong growth through February, and in the speed at which they are adapting product offerings and their selling efforts in March to meet the substantial change in customer needs from the COVID-19 pandemic. This follows USIS' momentum in the second half of 2019. Later in my comments, I'll discuss the success we are having across Equifax in focusing our efforts with customers on solutions leveraging our unique data assets to help them manage through this new COVID-19 recession environment. US is accelerating commercial activity and new deal pipelines remain strong. During the current market conditions, the number of pipeline opportunities as of the end of March was up 6% compared to December 2019 and up 33% from March 2019. And our win rate in the first quarter was up about 500 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. We are continuing to close new deals with customers in the past few weeks, even with the COVID-19 work environment. And we expect strong mortgage growth in the second quarter in the current low interest rate environment. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 44.7% were up 170 basis points from the first quarter of 2019, driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by increased royalty costs, as well as the increased investments in new product development, data analytics, increased consumer support costs and redundant systems costs. Turning now to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue up a very strong 32% versus the first quarter of 2019. Rudy Ploder and his EWS team delivered the highest growth quarter for EWS since we acquired the business in 2007. And on a run rate basis for the 12 months ended March 31st, EWS crossed the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time in their history, both huge milestones. Verification Services revenue was up an extremely strong 48% compared with the prior year, driven by outstanding revenue growth in verification and mortgage. The strong Verification Services revenue growth also reflects continued year-over-year growth in work number active records, as well as the rollout of new products in mortgage, talent solutions and other verticals and continued expansion of system-to-system integration with customers, which you know is really critical. EWS and Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth was a strong 9% and 15% respectively, compared to last year. Through February, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth was up 18% with strong double-digit growth across key non-mortgage verticals, including government, auto, talent solutions and debt management. Non-mortgage verifier revenue growth for the quarter was up 15%, but down from the 18% run rate we saw in February, reflecting the COVID-19 impact in the latter half of March, principally in auto, debt management and talent solutions. Work number database closed the first quarter with 105 million active records and 80 million active unique individuals, up 18% compared to March 2019. And the database now represents about half of US non-farm payroll. Our contributors are also growing rapidly from just under 30,000 a year ago to over 700,000 companies contributing in the first quarter. Growing TWN [ph] records drive hit rates that translates into revenue almost immediately. We expect to continue TWN contributor and record growth in second quarter in 2020. The work number database is Equifax's most unique and differentiated asset, particularly with the scale and currency of the database that can provide incremental value to our customers in today's challenging times, where there is so much income and employment uncertainty around consumers in the US. Through February, our Employer Services business revenues were flat compared to first quarter 2019. This was slightly better than the performance we saw over much of 2019 and reflected growth in our I-9 and other talent management businesses, offset by declines in unemployment insurance claims management and our Workforce Analytics business. For the quarter, Employer Services revenue was up 2%, with our unemployment insurance claims management business up 8% organically in the quarter due to very substantial - due to a very substantial increase in unemployment claims volume in the second half of March, with daily volumes up six fold during the last two weeks of March or the quarter given the rise in US unemployment filings. We expect continued substantial growth in unemployment claims in the second quarter. John will discuss this in more detail when he covers March and April trends in a few minutes. The strong verifier revenue growth resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5%, an increase of 210 basis points compared to last year due to the strong revenue growth and proactive cost management, which more than offset increased royalty costs and our redundant system costs from the technology transformation. Workforce Solutions is an outstanding business that continues to deliver very strong results even in challenging times. John will discuss later that we expect Workforce Solutions to deliver strong growth again in the second quarter. International revenue of $216 million was up 3% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis. Through February, International constant currency revenue was up a strong 8% with organic revenue growth also up 7.5%. The strong growth through February was a continuation of International's strong second half 2019 momentum. Their commercial momentum in the first quarter positions the International business to operate well in the new COVID-19 environment. Asia Pacific, which is primarily our Australian and New Zealand business and now also includes our India business had first quarter revenue of $70 million, up 3% in constant currency year-over-year. Through February however, Asia Pacific was up a strong 5% in local currency and Australia grew over 4%, both stronger than our expectations. Broad and ID and commercial online were both very strong in Australia, up 20% and 9%, respectively and marketing services continues to decline but at a much slower rate than in 2019. Shifting now to Europe. Our European business with revenue of $66 million was down 1% year-over-year in constant currency, with the credit business and debt management businesses also down 1%. And our credit business is negatively impacted by the decline in the economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of March. Through February in Europe, we showed strong constant currency growth of 8.5%. Our UK and Spain credit businesses grew 7% in total through February. In the UK, we saw growth in our financial services vertical, both direct and through reseller partners. We also saw growth in the gaming vertical and from new products launched in 2019 in open banking and digital marketing. European debt management revenue was up over 10% through February as we saw higher debt placements with the UK government. As John will discuss shortly, we are expecting a significant decline in debt management revenue in the UK in the second quarter as the UK government has suspended tax collection activities during the COVID crisis, as well as declines in our European credit businesses due to customers pausing on collection activities during the early phases of COVID-19. Shifting now to Latin America. Our business in Latin America delivered revenue of $43 million in the first quarter and was up 9% in local currency. However, through February, Latin America was up a strong 15% in local currency, led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Mexico, low-teens growth in Chile and Ecuador and high single growth in Uruguay. Our Latin American businesses are adding new logos and benefiting from the rapid adoption of Ignite and Interconnect in their markets. Canada revenue of $37 million was up 2% in local currency in the first quarter. Unlike most of our international markets, Canada has a mortgage business that benefits like the US from lower interest rates. Revenue growth in our Canadian mortgage business in the first quarter which makes up just over 10% of Canadian revenue were largely offset by declines in our consumer and commercial businesses during the last two weeks of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, Canada was up 5%, driven by consumer credit, specifically mortgage, and our commercial and ID and fraud businesses. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 27.8% were up a strong 250 basis points compared to last year. The strong growth in margins reflects the benefit of revenue growth and the cost actions implemented by the International team in the fourth quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019. Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions, their revenue was up 3% on a reported basis in the quarter and constant currency basis in the quarter. Their third - this was their third consecutive quarter of growth. Global Consumer direct revenue, which represents about 40% of total GCS revenue, was down about 2% year-over-year in the quarter. We saw mid single digit growth across the UK and Canada's combined consumer direct businesses. While the US consumer direct business declined 7% in the first quarter, it continued to improve from the fourth quarter of 2019 and still represents a substantial improvement from the double-digit decline in the US Consumer Direct business we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and since the cyber event in 2017. Sequentially versus fourth quarter, total subscribers are stable to slightly increasing across the US, Canada and UK, which is an encouraging sign as we move into second quarter. Our GCS partner businesses increased 8% in the quarter as a result of growth from our US free model partners, our benefits channel and our breach business, offset by revenue declines with some of our paid model partners. Our partners business was up a solid 9% through February as we saw nice growth in our benefits business and event-based businesses, as well as our traditional partners. Revenue was negatively impacted in the last couple of weeks of March by declines at some partners, particularly in the lead gen space, and we expect COVID-19 impacts at our partners to affect our second quarter partner revenue. John will discuss this in a few minutes, when he discusses April trends. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1% decreased 80 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by mix shifts and increased COVID-19 consumer call center support costs in late March. We also increased marketing spend in the US and Canada in the quarter. With the substantial weakening in several of our business units and verticals that began in the second half of March from the coronavirus pandemic, we took actions to tight cost - to tighten controls all over our cost and to dramatically reduce travel. We've frozen hiring except for roles directly related to consumer support. The EFX2020 technology and data transformation or new products will also continue at current levels, and we've also reduced discretionary spending across the company. At this stage, we're looking at $90 million of discretionary cost takeout versus our business plan for 2020 and, if necessary, we're prepared to take additional cost actions as required. That said, we will take actions to protect our franchise during this economic event. As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing our cloud technology and data transformation investment spending at planned levels and our new product growth initiatives, because of the significant strategic and operational value from both initiatives. These strategic priorities will benefit Equifax during the COVID economic impacts and power us into recovery. Shifting now to trends we are seeing post the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Starting in mid-March, Equifax began seeing revenue impacts in several of our business units and verticals from the broad lockdown actions taken globally to slow the spread of COVID-19. To help as you form your view on the potential impact of this pandemic, we wanted to provide you with a couple of things. First, our perspective on which portions of our businesses are recession-resilient today. Second, our performance during the global financial crisis and a comparison of our business mix in 2009 compared to today or 2020. And then last, John will cover current revenue trends we're seeing in our daily transactions in over the past few weeks. To estimate the impact the recession could have on Equifax or will have on Equifax, we assigned our line of businesses into three categories. First, recession-resistant. These businesses have drivers that are not directly aligned with economic activity in the recession and we expect them to grow through COVID-19. The best examples of these businesses are Workforce Solutions, our US mortgage business and our government lines of businesses that we expect will continue to grow from the uniqueness of the data, including TWN or from the low interest rate environments, including mortgage. Second, countercyclical businesses and these are businesses that perform better during the recession, and the best example is our Unemployment Claims Management business and Workforce Solutions, where we expect significant growth in Workforce Solutions revenue from growing unemployment claims in the United States. And third, our recession-impacted businesses. These are businesses that are directly impacted by economic activity in contraction and recession and include auto, cards and P loans, where both consumer activity declines or lender activity is contracted for risk containment reasons. We expect these business lines to have negative revenue growth in a recession. Today, about 65% of Equifax' US businesses are either recession-resistant or countercyclical and about 55% of our global business is recession-resistant or countercyclical. This compares in the 2009 global financial crisis where only about 40% of our businesses were either recession-resistant or countercyclical compared to the 55% today. This meaningful growth - the meaningful growth in EWS and US mortgage since 2009 positions Equifax well for the COVID-19 recession. As shown on slide seven, during the 2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency you would expect from a data analytics business. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue for the year, with our largest single quarterly decline at 10% in the first quarter of 2009 at the deepest point of the recession. The largest declines in 2009 were in international, with smaller declines in USIS as we benefited from growth in mortgage from low interest rates. Importantly, Workforce Solutions grew throughout the period and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009, both as the work number continued to grow records and contributors during the global financial crisis, which drove verification hit rates and we saw strong unemployment insurance claims revenue growth from growing unemployment levels in the US in 2009, and we expect a similar pattern in 2020. Shifting now to slide eight. Equifax business mix is better positioned for an economic event today than it was during the global financial crisis. Strong Workforce Solutions growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 10% of revenue in 2009 to 27% percent of revenue today. And US mortgage has grown from 12% of Equifax revenue in 2009 to over 20% today. In addition, Workforce Solutions growth in revenue and significant margin expansion has their - increased their percentage of total Equifax EBITDA to 30% today from only 11% in 2008. Over the last 12 years, Workforce Solutions' outsized revenue growth and the expansion of US mortgage, as well as the growth of less cyclical government-related businesses, including the growth of Workforce Analytics has increased Equifax recessions resistancy and countercyclical businesses from 40% of revenue in 2009 to over 15% - over 55% today, which we believe has significantly improved our capability to continue to invest and execute during the COVID-19 economic impacts. Our cloud technology and data transformation execution is well-timed as the benefits begin to roll in during 2020 and accelerate in \u201821 and \u201822. The cloud transformation investments have allowed us to more rapidly access multi-data assets in the new cloud data fabric environment and deliver new products to market with speed to address the new COVID economic challenges for our customers. The cloud transformation will improve our revenue growth, cost structure, margins and cash generation in the future. Clearly, the COVID-19 recession is much different than 2009 and like anything we've ever seen before, but Equifax is a stronger business with the scale of Workforce Solutions and US mortgage and much better positioned to weather the COVID-19 economic impacts with our unique data and technology leadership. Our financial performance and strength allows us to continue to invest in the cloud transformation and new products, which will benefit us in the future. I'll now turn the discussion over to John, so he can cover recent financial trends we are seeing in the business units, as well as an update on our liquidity, technology cost savings and some other financial items. I'll come back and review our progress on the cloud, technology and data transformation, new products and our vision for the future of Equifax in \u201821 and \u201822. John? Thanks, John. I hope our transparency on recent revenue trends and the framework for the second quarter is helpful. Let me wrap up with a discussion on our future. Our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 cloud technology and data transformation and our continuing investment in new products. Turning first to the cloud transformation. As it has only been two months since we last discussed our progress with you on the technology transformation, my discussion today will be abbreviated, and I'll return to a full update in July. Our investment in the transformation continues to be a top priority during 2020 as we work towards completing the strategic transformation and delivering the topline revenue, cost and cash benefits that John talked about from the investment. We are not seeing any negative impacts on the cloud transformation progress from the new working environment as our technology team was already well versed in remote working capabilities. We remain on track to complete the initial migrations of several large data exchanges by end of the third quarter, including the work number, NCTUE, US Consumer Risk or Acro, IXI Wealth, US Commercial, auto and property data assets. Our DataX exchange will follow in the fourth quarter as we made the decision to migrate DataX to the new cloud environment after the ACRO database conversion or transformation is completed to allow us to leverage the ACRO Cloud exchange for DataX integration. In addition, initial migration of our eID identity validation systems will be completed in April, with customer migrations expected to be completed over the next three to four months. Our new Luminate cloud identity and fraud suite, which includes a new eID as a service, is being developed as a cloud-native solution and is expected to be available to customers in the US and Canada beginning in the third quarter. Our Ignite analytics and machine learning platform that includes attribute and model management capability, as well as the ability for customers to easily and securely ingest their own data is integrated with InterConnect and is now available for customer migrations at AWS and on track to be available at GCP by the end of the second quarter. We continue to make strong progress globally, rolling out Ignite analytics platform with almost 200 customers now using Ignite Direct and Marketplace and more than 30 customers using our patented explainable machine learning or NDT-based models. We are continuing our progress in the migration of our customers on to our new cloud-based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite API framework. As a reminder, this is a common set of services on which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. As of the end of the first quarter, USIS had migrated over 1,200 US customers and International completed migrations with almost 1,000 customers. This is slightly ahead of the pace we discussed with you back in February. We expect this pace to accelerate significantly through 2020 with over 10,000 US customer migrations expected by year end and the vast majority of US customer migrations completed in early 2021. Customer migrations are an important part of our technology transformation and we continue to work closely with customers to define and execute migration plans and speed their access to the events products and services we can increasingly offer with our new cloud-native services. We are seeing the customer migration work continue at a normal pace in the past five weeks of the COVID-19 environment, which is encouraging. We are focused on the execution and where possible, accelerating our cloud technology and data transformation roadmap in 2020 to ensure we deliver the customer and commercial benefits from the transformation and achieve the revenue cost and cash benefits in \u201821 and \u201822. This is a top priority for Equifax. Turning now to slide 15. New product innovation remains a key component of our EFX 2020 strategy and accelerating new product generation is key to our long-term revenue growth. We have an active pipeline of new products with over 100 launches forecast for 2020, which is up from about 90 in 2019 and 60 in 2018. We're off to a strong start to the year with 34 new product launches in 2020, which is up 2x from the 14 we delivered in the first quarter last year. Increasingly, our new products are leveraging the broad scope and capabilities of our cloud-native production systems, including a rapid acceleration in time to market. This quarter, Workforce Solutions launched several new products, including an expanded suite of mortgage products that provide access to richer employment and income data to customers, as well as access to pull data throughout the mortgage application life cycle and enhanced talent reports that provide a more complete view of candidate employment, income, education credentials and licenses, as well as identity validation, all critical in the hiring process. In March, as the depth of the COVID-19 pandemic initiated recession became clear, our data and analytics product and commercial teams quickly refocused their activities to work with customers and partners to leverage Equifax' unique and differentiated data assets and capabilities to support all elements of our customers operations in this challenging work environment. Central to that effort is the work number. Our unique and differentiated employment and income data asset becomes increasingly essential in this environment with unprecedented consumer income and employment dynamics from accelerating unemployment, salary reductions and furloughs in the United States. Our teams focused on how to refine existing products, as well as generate new products to utilize these differentiated capabilities to meet these new customer needs. Our data and analytics teams reacted immediately to enhance our credit trends reporting that has long been utilized by our customers to evaluate trends across consumer and commercial lending, as well as the changes in overall consumer and small business credit standing. We immediately moved from a monthly update to weekly reporting service and added more proprietary Equifax data to help customers have more real-time data to make critical decisions. This product is now available on our Ignite marketplace analytics platform. We also customize this capability for specific needs of our customers. This includes making it available over secure Ignite application that includes advanced visualization of analytics across our diverse data assets, including over 11 industry groups, eight different vantage score bands for 11 loan products with three delinquency stages across 55 states and territories, as well as over 350 metropolitan areas in the United States. In the mortgage market, we are working across the industry to utilize our data to meet the requirements for the more current employment and income data and originations using TWN and enhancing off-line analysis using - including the use of income and employment data again to help mitigate portfolio risk and help customers identify consumers that may require specific collections treatment or support. We are in discussions with customers about weekly and monthly versus quarterly or annual, portfolio reviews using our differentiated data given the rapidly changing financial condition of the consumer. We've also launched a product we call Response Now [ph] a premium portfolio review solution across auto, credit card, personal loan and other product lines, which incorporates credit trends weekly reporting, economic data, consumer financial behavior and income and employment solutions, allowing customers to proactively manage their risk portfolio and lower credit losses while factoring in current economic - the current economic environment. These models are highly predictive and calibrated to the current economic environment to help lenders identify deteriorating credit risks. We also launched a Capital Markets Economic Suite, a suite of products to provide insight to the credit health of US consumers and small businesses, including delinquency, default and loss severity analytics for mortgage and other products, as well as the loan detail level across ZIP codes, vintages and market segments. Our ability to bring these new capabilities to market so quickly is accelerated by our progress for moving our data assets into a cloud-native data fabric. This is just the beginning of the new product and analytic offerings in front of us from our cloud data and technology investments. We will continue to prioritize and invest in new products, including recession-based product solutions during the second quarter and beyond. We recognize that Equifax - we recognize the important role that Equifax plays in the markets around the world where we do business. During this COVID-19 pandemic, we are working with consumers and other stakeholders in the public and private sectors on creative solutions that ease the burdens on consumers and businesses, while assisting in recovery efforts. In every country where we do business, Equifax is actively engaged with national and local governments to ensure continued credit reporting that captures the status of consumer payments and lender accommodations, while recognizing the intentions of policymakers to minimize negative impacts to consumers credit ratings caused by COVID-19 hardships. In the US, we worked independently and in conjunction with Experian and TransUnion to provide assistance to financial institutions seeking guidance on how to report during this challenging time period. We recognize that many consumers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will experience economic distress, particularly in the short term. Equifax is offering support through our website and other channels to consumers looking to minimize the pandemic's potential impact on their credit standing. Yesterday, we announced that the three US credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, would be making free weekly credit reports available to all US customers, all US consumers, for one year through April 2021. We are also offering free credit reports to Canadian consumers. We encourage consumers to take advantage of ongoing educational support, regarding how credit reports and scores work. And for small businesses, we are partnering with policymakers and others to support small businesses as they navigate the current environment. I'm proud of the many steps that we've taken to support consumers and small businesses and look forward to engaging as a constructive partner to help with additional solutions to help consumers and businesses in the overall economy during this challenging time. Wrapping up, let's turn to slide 16 on the future of Equifax in 2021 and \u201822. As we battle through the economic impacts of COVID-19, we remain confident that the future of Equifax is strong. Our financial performance allows us to continue on offense and invest in our cloud transformation and new products. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and into \u201821 and \u201822, we are confident in our business model, our investments and our ability to perform in this challenging COVID-19 economic environment. First, we have the right team in place, with seasoned leaders who understand data and analytics and how to operate in a recessionary environment. Second, our unique and differentiated data assets, including consumer credit, employment and income, utilities and property data assets, along with unique commercial credit data assets, position us to deliver the products and analytics our customers will demand as they manage through this unprecedented environment. Third, Workforce Solutions is a powerful business that we expect to grow through the COVID-19 recession and had strong growth potential in the long term. Our very unique TWN income and employment data is even more valuable in this unprecedented economic environment due to the scale, accuracy and latency of the data. EWS will continue to grow and monetize the TWN database and has real scale, with half of the US non-farm payroll in the database today, which drives hit rates and Workforce Solutions revenue. At 105 million records, the TWN database is up more than 2x from 2009, making it even more valuable than the global financial crisis many years ago. We expect TWN record growth to continue and to enhance the value of the database as hit rates continue to increase.  Fourth, the momentum of the US recovery and USIS, International and GCS performance in the second half of \u201819 and the first quarter give us confidence that our businesses are competitive and well down the path of recovery [Technical Difficulty] contracts in our history from the US Social Security Administration that is expected to deliver $40 million to $50 million of revenue per year over five years, starting in 2021. This contract reinforces the unique capabilities of our TWN data assets and will deliver strong growth and margins in the future. Sixth, we are continuing to invest in new products. As you know, NPIs fuel our growth not only in the current year, but in the future. In 2019, we increased our NPI spending and delivered 90 new products. We are continuing to invest in 2020 and expect over 100 new products this year. Our NPI capabilities are being accelerated by our cloud transformation and remain a top priority for 2020 and the future. We will continue to expand our investments in new products and expect the cloud transformation to accelerate our growth from NPIs in the future. And seventh and last, we're making strong progress on our cloud transformation, and the execution of the cloud investments is a clear priority for our team in 2020. There is no change in our spending or focus on the cloud transformation. We are continuing our investments and expect to make continued progress in 2020 and be substantially complete in the North America transformation in early \u201821 with International to follow. Our new cloud-native data and applications and always-on stability and speed to market and ability to market products around the globe will deliver significant benefits to Equifax that John discussed earlier. They will enhance our competitiveness and drive our market share, new products and accelerate our revenue growth. They will reduce our technology, COGS and development expense by over 15%, delivering $125 million of savings in \u201821 and \u201822. These savings ramp through \u201821 and \u201822 and allow us to reinvest further in new products and growth, while expanding EBITDA margins. And they also reduce our capital spending to below 7% of revenue in the \u201821 and \u201822 period from the 10.5% of revenue we saw in 2019 and during the last couple of years. This is equivalent to about $115 million reduction in capital spending from 2019 levels, which provides additional cash for investments or distribution to shareholders. We believe Equifax is well positioned to weather the economic challenges with strong revenues for growth in \u201821 and \u201822. We are still working towards re-establishing our long-term financial framework and an Investor Day in the second half of 2020. Wrapping up, these are challenging and unprecedented times for everyone. None of us know the depth or duration of this economic event, but Equifax is operating well. We're prepared for the crisis, and we're well positioned to weather the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on protecting the health and safety of our team, supporting consumers and delivering for our customers worldwide. We remain confident that the future of Equifax is strong. Our financial performance allows us to continue to invest in our future. Our business model is resilient, and we've seen a strong - and we have a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest and accelerate our cloud transformation and new product investments for future growth, cost improvements, margin expansion and cash generation in \u201821 and \u201822. We hope for the continued health of our employees and the consumers, customers, partners, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. And again, we thank the health care professionals, first responders and others on the front line of this pandemic for their bravery and dedication. We will continue to be transparent with you and our investors as the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic fallout unfolds. We plan to reinstate our 2020 guidance as soon as we have more clarity on the economic impact from COVID-19 and the path to recovery. And with that operator, please open it up for questions. Yeah, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And you're right, the Workforce Solutions or TALX was only a couple of years into Equifax at the point and it was a different scale of the business. Their database was a fraction of the size it is today. It's 2x the scale of it. There is no question that there will be pockets in our perspective. And I think John showed you some of the trends in April, where income employment data is used in personal loans or in auto, subprime auto, where we're seeing some pressure there or declines in the recent weeks as a result of reductions in originations. There aren't many people buying cars in the last five weeks for example. But if you look at the broader perspective of the business and where income and employment data is used, we believe that the TWN data or income and employment data is more valuable today in this economic event from COVID-19 than it was in the global financial crisis. In the global financial crisis, you had unemployment levels that were quite high. We're going to have that again. But you didn't have the uncertainty around consumers that were on, furlough, that had reduced salaries. You didn't have the salary reductions that are so widespread today. And you didn't have the pace of the scale of the unemployment waves going through the economy. And what we're hearing from our customers is that the value of knowing if someone is working and the value of knowing how much they're making is more important today in this economic cycle because of the unprecedented impact on consumer's incomes in the United States is really just changes dramatically. You add to it the scale of the use of the product in mortgage, which is much larger today than it was back then, the system, the system connections that we have. We have a low interest environment today that's going to drive refis. The purchase volume, we expect to be down during the pandemic, but with low interest rate environments and stimulus will that increase in the future. And then you have the ability of the business to continue to add data records. We've really scaled our capability to add records. And as you know, while we have hit rates that vary from 30% to 40%, we have 50%, 60%, 70% situations where we can't meet a customers request for income and employment data because our database is only 50% of non-farm payroll. So as we grow the database, the revenue in that business just grows from hit rates because of the systems impact there. So that's a bit of a long-winded discussion that - first off, we think Workforce Solutions has a really strong position in this COVID pandemic environment. And we think it has a lot of levers to continue to strengthen that position going forward. And then last, is that we really believe that if you think about data assets and value in the COVID pandemic versus the global financial crisis or prior recessions, understanding someone's income and employment is critical. I hope that helps. Thanks, Andrew. Do you mean on the contributor side or on the verification side, Andrew? Yeah. Well, there is no question. You look back, I think we shared some stats back, in 2009 we had 30,000 contributors. Those were largely - primarily large businesses. And I think you know we've had an intentional strategy of not only adding large businesses over the last decade and last year and current months, but also really getting to small businesses because that's where a lot of the workforce is. And we ended the quarter I think with 700,000 companies contributing data to us. So we're clearly getting more small businesses contributing. Where the impact of the pandemic is, it's really going to be widespread. You think about large companies, whether they're airlines or hotels or hospitality, restaurants, there is large companies out there that are furloughing lots of their employees, their executive team and very - and salaried employees are taking large salary reductions. So this is a pretty broad-based economic event. And as I discussed with Andrew, what we're hearing from our customers is that understanding the impact of forbearances and delinquencies is a challenge. And it's more challenging now than it was in the global financial crisis. But understanding, who's working? How much they're making? Has their salary been reduced? Are they on furlough at 30% reduction? Are they in a salary reduction and down 50%, is really critically important. And the pace of those changes are so rapid, meaning salary reductions happening last week. And if you think about the data assets we have and the industry has, this is the most current data asset in the industry, meaning we're updated every pay cycle. So we have data every week or two weeks from our contributors, which makes that data incredibly valuable because of its currency. So that's why that business is doing so well and why we expect it to do well in this economic environment. And we're not going to slow down our strategy around adding new records. As you know, we have a dedicated team, that's all they do, is work with big companies and payroll processors to increase our data contributors, and that's clearly a part of our strategy. You saw the growth that we had in the last year, up to 105 million records or 80 million uniques [ph] and that's going to continue. So that's another lever for that business in April and May and June and in the second half of 2020 as we continue to add data records going forward. While we're pleased we have close to half of the non-farm payroll in our database, we don't have the other half. And that's our opportunity to go work on that, which is a unique lever for growth because, as you know, the business model, the system, the system integrations, when a mortgage originator's saving our file, if they get a hit rate on our 80 million uniques, then they use that for the income and employment verification. If they don't, they have to go down another path. So every day that we're adding new records, that revenue goes up in any economic cycle as they hit our database. Yeah. As you know and I'll let John jump in. We don't forecast mortgage. It's not our gig. There is others that do that quite well. We look at all the mortgage forecasts when we're doing our normal modeling, I think, as you know, and we translate that through in a pretty formulaic way into our typical forecast and guidance. And I think as John pointed out, with where the future is, it's very hard, I think even for them to forecast what's going to happen. So we're not really using that beyond \u2013 we're really focused on daily trends at this point. Okay. I think - Manav, thanks for the question. I think we and I don't think there is any company out there that can forecast where this is going to go. How long are these lockdowns going to last? When are these going to be relaxing with economic activity? Consumers are stuck in their homes, how can they buy a car? Or how can they do a lot of financial activity? And that's why we don't see a way to forecast 2020 versus 2009. We tried to point out some of the very powerful differences in Equifax versus the global financial crisis, which we think serves us well as we enter this COVID crisis. But we don't know what the next stimulus package is going to be. We don't know what's going to happen when the payroll protection program ends in September. Is there going to be another wave of layoffs? Likely, you would think. It's hard to tell. Are people going to start flying again and going to hotels? Are they going to go to restaurants? Those things, there's so many uncertainties. So what we focused on was try to be really transparent with you, try to help you understand the significant changes in Equifax versus 2009 with Workforce Solutions up to 37% of our business and a sizable part of our EBITDA. US mortgage which we expect to continue to grow through this pandemic because of low interest rates and refis driving that and the cost actions that we've taken. We've tried to give you the best framework we can. And as soon as we have some visibility around where we think 2020 or 2021 is going, we'll certainly provide it. But we think we're better positioned today than we certainly were in 2009 because of the mix of our businesses. And those, John, are happening as we speak, meaning, just with the massive spike in unemployment claims coming in and off, we're certainly in revenue mode with those subscription agreements that we have. Good morning, George. John, maybe I'll start a little bit and then maybe you can jump in. There was a difference between the last two weeks of March and as we got into April, for sure. And if you remember, the last two weeks in March, all of us were schooling up our BCP plans, going to work from home, and there just was, I think, a different level of activity with our customers and with consumers. As we got into April, if you want to call the work from home, shelter in place mode being some level of normal. It was more normal in April. But John, I don't think there was much difference outside of like unemployment claims coming in and stuff like that? I think what will be interesting is that next couple of weeks, I think as everyone is watching, you're seeing some markets start to relax the shelter in place. Chile, I think, where we have a business is starting next week. And New Zealand is starting. You see some states in the United States that are talking about relaxing that in the coming weeks. And I think that will be indicative of, you know, as we have this walk back from a shelter in place to having some levels of economic activity of what that does to our current run rates. John, maybe I could just add. I think the group on the call knows that up until today's call, we've kind of talked about percentages that we see from savings from the cloud transformation. But now that we're at kind of the end of the first quarter and heading towards the last three quarters of the year, we thought it was helpful to put some dollars in of what we expect those benefits to be in \u201821 and \u201822 and going forward. Thanks. Yeah. It's a great question. And there's clearly been momentum. We've seen fairly steady, but there's been some bumpy sequential improvement over the last couple of years post the cyber event in 2017. And as you know, USIS was impacted most significantly. And as we got into the second half of 2019 and the first quarter, you can see the non-mortgage online responding there. The win rates have been pretty broad-based. I think you know we've got a really strong commercially oriented leader in Sid Singh that was kind of a year and change into his role. So he's really taking hold. He's restructured the commercial organization in the last few months, and that's bringing some new energy into how they're focused in the marketplace. The new product rollouts are helpful, growing products last year, gives him more stuff to sell and his team, which I think is quite helpful. So really, there isn't a segment that stands out. We're focused on all of them. And I think you know we put a particular focus on fintech because that's a space where our competitors are much stronger than we are. We've spooled up, I think, we've gone probably from a year or 18 months ago from a couple of people calling on fintech to close to a dozen today that are in that space. And of course, that has historically been growing pre-COVID much more rapidly than the normal market. So it was a space that we wanted to play in. So no good answer on anything that really stands out except that there's just been a real focus around driving that. And the second half of your question is, are we back yet? The question, no, of course, USIS, our competitors pre-COVID, and I don't know what their first quarter numbers look like, but I expect their non-mortgage growth - organic growth would be higher than USIS' in the United States. So that's a growth rate we're still chasing. We still believe that our team has the potential to get back and be competitive, as exhibited by the win rates that they're having in the marketplace. And when I think about going into the COVID pandemic and the economic impacts having that momentum from USIS still in recovery mode is positive. The fact that they have had the sequential growth and the performance in the second half of \u201819 and the first quarter performance gives me confidence that they're going to react and support our customers in the marketplace. And then you couple that with having the - some of the unique data assets we have like TWN that the USIS team can sell in the marketplace, that can bundle with the existing credit file sales or other ways to go to market and bring value to our customers and using our new single data fabric with integrated solutions that combine our USIS data with our TWN data, those are more opportunities for that team to have more wins in the marketplace. Yeah. Like most companies, we took actions as soon as we saw the pandemic hit. As I said in my comments, we've got a hiring freeze in place at Equifax. But that excludes where we see we need resources for the cloud transformation or for new products. So there's some benefits from that, that you expect, Jeff, would roll through. There's the travel benefits. No one's traveling. We'll -- I would guess there'll be no internal travel at Equifax for the rest of the year until there's some clarity around the vaccine and there'll be limited commercial travel. So that rolls in there. And then we also are tightening our belt around our other discretionary costs with third parties, advisers, consultants, others that are doing work that are not integral to the cloud transformation or to the - our new product rollouts. Those are areas that we're trimming back and that - John can answer the question around the framework, and I'll let John take that. Jeff, maybe I'll add one more comment. From our perspective, when you think about how we're running the company, I said in my comments quite clearly and hopefully clearly, that we're going to protect our franchise. We've got the financial strength to continue to make strategic investments even in this challenging economic time, and that includes the cloud transformation, which John and I both said, we're \u2013 we're spending what we plan to spend in 2020. And frankly, if we could find a way to accelerate the spending to accelerate the savings and benefits, we might do that. And the same with NPI. As you know, last year, we increased our spending in NPI, and that resulted in more new products. If we find opportunities to increase our spending around new products in 2020, we will do that in order to deliver in the near term you know, new products related to the recession impacts, but also for the future of Equifax. And then on the discretionary cost side, these are belt tightenings that are obviously meaningful, but are focused on areas where we won't, in my words, impact the franchise in the future of Equifax in \u201821 and \u201822. Well, if they're outside of their subscription, pretty quickly. Meaning they're on the clock. That's how the economics work. But we're clearly in that mode with a whole bunch of like a lot of the customers in the last couple of weeks. Thanks, Jeff. Hi, Bill. Yeah. We don't have a specific timetable for that. It's a very significant contract for us, as I mentioned. It's the largest contract in our history if we look back. It's one that really represents the power of that income and employment data that we have in EWS. And we wanted to give you some visibility as we were talking about \u201821 and \u201822, and obviously, \u201823 and \u201824, because it's a five year contract, that contract is going to be rolling in. And as we get closer to either the next few quarters or closer to our \u201821 guidance or the financial framework that we plan to put in place later in the year, we'll certainly give you more specifics on that. Yeah. John, you're going to have to help me on that one. I don't know if we have handy that kind of data. I think you probably know that when it comes to cards and P loans, we're smaller than our competitors in the United States in that space. They're much larger than we are. And we've clearly globally seen the largest impacts in cards, P loans and auto, just because it's common sense, right? If consumers can't get out of their homes, they can't go to a car dealership and buy a car and then they can't use the financing on it. So there's clearly been impacts in every market in those spaces. John, would you add to that in any way? I think maybe just - as you might imagine, what we are seeing is that the customers we deal with have pulled back on prescreens or originations. They're raising risk scores because of the uncertainty around the consumer, which impacts their volume. And as I mentioned in my comments, you may recall that I was running GE Capital's credit card business, which is now Synchrony, back in 2009 and those are the actions we took. Until you have some clarity around the consumer in those kind of businesses, whether it's P loan, auto or cards, you're going to be more conservative on your originations. On the flip side of that is, as I mentioned, which is the beauty of the business that we're in, is the countercyclical side is in my experience, we spent more money on portfolio management and credit line increase and decrease actions in order to manage the existing book that you have because the consumer is changing so rapidly. And one area we see that we're seeing some real traction on is increased discussions and activity around our income and employment data from Workforce Solutions in some of those spaces where we historically had less penetration or market share. Yeah. I think it's really tough to predict what's going to happen because we've never seen anything like this and there's so many uncertainties about how is the consumer going to come back? What's the stimulus going to look like? Is there going to be a second wave after the payroll protection plans here in the United States of unemployment action? So you have all those things layered in there which really impact how long this cycle is going to be and how much stimulus is going to be put at it. Clearly, we've seen unprecedented amounts that will be helpful. But the depth of this one, when you think about travel and the impacts from unemployment in so many sectors is just massive. Whether it will persist on the frequency post this economic event, hard to predict, I do expect the frequency of refreshing your data, refreshing your portfolio to be much more in this economic event than it was in 2009, just because there's so many more uncertainties in this environment. The second thing I would say that I mentioned earlier in my comments that I think is going to be uniquely valuable for Equifax is income and employment data, who' working and who's not, is going to be - we didn't have the database and the scale that we had in 2009 [ph]. We do today, but the volatility of people's salaries and ability to repay their debt is so much different in this economic environment than last one. And then to your point, does that result in work number or our TWN income and employment data becoming more of the workflows going forward? I think it's really possible. And we're opportunistically trying to work on that. When you think about mortgage, every mortgage in the United States that's originated for the most part pulls all three credit files and most - and they all have to really verify income and employment. We're very integrated in that workflow, but we still have more opportunities for system to system integration. We don't have - we only have - I say only, we only have half of the non-farm payroll. So there is a 50% of the originations or whatever the percentage is, something like that, that have to be verified in another way. So we'll be able to grow going in that space. We don't have that same penetration in some of the other sectors. And this could result in an extended period for Workforce Solutions to increase its market share in some of those other spaces like auto, like P loans and like cards, which we've been working on pre-pandemic and we're really spooling up now. John, maybe you could take that one. John, I think it's safe to say that the incremental margins on this incremental unemployment claim volume is quite high. Well, there will clearly be some impact there. We don' process all unemployment claims. We pick up that data which is valuable on the claims that we do process. So there could be some impact, but I think it's quite minimal. John? And maybe, John, just to add to that, as you probably know or you may know, we sell various flavors of our Workforce Solutions TWN data. We sell system to system integration if the consumer's going through a mortgage process and the originator hits our file, if there's a consumer in that file, then they pull that record in the - we charge them for it, whether they're working today or they were working six months ago, nine months ago, 12 months ago, et cetera, dependent upon the product that they pull in. We also \u2013 there's applications or customer use cases where so-called inactive records, meaning someone was working or on our database a year ago or six months ago or two months ago and is not active today is another revenue source for us that we sell. So there's multiple ways that we're able to sell the data, including the active records. I think it's hard for us to see that in mortgage because that's - mortgage is fairly strong, both in the credit file in USIS and then with the verification and Workforce Solutions. I think, as John pointed out, in USIS, our non-mortgage volume is, obviously, trends are down versus first quarter and last year. And those are going to reflect things like auto and P loans and credit cards, and it's going to be a combination. It's going to be primarily of them reducing originations. Part of it is just from economic activity or foot traffic, meaning with people in shelter in place, you can't buy a car. Or you can, but it's not as much happening. And then some of it is going to be, as you described of lenders, which some I've talked to, and I know that's what I did in 2009, when I was running GE Capital's business, you tighten up originations, so you figure out where that - where the consumer is going to be. So you raise score cut-offs or different ways to make sure you're protecting your book while you're still doing some originations. But we've clearly seen declines in those markets, not only in the United States but in other markets around the globe. Well, there's nothing similar about 2009. There is but I'm being a little sharp on that. This is so different. In 2009 there wasn't shelter in place and there wasn't every retail operation, auto dealers, you name it, shut down for months at a time. That's dramatically different, just the economic activity. And as I mentioned earlier, as we're starting to see some relaxation in states like here in Georgia, they're going to allow restaurants to open in a week or two and things like that. That to me is what is one point that's just dramatically different and you really can't compare how we performed until we get back to what I would call normal economic activity, meaning consumers are allowed to go to stores and want to go to stores and so on. Even with that, it's my view that this is going to be dramatically different than 2009 from an economic standpoint, just because of how consumers are going to operate. Are they going to go on a plane on vacation? That drives economic activity and credit cards. Are they going to put off buying a new car? The waves of unemployment are very different now than they were in 2009, and we've never seen, in our lifetimes, the waves of furloughs or salary reductions. It's just never been at that scale, which obviously changes how the consumer is operating and can operate. So that's just dramatically different. Now why we thought it was important to share that with you of what we looked like in 2009 was not about the specific percentages, but really how our - the resiliency of our business is, and we try to give you our view of how we categorize the businesses and a business like Workforce Solutions powered through the 2009 crisis is currently powering through the COVID crisis. We expect that to continue. The same with US mortgage. With low interest rates, us being over-indexed to mortgage in the United States is a good thing. It's generating margin that we can use to reinvest in the business as that business goes forward. So I think there is more differences in similarities, but the difference is around the scale of our recession-resistant businesses being dramatically larger in this economic event versus 2009, which was the worst we've ever seen until now, I think, serves us well as we get deeper into this COVID economic recession."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDorian Hare: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During today's call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. In 4Q 2021, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $8.6 million or $0.05 a share. This charge was for COGS principally incurred to reduce technology development expense as we complete the Equifax data and cloud transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income and adjusted EPS. As we have previously discussed, in July 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the U.S. consumer class action litigation arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident. That settlement agreement has been the subject of numerous court appeals. On January 10, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the last remaining petitions seeking to appeal, and the settlement agreement became effective as of January 11, 2022. In January, we deposited the remaining $345 million into the consumer restitution fund, and the claims administrator will begin to validate consumer claims. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we eliminated \u2013 excuse me, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we eliminated our GCS operational segment and moved its lines of the business into Workforce Solutions, USIS and International in Canada and Europe. As a result, Equifax now has three operating segments. In our remarks today, we will discuss 2021 and fourth quarter results as well as our 2022 guidance focused on this new structure, unless we indicate otherwise. For your reference, we have included in our 4Q 2021 earnings release Q&A reconciliations of our 2020 and 2021 prior business unit operating segment results to this new structure. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. Before I get to our strong fourth quarter results, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the tremendous progress and outstanding results we delivered last year. As shown on Slide 4, our financial performance in 2021 was very strong and built off an equally strong 2020. Revenue was up 19% with organic local currency revenue growth of 15% and core non-market growth of 22%, all well above our new 8% to 12% long-term financial framework, reflecting the strength of the new Equifax growth model. Adjusted EPS at $7.64 was up 10% and adjusted for the change in treatment of transformation expenses in 2021 was up a strong 24%. This is truly an outstanding year, substantially stronger than we expected when we started 2021 and despite a U.S. mortgage market that was down more than we expected at 7.5%. We delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and 2 years of strong above-market performance with 17% growth in 2020 and 19% growth last year. Workforce Solutions delivered a milestone with revenue over $2 billion for the first time, up 39% with organic revenue growth of 34% and the business is up 2x from their 2019 revenue of $915 million. This was again driven by very strong performance in Verification Services with revenue up 46% and organic revenue growth of 41%. Active records on the work number grew by a very strong 22 million records or 19% to 136 million records at the end of the year. Mortgage revenue was up 41%, almost 50 percentage points stronger than the underlying market. And non-mortgage revenue in Verification Services had organic growth of 41% driven by talent solutions with organic growth of over 100%. USIS also had a strong year. Non-mortgage revenue was up 16% with organic growth of 10%. Total revenue was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2% despite the 7.5% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. In total, our U.S. businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 80% of Equifax revenue, delivered 20% total and 17% organic growth with non-mortgage revenue growth of over 21% total and 15% organic, again, all well above our new long-term framework of 8% to 12%. International also delivered a milestone in 2021 with their first year of revenues over $1 billion. Revenue grew 10% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America. In 2021, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 5, grew a very strong 22% with fourth quarter revenue growth also a very strong 18%, both substantially above the new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. Core organic revenue growth in 2021 was 18% and 13% in the fourth quarter, again, above our long-term framework. Non-mortgage organic growth in Workforce Solutions and USIS and growth in International drove almost 9% core organic revenue growth in 2021 and over 8% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX. Mortgage outperformance, primarily in EWS, drove the remaining 9% in 2021 and 5% in fourth quarter, respectively, of core organic revenue growth. As we move through 2022 and 2023, we expect to see continued strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the \u2013 from the strength of Workforce Solutions, the new Equifax Cloud and accelerated NPIs. And we expect continued strong non-mortgage performance from both organic growth and acquisitions as well as continued strong mortgage outperformance from Workforce Solutions. Slide 6 covers our strong fourth quarter performance. Revenue at $1.25 billion was up 12% with organic constant currency growth of 6.6% despite a decline in the U.S. mortgage market of 21%, which was off a strong 23% growth a year ago in the fourth quarter. As I discussed earlier, core revenue growth was a very strong 18% in the quarter with core organic growth of 13% again driven by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions. Fourth quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $403 million, slightly higher than expected. EBITDA margins of 32.2% were consistent with our expectations. The decline in margins versus last year was primarily due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $47 million in our adjusted results in the fourth quarter, which were excluded last year. Adjusting for these costs, our margins were 35.9%. John will provide more \u2013 a more detailed discussion on our 2022 margins in a few minutes and the drivers of our up to 200 basis point margin expansion in 2022 that we're targeting. Adjusted EPS of $1.84 per share was above the high-end of our guidance range. As expected, adjusted EPS was down from last year and reflected the inclusion of cloud transformation costs of $47 million or $0.30 a share in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year. Excluding these costs, adjusted EPS would have been up 7.1%, about consistent with our organic revenue growth. The acquisitions completed in 2021 were slightly accretive to adjusted EPS. And we expect substantial acceleration and accretion in 2022 and 2023 from the acquisitions as we complete the integrations. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $532 million with reported revenue growth of 29% and organic revenue growth of 17%. And this, of course, was delivered despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market in the fourth quarter and against very strong 61% revenue growth that they delivered last year in the fourth quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up almost 50% with organic non-mortgage revenue up about 25%. Included in Workforce Solutions fourth quarter results is about $7 million from ID Watchdog, which was previously a part of GCS and is now part of Employer Services business in EWS. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their twin income and employment data was clear again in the fourth quarter. EWS is clearly our fastest-growing business and powering our results. Verification Services revenue in the quarter was $427 million, up 29%, with organic growth of almost 17%. The revenue from our Appriss Insights acquisition is included in Verification Services. Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 6% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market with the Workforce Solutions outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products. Verification Services nonmortgage revenue represented just over half of total Verification Services revenue in the quarter. Total Verifier non-mortgage revenue was up almost 65%, reflecting strong 30% organic revenue growth plus the addition of Appriss Insights in October. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth of 30% was very strong, particularly over last year's fourth quarter, which was up 15%. Our government vertical with the addition of Appriss Insights provides a broad set of solutions to federal, state and local governments. These include solutions in support of government assistance programs, including food and rental support as well as the VINE victims notification service and other law enforcement solutions acquired as a part of Appriss Insights. The government vertical represented about 40% of total non-mortgage verification revenue in the quarter and delivered 25% total and over 15% organic revenue growth. Organic growth was driven by the continued growth in the work number and the continued expansion of state benefit programs. We also continue to see a ramp in volume from our new Social Security Administration contract that went live last quarter. And we expect to see significant growth in volume as we move towards run rate levels through 2022. Talent solutions, which provides income, employment, educational background and medical certification verifications, incarceration, criminal background, medical sanctions and other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS Data Hub, had another outstanding quarter. The addition of Appriss Insights in October, educational information from the National Student Clearinghouse in August and significant growth in the work number during the quarter, substantially expanded the EWS Data Hub, supporting continued customer expansion and new products. Total talent solutions revenue represented about 40% of Verifier nonmortgage revenue in the quarter with total growth of almost 100% and organic growth of 50%. As you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of that hiring process. We've seen both the number and the frequency of job changes increasing in the current environment. Our ongoing addition of new data assets to the EWS Data Hub will enhance new product growth in this important vertical in the future. The nonmortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well, up over 50% in the quarter. Debt management with nonmortgage consumer lending grew over 30% in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was up 28% in the quarter. And as you know, this is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers new twin records. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $54 million, up slightly from last year but down over 15% sequentially as we expected. Substantial declines in UC revenue in the quarter were offset by growth in ERC revenue, which, as a reminder, is our business that supports employers obtaining federal employee retention credits. Employer Services non-UC and non-ERC businesses had revenue of about $50 million, up 60% versus last year with organic revenue growth of about 35%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere solution, continued to show very strong growth, up over 50%. In the fourth quarter, our I-9 business made up about 40% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. In August, we acquired Health e(fx), which provides services to employers to help them ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act, which we are now combining with our existing workforce analytics business. This combined workforce analytics business represented about 25% of employer non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6% for 2021 and have been consistently in the mid-50s over the past two years. As John will discuss later, we expect Workforce Solutions margins to be at or above the 54.6% delivered in 2021 in both the first quarter and in 2022. As we expected, fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA margins in Workforce were 48.4% and were lower than our historic levels due to three factors. First, Appriss Insights and Health e(fx) negatively impacted margins. As expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. Second, in the fourth quarter, EWS ramped one major and several smaller payroll processor record contributions to our Verifier database as well as integrated other data contributors to the data hub. As we discussed in the past, in the quarters where this occurs, we incur incremental costs related to boarding and ramping the new contributors. And as we've indicated, fourth quarter saw substantial new record additions, and these in-period costs impacted margins in the quarter. And third, our cloud transformation cost negatively impacted margins by about 200 basis points. Workforce substantially completed the Verifier cloud-native migration in the fourth quarter, so these costs will decline substantially going forward. We remain confident that Workforce Solutions margins will recover in 2022 and be above the 54.6% we saw in 2021. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding year and are well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue their above-market growth. EWS is our fastest-growing and highest-margin business. USIS had revenue of $434 million, which was about flat with the fourth quarter with the mortgage market down significantly and it includes $47 million of USIS consumer revenue previously part of GCS, which was just about flat. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $126 million was down 18% in the quarter, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, about consistent with the expectations we shared in October. Outperformance versus the overall market was driven by stronger growth in mortgage solutions, including growth in services. Non-mortgage non-consumer solutions revenue of $262 million grew almost 12% with organic revenue growth of almost 6%. In the fourth quarter, insurance continued to deliver double-digit growth. Commercial, and identity and fraud were up single digits and FI, auto and telco were up low to mid-single digits. And direct-to-consumer increased over 10% in the quarter. For the full year, non-mortgage non-consumer solutions revenue was up a strong 16% with organic growth in this category of about 10%. For 2021, USIS delivered double-digit organic growth across FI, insurance, identity and fraud and D2C as well as mid- to high single-digit growth in commercial and auto and telco declined slightly. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line and batch business, had revenue of about $79 million, our highest quarterly revenue in history. This was up about 14% in the quarter. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20%. Both risk and ID, and fraud revenue were up about 10%. In 2021, marketing-related revenue, which grew more than 20% in each quarter, represented about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20 and risk decisioning above 30. The USIS commercial team delivered record wins, up over 25% versus last year and 5% sequentially in the fourth quarter. Their new deal pipeline remains very strong with overall pipe slightly higher than the third quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.4% in the quarter, up over 50 basis points sequentially from third quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter in 2020 was principally driven by twofactors. First, the acquisitions of Kount and Teletrack negatively impacted margins in the period. As expected, initial margins for these acquisitions are dilutive to USIS. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. And second, cloud transformation costs negatively impacted margins by almost 75 basis points. As with EWS, these costs are expected to decline as we move through 2022. In 2022, we expect USIS margins to be flat to slightly below the almost 40% level we delivered in 2021. International revenue of $288 million was up 6% and over 7.5% sequentially on a local currency basis. Included in International in the fourth quarter was almost $25 million of consumer solutions revenue in Canada and the UK that was formerly part of GCS, which was down about 6% versus last year. The lower growth in the consumer revenue in the fourth quarter was in Europe, which we expect to recover to high single-digit growth in the first quarter. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed very well in the quarter with revenue of $88 million, up about 9% in local currency. Australia and New Zealand consumer revenue remained flat versus last year. Our ANZ commercial business combined online and off-line revenue was up 9% in the quarter. And our HR verifications business in Australia was up a strong 37%. European revenues of $90 million were about flat in local currency in the quarter, but up over 20% sequentially. As a reminder, Europe had a very strong baseline from the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by the reactivation of debt services in the UK and large electronic notifications volume in Spain, a consequence of a change in legislation. Our European credit reporting business, which is about two thirds of European revenue, was impacted by COVID lockdowns in the UK and up about 2%. Commercial data off-line and analytics and scores saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And consumer credit reporting offerings grew high single digit as lockdown measures eased. Included in the UK credit reporting business was $7 million from consumer solutions. Our European debt management business revenue was up over 30% sequentially but down 5% versus a very strong fourth quarter 2020. In December, Equifax was awarded a new five-year extension of the UK government debt resolutions tender, a debt collections contract with an estimated contract value of $136 million with an incremental $90 million upside from sales of analytics and other CRA-related solutions. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the UK government over the past several quarters that we expect should deliver strong growth in debt management revenue in the first half of 2022 for our UK business. Canada delivered revenue of $64 million in the quarter, up 6% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 4%. Canada experienced strong growth in analytics and decisioning solutions with strong growth in fintech and traditional FI, while supply issues continue to impact their auto business. Included in Canada revenue is $16 million of consumer solutions revenue. Latin American revenues of $45 million were up a strong 15% in the quarter in local currency, which was their fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Strong new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across our Latin American region. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 29.9% were up 320 basis points sequentially mainly due to stronger revenue and positive mix. Margins were down year-to-year due to costs related to the cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and the inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs, which were being excluded in 2020. Excluding these costs, margins were down slightly versus last year. Turning to Slide 7, Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding performance and is clearly our strongest and fastest-growing and most valuable business. As mentioned earlier, core revenue growth was up 38% in the quarter and 42% for the year with core organic revenue growth of 28% in the quarter and 38% for the full year of 2021. These strong results were driven by the uniqueness of our TWN income and employment data, the scale of the TWN database and continued expansion of new products and markets driven by outstanding consistent execution by Rudy and his team. 2021 growth of 39% is well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework, which we shared with you in November and of course, is on top of 51% delivered \u2013 growth delivered in 2020. EWS' ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by three factors. First, growing the work number TWN database. At the end of the fourth quarter, TWN reached 136 million active records, an increase of 19% or 22 million records from a year ago and included 105 million unique individuals, which is almost 70% of U.S. nonfarm payroll. This increase in records makes our TWN database more valuable to our customers from both higher hit rates and more complete employment histories. We are now receiving records every pay period from 2.5 million companies, up from 1 million companies when we started 2021 and 27,000 contributors a short two-plus years ago. Our strong momentum continued during the fourth quarter with the signing of three new exclusive agreements with major payroll processors that we expect to implement during 2022. As a reminder, almost 55% of our records are contributed directly by employers where EWS provides comprehensive employer services like UC claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, ERC, ACA and other HR and compliance solutions. Our acquisitions of HIREtech, i2verify, Health e(fx) and now Efficient Hire, which we announced earlier this week, strengthen our ability to deliver these employer services both directly and through relationships with payroll processors and HR software companies, and of course, expand our TWN database. We still have substantial room to grow our TWN income and employment database and expect to continue to add new direct contributors as well as the additional \u2013 addition of payroll processors and software partners on an exclusive basis to TWN in 2022. Beyond just the \u2013 just under 50 million nonfarm payroll records not yet in the TWN database, we've expanded our focus to data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the United States marketplace to further broaden and strengthen the TWN database. You probably saw we also announced an expansion of our global footprint for Workforce Solutions with the launch of our new UK income and employment verification platform. This adds to our existing Australia, Canada and India EWS business launches outside the United States. We've got plenty of room to grow TWN. Second growth lever for Workforce Solutions is increasing average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing our existing products to value, recognizing the depth of information TWN allows us to deliver to customers. Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And the third growth lever is by increasing penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets and new verticals. For example, we continue to increase our penetration of the mortgage market. Workforce Solutions received an inquiry for over 60% of combined mortgages, up from 55% in early 2020. We have significant runway to grow penetration in the mortgage vertical. We are also in the early stages of penetrating the talent market where today, we receive inquiries in about one in 10 hires in the United States, plenty of room for growth. Growing system-to-system integration is another key growth lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of pulls per transaction. During the quarter, about 76% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system to system, up over 2x from the 32% in 2019, another great growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Workforce Solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above-market and above-Equifax growth rates and is highly accretive margins that we expect to power workforce \u2013 power Equifax growth in the future. Slide 8 highlights core mortgage revenue growth performance of our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Mortgage revenue grew 19% in 2021 in a down 7.5% market and off 80% revenue growth in 2020. Our combined U.S. B2B businesses outperformed the market \u2013 the mortgage market by 28 points in 2021 and 16 points in the fourth quarter. This was driven by Workforce Solutions as they outperformed the underlying mortgage market by 51 points for the year and 27 points in the fourth quarter. John will cover our updated mortgage market outlook in a few minutes. We've reduced our outlook \u2013 mortgage outlook for 2021 \u2013 2022 to down 21.5% versus our prior view of down 15%, reflecting the likely impact of higher interest rates. We expect to offset a large portion of that impact with stronger growth \u2013 stronger core mortgage revenue growth from EWS, from the strong TWN record additions, new products, system-to-system integrations and penetration. We now expect EWS will outperform the U.S. mortgage market by approximately 30 points, up 700 basis points from our prior view and our combined U.S. B2B businesses of USIS and EWS to outperform the U.S. mortgage market by an amount approaching 20 points, which is up 400 basis points from our prior view. 2021 was a very strong year for new product innovation and a key priority of our team. As shown on Slide 9, we delivered a record 151 new products, up from 134 last year \u2013 I'm sorry, in 2020 and a Vitality Index of just under 9%, which is our highest vitality that we've achieved since 2018 and stronger than our 8% expectations when we started 2021. Our pace accelerated in the fourth quarter as we delivered 36 new products, positioning us well for 2022. In the fourth quarter, we launched significant new products we expect to drive growth in 2022 and beyond. The EWS talent report education product provides all available postsecondary degrees instantly sourced from the National Student Clearinghouse via an exclusive Equifax ordering experience using a single SSN number input. This enhanced offering helps deliver a more efficient hiring process and the ability to make better informed hiring decisions with a holistic candidate view. Workforce Solutions' priority next-day VOE and priority two-day VOE products are our quick and seamless manual solutions that deliver verification of employment on the next business day or second business day following a client's request. These solutions are available to both our web and integrated clients and provide complete coverage when combined with our instant verification of employment solutions from TWN. The myEquifax Allow Access product, launched by USIS, allows consumers to be notified instantly when they submit an application to a participating lender that their file is frozen and with a few easy steps can unlock their files so their loan can be processed. And this is a win-win for both the lender and the consumer. The Spending Power and Affluence Index products, also launched by US, were introduced as new marketing targeting tools that utilize proprietary data to identify customers and prospects with the greatest capacity to spend on new products or services. Spending Power estimates dollars available to spend after accounting for cost of living expenses while the Affluence Index provides a score that differentiates households based on spending power and credit utilization. And then last, we continue to help our clients automate smarter digital customer acquisition decisions by enabling access to new data sources through the ID Matrix Enhancements in Australia, our clients can simultaneously identify previously undetected risk based on e-mail metadata and assess financial eligibility for a loan based on Australian residency status. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capability to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2022 of over 10%, which equates to over $500 million of revenue in 2022 from new products introduced in the past three years. The 10% vitality is up over 100 basis points from our strong 2021 new product results and aligns with our new long-term growth framework we provided at our Investor Day in November. Turning to Slide 10. USIS is leading the industry in offering flexible structure for BNPL providers to report consumer credit data onto the Equifax U.S. credit exchange through BNPL-specific business industry codes. This new capability will provide Equifax customers and partners the flexibility to include the fast-growing BNPL data in credit decisioning or to exclude it based on their specific needs. Our new Equifax Cloud gives us the ability to quickly ingest and manage diverse data types and develop customer reports through Equifax One and custom scores using Equifax decisioning. Our data ingestion process is simplified by the new Equifax Cloud, and time to market for products has substantially accelerated. As we move through 2022, you'll see this capability further accelerate our NPI-based revenue growth. Before I turn it over to John, I wanted to quickly discuss our guidance expectations for 2022. In October, we shared with you a framework for 2022 that included a midpoint revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share. As discussed earlier, several factors have impacted our view of 2022 compared to the framework we shared with you a few months ago. First, expectations for the U.S. mortgage market have changed meaningfully given the jump in the 30-year mortgage rates from 3% in September to 3.6% today. We now expect the U.S. mortgage market to decline 21.5% in 2022 as opposed to the 15% decline we expected back in October. On its own, the 650 basis point further decline in the mortgage market negatively impacts our revenue by over $100 million. And offsetting that, we expect Equifax core revenue growth should reach 16% in 2022, over 200 basis points higher than what we reviewed with you in October. This is principally driven by the strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions, including the accelerated pace of new TWN record additions and the faster new products rollouts. This higher core revenue growth drives just over $100 million of additional revenue, offsetting the impact of the additional 650 basis points of mortgage market decline. Our strong core growth allows us to hold our 2022 guidance at the same level as the 2022 framework we shared with you in October with our expectation that we will be at the midpoint of our 2022 guidance for revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2022 guidance and assumptions and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. We\u2019re starting off strong in 2022, given our momentum from the fourth quarter.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2022, I\u2019ll share a little more detail on 4Q 2021. In 4Q 2021, items below operating income, specifically net interest and other expenses and effective tax rate, came in combined slightly weaker than expected. Net interest and other expense was slightly weaker than we expected, and our 22% effective tax rate was very close to the guidance we provided. As Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in as expected in the fourth quarter at 32.2%. The factors resulting in the year-to-year decline were considered in the guidance we shared in October. Specifically, two-thirds of the decline was driven by the treatment of cloud technology transformation costs in 2021, including them in our adjusted results. Remaining one-third of the decline is driven by the items Mark discussed earlier, specifically the impact on Workforce Solutions and USIS of the acquisitions completed in 2021 and the increased royalty costs. As Mark discussed, regarding the acquisitions, we expect to deliver synergies that will support higher EBITDA margins as we move through 2022 and 2023. And the higher royalties at Workforce Solutions were partially driven by cost related to the start-up of the significant new payroll partners launched in the second half of 2021. As I will discuss in detail in a moment, we expect 1Q 2022 Workforce Solutions margins to return to exceed 55% and overall, Equifax EBITDA margins to return to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially. Let\u2019s start with more detail on our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market. As shown on Slide 11, in 2022, we are expecting a 21.5% year-to-year decline in the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries. With a more rapid increase in the U.S. mortgage market rates we have seen in the first quarter, reaching 3.6% last week, consistent with the increase in the U.S. 10-year and reduced Fed purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, we expect refinancing activity to drop more substantially beginning as early as late in the first quarter. 2022 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries would need to decline an additional just under 5% from 2021 levels to return to average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period. The left side of Slide 12 provides perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would be beneficial. We have expanded this chart from versions we shared in prior quarters to provide greater perspective on the full in-the-money population of mortgages. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, in rising mortgage rate environments, refinancings will often occur with lower levels of rate benefit. This is increasingly true during periods of high home price appreciation as homeowners look to borrow against their increasing levels of home equity. Looking at data from late January, at current mortgage rate levels, there are over 16 million homes that would benefit from a refinancing. Of this amount, about 7.8 million mortgages that have a loan to value at 80% or below and for which the borrower has a 660 or above credit score would see their mortgage rate decline by 75 basis points or more. There\u2019s an additional 5.3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would see their mortgage rate decline by 25 basis points to 75 basis points. And there are another just over 3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would benefit by up to 25 basis points from refinancing. Although down significantly from the levels we saw earlier in 2021 when mortgage rates were around 3%, this remains a significant population similar to the levels we saw in 2009 and about 15% below what we saw in 2016. For perspective, per Black Knight data during 4Q 2021, over 35% of refinancings were by borrowers benefiting by a rate decrease of less than 75 basis points. Based upon our most recent data from July 2021, mortgage refinancings were just about 600,000 per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 12, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. Our 2022 assumption for U.S. mortgage credit inquiries is that we will see these high levels of purchase mortgage financings continue at levels slightly above the levels we saw in 2021. And that refinancings will decline significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021. Slide 13 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8.4% constant currency and 7.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.3 billion. Using current FX rates, FX is a negative impact on 2022 growth of just over 0.8%, about 0.2 percentage points weaker than we discussed in October. Total revenue of $5.3 billion is up almost 8% from 2021 and in line with the framework we provided in October. The 21.5% more \u2013 decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 6.6%, about 200 basis points or just over $100 million more negative than the levels we discussed in October. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business, total headwinds to 2022 revenue growth are about 8 percentage points. Core organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis is anticipated to be over 13%. This is almost 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October with this improvement driven by Workforce Solutions through the much stronger record growth and accelerating NPI and strong pricing driving higher average unit revenues that Mark discussed earlier. Non-mortgage organic growth is driving over 7% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. USIS non-mortgage and international are also expected to drive core growth. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining almost 6% of the core \u2013 of the organic core growth. This is driven by strong outperformance in Workforce Solutions. The acquisitions completed in 2021, plus the Efficient Hire acquisition closed earlier this week, are expected to contribute about 3.2 percentage points of growth to 2022. Core revenue growth, excluding FX, of almost 16.5% is well above our long-term framework and 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October due to the stronger core organic growth in Workforce Solutions and our good start to the year and acquisitions. This stronger core revenue growth drives just over $100 million in revenue benefit, offsetting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Slide 14 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 13% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.65 per share. This is in line with the midpoint of the 2022 framework we shared in October. EBITDA margins are still expected to increase in the 175 to 200 basis point range we discussed in October. Revenue growth of 7.6% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% would deliver about 10% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of 175 basis points to 200 basis points is expected to drive 9% growth in adjusted EPS. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $40 million in 2022, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects increased debt from the 2021 acquisitions and the higher short-term interest rates I\u2019ve referenced. Interest rates \u2013 the interest expense is higher than our expectation in October by about $7 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.5% does not assume any changes to the U.S. federal tax rate. Slide 15 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022. We anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 16%, reflecting organic growth of 13% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021 plus Efficient Hire. Slide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. 2022 revenue of between $5.25 billion and $5.35 billion reflects growth of about 6.6% to 8.7% versus 2021, including a 0.8% negative impact from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 3.2%. EWS is expected to deliver over 15% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be up from the 54.6% delivered in 2021. USIS revenue is expected to be about flat, reflecting the 21.5% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be slightly down from the 39.9% delivered in 2021. Combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to be down slightly with mortgage outperformance approaching 20%. And International revenues expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 7% to 9%. International EBITDA margins are expected to expand by over 175 basis points. 2022 adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $8.80 per share is up 11.2% to 15.2% from 2021. Given the greater decline of the U.S. mortgage market we discussed earlier, we believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. The 175 to 200 basis point improvement in our 2022 EBITDA margin from the 33.9% in 2021 is principally driven by the following main factors. Workforce Solutions revenue growth of over 15% with margins at or above their current 54.6% drives a benefit to overall Equifax EBITDA margins of over 150 basis points. Corporate expense as a percentage of revenue is declining year-to-year on higher overall Equifax revenue, improving overall Equifax EBITDA margin by on the order of 100 basis points. The drivers of the lower spend are principally lower corporate technology transformation expense and lower variable comp. International margin expansion of over 175 basis points also drives about 25 basis points in overall Equifax EBITDA margin. These are partially offset by the negative impact on overall Equifax EBITDA margins of flat USIS revenue in 2022 due to the very weak mortgage market. Slide 17 provides our guidance for 1Q 2022. We are starting 2022 strong, better than previously expected. We expect revenue in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.34 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 8.8% to 10.5%, including a 1.2% negative impact from FX. The U.S. mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries is expected to be down approximately 24%. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 5.2%. 1Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially. The improvement is driven by the same two factors we discussed driving the improvement in our full year 2022 EBITDA margins. Looking at the business units in the first quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue is expected to be up over 25% year-to-year, and EBITDA margins are expected to be over 55% driven by significant growth in Verifier and seasonally strong Workforce Analytics revenue. Workforce Solutions will represent about 47% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenues expected to be down 3% to 4% year-to-year driven by the 24% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in non-mortgage expected to be up mid-single-digit percentage. EBITDA margins will be down slightly sequentially from 4Q 2021 due to the weak mortgage market. International revenue is expected to be up about 8% year-to-year in constant currency. And EBITDA margins are expected to be down about 100 basis points year-to-year. The decline in EBITDA margin is driven by increased cost in Canada as we migrate our Canadian credit exchange to be in production on data fabric in the quarter and some negative mix from growth in debt management. As I just indicated, full year EBITDA margins for International should increase 175 basis points year-to-year. Corporate expense will decline year-to-year, benefiting overall Equifax EBITDA margins. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q 2022 to be $2.08 to $2.18 per share compared to the 1Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.97 per share. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 18. At our Investor Day in November, we discussed the strong earnings and cash flow that can be generated by 2025 by Equifax executing our new long-term financial framework. We also shared a scenario for you to consider that assuming the U.S. mortgage market normalizes by 2025 to the average levels we saw over 2015 to 2019 and we deliver revenue growth just above the midpoint of our 8% to 12% framework growth rate, revenue in 2025 could be about $7 billion. And continuing to execute our cloud data and tech transformation at these revenue levels could deliver 39% EBITDA margins by 2025. Beyond 2025, we expect to see revenue expansion of 8% to 12% and deliver margin expansion of, on average, 50 basis points per year, reflecting our significant operating leverage and high variable margins. As shown on Slide 19, free cash flow accelerated significantly in 2021, reaching $866 million and 92% of adjusted net income. In 2022, excluding the $345 million payment on the U.S. consumer class action settlement made in January, free cash flow will exceed $1 billion and 95% of adjusted net income. As we discussed in November at our Investor Day, to the extent, we are able to deliver revenue growth and EBITDA margins I just referenced in 2025, we could generate $2.7 billion of EBITDA, $12.75 in adjusted EPS and $1.6 billion in free cash flow, almost double the $866 million that we delivered in 2021. The substantial increase in free cash flow creates significant capacity for M&A and also for a return of capital to shareholders through cash generation and increased debt capacity. Now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 20, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX Cloud with innovation new products. EFX2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and the foundation of the new Equifax. We continue to make significant progress executing the Equifax cloud data and technology transformation. We now have about half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North America cloud migrations. We\u2019ve now completed almost 112,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations. In North America, our principal consumer exchanges are in production in the new Equifax cloud-based single data fabric and delivering to our customers. Our International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some customer migrations continuing into 2024. We remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics and technology company. We\u2019re in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities, but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond. At our Investor Day in November, we discussed how the execution of our new EFX2023 strategic priorities, including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, will lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth. We introduced the new Equifax long-term financial framework shown on Slide 21, with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt-on M&A. We also expect to deliver margin expansion, as John mentioned a few minutes ago, with 50 basis points per year over the long-term. That will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 16%, which combined with our 1% dividend yield target will allow us to deliver a total return to shareholders of 13% to 18% going forward. Reinvesting our strong outperformance and strategic and accretive bolt-on M&A is a key priority for the future. As shown on the left side of Slide 22, 2021 was a strong year for bolt-on M&A with eight acquisitions closed totaling about $3 billion that added $300 million to run rate revenue, excluding synergies. Our M&A priorities are clear and focused on expanding and strengthening the core of Equifax through, number one, expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions; number two, adding unique data assets; number three, expanding in the fast-growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four, continuing to look to expand our credit bureau footprint globally. We expect to add 100, 200 basis points in revenue growth each year from bolt-on M&A. In 2021, we completed eight strategic and accretive acquisitions shown on Slide 23. We substantially strengthened and broadened Workforce Solutions through the acquisition of Appriss as well as Health e(fx), HIREtech and i2verify. And we strengthened our identity and fraud portfolio through the acquisition of Kount and our USIS differentiated data assets through both the Teletrack and Kount acquisitions. These were critical acquisitions for Equifax that we\u2019re now focused on fully integrating the businesses and driving synergies to accelerate our growth. Reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and long-term growth framework. We\u2019re starting off 2022 \u2013 we\u2019re starting 2022 off strong with a bolt-on acquisition that we closed earlier this week. As outlined on Slide 24, Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded employer services to hospitality, building services and senior living. The acquisition also strengthens Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market and provides us with incremental TWN records. Slide 25 highlights the tremendous growth of Workforce Solutions, both in revenue and EBITDA margins over the past five years. The very strong growth of the work number and the addition of Appriss Insights and expansion of the EWS Data Hub have dramatically expanded the Workforce Solutions addressable markets across new verticals of talent solutions, government, Employer Services, including onboarding as well as their core mortgage and financial services markets. Our ability to access these markets with our unique and still expanding TWN employment, income and talent data and services will allow EWS to continue to deliver above-market core growth and power EFX in the future. We\u2019re also leveraging the new EWS cloud-based tech platform for international expansion with the announcement I mentioned earlier of our new UK income and employment verification services. This adds to our EWS solutions in Canada, Australia and India. Workforce Solutions has grown from about 25% of Equifax revenue three years ago to over 40% last year and will likely grow to over 50% of Equifax in the coming years. The above-market growth in Workforce Solutions and depth and diversity of their people-based assets have moved Equifax well beyond the traditional credit bureau space and made us a faster growing and more diverse business than we were a short three years ago. As shown on Slide 26, the new Equifax is a customer and product-centric company that will deliver 8% to 12% revenue growth in the future by leveraging our Equifax cloud-native architecture centered on a single data fabric to enable seamless use of our unique data assets to deliver new products faster and more effectively. Executing on our EFX2023 growth strategy and delivering revenue growth consistent with the midpoint of our long-term framework will allow us to deliver $7 billion of revenue and 39% EBITDA margins in 2025, as John just mentioned a few minutes ago and as we shared with you in November. Wrapping up on Slide 27, Equifax delivered another strong base quarter with above-market growth in 2021, more than offsetting a declining mortgage market. We are operating exceptionally well and have strong momentum as we move into 2022. We\u2019ve now delivered eight consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is on offense. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter and year, powering our results, delivering 29% revenue growth in the fourth quarter while integrating Appriss Insights and the three other 2021 bolt-on acquisitions that strengthened the core of our Workforce Solutions. Workforce is clearly our largest, fastest-growing and most valuable business. And Rudy and his team remain focused on driving outsized growth. USIS also delivered a strong quarter with 12% non-mortgage growth and about 6% organic non-mortgage growth, offsetting the impact of a sharp over 20% decline in the mortgage market. Sid and the USIS team remain competitive and are working and are winning in the marketplace. International grew for the fifth consecutive quarter with 6% growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes. We have high expectations for International as we move into 2022. We spent the last three years building the Equifax cloud and are in the early days of leveraging our new and uniquely Equifax cloud-based technology and single data fabric capabilities. As we move into 2022 and beyond, we will increasingly realize the top line, cost and cash benefits from these new only Equifax cloud capabilities. And we\u2019ve already added a strategic bolt-on acquisition to Workforce Solutions this week that combined with the acquisitions we made in 2021 are contributing 320 basis points or almost $160 million to 2022 revenue growth. We continue to build our pipeline as we look to add 100 to 120 basis points of revenue growth annually from bolt-on M&A. Our 2022 guidance with core revenue growth of 16% is well above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. And 8% growth in total is aligned with our prior guidance despite a 21% decline in the mortgage market. Our ability to offset the additional 650 basis points of mortgage decline with stronger core growth reflects the breadth and strength of the new Equifax. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 13% to $8.65 at the midpoint, which also aligns with the 2022 framework we reviewed with you in October. I\u2019m energized about our strong above-market performance in 2021, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in 2022 and beyond. We remain convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. I\u2019d also like to announce today that Trevor Burns is returning to the Equifax Investor Relations team. Please join me in welcoming Trevor back to IR and feel free to contact Trevor, Dorian or Sam with any questions. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Allison on for George. Congrats on the strong results and outlook. And thank you for taking my questions. I was hoping to drill in a bit more into the mortgage market estimate. Given how rates have been moving, I was curious if you can comment on how the 21.5% decline in mortgage market increase estimate was derived in terms of the 10-year yield in mortgage rates? And how comfortable you are with that estimate?\nMark Begor: Yes. I\u2019ll start, and John, you can jump in. As you know, forecasting the mortgage market is quite challenging. The good news is we have a lot of history which we rely on, and we have a lot of data that we rely on. But I would \u2013 you make the point that it\u2019s obviously challenging. But we look at all of our data elements of the track record of new home purchases in the marketplace, the refi market. John went through some detail on the still sizable population of homes in the United States that will benefit from a refinancing. He also highlighted the significant increase in HPA or home price appreciation, which is I think 30% for most geographies across the United States. So the availability for consumers to access equity in their homes through a refinancing. Those certainly weighed in. And of course, offsetting that, as you point out, is the higher interest rates, which reduced the number of homes available for refi. So those were all the factors that we put into our models and our analysis. And we thought 21.5% was the right place, given everything we see today, obviously, down dramatically from the minus 15% we were using for really the second or the last portions of 2021 as we were looking forward to 2022. And then, of course, we\u2019re pleased that the core performance of Equifax is strong. And we can offset that with our core growth, particularly from Workforce Solutions from the momentum in the fourth quarter, the strong addition of records, which helps power their business and broadly the strong performance of Equifax.\nJohn Gamble: We also look closely at run rates. So really through January through early February, the run rates are consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in our first quarter \u2013 the first quarter estimate down 24% wasn\u2019t changed that really materially from the estimate we gave in October. So we look closely at those run rates. We think they\u2019ve been relatively predictive. And we\u2019re also, as Mark said, we try to be very open about what we\u2019ve assumed. So that if you have a different view on mortgage, at least you\u2019ll have a very good view as to what we put into our numbers, and you can obviously act accordingly.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s helpful color. And then just as a quick follow-up, shifting to EWS. How should we be thinking about pricing as a driver for 2022?\nMark Begor: Yes. As you know, we don\u2019t talk about specific pricing actions, but all of our businesses use price on an annual basis to offset inflation, of course, but also reflect the value of the solutions that we\u2019re delivering. And we\u2019ve been quite clear in prior discussions with you and our other investors that Workforce Solutions has more pricing power because of the uniqueness of the assets they deliver and the scale of the database. So it\u2019s clearly one of the levers. But as you know, that\u2019s only one. They\u2019ve really ramped up their new product rollouts in the last 12 to 18 months, leveraging the cloud, particularly in the second half of 2021. And we talked about new solutions that we\u2019re bringing to market in the mortgage space, for example, where we have mortgage solutions that provide more history at a meaningfully higher price point than the single solution that we have or the co-borrower solution that we now have called Mortgage Duo that is priced over $175 per poll because it provides real value on co-borrowers. So those are examples of leverage that Workforce has. And of course, the other levers, the adding of TWN records, our TWN records being up 19%. The new relationships that we\u2019ve signed exclusively in the latter part of the year that we\u2019ll be adding to our records in 2022. As you know, because of the very large volume of inquiries that we get on a system-to-system basis or through the web, as we add new records, we\u2019re able to monetize those really instantly. So that 19% is another very meaningful lever for Workforce Solutions as we move into 2022.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate all the helpful detail. If we start with the 136 million active work number records from Q4, add the three agreements you signed with payroll processors, you had additional work number records, how should we think about active work number records estimated for year-end 2022 and then the associated hit rate?\nMark Begor: Yes. As you know, we don\u2019t give detail around kind of guidance on the records that we\u2019re adding during the year. We try to be very transparent about current period record additions. And as you know, those were added at different points if you think about 2021 during the year, so you get a year-over-year benefit in 2022 for the record. So the 19% increase will benefit the Workforce Solutions in 2022. And then, of course, these new agreements that we mentioned that we\u2019ve signed with major \u2013 some of the larger payroll processors on an exclusive basis, we\u2019ll be adding at different points during the year. It takes time to build the system integrations and to bring those into our data set. And then, of course, as you know, close to 60% of our records come from individual company relationships that we have from our Employer Services business. And that\u2019s a very active area for us to add records, which we do on a \u2013 kind of on a daily, weekly basis. Actually, John and I get a report every Friday of records that are added. And those are \u2013 we\u2019re really strengthening our ability to add records from individual companies as we build our Employer Services solutions, whether that\u2019s I-9, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, HCA, W-2. And as you know, we did three acquisitions last year that add to that space, including one this week, that grow our solutions and Employer Services business, but they also bring records. So we have a really a multisided approach and really scale focus on adding records. And just back on the payroll processors, we still have a pipeline of the relationships we don\u2019t have. We\u2019re in active dialogues with those as we\u2019ve talked about. We have real momentum. As you know, I don\u2019t know, in the last 18 months, we\u2019ve added some meaningful new relationships, including a large one in third quarter last year that we announced, I guess, a year ago on our fourth quarter call. And then we\u2019ve got the three that we added on an exclusive basis in the last few weeks that will be rolling in, in 2022. So a big focus on adding those records. And as you think about it, there\u2019s a long runway. I would encourage you to think about total records but also unique records. Remember, the 135 million is total records, but we have 105 million SSNs or unique individuals. So there\u2019s 30 million people in there that have multiple jobs. The path from 105 million to 155 million, 157 million or 158 million whatever the right number is now, nonfarm payroll, it\u2019s another 50 million plus individuals that we are focused on adding. And then, of course, we have a big focus of going beyond nonfarm payroll to really get those very valuable 40 million to 50 million gig records, meaning individuals that are self-employed. There is a second job beyond nonfarm payroll or someone who is just self-employed. And then also the 20 million to 30 million pensioner records that is another valuable source for income verification for those that are not in the workforce today. So you add those up, you\u2019re looking at something north of 100 million additional records we can add. If you think about the 105 million we have unique individuals and add that potential, we have the ability to still kind of double the TWN database, and we\u2019re focused on it.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. Just as a follow-up, John, for the first quarter, you\u2019re guiding Workforce Solutions revenue growth over 25%, which is well above the 15% guidance for the full year. Can you talk through the cadence of expected Workforce Solutions revenue growth throughout 2022? And what puts Q1 so far above the full year guide?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. The big \u2013 one of the biggest factors would be the fact that we did the large acquisitions in the second half of this year. So you wrap around the addition of that revenue as you get into the third quarter, but principally the fourth quarter. But overall, we expect Workforce Solutions to continue to perform extremely well and drive very high organic growth throughout the year.\nDavid Togut: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question Is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nKevin McVeigh: Congrats. On the Vitality Index, it seems like you\u2019re clearly outpacing that. And if I heard you right, it\u2019s about 10% in 2022. Maybe help us understand that. Is that just a function of some of the more recent product that\u2019s been brought to market or broader acceptance? Just what\u2019s driving that outperformance?\nMark Begor: Yes, and yes. And I think you know, and I hope you get a sense that it\u2019s a huge priority of ours. We really ramped up our focus on new products, I\u2019d call it, two years ago when we added significant resources, meaning new people. I think as you know, we have for the first time now in the last two years a Chief Product Officer, who is on my leadership team. We\u2019re really driving, leveraging our differentiated data and the Equifax cloud. And what you\u2019re seeing is the \u2013 I would call it the early days or early innings of our ability to leverage the cloud. Of course, while we\u2019re more than halfway as far as kind of cloud complete, that will substantially accelerate in 2022, that half that is complete is starting to take hold, where what\u2019s happening is what we thought would happen is we\u2019re able to combine data assets, bring new solutions to market much more quickly. So it\u2019s a combination of resources and focus. We have a monthly deep dive, John and I with the product team around their pipeline and then the ability to leverage our new capabilities. This is why we invested in the cloud, why we invested in a single data fabric was our ability to ramp up new product introductions. And as you point out, going from 5%, 6% a couple of years ago vitality to we started last year hoping to do 8%. We ended at 9% vitality. And then as you point out, to be \u2013 have a goal in 2022 of 10%, that\u2019s $0.5 billion of new products introduced in the last three years. And we\u2019re very deliberate about how we define a new product. It has to be new-new. And we view that as a very attractive growth lever for us. As you know, new products and incremental revenue are very high incremental margins for our business. And it\u2019s inherent in our long-term framework that we rolled out in November, where we increased the low end of 100 bps and the high end 200 basis points of our total growth going forward that NPIs will be a meaningfully part \u2013 meaningful part of that. And when we talked in November, we said our long-term goal is to get to 10% vitality, and we\u2019re chasing that this year. And we \u2013 as we talked a few minutes ago, our goal is to deliver 10% vitality in 2022.\nKevin McVeigh: That\u2019s great. And then just one quick follow-up. If you said this, I apologize, but what mortgage rate do you have embedded in the assumptions for 2022?\nJohn Gamble: So, I don\u2019t have a specific forecast for mortgage rates, right? What we do is, I think we have an earlier question, right? We look at the current forecasts that are out there for the 10-year. And we try to consider those in the decisions we make, right? So right now, I think if you took a look at the Bloomberg average, you\u2019d see an expectation that we\u2019re going to see the 10-year go up, say, somewhere between 35 basis points and 50 basis points. So, we make an assumption that probably you\u2019re looking at mortgage rates moving in a similar direction. To be fair, as Mark said, forecasting the mortgage market, incredibly hard and actually tying the movement in the mortgage market to the 10-year, also incredibly hard. But that\u2019s basically what we\u2019ve assumed in the practice.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, John, I was just hoping you could provide mortgage revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the fourth quarter. And if you could give mortgage revenues again for fourth quarter for USIS and EWS as a percentage of revenues?\nJohn Gamble: So I can get \u2013 the first one I have, it\u2019s 27%. I think we did give in the script some detail on mortgage revenue for EWS and USIS, specifically. But for Equifax, fourth quarter mortgage was 27% of total revenue. And for the full year, it was 32%. And Andrew, just as an FYI, a little later today, we\u2019ll post the supplemental deck. And in that will be the updated pie charts that show revenue by segment for Equifax in each of the business units.\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. And I think the pie charts are annual, right?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, sir.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMark Begor: Good morning, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: Good morning, Mark. I just wanted to focus on \u2013 obviously, EWS is going well, et cetera, the mortgage market. Can you just talk a little bit about the USIS non-mortgage businesses and some of the trends and stuff you\u2019re seeing there? It sounds like the consumer is healthy, but just was hoping for that outlook on your end.\nJohn Gamble: Sure. I can start, and I\u2019m sure Mark will jump in, right? So, we had nonmortgage organic growth of about 6%. We had total growth of about 12%, right? I think as Mark mentioned in the script, we\u2019re seeing very good growth continues in insurance. We said up double digits, up high single digits in commercial, high single digits in identity and fraud. So again, we think very good performance.\nMark Begor: Strong growth in marketing, which we translate as we go into 2022 into online.\nJohn Gamble: Absolutely, right. So with FI, obviously, we saw very strong growth, as Mark said, in FMS, which we think is going to translate into strengthening growth as we go through all of 2022. We\u2019ve also had, as Mark mentioned in his comments, really nice new business wins in USIS, a lot of that around FI. And then we\u2019ve had actually some several significant wins with larger FIs that should ramp as we go through 2022. So, we think we\u2019re going to see nice increases on organic growth as we move through 2022, both in total organic growth, but organic growth specifically to FIs. And as we look at identity and fraud, we saw really nice growth in, let\u2019s call it, our new identity and fraud products, our identity foundry and really Kount-based products. As we got into the fourth quarter, growth there was well over 20%. We are going through a little bit of a transition. We\u2019re transitioning off some of our older legacy based products under those new products. So you see some choppy growth, although up high single digit, certainly isn\u2019t bad. And \u2013 but we\u2019re seeing very good growth in the Kount-based products and the products that are based on the new identity foundry that we\u2019ve talked to you about in the past, which is all built on data fabric. So, we feel like the 6% that we talked about in organic in the fourth quarter was relatively good performance. As we indicated, it\u2019s probably going to be about similar to that in the first, but we\u2019re expecting to see nice improvement as we go through next year.\nMark Begor: I\u2019ll just add, Manav, that we\u2019re also pleased with the traction we\u2019re starting to see and we have been seeing around kind of our competitive positioning with the cloud, the capabilities of the cloud that we deliver that we think differentiate Equifax. Of course, we think we have data our competitors don\u2019t have. And those discussions around competitive takeaways or competitive wins are continue to pick up momentum by Sid and his team. So, we think that\u2019s another positive going forward as they get closer to being cloud-native and fully delivering those differentiated service levels and capabilities to our customers. We think that\u2019s going to be a positive for them going forward.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And Mark, just on the International workforce expansion, the new countries that you had announced, can you just help us in terms of time line what we should be expecting? I\u2019m guessing your new tech and cloud infrastructure perhaps will help it get to a size faster than what we witnessed in the U.S.? Or should we be thinking differently?\nMark Begor: No. It\u2019s \u2013 you and I talked before, and we\u2019ve talked with our investor base many times about our goal of expanding workforce globally. We paused International expansions while we were building out the tech stack, and that\u2019s now built. UK is our first move there. The technology is live. We\u2019re, I believe, close to ingesting records, meaning starting to have contributors contribute into our UK, TWN database. So that\u2019s happening as we speak. That was kind of built up over the last number of months. And as you point out, we now have the ability to go into international markets more quickly, more economically with a cloud-based technology stack. Of course, this adds to our Australian business, where we\u2019re ingesting and actually delivering solutions in the marketplace, same in Canada and same in India. And we do have a strategy to expand to other markets globally. We\u2019re \u2013 we haven\u2019t announced anything yet, but we see that as an opportunity. Maybe to close that point is that the financial impact of it is it will be de minimis in the scale of workforce and Equifax in 2022. Meaning it will be small, but we expect it to grow over time. Where it will be meaningful is going to be a couple of years probably when you think about those international expansions. But in each of those markets, what it does for our credit file business, think UK, Australia, India and Canada, is it makes them more competitive because we bring a solution now of not only the credit report in Canada or the UK, but then we can couple in, just like we\u2019re doing in the United States, an income and employment verification. So that\u2019s another positive of going into markets that we\u2019re already in. And of course, as you know, in a number of those markets like UK and Australia, we have very large market positions. So the addition of the income and employment data is positive for us. So it\u2019s clearly a part of Workforce Solutions growth strategy going forward is to U.K. is our \u2013 is the move we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we\u2019ll look for other markets to expand our workforce business into, because we believe \u2013 we view it as a global franchise, of course, which is anchored quite strongly in our very, very large U.S. business.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nMark Begor: Hey Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Good morning. Workforce margins really stepped down this quarter. Mark, you were clear on the three pieces. The acquisition dilution dissipating and cloud transfer transformation being over, that makes sense to me as to why those won\u2019t continue. But around the ramp of new contributors, that was really strong this quarter, which is a great thing. And it\u2019d be great if that continues. So I guess, how much was that record ramp impacting the margins? And next year, can you still achieve mid-50s if that ramp sort of continues to grow? I just want to make sure also that there isn\u2019t anything competitively changing that impacted.\nMark Begor: No, no, no. I think we said two or three times in our earlier comments that we have clear expectations that workforce will in 2022 achieve their kind of historical margins or I think we said it or above. It\u2019s not unusual, and you followed us for some time. You may remember in, I think, third quarter of 2020, going back maybe to \u2013 was there in 2019, we also had maybe an instance like this, there\u2019s a little bit of lumpiness when you\u2019re adding a bigger payroll processor. And there\u2019s a lumpiness in some in-quarter costs to complete those integrations. Sometimes we help support partner, meaning we help pay for some of those integration costs, we have some incremental costs on our side. But you\u2019ve seen in the past that those quickly are dissipated, meaning they are onetime. And we \u2013 we\u2019ve factored into what is going to happen in as far as record additions that we can see now in 2022 in kind of the comments we had earlier around our expectation that workforce margins will kind of return to that mid-50s.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. And we indicated they\u2019ll step back to 55% in the first quarter, right? So, I mean \u2013 so we feel very good about the fact that these each of those three factors that Mark talked about, we can address, and we will address them very quickly. And they were all substantial, right? So, you can think about them all being relatively consistent in size and significant to what affected us year-on-year, but we expect to be back at 55% in the first quarter.\nToni Kaplan: Okay. That\u2019s great. And my follow-up is also on workforce. I was hoping you could talk about just competition there, if anything has changed with regard to sort of more players coming in or some of your large bureau competitors are looking at this as an area that they can expand in. So can the market \u2013 is market growth going? Can that lead to you and others being successful? Or is this really going to come down to plating to retain market share? And just talk about sustainability and exclusivity and stuff like that.\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a great question. We talked about it many times in prior calls. We got a lot \u2013 we have a lot of confidence in the scale of our underlying business model. And as you pointed out, there are some others that are trying to enter this space. We think it's going to be quite challenging to obtain records, start with that, think about the tens of thousands of integrations that we have. Remember, the integration of income and employment data is a separate integration from existing credit file integration. So those have to be built. But just start with records. The 19% growth that we had, the 135 million, 105 million uniques. We added a large payroll processor last year in the third quarter that was exclusive. We've added three more \u2013 we\u2019re adding three more that are all exclusive. And of course, exclusive means they're only going to work with Equifax and Workforce Solutions. So that's quite challenging. And remember, too, that the 60% of our records we've accumulated over 15 years of building up those relationships through the very large Employer Solutions business we have or providing all those services to HR managers and companies for W-2, I-9, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, HCA, et cetera, those solutions, that's a very long-term scale kind of business to build out. So while we know there are others in the space, we think our market position is quite strong, and we got a lot of confidence in maintaining that position going forward. And it really starts with the ability to build out a data set that looks like Equifax's we think that's very, very hard to do.\nJohn Gamble: The other thing I'd just add is that if you think about the markets we're addressing, our penetration in those markets still has a long way to run, right? As Mark mentioned in his comments on mortgage, which is where we're the most highly penetrated, it's still just over 60%. And when you go into talent solutions and government, and it's important to remember in both of those segments, right, it's not just current record, it's depth of records, so that's extremely important, right? History makes an extremely \u2013 is extremely important in both our government services and importantly, our talent solutions businesses. There, our penetration is, in most cases, well under 25%, right, and growing very rapidly. And the reason it's growing rapidly again is because of the depth of records we're now able to provide, which we couldn't provide two-years ago. So we think there's huge opportunity in those nonmortgage businesses to substantially grow our share. And right now, we're competing against, in many cases, pay stubs or more manual processes to collect the information. So we feel very, very good about the opportunities to grow within the market segment by basically providing instant verifications within those market segments where they're not available today.\nMark Begor: Toni, maybe to add one more point on it. We hear more about competitors from these calls than we do in the marketplace, if you understand that point meaning, we hear that from our investors and so on, but we really don't see them in the marketplace. They just don't have the scale to play either on the record additions or on delivering solutions to our customers. We've been in this business for 15 years. We've invested $1 billion \u2013 actually, more than that, we're up to like $3-plus billion probably in the business since we owned it when you add M&A. And then on the technology side, think about it, we put $300 million into the business incrementally in the last three years. It's a massive investment, and you have to have real scale to be able to play at the level we're playing at.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect, thanks. Congrats, and welcome back to Trevor.\nMark Begor: Thanks.\nOperator: Thanks. Your next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham Company. Your line is now live.\nKyle Peterson: Hey, good morning. Thanks guys. Just one quick one for me. Just I want to see if you guys could provide a little more color and thoughts on the impact of buy now pay later now being kind of included in your credit reports. Do you think the opportunity there is more on the volume side of kind of increasing the pool of customers out there that are being scored particularly upgrading kind of thin-file customers to more kind of standard and thick file? Or do you think it's more of an opportunity to potentially have some pricing leverage down the road just as you get more data points and just more data that can be used by some of these potential lenders?\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a great question. It's really all of the above. We have a relationships all over the globe with the BNPL players. As you know, they're growing rapidly. We're selling them identity data, think Kount or other identity because you got to verify a consumer before you offer that for payment loan, for the blue jeans or whatever they're buying. We're also selling them some credit data in different markets, including the United States, particularly as they go to bigger-ticket transactions. If you're financing a pair of blue jeans for $100, over four-payments, there's a credit exposure to that. It's very different than you're doing a refrigerator. That's a $1,000 refrigerator or something. And so there's a trend there where you're seeing more credit data being used for BNPL players as customers. On the data side, it really follows our focus on just building out our data assets. And there are a lot of data elements, as you point out, in BNPL players. And actually, with all credit fans, it's very popular, for example, with millennials, which typically have thinner credit files. They may be good credit, but they have thin credit files. Meaning they only have one bank card or two bank cards or whatever. So that BNPL data will be very valuable. We're also going down the path of adding rental data. So we're accumulating rental payment data. That's another valuable asset. And of course, in the alternative data side, meaning outside the credit file, we have really scaled data assets at Equifax that we're putting in our single data fabric and bringing to market as new solutions like our NCTUE cellphone utility payment data, which is very valuable as another trade line for thin or no hit \u2013 thin file or no hit customers. And then on the pure alternative data, we bought DataX a couple of years ago in 2018. And then we acquired last year, Teletrack. And we'll now have the largest data set at something like 80 million Americans outside of the credit file their data from rent-to-own companies, their payment data from auto lenders, subprime auto lenders, sales finance companies, furniture companies, payday lenders. So a very, very rich data set that's additive to the credit file, just like this BNPL data, just like our NC+ data, just like rental data. So it's a broad focus for us. And the cloud capabilities we have in the single data fabric really allow us to bring these new data sources into our environment, into our database. And of course, as you know, we have \u2013 we've built out and now are adding to our single data fabric where we're going to have data keyed and linked for an individual. Every data element that we have will be put together that way, which is, again, as a part of the benefits of our big cloud investments that we're making.\nKyle Peterson: Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier comment around the expansion of Workforce Solution into nonmortgage. I was wondering if you could give some color on the pipeline for new clients and government sector, talent solution as well as auto, personal consumer loans. Any color on those fronts on the pipeline, how does that look for new clients? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. As you heard from our comments earlier, that's a very fast-growing space for us, which I think you were broadly talking about our nonmortgage portion of Workforce Solutions, which is growing very, very strongly. Government is a big vertical for us. We've been expanding there. Appriss makes us stronger. We signed and launched the SSA contract last year. That's ramping. So that's another new solution. We see a lot of potential in government. Talent is a very big space for us with big potential. In my comments earlier, I shared the point that we only today see one in 10 inquiries around the hiring process. So big runway, and that business has been growing strong, strong double digits in the hiring space. And we see big potential when you combine some of the Appriss data, the National Student Clearinghouse education data and of course, as John mentioned, the work history we have. We have a history on individuals because we've been accumulating records over the last 10-plus years, and we average something like 5.5 jobs for every American. So that work history is extremely valuable in that hiring process for 75 million people a year were hired. So that's a big growth area for us. We talked about Employer Services or Employer Solutions, where we're delivering HR compliance generally solutions to HR managers to do that work for them. A lot of those \u2013 a lot of that work today is in-sourced. We pick up the outsourcing of it either directly or through our partners. And that's another area that's been growing. And of course, we've done a bunch of M&A there that strengthen us. And the three bolt-on acquisitions last year of HIREtech, i2verify and Health e(fx) and then the acquisition we announced and closed this week of Efficient Hire, those strengthen us in that space of delivering those W-2, I-9 verification, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, all those other solutions, to HR managers. Of course, they bring records to us, which is very valuable. So we see a really very attractive growth potential. And then in Financial Services, to your question, we've been growing very strongly outside of mortgage. Auto is a space that's growing for us, using our income and employment data along with credit data. Personal loans, we have very strong penetration there that \u2013 using income and employment data. And then in cards, we've got a couple of big issuers now that are combining our income and employment data with the credit file at origination, and we expect that to grow also. So that's a new opportunity for us. So a lot of potential for Workforce Solutions. And of course, most of the verticals we just talked about are way different than our traditional credit bureau verticals, meaning we\u2019re in spaces that are growing faster than our core credit bureau space. But they also diversify Equifax very, very broadly. From being historically more traditional financial services, we\u2019re now much more diversified than we will be in the future as we grow.\nAshish Sabadra: That\u2019s great color. Congrats on that. And maybe if I can just ask kind of a follow-up question. You mentioned significant competitive wins on the core credit bureau side as well. I was wondering if you could provide any color on that front. How much of that is being driven by the differentiated income verification that you have using that as a land-and-expand strategy? And any other color where you\u2019re seeing this competitive win, traditional FIs, fintech? Any color will be helpful. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. We didn\u2019t talk about specific wins, but we did talk about when I used the term momentum by our USIS team competitively. And that\u2019s really driven by areas that you talked about. It\u2019s our differentiated data, which, of course, we\u2019re expanding. It\u2019s the build-out of the single data fabric, which makes our data more accessible. We have more data than our competitors and then we have it in a way that\u2019s more easily utilized and then the cloud capabilities and cloud functionality that is increasingly in the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing that give us a leg up in those competitive discussions that we view as positive going forward for USIS and for Equifax.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks and congrats once again on a strong quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. First question, I wanted to follow up again on talent solutions. Mark, you mentioned a few times now that you get an inquiry on one in 10 hires in the United States. I guess I\u2019m wondering what drives that number higher or the factors that could drive that higher? Is it primarily adding client relationships? Is it adding records and increasing hit rates? Or is there a component of that is dependent on employers themselves increasingly including income and employment verification screens in their onboarding process? Just trying to get a sense for drivers and maybe what falls within Equifax\u2019s control?\nMark Begor: Yes. Just to clarify, we don\u2019t do income verification. It\u2019s really employment history that we deliver there. And the one item we just wanted to point out there\u2019s a lot of runway in this. We have a large business. It\u2019s growing very rapidly in the talent solutions space as we continue to grow. And the drivers are really driven by first, it\u2019s our work history that we have. We have well over 0.5 billion total records, which is \u2013 think about that 5.5 jobs on the average American. So if you don\u2019t come to Equifax, you\u2019ve got to go manually to each of those companies in order to verify that. So the one-click instant kind of data element for Equifax is from Workforce Solutions is what\u2019s driving the growth. We\u2019re also productizing it. We\u2019re in the early stages of bringing new solutions to market that really solve our customers. In this case, it\u2019s either a background screener typically, but it could also be an individual company. But it\u2019s really how do we help them complete their job more quickly. And speed is really important. It always has been in the hiring process. You think about it, when someone\u2019s being hired for a new job, there\u2019s typically an open job there. And the hiring manager wants them to start quickly because there\u2019s work to be done, whether it\u2019s in a fast food restaurant or in a warehouse or a white-collar job, speed is very important. And if we\u2019re able to deliver that instant decision that shortens that time between offer of employment and start of work, it\u2019s really a big opportunity. So we\u2019re going to in 2022 bring new solutions that will likely be more job category based. Meaning we\u2019ll combine our work history, which is the foundation of that, meaning where you worked in the past, adding to educational data that we now have from National Student Clearinghouse. You have the criminal justice data that\u2019s typically used in a background screen. We can package that up in individual solutions. So it\u2019s really a very attractive growth opportunity for us that \u2013 and what really drove the solution is it starts with our big database. Having that 0.5 billion records in that work history gives us something that\u2019s incredibly unique that no one else has. And as we productize it with some of the other data elements, that will be a way to continue to grow. And we\u2019d like to do more M&A. Appriss is a big example of that. That brought the criminal justice incarceration data and also medical credentialing data. There\u2019s other data elements that we\u2019d like to either partner or add to. And of course, we mentioned a couple of times that we added the education data, which a lot of white-collar jobs, there\u2019s a requirement to verify where you go to school. And we can do that instantly now, and we\u2019ll productize that in combining the multiple data elements we have to help speed up the decisioning for our customers. So we see big growth potential here.\nJohn Gamble: What\u2019s happening in talent feels a lot like what happened in mortgage. If you look back over time in mortgage as the depth of the database increased substantially, our penetration went up very, very rapidly. And that\u2019s what drove a lot of growth. And as Mark described, the depth of TWN but also all these other data assets has now made our ability to respond with a more complete response and talent, which is obviously harder because there\u2019s more information there has improved dramatically over the past two to three years. And so that\u2019s why even before acquiring Appriss, we were talking about organic growth rates that were on the order of 100%, right? So we feel like we\u2019ve hit an inflection point in talent as well.\nAndrew Nicholas: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, just on international opportunity within Workforce Solutions. I know you asked \u2013 or a question was asked on that earlier. Just wanted to ask on kind of the mix between organic and inorganic growth there. I know to this point, it\u2019s been limited in terms of M&A, but is that part of the strategy? Or in the near to medium term, is that primarily an organic effort adding to kind of the UK and Australian capabilities? Thanks.\nMark Begor: It\u2019s definitely an organic focus. We\u2019d love to do some M&A, but there\u2019s really nothing out there. There are others that do this that we\u2019ve seen or found. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re leveraging our core technology. It\u2019s now cloud based. We also have relationships with multinationals, where we\u2019re doing their income employment verification here in the United States, and they have operations in other countries, so they want us to do it there. So that\u2019s kind of a base load that we can add to the data set organically. And then same thing with either leveraging our existing payroll partnerships here in the United States are working with new HR providers or payroll processors in those markets to add records. That\u2019s all the approach. So it\u2019s definitely organic.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question today. Just on that last question. I wanted to follow on with the international opportunity Workforce Solutions. Could you talk about the ability or necessity for you to sort of establish the same kind of strength of competitive moat you have in the U.S. in international markets to make this work? Or is it \u2013 is the environment sort of different in terms of how you need to build this?\nMark Begor: Well, our goal would be to have a similar competitive strength globally. We think that we have a lot of opportunities to do that. In many of our markets that we\u2019re in today, we\u2019re really the only one doing it. The couple of markets, I believe in the UK, Experian has talked about trying to do something like what we\u2019re doing but not in other markets. But we think we have a lot of competitive strengths. We\u2019ve got a technology stack that we\u2019ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars, and it\u2019s now cloud-based. We have the relationships that I talked about, and we have the know-how. So we\u2019re going to approach it. These take time to build. It takes time to build out the records and the record contributors. Remember, it took us over a decade to get Workforce Solutions to some level of scale in a big market like the United States. We\u2019ll likely be able to do that more quickly in these other markets because of the leverage we have in our technology and relationships in the marketplace. But it will definitely get built out. And we\u2019ll likely do other markets beyond the four that we\u2019re in. That will be a part of our growth strategy.\nSimon Clinch: Understood. Okay. And just as a follow-up, just going back to the mortgage market and the outlook you provided. I guess I\u2019m quite interested in what \u2013 maybe we could explore the levers you have to pull within your mortgage franchise in periods if the mortgage market were to be significantly weaker than you anticipated in your guidance? What are the things you can do to try and mitigate some of that downside within?\nMark Begor: Yes, sure. I would argue it already, at least our outlook is significantly weaker. We, a few months ago, thought it\u2019d be down 15 for 2022, and now we\u2019re down 21.5. That\u2019s meaningfully different than \u2013 I think it\u2019s quite powerful that Equifax has the momentum from the fourth quarter and the strength to offset that. We\u2019re very pleased with that. It shows the strength of the underlying business. We finished the fourth quarter quite strongly and had momentum coming into the year. We would look to continue to outperform going forward. We can\u2019t predict that at this stage because we are working with it down 21.5. But when you combine the down 21.5 with the decline in 2020, the mortgage market has moved substantially at least in our forecast towards the normalization. And then we think a lot, and I\u2019m sure you do too, about there\u2019s obviously the interest rate impact, which is primarily what factored into our reset of the mortgage market. But still offsetting that is a very sizable home price appreciation that we\u2019ve never seen in kind of the last 20 years that is a positive that we think could dampen at least further declines. It's hard to forecast what's going to happen with interest rates, but there's a lot of equity for consumers to access. And historically, when consumers have that ability to do cash-out refis, they will do that to do home improvement, to do vacations or other things they're going to do. So those are some of the elements that we think about. But just on our so-called updated guidance with mortgage down meaningfully from where we thought a few months ago and then the ability to offset that, we think that shows the strength and breadth of the underlying Equifax business.\nJohn Gamble: And we're like most companies, right? We run a broad group of risks and opportunities against our plans. And we wouldn't \u2013 we try to cover our risk across the entire company, right? And obviously, mortgage market is a risk that everyone is dealing with in our industry. And we work across Equifax to drive growth through more MDI, everything Mark's already talked about, to give us opportunities to cover additional risk.\nSimon Clinch: That's great. Thanks very much.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Simon.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci on for Hamzah. Just my first question, I know you guys already talked about some of the competition within EWS. But just, I guess, we're also hearing that new entrants are getting into that verification space. And just wanted to get your thoughts on, I guess, other competitors getting D1 certification and maybe then getting access to records at cheaper costs. Does that hold any water from your perspective? And then also, could you just talk about the consent mechanisms and how your business could be different from some of those new entrants again around consent?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think you're talking about versus what you would call our traditional competitors. I think you're talking more about some of the fintechs that are doing consented data kind of acquisitions. And we have solutions there, too. We have a partnership with Yodlee here in the United States. We have in other markets where we do consented data. There's a lot of friction involved in consented data. And it starts with you have to disrupt the process as a mortgage process or a credit card process or an auto process to ask the consumer to give their user ID and password for their bank account or their user ID and password for their payroll processor or their user ID and password for their employee benefits site at their company. And there's just a lot of fallout of consumers that aren't willing to do that. And we've just seen \u2013 it's certainly a niche that we're playing in, but it's one that we haven't seen real traction in. And then second is the fact that most of our customers, actually all of them, want instant verifications. Meaning just pinging our database and we send back the element, you don't have that friction and time. It could take hours, days, who knows dependent upon a digital process, to have that consent process take place. So that the instant verification is when we're in a workflow with our customer, meaning they're processing a mortgage, it gets to a certain point, they ping our database. And we deliver in milliseconds the verification of that. So I think it's a niche, but we really don't view them as competitors. As John pointed out earlier in the conversation, we still think about our biggest competitor being paper paystubs. That's the one that we continue to displace through instant. Again, there's friction with paper paystubs. Someone's got to go get them. There's a lot of fraud involved. We do that instant verification. You asked a question about access our records at a lower price. We've said many times, including the three new relationships we signed late in the year, that our relationships are exclusive. And exclusive means exclusive, meaning they're not accessible by others, which is the way we want to have those relationships kind of broadly and our partners do also. And then remember, 60% of our records come from individual companies. Those are very hard to access even through a consumer-consented process. And then I'll just end I think with your question about our consent process. As you know, we authenticate anyone who uses our data, and we require anyone who uses our data to follow Fair Credit Reporting Act processes where the individual, the consumer has to consent to access to their data. So no data is used without a consumer consenting in Workforce Solutions, of course, or in our credit file business. And that's inherent in the security and privacy processes that we have. And on top of that, we're credentialing or authenticating the company that's using the data, which is another element in ensuring that they follow the Fair Credit Reporting Act processes.\nMario Cortellacci: Understood. And then \u2013 so it sounds like these new fintech entrants are, like you say, more of a niche. But you guys are also, I guess, pursuing M&A opportunities. You did the Efficient Hire deal as well. And I guess just maybe you could talk about some of the other Workforce Solution, M&A deal that you could pursue? And do those new fintech entrants pose any competition that could help \u2013 that could drive up valuation for those deals?\nMark Begor: We don't think consumer-consented income and employment verification is an M&A target for us. We already have the ability to do it ourselves through other partnerships we have. And we view it as a niche, although we bought a consumer-consented business in the U.K. really because of open data. But that was one that really is more U.K.-centric. The other acquisitions we've done were really to strengthen our Employer Services or solutions business, where we provide compliance and regulatory services to HR managers. And that's a big business for us. It's one where they typically do that themselves and then outsource to someone like Equifax because we can do it with a higher degree of accuracy, privacy, efficiency. And that's W-2 management. It's I-9 verification. It's Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Employee Resource Credit, HCA, et cetera, those compliance services, I-9 verification. So we provide those services. And the three and now four acquisitions we've done with Efficient Hire that we did this week really strengthen us in those services elements to the HR manager. And then as a part of that solution, we also get TWN records. So it's another way for us to obtain records. So that's really our M&A focus there. There aren't a lot of those opportunities. Of course, we acquired another very attractive one this week in Efficient Hire and of course, three last year, as we pointed out. And then the other M&A focus for us is around our talent data hub. And that's the Appriss acquisition that we closed on in October, really attractive team and business that we brought in and brought in unique data at scale around incarceration and criminal justice and also medical credentialing data. And that's an area where we've been very clear that we'd like to do more M&A both in Employer Services, like Efficient Hire this week. We'd also like to do more M&A around data that's used in the hiring process like Appriss to build out the Equifax data hub.\nMario Cortellacci: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Begor: Hey, George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. As you think about your TWN database, approximately what portion of records there are covered by exclusive relationships with payroll processors and software providers? Just trying to get a sense for if a competitor were to try to replicate a portion of your scale in verification, could they quickly scale by also partnering with some of the payroll processors or software providers that you partner with?\nMark Begor: Yes. And George, I would add to the question maybe to complete it. Also the records we obtained directly through individual companies to kind of complete the equation. Now you can decide how you define those. We think of those as they're not exclusive, meaning individual companies which is 60% of our records, but they're very sticky to Equifax and our view is HR managers aren't going to share those records with two companies. And remember, we generally obtain individual company records because we're providing unique services to that HR manager, whether its unemployment claims, W-2 management, et cetera. With regards to the 40-plus percent from partners, we've been very clear that the vast, vast, I'll say vast twice, majority of those relationships are exclusive, and exclusive means exclusive there. And our intention is to have them all be exclusive over time. They're not all exclusive. And as you know, the relationships \u2013 all the relationships we've added in the last two years have been exclusive, including the three that we signed in December. And it's our intention for them to be exclusive as we sign them going forward. Does that help?\nGeorge Tong: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you. And then secondly, on margins, you're expecting up to 200 bps of margin expansion this year. And part of the flow-through on margin performance assumes reinvestments back into the business. So you talked a lot about new product innovation. Any other areas of investments, maybe specific areas around cloud or tech or infrastructure, et cetera, that you're putting money back into the business in order to support the growth?\nMark Begor: Yes. You're always making investments. I think you pointed out one is clearly our priority of ours is to continue to invest in product capabilities and resources, and new products require some investment. And of course, the 200 that you mentioned is net of those reinvestments that we're making this year, which we're continuing. And you know that we've been investing in product capabilities really for the last couple of years as we've been growing out that capability. Data analytics is another area that we're investing in, whether it's new data being contributed like the BNPL data that requires some investment or new contributors to TWN, rental data, et cetera. So that's a priority of ours as we're investing. We've got some commercial footprint investments that we're making in 2022, as you would expect, to continue to grow our commercial coverage, which is quite strong but are intended to make it stronger. And then, of course, we're continuing to complete the cloud transformation that underlies that investment and also receive the net benefits as we decommission some of our legacy infrastructure during 2022, which will be a positive for us and reflected in that 200 bps. Anything, John?\nJohn Gamble: No.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. I think one probably for John and one for you. Maybe just starting with John. Just in terms of the growth, there was an improvement in the expectations from the core non-mortgage from the 3Q to the 4Q, and it's very helpful in terms of maintaining the guidance. I wanted to ask, is there a part of the non-mortgage business that accelerated materially over the last 3.5 months or so? Or is it that we're kind of further into \u2013 closer to delivering on the 2022 numbers as you're already getting into the year? Or do you have more visibility? Do you feel more comfortable with that? Maybe you can comment on that first?\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So I think Mark talked about it, right? And we saw a real acceleration in record additions and product launches, right, at EWS specifically, right? So I think that's where we saw acceleration. Certainly, as you get closer to a period, right, you get more visibility, and that's part of it. But no, we really did see very nice improvement in growth as it relates to record additions and things that would be very beneficial in 2022 in Workforce Solutions that affects not only mortgage, but also all the other non-mortgage areas that we talked about and also those three substantial payroll providers that we indicated we signed that have not gone into production yet. So it gives us more comfort in the pace of new record addition as well, which also adds to new products, right? I mean, as we get deeper data sets, more history, new product launches accelerate. So all of those things work together to give us confidence, that we can that cover that 6.5% incremental decline in the mortgage market.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you. And then just overall, how are you guys thinking about inflation impact beyond like the very near term? The impact on the consumer in terms of higher cost of living for just basic staples and things like that, how do you think that's going to interact with kind of the view of the banks on credit and their willingness to lend? Right now, things are pretty loose. But if this kind of continues for the two, three more quarters, do you think that, that's going to have a longer-term impact in terms of just kind of the credit cycle on the consumer side and how that would impact that side of the business?\nMark Begor: I think you got to kind of layer another leg on that is how might it impact the economy. But as you know, while inflation is up, wages are up also. And job growth is up, people are working. During the last 24 months, they've strengthened broadly their credit position, meaning that a lot of the stimulus money has been used to make men pays and pay down credit card balances. So as we enter 2022, you've got a consumer that broadly is much better positioned than they were two years ago when we entered COVID. So I think that is a positive for our customers and a positive for us. The other thing that, again, going beyond the consumer is that a lot of our customers have experienced deleveraging, meaning customers paying down balances. So they're focused, and you've seen that in our FMS marketing revenue, they're focused on going after new customers that generally are more creditworthy. I think on a \u2013 over the last two years, credit scores have gone up something like 20 points on average because of the stimulus money and now increasingly, people are working. So that's how I would think about it that we're still in a pretty attractive environment. Now how long does inflation hold up? What happens \u2013 what does the Fed do with interest rates beyond what they've kind of indicated? I think those are all different factors. But my expectation is 2022 should be pretty good for the consumer, meaning they're strong and then good for us because our customers are going to be looking to grow their business with those consumers.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from George Gregory from BNP Paribas. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Gregory: Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little bit, please, to the verification non-mortgage trend, please. I think, Mark, you called out Q4 non-mortgage organic growth of around 30%. When I compare that to the second quarter, I think in the second quarter, it was total growth of around 65%. I don't think there was a great bit of nonorganic growth in that. When I look at the two year stack, that would seem to suggest that maybe a little bit of deceleration despite presumably the SSA contract, which has been ramping up into the fourth quarter and \u2013 the growth from the new records. Just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that sort of sequential trend? And if there was anything that would have held the fourth quarter back relative to that very strong second quarter, please? Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: Let me just \u2013 I know Mark jump in, but let me just give you some background rate. So the \u2013 so I think we're seeing very, very good growth in talent solutions and government, organic and inorganic. And part of what you're seeing is just a year-over-year effect. If you went back and looked at our results last year, you started seeing accelerated growth in talent solutions as you got into late third quarter and really fourth quarter of last year is my recollection. So I think part of what you're seeing is just a year-over-year effect. And it was \u2013 we started to see \u2013 really see the acceleration in the growth of some of those non-mortgage businesses. As records grew, it's kind of everything we talked about before. So we feel very good about the growth of non-mortgage across verification services and its direction and pace.\nMark Begor: I would add, these numbers are quite exceptional, right? Those kind of growth rates. And as we look at quarter \u2013 year-over-year kind of growth on a quarterly basis, they're growing over kind of exceptional performance. And just adding to it, clearly, outperforming the long-term framework we put in place in November for Workforce Solutions of 13 to 15, which is kind of how that \u2013 their piece of our 8 to 12 going forward, they're clearly outperforming that. And there's a lot of factors there, whether it's records, penetration, new product rollouts. They've been performing very, very strongly. And then we expect that to continue to have a very strong 2022 from workforce.\nGeorge Gregory: Thank you, John. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live.\nCraig Huber: Thank you. My first line of questions, I apologize if you already covered this, your sort of outlook for your business for credit cards, autos, and personal loans. I mean given the higher rates this year of inflation, what is sort of your outlook for those three segments for you guys?\nMark Begor: You're talking about the market growth versus our growth?\nCraig Huber: Why don't we talk on your growth, what I mean. Credit cards, auto loans. How do we think about that this year?\nMark Begor: Yes, we typically don't give actual segment growth like that as a part of our guidance, but let me just give some color about how we think about those verticals is that there's a couple of questions ago, I talked about cards and so on. We think card growth will be positive for us and for the industry in 2022 as card issuers are looking to rebuild their balance sheets after they come down. P loans is another one that should be positive in \u2013 for the industry in 2022. There was some real tightening in 2020 as we went into COVID. That started to relax as we got into the mid parts of 2021. So that should be a benefit. Auto is broadly strong from a consumer demand standpoint, but you've got the supply chain issues, meaning there aren't available autos, which have dampened some of that. Whether those supply chain issue's sorted out is hard to see, not my strength. But there's underlying consumer demand there that's quite strong.\nJohn Gamble: The only thing we did say is in our 2022 guidance for USIS non-mortgage, which includes more than the three segments you just referenced, it includes identity and fraud. It includes commercial and some other segments, we had said basically high single digits, up 6% to 8%. So consistent with our long-term framework.\nCraig Huber: And my follow-up question, you guys have obviously talked a lot about new businesses you guys keep rolling out here to your credit and stuff. How do you think about margins for those businesses when you roll them out? Are they almost at the segment level pretty soon, given your infrastructure you have in place, the data you already have? Or said differently, how long does it generally take when you roll out new products for it to get to the segment level margins? And how should we think about?\nMark Begor: Generally, we think about new products is generally being quite accretive to our margins because they're generally \u2013 think about our Vitality Index of $500 million of growth over the last three years. Those are generally incremental revenue, and they have high incremental margins. So that's kind of how we think about it. So they deliver margin pretty quickly that are accretive to our historical growth rates. And that's why we're so focused on new products because they drive our top line and then the incremental nature of that growth is expanding our margins.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you guys.\nMark Begor: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Dorian for any further or closing comments.\nDorian Hare: Thank you for joining today's call. We look forward to engaging with you further in meetings and conferences during the quarter. And of course, we look forward to convening again when we report our Q1 earnings in April. This does conclude the call.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2022, I'll share a little more detail on 4Q 2021. In 4Q 2021, items below operating income, specifically net interest and other expenses and effective tax rate, came in combined slightly weaker than expected. Net interest and other expense was slightly weaker than we expected, and our 22% effective tax rate was very close to the guidance we provided. As Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in as expected in the fourth quarter at 32.2%. The factors resulting in the year-to-year decline were considered in the guidance we shared in October. Specifically, two-thirds of the decline was driven by the treatment of cloud technology transformation costs in 2021, including them in our adjusted results. Remaining one-third of the decline is driven by the items Mark discussed earlier, specifically the impact on Workforce Solutions and USIS of the acquisitions completed in 2021 and the increased royalty costs. As Mark discussed, regarding the acquisitions, we expect to deliver synergies that will support higher EBITDA margins as we move through 2022 and 2023. And the higher royalties at Workforce Solutions were partially driven by cost related to the start-up of the significant new payroll partners launched in the second half of 2021. As I will discuss in detail in a moment, we expect 1Q 2022 Workforce Solutions margins to return to exceed 55% and overall, Equifax EBITDA margins to return to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially. Let's start with more detail on our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market. As shown on Slide 11, in 2022, we are expecting a 21.5% year-to-year decline in the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries. With a more rapid increase in the U.S. mortgage market rates we have seen in the first quarter, reaching 3.6% last week, consistent with the increase in the U.S. 10-year and reduced Fed purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, we expect refinancing activity to drop more substantially beginning as early as late in the first quarter. 2022 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries would need to decline an additional just under 5% from 2021 levels to return to average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period. The left side of Slide 12 provides perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would be beneficial. We have expanded this chart from versions we shared in prior quarters to provide greater perspective on the full in-the-money population of mortgages. As we've discussed in prior quarters, in rising mortgage rate environments, refinancings will often occur with lower levels of rate benefit. This is increasingly true during periods of high home price appreciation as homeowners look to borrow against their increasing levels of home equity. Looking at data from late January, at current mortgage rate levels, there are over 16 million homes that would benefit from a refinancing. Of this amount, about 7.8 million mortgages that have a loan to value at 80% or below and for which the borrower has a 660 or above credit score would see their mortgage rate decline by 75 basis points or more. There's an additional 5.3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would see their mortgage rate decline by 25 basis points to 75 basis points. And there are another just over 3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would benefit by up to 25 basis points from refinancing. Although down significantly from the levels we saw earlier in 2021 when mortgage rates were around 3%, this remains a significant population similar to the levels we saw in 2009 and about 15% below what we saw in 2016. For perspective, per Black Knight data during 4Q 2021, over 35% of refinancings were by borrowers benefiting by a rate decrease of less than 75 basis points. Based upon our most recent data from July 2021, mortgage refinancings were just about 600,000 per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 12, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. Our 2022 assumption for U.S. mortgage credit inquiries is that we will see these high levels of purchase mortgage financings continue at levels slightly above the levels we saw in 2021. And that refinancings will decline significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021. Slide 13 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8.4% constant currency and 7.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.3 billion. Using current FX rates, FX is a negative impact on 2022 growth of just over 0.8%, about 0.2 percentage points weaker than we discussed in October. Total revenue of $5.3 billion is up almost 8% from 2021 and in line with the framework we provided in October. The 21.5% more \u2013 decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 6.6%, about 200 basis points or just over $100 million more negative than the levels we discussed in October. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business, total headwinds to 2022 revenue growth are about 8 percentage points. Core organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis is anticipated to be over 13%. This is almost 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October with this improvement driven by Workforce Solutions through the much stronger record growth and accelerating NPI and strong pricing driving higher average unit revenues that Mark discussed earlier. Non-mortgage organic growth is driving over 7% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. USIS non-mortgage and international are also expected to drive core growth. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining almost 6% of the core \u2013 of the organic core growth. This is driven by strong outperformance in Workforce Solutions. The acquisitions completed in 2021, plus the Efficient Hire acquisition closed earlier this week, are expected to contribute about 3.2 percentage points of growth to 2022. Core revenue growth, excluding FX, of almost 16.5% is well above our long-term framework and 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October due to the stronger core organic growth in Workforce Solutions and our good start to the year and acquisitions. This stronger core revenue growth drives just over $100 million in revenue benefit, offsetting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Slide 14 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 13% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.65 per share. This is in line with the midpoint of the 2022 framework we shared in October. EBITDA margins are still expected to increase in the 175 to 200 basis point range we discussed in October. Revenue growth of 7.6% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% would deliver about 10% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of 175 basis points to 200 basis points is expected to drive 9% growth in adjusted EPS. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $40 million in 2022, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects increased debt from the 2021 acquisitions and the higher short-term interest rates I've referenced. Interest rates \u2013 the interest expense is higher than our expectation in October by about $7 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.5% does not assume any changes to the U.S. federal tax rate. Slide 15 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022. We anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 16%, reflecting organic growth of 13% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021 plus Efficient Hire. Slide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. 2022 revenue of between $5.25 billion and $5.35 billion reflects growth of about 6.6% to 8.7% versus 2021, including a 0.8% negative impact from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 3.2%. EWS is expected to deliver over 15% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be up from the 54.6% delivered in 2021. USIS revenue is expected to be about flat, reflecting the 21.5% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be slightly down from the 39.9% delivered in 2021. Combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to be down slightly with mortgage outperformance approaching 20%. And International revenues expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 7% to 9%. International EBITDA margins are expected to expand by over 175 basis points. 2022 adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $8.80 per share is up 11.2% to 15.2% from 2021. Given the greater decline of the U.S. mortgage market we discussed earlier, we believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. The 175 to 200 basis point improvement in our 2022 EBITDA margin from the 33.9% in 2021 is principally driven by the following main factors. Workforce Solutions revenue growth of over 15% with margins at or above their current 54.6% drives a benefit to overall Equifax EBITDA margins of over 150 basis points. Corporate expense as a percentage of revenue is declining year-to-year on higher overall Equifax revenue, improving overall Equifax EBITDA margin by on the order of 100 basis points. The drivers of the lower spend are principally lower corporate technology transformation expense and lower variable comp. International margin expansion of over 175 basis points also drives about 25 basis points in overall Equifax EBITDA margin. These are partially offset by the negative impact on overall Equifax EBITDA margins of flat USIS revenue in 2022 due to the very weak mortgage market. Slide 17 provides our guidance for 1Q 2022. We are starting 2022 strong, better than previously expected. We expect revenue in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.34 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 8.8% to 10.5%, including a 1.2% negative impact from FX. The U.S. mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries is expected to be down approximately 24%. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 5.2%. 1Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially. The improvement is driven by the same two factors we discussed driving the improvement in our full year 2022 EBITDA margins. Looking at the business units in the first quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue is expected to be up over 25% year-to-year, and EBITDA margins are expected to be over 55% driven by significant growth in Verifier and seasonally strong Workforce Analytics revenue. Workforce Solutions will represent about 47% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenues expected to be down 3% to 4% year-to-year driven by the 24% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in non-mortgage expected to be up mid-single-digit percentage. EBITDA margins will be down slightly sequentially from 4Q 2021 due to the weak mortgage market. International revenue is expected to be up about 8% year-to-year in constant currency. And EBITDA margins are expected to be down about 100 basis points year-to-year. The decline in EBITDA margin is driven by increased cost in Canada as we migrate our Canadian credit exchange to be in production on data fabric in the quarter and some negative mix from growth in debt management. As I just indicated, full year EBITDA margins for International should increase 175 basis points year-to-year. Corporate expense will decline year-to-year, benefiting overall Equifax EBITDA margins. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q 2022 to be $2.08 to $2.18 per share compared to the 1Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.97 per share. Now let's turn to Slide 18. At our Investor Day in November, we discussed the strong earnings and cash flow that can be generated by 2025 by Equifax executing our new long-term financial framework. We also shared a scenario for you to consider that assuming the U.S. mortgage market normalizes by 2025 to the average levels we saw over 2015 to 2019 and we deliver revenue growth just above the midpoint of our 8% to 12% framework growth rate, revenue in 2025 could be about $7 billion. And continuing to execute our cloud data and tech transformation at these revenue levels could deliver 39% EBITDA margins by 2025. Beyond 2025, we expect to see revenue expansion of 8% to 12% and deliver margin expansion of, on average, 50 basis points per year, reflecting our significant operating leverage and high variable margins. As shown on Slide 19, free cash flow accelerated significantly in 2021, reaching $866 million and 92% of adjusted net income. In 2022, excluding the $345 million payment on the U.S. consumer class action settlement made in January, free cash flow will exceed $1 billion and 95% of adjusted net income. As we discussed in November at our Investor Day, to the extent, we are able to deliver revenue growth and EBITDA margins I just referenced in 2025, we could generate $2.7 billion of EBITDA, $12.75 in adjusted EPS and $1.6 billion in free cash flow, almost double the $866 million that we delivered in 2021. The substantial increase in free cash flow creates significant capacity for M&A and also for a return of capital to shareholders through cash generation and increased debt capacity. Now I'd like to turn it back to Mark. We also look closely at run rates. So really through January through early February, the run rates are consistent with what we've talked about in our first quarter \u2013 the first quarter estimate down 24% wasn't changed that really materially from the estimate we gave in October. So we look closely at those run rates. We think they've been relatively predictive. And we're also, as Mark said, we try to be very open about what we've assumed. So that if you have a different view on mortgage, at least you'll have a very good view as to what we put into our numbers, and you can obviously act accordingly. Yes. The big \u2013 one of the biggest factors would be the fact that we did the large acquisitions in the second half of this year. So you wrap around the addition of that revenue as you get into the third quarter, but principally the fourth quarter. But overall, we expect Workforce Solutions to continue to perform extremely well and drive very high organic growth throughout the year. So, I don't have a specific forecast for mortgage rates, right? What we do is, I think we have an earlier question, right? We look at the current forecasts that are out there for the 10-year. And we try to consider those in the decisions we make, right? So right now, I think if you took a look at the Bloomberg average, you'd see an expectation that we're going to see the 10-year go up, say, somewhere between 35 basis points and 50 basis points. So, we make an assumption that probably you're looking at mortgage rates moving in a similar direction. To be fair, as Mark said, forecasting the mortgage market, incredibly hard and actually tying the movement in the mortgage market to the 10-year, also incredibly hard. But that's basically what we've assumed in the practice. So I can get \u2013 the first one I have, it's 27%. I think we did give in the script some detail on mortgage revenue for EWS and USIS, specifically. But for Equifax, fourth quarter mortgage was 27% of total revenue. And for the full year, it was 32%. And Andrew, just as an FYI, a little later today, we'll post the supplemental deck. And in that will be the updated pie charts that show revenue by segment for Equifax in each of the business units. Yes, sir. Sure. I can start, and I'm sure Mark will jump in, right? So, we had nonmortgage organic growth of about 6%. We had total growth of about 12%, right? I think as Mark mentioned in the script, we're seeing very good growth continues in insurance. We said up double digits, up high single digits in commercial, high single digits in identity and fraud. So again, we think very good performance. Absolutely, right. So with FI, obviously, we saw very strong growth, as Mark said, in FMS, which we think is going to translate into strengthening growth as we go through all of 2022. We've also had, as Mark mentioned in his comments, really nice new business wins in USIS, a lot of that around FI. And then we've had actually some several significant wins with larger FIs that should ramp as we go through 2022. So, we think we're going to see nice increases on organic growth as we move through 2022, both in total organic growth, but organic growth specifically to FIs. And as we look at identity and fraud, we saw really nice growth in, let's call it, our new identity and fraud products, our identity foundry and really Kount-based products. As we got into the fourth quarter, growth there was well over 20%. We are going through a little bit of a transition. We're transitioning off some of our older legacy based products under those new products. So you see some choppy growth, although up high single digit, certainly isn't bad. And \u2013 but we're seeing very good growth in the Kount-based products and the products that are based on the new identity foundry that we've talked to you about in the past, which is all built on data fabric. So, we feel like the 6% that we talked about in organic in the fourth quarter was relatively good performance. As we indicated, it's probably going to be about similar to that in the first, but we're expecting to see nice improvement as we go through next year. Yes. And we indicated they'll step back to 55% in the first quarter, right? So, I mean \u2013 so we feel very good about the fact that these each of those three factors that Mark talked about, we can address, and we will address them very quickly. And they were all substantial, right? So, you can think about them all being relatively consistent in size and significant to what affected us year-on-year, but we expect to be back at 55% in the first quarter. The other thing I'd just add is that if you think about the markets we're addressing, our penetration in those markets still has a long way to run, right? As Mark mentioned in his comments on mortgage, which is where we're the most highly penetrated, it's still just over 60%. And when you go into talent solutions and government, and it's important to remember in both of those segments, right, it's not just current record, it's depth of records, so that's extremely important, right? History makes an extremely \u2013 is extremely important in both our government services and importantly, our talent solutions businesses. There, our penetration is, in most cases, well under 25%, right, and growing very rapidly. And the reason it's growing rapidly again is because of the depth of records we're now able to provide, which we couldn't provide two-years ago. So we think there's huge opportunity in those nonmortgage businesses to substantially grow our share. And right now, we're competing against, in many cases, pay stubs or more manual processes to collect the information. So we feel very, very good about the opportunities to grow within the market segment by basically providing instant verifications within those market segments where they're not available today. What's happening in talent feels a lot like what happened in mortgage. If you look back over time in mortgage as the depth of the database increased substantially, our penetration went up very, very rapidly. And that's what drove a lot of growth. And as Mark described, the depth of TWN but also all these other data assets has now made our ability to respond with a more complete response and talent, which is obviously harder because there's more information there has improved dramatically over the past two to three years. And so that's why even before acquiring Appriss, we were talking about organic growth rates that were on the order of 100%, right? So we feel like we've hit an inflection point in talent as well. And we're like most companies, right? We run a broad group of risks and opportunities against our plans. And we wouldn't \u2013 we try to cover our risk across the entire company, right? And obviously, mortgage market is a risk that everyone is dealing with in our industry. And we work across Equifax to drive growth through more MDI, everything Mark's already talked about, to give us opportunities to cover additional risk. No. Sure. So I think Mark talked about it, right? And we saw a real acceleration in record additions and product launches, right, at EWS specifically, right? So I think that's where we saw acceleration. Certainly, as you get closer to a period, right, you get more visibility, and that's part of it. But no, we really did see very nice improvement in growth as it relates to record additions and things that would be very beneficial in 2022 in Workforce Solutions that affects not only mortgage, but also all the other non-mortgage areas that we talked about and also those three substantial payroll providers that we indicated we signed that have not gone into production yet. So it gives us more comfort in the pace of new record addition as well, which also adds to new products, right? I mean, as we get deeper data sets, more history, new product launches accelerate. So all of those things work together to give us confidence, that we can that cover that 6.5% incremental decline in the mortgage market. Let me just \u2013 I know Mark jump in, but let me just give you some background rate. So the \u2013 so I think we're seeing very, very good growth in talent solutions and government, organic and inorganic. And part of what you're seeing is just a year-over-year effect. If you went back and looked at our results last year, you started seeing accelerated growth in talent solutions as you got into late third quarter and really fourth quarter of last year is my recollection. So I think part of what you're seeing is just a year-over-year effect. And it was \u2013 we started to see \u2013 really see the acceleration in the growth of some of those non-mortgage businesses. As records grew, it's kind of everything we talked about before. So we feel very good about the growth of non-mortgage across verification services and its direction and pace. The only thing we did say is in our 2022 guidance for USIS non-mortgage, which includes more than the three segments you just referenced, it includes identity and fraud. It includes commercial and some other segments, we had said basically high single digits, up 6% to 8%. So consistent with our long-term framework."

            "content": "Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. Before I get to our strong fourth quarter results, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the tremendous progress and outstanding results we delivered last year. As shown on Slide 4, our financial performance in 2021 was very strong and built off an equally strong 2020. Revenue was up 19% with organic local currency revenue growth of 15% and core non-market growth of 22%, all well above our new 8% to 12% long-term financial framework, reflecting the strength of the new Equifax growth model. Adjusted EPS at $7.64 was up 10% and adjusted for the change in treatment of transformation expenses in 2021 was up a strong 24%. This is truly an outstanding year, substantially stronger than we expected when we started 2021 and despite a U.S. mortgage market that was down more than we expected at 7.5%. We delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and 2 years of strong above-market performance with 17% growth in 2020 and 19% growth last year. Workforce Solutions delivered a milestone with revenue over $2 billion for the first time, up 39% with organic revenue growth of 34% and the business is up 2x from their 2019 revenue of $915 million. This was again driven by very strong performance in Verification Services with revenue up 46% and organic revenue growth of 41%. Active records on the work number grew by a very strong 22 million records or 19% to 136 million records at the end of the year. Mortgage revenue was up 41%, almost 50 percentage points stronger than the underlying market. And non-mortgage revenue in Verification Services had organic growth of 41% driven by talent solutions with organic growth of over 100%. USIS also had a strong year. Non-mortgage revenue was up 16% with organic growth of 10%. Total revenue was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2% despite the 7.5% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. In total, our U.S. businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 80% of Equifax revenue, delivered 20% total and 17% organic growth with non-mortgage revenue growth of over 21% total and 15% organic, again, all well above our new long-term framework of 8% to 12%. International also delivered a milestone in 2021 with their first year of revenues over $1 billion. Revenue grew 10% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America. In 2021, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 5, grew a very strong 22% with fourth quarter revenue growth also a very strong 18%, both substantially above the new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. Core organic revenue growth in 2021 was 18% and 13% in the fourth quarter, again, above our long-term framework. Non-mortgage organic growth in Workforce Solutions and USIS and growth in International drove almost 9% core organic revenue growth in 2021 and over 8% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX. Mortgage outperformance, primarily in EWS, drove the remaining 9% in 2021 and 5% in fourth quarter, respectively, of core organic revenue growth. As we move through 2022 and 2023, we expect to see continued strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the \u2013 from the strength of Workforce Solutions, the new Equifax Cloud and accelerated NPIs. And we expect continued strong non-mortgage performance from both organic growth and acquisitions as well as continued strong mortgage outperformance from Workforce Solutions. Slide 6 covers our strong fourth quarter performance. Revenue at $1.25 billion was up 12% with organic constant currency growth of 6.6% despite a decline in the U.S. mortgage market of 21%, which was off a strong 23% growth a year ago in the fourth quarter. As I discussed earlier, core revenue growth was a very strong 18% in the quarter with core organic growth of 13% again driven by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions. Fourth quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $403 million, slightly higher than expected. EBITDA margins of 32.2% were consistent with our expectations. The decline in margins versus last year was primarily due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $47 million in our adjusted results in the fourth quarter, which were excluded last year. Adjusting for these costs, our margins were 35.9%. John will provide more \u2013 a more detailed discussion on our 2022 margins in a few minutes and the drivers of our up to 200 basis point margin expansion in 2022 that we're targeting. Adjusted EPS of $1.84 per share was above the high-end of our guidance range. As expected, adjusted EPS was down from last year and reflected the inclusion of cloud transformation costs of $47 million or $0.30 a share in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year. Excluding these costs, adjusted EPS would have been up 7.1%, about consistent with our organic revenue growth. The acquisitions completed in 2021 were slightly accretive to adjusted EPS. And we expect substantial acceleration and accretion in 2022 and 2023 from the acquisitions as we complete the integrations. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $532 million with reported revenue growth of 29% and organic revenue growth of 17%. And this, of course, was delivered despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market in the fourth quarter and against very strong 61% revenue growth that they delivered last year in the fourth quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up almost 50% with organic non-mortgage revenue up about 25%. Included in Workforce Solutions fourth quarter results is about $7 million from ID Watchdog, which was previously a part of GCS and is now part of Employer Services business in EWS. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their twin income and employment data was clear again in the fourth quarter. EWS is clearly our fastest-growing business and powering our results. Verification Services revenue in the quarter was $427 million, up 29%, with organic growth of almost 17%. The revenue from our Appriss Insights acquisition is included in Verification Services. Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 6% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market with the Workforce Solutions outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products. Verification Services nonmortgage revenue represented just over half of total Verification Services revenue in the quarter. Total Verifier non-mortgage revenue was up almost 65%, reflecting strong 30% organic revenue growth plus the addition of Appriss Insights in October. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth of 30% was very strong, particularly over last year's fourth quarter, which was up 15%. Our government vertical with the addition of Appriss Insights provides a broad set of solutions to federal, state and local governments. These include solutions in support of government assistance programs, including food and rental support as well as the VINE victims notification service and other law enforcement solutions acquired as a part of Appriss Insights. The government vertical represented about 40% of total non-mortgage verification revenue in the quarter and delivered 25% total and over 15% organic revenue growth. Organic growth was driven by the continued growth in the work number and the continued expansion of state benefit programs. We also continue to see a ramp in volume from our new Social Security Administration contract that went live last quarter. And we expect to see significant growth in volume as we move towards run rate levels through 2022. Talent solutions, which provides income, employment, educational background and medical certification verifications, incarceration, criminal background, medical sanctions and other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS Data Hub, had another outstanding quarter. The addition of Appriss Insights in October, educational information from the National Student Clearinghouse in August and significant growth in the work number during the quarter, substantially expanded the EWS Data Hub, supporting continued customer expansion and new products. Total talent solutions revenue represented about 40% of Verifier nonmortgage revenue in the quarter with total growth of almost 100% and organic growth of 50%. As you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of that hiring process. We've seen both the number and the frequency of job changes increasing in the current environment. Our ongoing addition of new data assets to the EWS Data Hub will enhance new product growth in this important vertical in the future. The nonmortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well, up over 50% in the quarter. Debt management with nonmortgage consumer lending grew over 30% in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was up 28% in the quarter. And as you know, this is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers new twin records. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $54 million, up slightly from last year but down over 15% sequentially as we expected. Substantial declines in UC revenue in the quarter were offset by growth in ERC revenue, which, as a reminder, is our business that supports employers obtaining federal employee retention credits. Employer Services non-UC and non-ERC businesses had revenue of about $50 million, up 60% versus last year with organic revenue growth of about 35%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere solution, continued to show very strong growth, up over 50%. In the fourth quarter, our I-9 business made up about 40% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. In August, we acquired Health e(fx), which provides services to employers to help them ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act, which we are now combining with our existing workforce analytics business. This combined workforce analytics business represented about 25% of employer non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6% for 2021 and have been consistently in the mid-50s over the past two years. As John will discuss later, we expect Workforce Solutions margins to be at or above the 54.6% delivered in 2021 in both the first quarter and in 2022. As we expected, fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA margins in Workforce were 48.4% and were lower than our historic levels due to three factors. First, Appriss Insights and Health e(fx) negatively impacted margins. As expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. Second, in the fourth quarter, EWS ramped one major and several smaller payroll processor record contributions to our Verifier database as well as integrated other data contributors to the data hub. As we discussed in the past, in the quarters where this occurs, we incur incremental costs related to boarding and ramping the new contributors. And as we've indicated, fourth quarter saw substantial new record additions, and these in-period costs impacted margins in the quarter. And third, our cloud transformation cost negatively impacted margins by about 200 basis points. Workforce substantially completed the Verifier cloud-native migration in the fourth quarter, so these costs will decline substantially going forward. We remain confident that Workforce Solutions margins will recover in 2022 and be above the 54.6% we saw in 2021. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding year and are well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue their above-market growth. EWS is our fastest-growing and highest-margin business. USIS had revenue of $434 million, which was about flat with the fourth quarter with the mortgage market down significantly and it includes $47 million of USIS consumer revenue previously part of GCS, which was just about flat. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $126 million was down 18% in the quarter, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, about consistent with the expectations we shared in October. Outperformance versus the overall market was driven by stronger growth in mortgage solutions, including growth in services. Non-mortgage non-consumer solutions revenue of $262 million grew almost 12% with organic revenue growth of almost 6%. In the fourth quarter, insurance continued to deliver double-digit growth. Commercial, and identity and fraud were up single digits and FI, auto and telco were up low to mid-single digits. And direct-to-consumer increased over 10% in the quarter. For the full year, non-mortgage non-consumer solutions revenue was up a strong 16% with organic growth in this category of about 10%. For 2021, USIS delivered double-digit organic growth across FI, insurance, identity and fraud and D2C as well as mid- to high single-digit growth in commercial and auto and telco declined slightly. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line and batch business, had revenue of about $79 million, our highest quarterly revenue in history. This was up about 14% in the quarter. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20%. Both risk and ID, and fraud revenue were up about 10%. In 2021, marketing-related revenue, which grew more than 20% in each quarter, represented about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20 and risk decisioning above 30. The USIS commercial team delivered record wins, up over 25% versus last year and 5% sequentially in the fourth quarter. Their new deal pipeline remains very strong with overall pipe slightly higher than the third quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.4% in the quarter, up over 50 basis points sequentially from third quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter in 2020 was principally driven by twofactors. First, the acquisitions of Kount and Teletrack negatively impacted margins in the period. As expected, initial margins for these acquisitions are dilutive to USIS. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. And second, cloud transformation costs negatively impacted margins by almost 75 basis points. As with EWS, these costs are expected to decline as we move through 2022. In 2022, we expect USIS margins to be flat to slightly below the almost 40% level we delivered in 2021. International revenue of $288 million was up 6% and over 7.5% sequentially on a local currency basis. Included in International in the fourth quarter was almost $25 million of consumer solutions revenue in Canada and the UK that was formerly part of GCS, which was down about 6% versus last year. The lower growth in the consumer revenue in the fourth quarter was in Europe, which we expect to recover to high single-digit growth in the first quarter. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed very well in the quarter with revenue of $88 million, up about 9% in local currency. Australia and New Zealand consumer revenue remained flat versus last year. Our ANZ commercial business combined online and off-line revenue was up 9% in the quarter. And our HR verifications business in Australia was up a strong 37%. European revenues of $90 million were about flat in local currency in the quarter, but up over 20% sequentially. As a reminder, Europe had a very strong baseline from the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by the reactivation of debt services in the UK and large electronic notifications volume in Spain, a consequence of a change in legislation. Our European credit reporting business, which is about two thirds of European revenue, was impacted by COVID lockdowns in the UK and up about 2%. Commercial data off-line and analytics and scores saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And consumer credit reporting offerings grew high single digit as lockdown measures eased. Included in the UK credit reporting business was $7 million from consumer solutions. Our European debt management business revenue was up over 30% sequentially but down 5% versus a very strong fourth quarter 2020. In December, Equifax was awarded a new five-year extension of the UK government debt resolutions tender, a debt collections contract with an estimated contract value of $136 million with an incremental $90 million upside from sales of analytics and other CRA-related solutions. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the UK government over the past several quarters that we expect should deliver strong growth in debt management revenue in the first half of 2022 for our UK business. Canada delivered revenue of $64 million in the quarter, up 6% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 4%. Canada experienced strong growth in analytics and decisioning solutions with strong growth in fintech and traditional FI, while supply issues continue to impact their auto business. Included in Canada revenue is $16 million of consumer solutions revenue. Latin American revenues of $45 million were up a strong 15% in the quarter in local currency, which was their fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Strong new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across our Latin American region. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 29.9% were up 320 basis points sequentially mainly due to stronger revenue and positive mix. Margins were down year-to-year due to costs related to the cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and the inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs, which were being excluded in 2020. Excluding these costs, margins were down slightly versus last year. Turning to Slide 7, Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding performance and is clearly our strongest and fastest-growing and most valuable business. As mentioned earlier, core revenue growth was up 38% in the quarter and 42% for the year with core organic revenue growth of 28% in the quarter and 38% for the full year of 2021. These strong results were driven by the uniqueness of our TWN income and employment data, the scale of the TWN database and continued expansion of new products and markets driven by outstanding consistent execution by Rudy and his team. 2021 growth of 39% is well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework, which we shared with you in November and of course, is on top of 51% delivered \u2013 growth delivered in 2020. EWS' ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by three factors. First, growing the work number TWN database. At the end of the fourth quarter, TWN reached 136 million active records, an increase of 19% or 22 million records from a year ago and included 105 million unique individuals, which is almost 70% of U.S. nonfarm payroll. This increase in records makes our TWN database more valuable to our customers from both higher hit rates and more complete employment histories. We are now receiving records every pay period from 2.5 million companies, up from 1 million companies when we started 2021 and 27,000 contributors a short two-plus years ago. Our strong momentum continued during the fourth quarter with the signing of three new exclusive agreements with major payroll processors that we expect to implement during 2022. As a reminder, almost 55% of our records are contributed directly by employers where EWS provides comprehensive employer services like UC claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, ERC, ACA and other HR and compliance solutions. Our acquisitions of HIREtech, i2verify, Health e(fx) and now Efficient Hire, which we announced earlier this week, strengthen our ability to deliver these employer services both directly and through relationships with payroll processors and HR software companies, and of course, expand our TWN database. We still have substantial room to grow our TWN income and employment database and expect to continue to add new direct contributors as well as the additional \u2013 addition of payroll processors and software partners on an exclusive basis to TWN in 2022. Beyond just the \u2013 just under 50 million nonfarm payroll records not yet in the TWN database, we've expanded our focus to data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the United States marketplace to further broaden and strengthen the TWN database. You probably saw we also announced an expansion of our global footprint for Workforce Solutions with the launch of our new UK income and employment verification platform. This adds to our existing Australia, Canada and India EWS business launches outside the United States. We've got plenty of room to grow TWN. Second growth lever for Workforce Solutions is increasing average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing our existing products to value, recognizing the depth of information TWN allows us to deliver to customers. Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And the third growth lever is by increasing penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets and new verticals. For example, we continue to increase our penetration of the mortgage market. Workforce Solutions received an inquiry for over 60% of combined mortgages, up from 55% in early 2020. We have significant runway to grow penetration in the mortgage vertical. We are also in the early stages of penetrating the talent market where today, we receive inquiries in about one in 10 hires in the United States, plenty of room for growth. Growing system-to-system integration is another key growth lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of pulls per transaction. During the quarter, about 76% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system to system, up over 2x from the 32% in 2019, another great growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Workforce Solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above-market and above-Equifax growth rates and is highly accretive margins that we expect to power workforce \u2013 power Equifax growth in the future. Slide 8 highlights core mortgage revenue growth performance of our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Mortgage revenue grew 19% in 2021 in a down 7.5% market and off 80% revenue growth in 2020. Our combined U.S. B2B businesses outperformed the market \u2013 the mortgage market by 28 points in 2021 and 16 points in the fourth quarter. This was driven by Workforce Solutions as they outperformed the underlying mortgage market by 51 points for the year and 27 points in the fourth quarter. John will cover our updated mortgage market outlook in a few minutes. We've reduced our outlook \u2013 mortgage outlook for 2021 \u2013 2022 to down 21.5% versus our prior view of down 15%, reflecting the likely impact of higher interest rates. We expect to offset a large portion of that impact with stronger growth \u2013 stronger core mortgage revenue growth from EWS, from the strong TWN record additions, new products, system-to-system integrations and penetration. We now expect EWS will outperform the U.S. mortgage market by approximately 30 points, up 700 basis points from our prior view and our combined U.S. B2B businesses of USIS and EWS to outperform the U.S. mortgage market by an amount approaching 20 points, which is up 400 basis points from our prior view. 2021 was a very strong year for new product innovation and a key priority of our team. As shown on Slide 9, we delivered a record 151 new products, up from 134 last year \u2013 I'm sorry, in 2020 and a Vitality Index of just under 9%, which is our highest vitality that we've achieved since 2018 and stronger than our 8% expectations when we started 2021. Our pace accelerated in the fourth quarter as we delivered 36 new products, positioning us well for 2022. In the fourth quarter, we launched significant new products we expect to drive growth in 2022 and beyond. The EWS talent report education product provides all available postsecondary degrees instantly sourced from the National Student Clearinghouse via an exclusive Equifax ordering experience using a single SSN number input. This enhanced offering helps deliver a more efficient hiring process and the ability to make better informed hiring decisions with a holistic candidate view. Workforce Solutions' priority next-day VOE and priority two-day VOE products are our quick and seamless manual solutions that deliver verification of employment on the next business day or second business day following a client's request. These solutions are available to both our web and integrated clients and provide complete coverage when combined with our instant verification of employment solutions from TWN. The myEquifax Allow Access product, launched by USIS, allows consumers to be notified instantly when they submit an application to a participating lender that their file is frozen and with a few easy steps can unlock their files so their loan can be processed. And this is a win-win for both the lender and the consumer. The Spending Power and Affluence Index products, also launched by US, were introduced as new marketing targeting tools that utilize proprietary data to identify customers and prospects with the greatest capacity to spend on new products or services. Spending Power estimates dollars available to spend after accounting for cost of living expenses while the Affluence Index provides a score that differentiates households based on spending power and credit utilization. And then last, we continue to help our clients automate smarter digital customer acquisition decisions by enabling access to new data sources through the ID Matrix Enhancements in Australia, our clients can simultaneously identify previously undetected risk based on e-mail metadata and assess financial eligibility for a loan based on Australian residency status. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capability to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2022 of over 10%, which equates to over $500 million of revenue in 2022 from new products introduced in the past three years. The 10% vitality is up over 100 basis points from our strong 2021 new product results and aligns with our new long-term growth framework we provided at our Investor Day in November. Turning to Slide 10. USIS is leading the industry in offering flexible structure for BNPL providers to report consumer credit data onto the Equifax U.S. credit exchange through BNPL-specific business industry codes. This new capability will provide Equifax customers and partners the flexibility to include the fast-growing BNPL data in credit decisioning or to exclude it based on their specific needs. Our new Equifax Cloud gives us the ability to quickly ingest and manage diverse data types and develop customer reports through Equifax One and custom scores using Equifax decisioning. Our data ingestion process is simplified by the new Equifax Cloud, and time to market for products has substantially accelerated. As we move through 2022, you'll see this capability further accelerate our NPI-based revenue growth. Before I turn it over to John, I wanted to quickly discuss our guidance expectations for 2022. In October, we shared with you a framework for 2022 that included a midpoint revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share. As discussed earlier, several factors have impacted our view of 2022 compared to the framework we shared with you a few months ago. First, expectations for the U.S. mortgage market have changed meaningfully given the jump in the 30-year mortgage rates from 3% in September to 3.6% today. We now expect the U.S. mortgage market to decline 21.5% in 2022 as opposed to the 15% decline we expected back in October. On its own, the 650 basis point further decline in the mortgage market negatively impacts our revenue by over $100 million. And offsetting that, we expect Equifax core revenue growth should reach 16% in 2022, over 200 basis points higher than what we reviewed with you in October. This is principally driven by the strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions, including the accelerated pace of new TWN record additions and the faster new products rollouts. This higher core revenue growth drives just over $100 million of additional revenue, offsetting the impact of the additional 650 basis points of mortgage market decline. Our strong core growth allows us to hold our 2022 guidance at the same level as the 2022 framework we shared with you in October with our expectation that we will be at the midpoint of our 2022 guidance for revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2022 guidance and assumptions and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. We're starting off strong in 2022, given our momentum from the fourth quarter. Thanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 20, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX Cloud with innovation new products. EFX2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and the foundation of the new Equifax. We continue to make significant progress executing the Equifax cloud data and technology transformation. We now have about half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North America cloud migrations. We've now completed almost 112,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations. In North America, our principal consumer exchanges are in production in the new Equifax cloud-based single data fabric and delivering to our customers. Our International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some customer migrations continuing into 2024. We remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics and technology company. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities, but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond. At our Investor Day in November, we discussed how the execution of our new EFX2023 strategic priorities, including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, will lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth. We introduced the new Equifax long-term financial framework shown on Slide 21, with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt-on M&A. We also expect to deliver margin expansion, as John mentioned a few minutes ago, with 50 basis points per year over the long-term. That will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 16%, which combined with our 1% dividend yield target will allow us to deliver a total return to shareholders of 13% to 18% going forward. Reinvesting our strong outperformance and strategic and accretive bolt-on M&A is a key priority for the future. As shown on the left side of Slide 22, 2021 was a strong year for bolt-on M&A with eight acquisitions closed totaling about $3 billion that added $300 million to run rate revenue, excluding synergies. Our M&A priorities are clear and focused on expanding and strengthening the core of Equifax through, number one, expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions; number two, adding unique data assets; number three, expanding in the fast-growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four, continuing to look to expand our credit bureau footprint globally. We expect to add 100, 200 basis points in revenue growth each year from bolt-on M&A. In 2021, we completed eight strategic and accretive acquisitions shown on Slide 23. We substantially strengthened and broadened Workforce Solutions through the acquisition of Appriss as well as Health e(fx), HIREtech and i2verify. And we strengthened our identity and fraud portfolio through the acquisition of Kount and our USIS differentiated data assets through both the Teletrack and Kount acquisitions. These were critical acquisitions for Equifax that we're now focused on fully integrating the businesses and driving synergies to accelerate our growth. Reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and long-term growth framework. We're starting off 2022 \u2013 we're starting 2022 off strong with a bolt-on acquisition that we closed earlier this week. As outlined on Slide 24, Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded employer services to hospitality, building services and senior living. The acquisition also strengthens Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market and provides us with incremental TWN records. Slide 25 highlights the tremendous growth of Workforce Solutions, both in revenue and EBITDA margins over the past five years. The very strong growth of the work number and the addition of Appriss Insights and expansion of the EWS Data Hub have dramatically expanded the Workforce Solutions addressable markets across new verticals of talent solutions, government, Employer Services, including onboarding as well as their core mortgage and financial services markets. Our ability to access these markets with our unique and still expanding TWN employment, income and talent data and services will allow EWS to continue to deliver above-market core growth and power EFX in the future. We're also leveraging the new EWS cloud-based tech platform for international expansion with the announcement I mentioned earlier of our new UK income and employment verification services. This adds to our EWS solutions in Canada, Australia and India. Workforce Solutions has grown from about 25% of Equifax revenue three years ago to over 40% last year and will likely grow to over 50% of Equifax in the coming years. The above-market growth in Workforce Solutions and depth and diversity of their people-based assets have moved Equifax well beyond the traditional credit bureau space and made us a faster growing and more diverse business than we were a short three years ago. As shown on Slide 26, the new Equifax is a customer and product-centric company that will deliver 8% to 12% revenue growth in the future by leveraging our Equifax cloud-native architecture centered on a single data fabric to enable seamless use of our unique data assets to deliver new products faster and more effectively. Executing on our EFX2023 growth strategy and delivering revenue growth consistent with the midpoint of our long-term framework will allow us to deliver $7 billion of revenue and 39% EBITDA margins in 2025, as John just mentioned a few minutes ago and as we shared with you in November. Wrapping up on Slide 27, Equifax delivered another strong base quarter with above-market growth in 2021, more than offsetting a declining mortgage market. We are operating exceptionally well and have strong momentum as we move into 2022. We've now delivered eight consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is on offense. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter and year, powering our results, delivering 29% revenue growth in the fourth quarter while integrating Appriss Insights and the three other 2021 bolt-on acquisitions that strengthened the core of our Workforce Solutions. Workforce is clearly our largest, fastest-growing and most valuable business. And Rudy and his team remain focused on driving outsized growth. USIS also delivered a strong quarter with 12% non-mortgage growth and about 6% organic non-mortgage growth, offsetting the impact of a sharp over 20% decline in the mortgage market. Sid and the USIS team remain competitive and are working and are winning in the marketplace. International grew for the fifth consecutive quarter with 6% growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes. We have high expectations for International as we move into 2022. We spent the last three years building the Equifax cloud and are in the early days of leveraging our new and uniquely Equifax cloud-based technology and single data fabric capabilities. As we move into 2022 and beyond, we will increasingly realize the top line, cost and cash benefits from these new only Equifax cloud capabilities. And we've already added a strategic bolt-on acquisition to Workforce Solutions this week that combined with the acquisitions we made in 2021 are contributing 320 basis points or almost $160 million to 2022 revenue growth. We continue to build our pipeline as we look to add 100 to 120 basis points of revenue growth annually from bolt-on M&A. Our 2022 guidance with core revenue growth of 16% is well above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. And 8% growth in total is aligned with our prior guidance despite a 21% decline in the mortgage market. Our ability to offset the additional 650 basis points of mortgage decline with stronger core growth reflects the breadth and strength of the new Equifax. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 13% to $8.65 at the midpoint, which also aligns with the 2022 framework we reviewed with you in October. I'm energized about our strong above-market performance in 2021, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in 2022 and beyond. We remain convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. I'd also like to announce today that Trevor Burns is returning to the Equifax Investor Relations team. Please join me in welcoming Trevor back to IR and feel free to contact Trevor, Dorian or Sam with any questions. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes. I'll start, and John, you can jump in. As you know, forecasting the mortgage market is quite challenging. The good news is we have a lot of history which we rely on, and we have a lot of data that we rely on. But I would \u2013 you make the point that it's obviously challenging. But we look at all of our data elements of the track record of new home purchases in the marketplace, the refi market. John went through some detail on the still sizable population of homes in the United States that will benefit from a refinancing. He also highlighted the significant increase in HPA or home price appreciation, which is I think 30% for most geographies across the United States. So the availability for consumers to access equity in their homes through a refinancing. Those certainly weighed in. And of course, offsetting that, as you point out, is the higher interest rates, which reduced the number of homes available for refi. So those were all the factors that we put into our models and our analysis. And we thought 21.5% was the right place, given everything we see today, obviously, down dramatically from the minus 15% we were using for really the second or the last portions of 2021 as we were looking forward to 2022. And then, of course, we're pleased that the core performance of Equifax is strong. And we can offset that with our core growth, particularly from Workforce Solutions from the momentum in the fourth quarter, the strong addition of records, which helps power their business and broadly the strong performance of Equifax. Yes. As you know, we don't talk about specific pricing actions, but all of our businesses use price on an annual basis to offset inflation, of course, but also reflect the value of the solutions that we're delivering. And we've been quite clear in prior discussions with you and our other investors that Workforce Solutions has more pricing power because of the uniqueness of the assets they deliver and the scale of the database. So it's clearly one of the levers. But as you know, that's only one. They've really ramped up their new product rollouts in the last 12 to 18 months, leveraging the cloud, particularly in the second half of 2021. And we talked about new solutions that we're bringing to market in the mortgage space, for example, where we have mortgage solutions that provide more history at a meaningfully higher price point than the single solution that we have or the co-borrower solution that we now have called Mortgage Duo that is priced over $175 per poll because it provides real value on co-borrowers. So those are examples of leverage that Workforce has. And of course, the other levers, the adding of TWN records, our TWN records being up 19%. The new relationships that we've signed exclusively in the latter part of the year that we'll be adding to our records in 2022. As you know, because of the very large volume of inquiries that we get on a system-to-system basis or through the web, as we add new records, we're able to monetize those really instantly. So that 19% is another very meaningful lever for Workforce Solutions as we move into 2022. Yes. As you know, we don't give detail around kind of guidance on the records that we're adding during the year. We try to be very transparent about current period record additions. And as you know, those were added at different points if you think about 2021 during the year, so you get a year-over-year benefit in 2022 for the record. So the 19% increase will benefit the Workforce Solutions in 2022. And then, of course, these new agreements that we mentioned that we've signed with major \u2013 some of the larger payroll processors on an exclusive basis, we'll be adding at different points during the year. It takes time to build the system integrations and to bring those into our data set. And then, of course, as you know, close to 60% of our records come from individual company relationships that we have from our Employer Services business. And that's a very active area for us to add records, which we do on a \u2013 kind of on a daily, weekly basis. Actually, John and I get a report every Friday of records that are added. And those are \u2013 we're really strengthening our ability to add records from individual companies as we build our Employer Services solutions, whether that's I-9, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, HCA, W-2. And as you know, we did three acquisitions last year that add to that space, including one this week, that grow our solutions and Employer Services business, but they also bring records. So we have a really a multisided approach and really scale focus on adding records. And just back on the payroll processors, we still have a pipeline of the relationships we don't have. We're in active dialogues with those as we've talked about. We have real momentum. As you know, I don't know, in the last 18 months, we've added some meaningful new relationships, including a large one in third quarter last year that we announced, I guess, a year ago on our fourth quarter call. And then we've got the three that we added on an exclusive basis in the last few weeks that will be rolling in, in 2022. So a big focus on adding those records. And as you think about it, there's a long runway. I would encourage you to think about total records but also unique records. Remember, the 135 million is total records, but we have 105 million SSNs or unique individuals. So there's 30 million people in there that have multiple jobs. The path from 105 million to 155 million, 157 million or 158 million whatever the right number is now, nonfarm payroll, it's another 50 million plus individuals that we are focused on adding. And then, of course, we have a big focus of going beyond nonfarm payroll to really get those very valuable 40 million to 50 million gig records, meaning individuals that are self-employed. There is a second job beyond nonfarm payroll or someone who is just self-employed. And then also the 20 million to 30 million pensioner records that is another valuable source for income verification for those that are not in the workforce today. So you add those up, you're looking at something north of 100 million additional records we can add. If you think about the 105 million we have unique individuals and add that potential, we have the ability to still kind of double the TWN database, and we're focused on it. Yes, and yes. And I think you know, and I hope you get a sense that it's a huge priority of ours. We really ramped up our focus on new products, I'd call it, two years ago when we added significant resources, meaning new people. I think as you know, we have for the first time now in the last two years a Chief Product Officer, who is on my leadership team. We're really driving, leveraging our differentiated data and the Equifax cloud. And what you're seeing is the \u2013 I would call it the early days or early innings of our ability to leverage the cloud. Of course, while we're more than halfway as far as kind of cloud complete, that will substantially accelerate in 2022, that half that is complete is starting to take hold, where what's happening is what we thought would happen is we're able to combine data assets, bring new solutions to market much more quickly. So it's a combination of resources and focus. We have a monthly deep dive, John and I with the product team around their pipeline and then the ability to leverage our new capabilities. This is why we invested in the cloud, why we invested in a single data fabric was our ability to ramp up new product introductions. And as you point out, going from 5%, 6% a couple of years ago vitality to we started last year hoping to do 8%. We ended at 9% vitality. And then as you point out, to be \u2013 have a goal in 2022 of 10%, that's $0.5 billion of new products introduced in the last three years. And we're very deliberate about how we define a new product. It has to be new-new. And we view that as a very attractive growth lever for us. As you know, new products and incremental revenue are very high incremental margins for our business. And it's inherent in our long-term framework that we rolled out in November, where we increased the low end of 100 bps and the high end 200 basis points of our total growth going forward that NPIs will be a meaningfully part \u2013 meaningful part of that. And when we talked in November, we said our long-term goal is to get to 10% vitality, and we're chasing that this year. And we \u2013 as we talked a few minutes ago, our goal is to deliver 10% vitality in 2022. Good morning, Manav. Strong growth in marketing, which we translate as we go into 2022 into online. I'll just add, Manav, that we're also pleased with the traction we're starting to see and we have been seeing around kind of our competitive positioning with the cloud, the capabilities of the cloud that we deliver that we think differentiate Equifax. Of course, we think we have data our competitors don't have. And those discussions around competitive takeaways or competitive wins are continue to pick up momentum by Sid and his team. So, we think that's another positive going forward as they get closer to being cloud-native and fully delivering those differentiated service levels and capabilities to our customers. We think that's going to be a positive for them going forward. No. It's \u2013 you and I talked before, and we've talked with our investor base many times about our goal of expanding workforce globally. We paused International expansions while we were building out the tech stack, and that's now built. UK is our first move there. The technology is live. We're, I believe, close to ingesting records, meaning starting to have contributors contribute into our UK, TWN database. So that's happening as we speak. That was kind of built up over the last number of months. And as you point out, we now have the ability to go into international markets more quickly, more economically with a cloud-based technology stack. Of course, this adds to our Australian business, where we're ingesting and actually delivering solutions in the marketplace, same in Canada and same in India. And we do have a strategy to expand to other markets globally. We're \u2013 we haven't announced anything yet, but we see that as an opportunity. Maybe to close that point is that the financial impact of it is it will be de minimis in the scale of workforce and Equifax in 2022. Meaning it will be small, but we expect it to grow over time. Where it will be meaningful is going to be a couple of years probably when you think about those international expansions. But in each of those markets, what it does for our credit file business, think UK, Australia, India and Canada, is it makes them more competitive because we bring a solution now of not only the credit report in Canada or the UK, but then we can couple in, just like we're doing in the United States, an income and employment verification. So that's another positive of going into markets that we're already in. And of course, as you know, in a number of those markets like UK and Australia, we have very large market positions. So the addition of the income and employment data is positive for us. So it's clearly a part of Workforce Solutions growth strategy going forward is to U.K. is our \u2013 is the move we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we'll look for other markets to expand our workforce business into, because we believe \u2013 we view it as a global franchise, of course, which is anchored quite strongly in our very, very large U.S. business. Hey Toni. No, no, no. I think we said two or three times in our earlier comments that we have clear expectations that workforce will in 2022 achieve their kind of historical margins or I think we said it or above. It's not unusual, and you followed us for some time. You may remember in, I think, third quarter of 2020, going back maybe to \u2013 was there in 2019, we also had maybe an instance like this, there's a little bit of lumpiness when you're adding a bigger payroll processor. And there's a lumpiness in some in-quarter costs to complete those integrations. Sometimes we help support partner, meaning we help pay for some of those integration costs, we have some incremental costs on our side. But you've seen in the past that those quickly are dissipated, meaning they are onetime. And we \u2013 we've factored into what is going to happen in as far as record additions that we can see now in 2022 in kind of the comments we had earlier around our expectation that workforce margins will kind of return to that mid-50s. Yes, it's a great question. We talked about it many times in prior calls. We got a lot \u2013 we have a lot of confidence in the scale of our underlying business model. And as you pointed out, there are some others that are trying to enter this space. We think it's going to be quite challenging to obtain records, start with that, think about the tens of thousands of integrations that we have. Remember, the integration of income and employment data is a separate integration from existing credit file integration. So those have to be built. But just start with records. The 19% growth that we had, the 135 million, 105 million uniques. We added a large payroll processor last year in the third quarter that was exclusive. We've added three more \u2013 we're adding three more that are all exclusive. And of course, exclusive means they're only going to work with Equifax and Workforce Solutions. So that's quite challenging. And remember, too, that the 60% of our records we've accumulated over 15 years of building up those relationships through the very large Employer Solutions business we have or providing all those services to HR managers and companies for W-2, I-9, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, HCA, et cetera, those solutions, that's a very long-term scale kind of business to build out. So while we know there are others in the space, we think our market position is quite strong, and we got a lot of confidence in maintaining that position going forward. And it really starts with the ability to build out a data set that looks like Equifax's we think that's very, very hard to do. Toni, maybe to add one more point on it. We hear more about competitors from these calls than we do in the marketplace, if you understand that point meaning, we hear that from our investors and so on, but we really don't see them in the marketplace. They just don't have the scale to play either on the record additions or on delivering solutions to our customers. We've been in this business for 15 years. We've invested $1 billion \u2013 actually, more than that, we're up to like $3-plus billion probably in the business since we owned it when you add M&A. And then on the technology side, think about it, we put $300 million into the business incrementally in the last three years. It's a massive investment, and you have to have real scale to be able to play at the level we're playing at. Thanks. Yes, it's a great question. It's really all of the above. We have a relationships all over the globe with the BNPL players. As you know, they're growing rapidly. We're selling them identity data, think Kount or other identity because you got to verify a consumer before you offer that for payment loan, for the blue jeans or whatever they're buying. We're also selling them some credit data in different markets, including the United States, particularly as they go to bigger-ticket transactions. If you're financing a pair of blue jeans for $100, over four-payments, there's a credit exposure to that. It's very different than you're doing a refrigerator. That's a $1,000 refrigerator or something. And so there's a trend there where you're seeing more credit data being used for BNPL players as customers. On the data side, it really follows our focus on just building out our data assets. And there are a lot of data elements, as you point out, in BNPL players. And actually, with all credit fans, it's very popular, for example, with millennials, which typically have thinner credit files. They may be good credit, but they have thin credit files. Meaning they only have one bank card or two bank cards or whatever. So that BNPL data will be very valuable. We're also going down the path of adding rental data. So we're accumulating rental payment data. That's another valuable asset. And of course, in the alternative data side, meaning outside the credit file, we have really scaled data assets at Equifax that we're putting in our single data fabric and bringing to market as new solutions like our NCTUE cellphone utility payment data, which is very valuable as another trade line for thin or no hit \u2013 thin file or no hit customers. And then on the pure alternative data, we bought DataX a couple of years ago in 2018. And then we acquired last year, Teletrack. And we'll now have the largest data set at something like 80 million Americans outside of the credit file their data from rent-to-own companies, their payment data from auto lenders, subprime auto lenders, sales finance companies, furniture companies, payday lenders. So a very, very rich data set that's additive to the credit file, just like this BNPL data, just like our NC+ data, just like rental data. So it's a broad focus for us. And the cloud capabilities we have in the single data fabric really allow us to bring these new data sources into our environment, into our database. And of course, as you know, we have \u2013 we've built out and now are adding to our single data fabric where we're going to have data keyed and linked for an individual. Every data element that we have will be put together that way, which is, again, as a part of the benefits of our big cloud investments that we're making. Yes. As you heard from our comments earlier, that's a very fast-growing space for us, which I think you were broadly talking about our nonmortgage portion of Workforce Solutions, which is growing very, very strongly. Government is a big vertical for us. We've been expanding there. Appriss makes us stronger. We signed and launched the SSA contract last year. That's ramping. So that's another new solution. We see a lot of potential in government. Talent is a very big space for us with big potential. In my comments earlier, I shared the point that we only today see one in 10 inquiries around the hiring process. So big runway, and that business has been growing strong, strong double digits in the hiring space. And we see big potential when you combine some of the Appriss data, the National Student Clearinghouse education data and of course, as John mentioned, the work history we have. We have a history on individuals because we've been accumulating records over the last 10-plus years, and we average something like 5.5 jobs for every American. So that work history is extremely valuable in that hiring process for 75 million people a year were hired. So that's a big growth area for us. We talked about Employer Services or Employer Solutions, where we're delivering HR compliance generally solutions to HR managers to do that work for them. A lot of those \u2013 a lot of that work today is in-sourced. We pick up the outsourcing of it either directly or through our partners. And that's another area that's been growing. And of course, we've done a bunch of M&A there that strengthen us. And the three bolt-on acquisitions last year of HIREtech, i2verify and Health e(fx) and then the acquisition we announced and closed this week of Efficient Hire, those strengthen us in that space of delivering those W-2, I-9 verification, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, all those other solutions, to HR managers. Of course, they bring records to us, which is very valuable. So we see a really very attractive growth potential. And then in Financial Services, to your question, we've been growing very strongly outside of mortgage. Auto is a space that's growing for us, using our income and employment data along with credit data. Personal loans, we have very strong penetration there that \u2013 using income and employment data. And then in cards, we've got a couple of big issuers now that are combining our income and employment data with the credit file at origination, and we expect that to grow also. So that's a new opportunity for us. So a lot of potential for Workforce Solutions. And of course, most of the verticals we just talked about are way different than our traditional credit bureau verticals, meaning we're in spaces that are growing faster than our core credit bureau space. But they also diversify Equifax very, very broadly. From being historically more traditional financial services, we're now much more diversified than we will be in the future as we grow. Yes. We didn't talk about specific wins, but we did talk about when I used the term momentum by our USIS team competitively. And that's really driven by areas that you talked about. It's our differentiated data, which, of course, we're expanding. It's the build-out of the single data fabric, which makes our data more accessible. We have more data than our competitors and then we have it in a way that's more easily utilized and then the cloud capabilities and cloud functionality that is increasingly in the marketplace. We're seeing that give us a leg up in those competitive discussions that we view as positive going forward for USIS and for Equifax. Yes. Just to clarify, we don't do income verification. It's really employment history that we deliver there. And the one item we just wanted to point out there's a lot of runway in this. We have a large business. It's growing very rapidly in the talent solutions space as we continue to grow. And the drivers are really driven by first, it's our work history that we have. We have well over 0.5 billion total records, which is \u2013 think about that 5.5 jobs on the average American. So if you don't come to Equifax, you've got to go manually to each of those companies in order to verify that. So the one-click instant kind of data element for Equifax is from Workforce Solutions is what's driving the growth. We're also productizing it. We're in the early stages of bringing new solutions to market that really solve our customers. In this case, it's either a background screener typically, but it could also be an individual company. But it's really how do we help them complete their job more quickly. And speed is really important. It always has been in the hiring process. You think about it, when someone's being hired for a new job, there's typically an open job there. And the hiring manager wants them to start quickly because there's work to be done, whether it's in a fast food restaurant or in a warehouse or a white-collar job, speed is very important. And if we're able to deliver that instant decision that shortens that time between offer of employment and start of work, it's really a big opportunity. So we're going to in 2022 bring new solutions that will likely be more job category based. Meaning we'll combine our work history, which is the foundation of that, meaning where you worked in the past, adding to educational data that we now have from National Student Clearinghouse. You have the criminal justice data that's typically used in a background screen. We can package that up in individual solutions. So it's really a very attractive growth opportunity for us that \u2013 and what really drove the solution is it starts with our big database. Having that 0.5 billion records in that work history gives us something that's incredibly unique that no one else has. And as we productize it with some of the other data elements, that will be a way to continue to grow. And we'd like to do more M&A. Appriss is a big example of that. That brought the criminal justice incarceration data and also medical credentialing data. There's other data elements that we'd like to either partner or add to. And of course, we mentioned a couple of times that we added the education data, which a lot of white-collar jobs, there's a requirement to verify where you go to school. And we can do that instantly now, and we'll productize that in combining the multiple data elements we have to help speed up the decisioning for our customers. So we see big growth potential here. It's definitely an organic focus. We'd love to do some M&A, but there's really nothing out there. There are others that do this that we've seen or found. And that's why we're leveraging our core technology. It's now cloud based. We also have relationships with multinationals, where we're doing their income employment verification here in the United States, and they have operations in other countries, so they want us to do it there. So that's kind of a base load that we can add to the data set organically. And then same thing with either leveraging our existing payroll partnerships here in the United States are working with new HR providers or payroll processors in those markets to add records. That's all the approach. So it's definitely organic. Well, our goal would be to have a similar competitive strength globally. We think that we have a lot of opportunities to do that. In many of our markets that we're in today, we're really the only one doing it. The couple of markets, I believe in the UK, Experian has talked about trying to do something like what we're doing but not in other markets. But we think we have a lot of competitive strengths. We've got a technology stack that we've invested hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's now cloud-based. We have the relationships that I talked about, and we have the know-how. So we're going to approach it. These take time to build. It takes time to build out the records and the record contributors. Remember, it took us over a decade to get Workforce Solutions to some level of scale in a big market like the United States. We'll likely be able to do that more quickly in these other markets because of the leverage we have in our technology and relationships in the marketplace. But it will definitely get built out. And we'll likely do other markets beyond the four that we're in. That will be a part of our growth strategy. Yes, sure. I would argue it already, at least our outlook is significantly weaker. We, a few months ago, thought it'd be down 15 for 2022, and now we're down 21.5. That's meaningfully different than \u2013 I think it's quite powerful that Equifax has the momentum from the fourth quarter and the strength to offset that. We're very pleased with that. It shows the strength of the underlying business. We finished the fourth quarter quite strongly and had momentum coming into the year. We would look to continue to outperform going forward. We can't predict that at this stage because we are working with it down 21.5. But when you combine the down 21.5 with the decline in 2020, the mortgage market has moved substantially at least in our forecast towards the normalization. And then we think a lot, and I'm sure you do too, about there's obviously the interest rate impact, which is primarily what factored into our reset of the mortgage market. But still offsetting that is a very sizable home price appreciation that we've never seen in kind of the last 20 years that is a positive that we think could dampen at least further declines. It's hard to forecast what's going to happen with interest rates, but there's a lot of equity for consumers to access. And historically, when consumers have that ability to do cash-out refis, they will do that to do home improvement, to do vacations or other things they're going to do. So those are some of the elements that we think about. But just on our so-called updated guidance with mortgage down meaningfully from where we thought a few months ago and then the ability to offset that, we think that shows the strength and breadth of the underlying Equifax business. Thanks, Simon. Yes. I think you're talking about versus what you would call our traditional competitors. I think you're talking more about some of the fintechs that are doing consented data kind of acquisitions. And we have solutions there, too. We have a partnership with Yodlee here in the United States. We have in other markets where we do consented data. There's a lot of friction involved in consented data. And it starts with you have to disrupt the process as a mortgage process or a credit card process or an auto process to ask the consumer to give their user ID and password for their bank account or their user ID and password for their payroll processor or their user ID and password for their employee benefits site at their company. And there's just a lot of fallout of consumers that aren't willing to do that. And we've just seen \u2013 it's certainly a niche that we're playing in, but it's one that we haven't seen real traction in. And then second is the fact that most of our customers, actually all of them, want instant verifications. Meaning just pinging our database and we send back the element, you don't have that friction and time. It could take hours, days, who knows dependent upon a digital process, to have that consent process take place. So that the instant verification is when we're in a workflow with our customer, meaning they're processing a mortgage, it gets to a certain point, they ping our database. And we deliver in milliseconds the verification of that. So I think it's a niche, but we really don't view them as competitors. As John pointed out earlier in the conversation, we still think about our biggest competitor being paper paystubs. That's the one that we continue to displace through instant. Again, there's friction with paper paystubs. Someone's got to go get them. There's a lot of fraud involved. We do that instant verification. You asked a question about access our records at a lower price. We've said many times, including the three new relationships we signed late in the year, that our relationships are exclusive. And exclusive means exclusive, meaning they're not accessible by others, which is the way we want to have those relationships kind of broadly and our partners do also. And then remember, 60% of our records come from individual companies. Those are very hard to access even through a consumer-consented process. And then I'll just end I think with your question about our consent process. As you know, we authenticate anyone who uses our data, and we require anyone who uses our data to follow Fair Credit Reporting Act processes where the individual, the consumer has to consent to access to their data. So no data is used without a consumer consenting in Workforce Solutions, of course, or in our credit file business. And that's inherent in the security and privacy processes that we have. And on top of that, we're credentialing or authenticating the company that's using the data, which is another element in ensuring that they follow the Fair Credit Reporting Act processes. We don't think consumer-consented income and employment verification is an M&A target for us. We already have the ability to do it ourselves through other partnerships we have. And we view it as a niche, although we bought a consumer-consented business in the U.K. really because of open data. But that was one that really is more U.K.-centric. The other acquisitions we've done were really to strengthen our Employer Services or solutions business, where we provide compliance and regulatory services to HR managers. And that's a big business for us. It's one where they typically do that themselves and then outsource to someone like Equifax because we can do it with a higher degree of accuracy, privacy, efficiency. And that's W-2 management. It's I-9 verification. It's Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Employee Resource Credit, HCA, et cetera, those compliance services, I-9 verification. So we provide those services. And the three and now four acquisitions we've done with Efficient Hire that we did this week really strengthen us in those services elements to the HR manager. And then as a part of that solution, we also get TWN records. So it's another way for us to obtain records. So that's really our M&A focus there. There aren't a lot of those opportunities. Of course, we acquired another very attractive one this week in Efficient Hire and of course, three last year, as we pointed out. And then the other M&A focus for us is around our talent data hub. And that's the Appriss acquisition that we closed on in October, really attractive team and business that we brought in and brought in unique data at scale around incarceration and criminal justice and also medical credentialing data. And that's an area where we've been very clear that we'd like to do more M&A both in Employer Services, like Efficient Hire this week. We'd also like to do more M&A around data that's used in the hiring process like Appriss to build out the Equifax data hub. Hey, George. Yes. And George, I would add to the question maybe to complete it. Also the records we obtained directly through individual companies to kind of complete the equation. Now you can decide how you define those. We think of those as they're not exclusive, meaning individual companies which is 60% of our records, but they're very sticky to Equifax and our view is HR managers aren't going to share those records with two companies. And remember, we generally obtain individual company records because we're providing unique services to that HR manager, whether its unemployment claims, W-2 management, et cetera. With regards to the 40-plus percent from partners, we've been very clear that the vast, vast, I'll say vast twice, majority of those relationships are exclusive, and exclusive means exclusive there. And our intention is to have them all be exclusive over time. They're not all exclusive. And as you know, the relationships \u2013 all the relationships we've added in the last two years have been exclusive, including the three that we signed in December. And it's our intention for them to be exclusive as we sign them going forward. Does that help? Yes. You're always making investments. I think you pointed out one is clearly our priority of ours is to continue to invest in product capabilities and resources, and new products require some investment. And of course, the 200 that you mentioned is net of those reinvestments that we're making this year, which we're continuing. And you know that we've been investing in product capabilities really for the last couple of years as we've been growing out that capability. Data analytics is another area that we're investing in, whether it's new data being contributed like the BNPL data that requires some investment or new contributors to TWN, rental data, et cetera. So that's a priority of ours as we're investing. We've got some commercial footprint investments that we're making in 2022, as you would expect, to continue to grow our commercial coverage, which is quite strong but are intended to make it stronger. And then, of course, we're continuing to complete the cloud transformation that underlies that investment and also receive the net benefits as we decommission some of our legacy infrastructure during 2022, which will be a positive for us and reflected in that 200 bps. Anything, John? I think you got to kind of layer another leg on that is how might it impact the economy. But as you know, while inflation is up, wages are up also. And job growth is up, people are working. During the last 24 months, they've strengthened broadly their credit position, meaning that a lot of the stimulus money has been used to make men pays and pay down credit card balances. So as we enter 2022, you've got a consumer that broadly is much better positioned than they were two years ago when we entered COVID. So I think that is a positive for our customers and a positive for us. The other thing that, again, going beyond the consumer is that a lot of our customers have experienced deleveraging, meaning customers paying down balances. So they're focused, and you've seen that in our FMS marketing revenue, they're focused on going after new customers that generally are more creditworthy. I think on a \u2013 over the last two years, credit scores have gone up something like 20 points on average because of the stimulus money and now increasingly, people are working. So that's how I would think about it that we're still in a pretty attractive environment. Now how long does inflation hold up? What happens \u2013 what does the Fed do with interest rates beyond what they've kind of indicated? I think those are all different factors. But my expectation is 2022 should be pretty good for the consumer, meaning they're strong and then good for us because our customers are going to be looking to grow their business with those consumers. I would add, these numbers are quite exceptional, right? Those kind of growth rates. And as we look at quarter \u2013 year-over-year kind of growth on a quarterly basis, they're growing over kind of exceptional performance. And just adding to it, clearly, outperforming the long-term framework we put in place in November for Workforce Solutions of 13 to 15, which is kind of how that \u2013 their piece of our 8 to 12 going forward, they're clearly outperforming that. And there's a lot of factors there, whether it's records, penetration, new product rollouts. They've been performing very, very strongly. And then we expect that to continue to have a very strong 2022 from workforce. You're talking about the market growth versus our growth? Yes, we typically don't give actual segment growth like that as a part of our guidance, but let me just give some color about how we think about those verticals is that there's a couple of questions ago, I talked about cards and so on. We think card growth will be positive for us and for the industry in 2022 as card issuers are looking to rebuild their balance sheets after they come down. P loans is another one that should be positive in \u2013 for the industry in 2022. There was some real tightening in 2020 as we went into COVID. That started to relax as we got into the mid parts of 2021. So that should be a benefit. Auto is broadly strong from a consumer demand standpoint, but you've got the supply chain issues, meaning there aren't available autos, which have dampened some of that. Whether those supply chain issue's sorted out is hard to see, not my strength. But there's underlying consumer demand there that's quite strong. Generally, we think about new products is generally being quite accretive to our margins because they're generally \u2013 think about our Vitality Index of $500 million of growth over the last three years. Those are generally incremental revenue, and they have high incremental margins. So that's kind of how we think about it. So they deliver margin pretty quickly that are accretive to our historical growth rates. And that's why we're so focused on new products because they drive our top line and then the incremental nature of that growth is expanding our margins. Thanks."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nDorian Hare: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab on our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can be also found in the Presentations section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q3 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full year 2021 guidance as well as a framework for 2022, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to material -- to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. We had a very strong third quarter and first 9 months of 2021, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $1.223 billion, which was up over 14%, with core non-mortgage market and non-UC, ERC claims revenue growth of 20%. We are executing extremely well against the critical priorities of our EFX2023 strategy, as we highlighted on Slide 4. Our focus on leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, new products and growth is clearly driving our strong financial results. Our revenue growth has accelerated from 3% in 2019, as we were recovering from the 2017 cyber event and investing heavily in our EFX Cloud transformation to 17% last year. We are on track to deliver 19% core growth this year at the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance. More importantly, our core growth, which excludes the impact of the mortgage market, unemployment claims and ERC-related revenues is expected to accelerate to 21% this year, a powerful figure that reflects the strength of our underlying business model and EFX2023 growth strategy. Not only is our core growth accelerating above historical levels during '20 and '21 in challenging COVID markets. And more recently, in a declining mortgage market, we are also expanding EFX beyond our traditional credit bureau routes to a more diverse data analytics and technology company with our investments in the Equifax cloud, new data assets and NPIs, along with reinvesting our outperformance in bolt-on M&A in areas such as talent, government and ID and fraud. We are quickly pivoting from building the Equifax cloud to leveraging it for innovation of new products that will position the new Equifax for stronger and more diversified growth in the future. Our EFX2023 growth strategy remains our compass for the future and drives all of our top and bottom line growth initiatives as we move towards '22 and beyond. Turning to Slide 5. Equifax had a very strong quarter. Revenue at $1.22 billion was up 14.5%, with organic constant currency growth up a strong 12%. The almost 15% top line growth was off a strong 19% growth last year in a much stronger mortgage market. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. More importantly, our core growth was up a strong 20%. Our U.S. B2B businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 75% of Equifax revenue, again drove our growth, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the 21% decline in the U.S. mortgage market in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up over 30%, and organic non-mortgage revenue was up 24%, strengthening sequentially from the 16% and 20% we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year. Third quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $404 million, up slightly from third quarter last year with margins of 33%. As expected, margins were down versus 2020 due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $45 million in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year, and redundant cloud transformation systems cost of $15 million. These costs related to cloud tech transformation negatively impacted EBITDA margins by almost 500 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $1.85 a share was down slightly from last year. Adjusting for the cloud transformation costs of $45 million or $0.27 a share, adjusted EPS would have been up a strong 11%. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. In the quarter, we completed 4,000 B2B customer migrations for a total of 15,400 migrations completed so far this year. In September alone, USIS completed over 900 customer migrations. Since the beginning of the transformation, we've completed almost 97,000 B2B migrations, 3.5 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations. We remain on track and confident in our plan. We continue to expect the North American transformation to be principally complete in early '22, with the remaining customer migrations broadly completing by the end of next year. International transformation will follow, being principally completed by the end of 2023, with some customer migrations continuing into 2024.  We're still in the early days of leveraging the cloud but remain confident that will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line and expand our margins and the growth in cost savings in '22 and beyond. Our NPI performance also continues to accelerate. In the quarter, we released 30 new products. And we still expect our Vitality Index to accelerate from 5% last year to over 8% in 2021. Given our very strong third quarter performance, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 320 basis points or $131 million at the midpoint of a range between $4.9 billion to $4.921 billion, up 19% from last year, and increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 per share to a midpoint of $7.57 per share, which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a 23% growth in EPS. This includes our expectation that the U.S. mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries will decline just over 7% this year with the bulk of the return to normalization in the second half, which we expect to be down around 20%. Roughly 2/3 of the 320 basis point increase in our revenue growth framework to 19% is from organic business performance, with the balance from the acquisition of Appriss, Health e(fx) and Teletrack, which we expect to add about $45 million to revenue in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars on Slide 6, grew a very strong 20%, a third consecutive quarter of core growth at or above 20%. Non-mortgage growth in EWS and USIS and growth in International drove about 900 basis points to the core revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and FX, with mortgage outperformance primarily in Workforce Solutions driving about 800 basis points of organic core growth in the quarter. As we move through '22 and '23, we expect to continue to see strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the new EFX Cloud, accelerated NPIs, continued strong non-mortgage growth, both from organic growth and acquisitions, as well as continued strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $508 million, which was up 35%. This is the first quarter Workforce Solutions has delivered over $0.5 billion of revenue in a single quarter, a big milestone. This was against a very strong 57% growth last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up over -- were 54%. Non-mortgage revenue at Workforce Solutions was up over 48%, with organic non-mortgage revenue up 41%. The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness of their TWN income and employment data set was clear again in the third quarter. Workforce's Verification Services revenue of $403 million was up a strong 34%. Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 22% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market, with the EWS outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products. Importantly, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue was up 55% in the quarter, consistent with the very strong growth we saw last quarter. Our government vertical, which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs, including food and rental support, grew over 20% in the quarter. Government remains one of our largest non-mortgage segments with attractive growth potential in the future and represents about 1/3 of non-mortgage verification revenue. Our new SSA contract went live this quarter at relatively low start-up volumes, and we expect to see it ramp as we move through 2022. We expect new products, the addition of Appriss and expanded federal and state social services to fuel growth in our government vertical in the future. Talent solutions, which provides income employment verifications as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS data hub, had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and NPIs growing over 100%. Talent solutions now represents almost 30% of non-mortgage verification revenue. And as you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually, with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of the hiring process. The addition of Appriss Insights and our new partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse will fuel growth and new products in this important vertical. The non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well of about 90% in the quarter, both from deepening penetration with lenders and from some recovery in these markets, although auto has been impacted by inventory shortages. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was up $30 million in the quarter. This is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers records. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $65 million, up about $14 million from last year. Substantial declines in the UC revenue in the quarter were more than offset by ERC, which grew substantially -- sequentially as we support the businesses in obtaining federal employee retention credit payments. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of about $40 million, up 60%, with organic growth of about 35%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product, continue to show very strong growth, up about 80%. Our I-9 business is now almost half of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. Reflecting the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of Workforce Analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses to deliver total growth of about 40% and organic growth of about 25% in the year. Reflecting the uniqueness of the TWN data, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins of 54.3%. The decline versus last year is driven by investments in the tech transformation as well as redundant systems costs and as well as significant investments in data onboarding, sales and marketing to continue to drive Workforce Solutions growth. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a very strong '21, '22 and beyond. Turning now to USIS. Their revenue of $380 million was up slightly from last year. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $148 million was down 17%, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, slightly better than the down 23% we expected in July. USIS outperformance versus the overall market was driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products. Importantly, non-mortgage revenue of $240 million grew almost 8 -- sorry, 16% with organic growth of over 9%. Year-to-date, non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 17%, and organic non-mortgage revenue growth is over 10%. Banking, insurance, commercial and direct-to-consumer were all up over 10% in the quarter. Fraud was up almost 10% organically and up over 75% in total, with the inclusion of our Kount acquisition. Auto was up mid-single digits despite supply pressures, and telco was down just over 5%. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is, broadly speaking, our off-line or batch business, was $55 million in the quarter and up about 20%. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20%; and ID and fraud revenue, which grew over 15%. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 40% of FMS revenue; identity and fraud, above 20%; and risk decisioning, about 35%. The USIS sales team delivered record wins up over 20% versus last year and 40% sequentially in the quarter. The new deal pipeline in USIS remains very strong. During the quarter, USIS acquired Teletrack, a U.S. leader in alternative credit data. Teletrack is being consolidated with DataX, our specialty finance credit reporting agency that we acquired in 2018, to expand our capabilities in the fast-growing alternative data space serving unbanked and underbanked U.S. consumers. The USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 40% in the quarter, flat sequentially with second quarter. Similar to second quarter, the decline in margins in the quarter versus last year was due to both costs related to the cloud transformation, which include the cost of redundant systems and inclusion of our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs which are being excluded in 2020, and the expansion of our investments in sales and marketing as well as new products to leverage both the strengthening U.S. market and accelerate new product introductions to drive revenue growth in '22 and beyond. Turning to International. Their revenue of $245 million was up 10% on a local currency basis and up 100 basis points sequentially. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets following the COVID pandemic impacts. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed well in the quarter with revenue of $89 million, up about 7% in local currency. Australia delivered this growth despite the extended COVID lockdowns in many portions of that country. Australia consumer revenue continued to recover, up 3% versus last year and about flat sequentially. Our Commercial businesses combined online and off-line revenue was up 8% in the quarter. Fraud and identity was up 13%, following 22% growth in the first half. European revenues of $68 million were up 9% in local currency in the quarter and flat sequentially. Our European credit reporting business was up about 5% with continued growth in both the U.K. and Spain. Our European debt management business revenue increased by about 21% in local currency, off the lows we saw last year during the COVID recession. Canada delivered revenue of $44 million in the quarter, up over 8% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 15%. Canada experienced strong growth in fintech, while supply issues continue to impact our auto business. Latin American revenues of $45 million grew 16% in the quarter in local currency, which was the third consecutive quarter of growth coming out of COVID. We continue to see the benefit in Lat Am of the strong new product introductions introduced over the past 3 years. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 26.7% were down slightly from 27.3% in the second quarter. The sequential decline was driven by incremental technology costs in Australia and Canada as they accelerate their cloud transformation programs. The decline in the quarter was principally due to costs related to the cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs, which were being excluded last year. Margins were negatively impacted the quarter by -- also negatively impacted the quarter by our increased investments in sales and marketing and new products. Global Consumer Solutions revenue of $82 million was down 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a local currency basis in the quarter, slightly above our expectations. We saw growth of about 2% in our global consumer direct business, which sells directly to consumers through equifax.com and represents a little over half of GCS revenue.  The decline in GCS revenue in the quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead gen partner business. We expect the GCS partner business and GCS business overall to return to growth in the fourth quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.4% were up sequentially, reflecting lower operating costs. The decline versus last year was principally driven by revenue declines. Turning now to Slide 8. Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax as it's clearly our strongest, fastest-growing and most valuable business, with strong 35% growth in the quarter, up 57% growth a year ago. Core revenue growth was 42%, driven by the uniqueness of the TWN income and employment data, scale of the TWN database and consistent execution by Rudy and his team. EWS' ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by 3 factors. First, growing the work number database. At the end of the third quarter, TWN reached 125 million active records, an increase of 12% or 13 million records from a year ago and included 97 million unique records. At 97 million uniques, we now have over 60% of nonfarm payroll, which makes our TWN data set more valuable to our customers with higher hit rates. We are now receiving records every pay period from 1.9 million companies, up from 1 million when we started the year and 27,000 contributors a short 2 years ago. The exclusive agreement with a major payroll processor that we announced on our February call went live in the third quarter and contributed to this growth. Our strong momentum continues as we signed another large payroll processor last week on an exclusive basis that will come online in the coming months. We also expect to add further payroll processors in the coming months. As a reminder, almost 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers to which EWS provides comprehensive Employer Services like UC claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, ERC, HSA and other HR and compliance solutions. Our acquisitions of HIREtech, i2verify and Health e(fx) this year strengthened our ability to deliver these unique HR services, particularly through relationships with payroll processors and HR software companies. These partnerships have been built up over the past decade by the Workforce Solutions team. The remaining 40% of our records are contributed through partnerships with payroll providers and HR software companies, most of which are exclusive. We still have substantial room to grow our income and employment database and expect to continue to add new data contributors as well as reach agreements with several additional payroll processors in the fourth quarter to add their records on an exclusive basis to TWN in 2022. Beyond the over 50 million nonfarm payroll records not yet in the TWN database, we're focused on data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the U.S. marketplace to further broaden the TWN database. We have plenty of room to grow TWN. Second, increasing our average revenue transactions -- average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing, our existing products to value, recognizing the depth of information TWN allows us to deliver to customers. Workforce Solutions' new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And third, by increasing our penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets. For example, we continue to increase our penetration in the mortgage market. At the end of 2020, Workforce Solutions received an inquiry in almost 60% of completed mortgages, up from 55% in 2019. This 500 basis point increase is a big step forward, but we still have plenty of runway to expand the customers using TWN mortgage. We're also seeing substantial growth in TWN in other credit markets, including card and auto as these verticals take advantage of the unique lift from TWN income and employment data in the 60% hit rates with our database. Growing system-to-system integrations is another key lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of poll per transaction. During the quarter, about 75% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system-to-system, up over 2x from 32% in 2019. And again, we still have plenty of growth potential here. Workforce Solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above-market and above Equifax growth rates and margins that we expect to continue in the future. Slide 9 highlights the core growth performance of our U.S. B2B mortgage businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Our combined U.S. B2B businesses delivered 3% revenue growth in mortgage in the third quarter, outperforming the mortgage market by 24 basis points, with the market down 21%. This strong performance -- outperformance was again driven by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 43%, enabled by the multiple drivers that I just discussed. Slide 10 provides an update on new product innovation, leveraging the Equifax Cloud and our differentiated data, a key driver of our current and future growth. In the quarter, we delivered 30 new products with 150 new products in the market so far this year, which is up 18% from the 96 we delivered in the same time frame last year. We continue to expect our 2021 Vitality Index defined as a percent of revenue delivered from NPIs launched in the past 3 years to be over 8%. In the third quarter, we launched significant new products we expect to continue to drive growth in '22 and beyond. The SSA payroll exchange that went live as an EWS product that supports verifications of SSI and SSDI social services delivering critical income and employment status based on program requirements. OneView with DataX is a new integrated consumer credit report that redefines how we deliver display and provide insights to our customers. It also sets the stage for integrating nontraditional credit data in a single view solution for our customers. Alternative data from DataX, Teletrack, NC+, rental payments and other sources are a critical priority for Equifax, and we expect to continue to drive NPIs in this space in the future. Digital Identity Trust 2.0 product provides businesses with a comprehensive, passive identity verification service that delivers a trust/do not trust recommendation across both physical and digital identity vectors. This product will leverage Kount data by year-end. MarketMix Premier solution enables the ability for FIs to access market share and size of liquidity across geographics. This provides quick identification of targeted growth markets to deploy spend across branch sales and marketing efforts. And lastly, the new Equifax Affordability product in Australia uses bank transaction data and sophisticated categorization to provide an affordability view to customers while removing friction for the consumer. We're clearly focused on leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive our NPI rollouts and new product revenue in '21 and beyond. Growing the NPI is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. As detailed on Slide 11, in 2021, we reinvest our strong outperformance in strategic and accretive bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing growth markets and allow us to enter new markets with new capabilities. Our 2021 acquisitions add $300 million plus synergies to our run rate revenue. We are focused on executing acquisitions that are accretive to our long-term revenue growth and margins and deliver attractive shareholder returns. Our priorities for M&A are clear and aligned around, number one, expanding our differentiated data, which is at the core Equifax. We have scale and unique data sets that we want to expand and leverage with new data elements to drive enhanced decisioning for our customers. All of our acquisitions deliver new and differentiated data, and more data drive better decisions. Second, expanding and widening our largest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions, is a priority for our M&A. The Appriss Insights, HIREtech, Health e(fx) and i2verify acquisitions strengthen Workforce and position EWS for future outperformance. And last, broadening our ID and fraud capabilities in the fast-growing digital and e-commerce space is another M&A priority. Kount strongly advanced our capabilities in this fast-growing space. We closed the Appriss acquisition on October 1 and are focused on integration, new solutions and growth. Appriss Insights and our new partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse are a big step forward in our strategy to build out an EWS Data Hub centered off our almost 500 million historical TWN data records to address the fast-growing talent and government markets. As detailed on Slide 12, combining our scale TWN data with Appriss Insights criminal and health care credentialing and sections data, along with other partner data assets, including the exclusive partnership for college and university data we entered into in the third quarter with the National Student Clearinghouse, allows Workforce Solutions to deliver the most complete, real-time, 360-degree view of the prospective employee or applicant for government benefits available in the market. The talent solutions and government verticals offer large and growing markets for our Workforce Solutions business through the EWS Data Hub. We estimate an addressable market of $5 billion in the U.S. hiring space and onboarding process, with around 75 million new employees onboarded annually in the U.S. Workforce Solutions government vertical is focused on delivering data and solutions to support federal and state benefit programs as well as law enforcement agencies. This is a substantial and growing sector that we estimate to have an addressable market of about $2 billion. Appriss Insights strongly accelerates our ability to penetrate these large and fast-growing TAMs. Insights is anticipated to generate $150 million of run rate revenue during 2021 and to grow on a stand-alone basis at over 15% annually. We also anticipate building towards approximately $75 million in revenue synergies by 2025, leveraging the EFX Cloud to integrate Appriss Insights' rich people-based risk intelligence data in the EWS Data Hub to form a new multi-data solutions and through cross-selling efforts. Acquiring Appriss Insights and partnering with the National Student Clearinghouse provide strong pillars for Workforce Solutions growth and fast-growing markets going forward. Slide 13 highlights our focus on adding alternative data to our database focused on the 60 million un or underbanked population in the United States. According to a Federal Reserve study, 6% of U.S. adults do not have a checking, savings or money market account, although 2/5 use some form of alternative financial service. Moreover, 16% of adults have a bank account but also use an alternative financial service product generally at much higher costs. Providing services that help bring these underserved populations into the financial mainstream is core to our purpose of helping people live their financial best and is an important priority for our customers. Our acquisition of Teletrack in September, which we are combining with our DataX business, creates a leading U.S. specialty consumer reporting agency with data on more than 80 million thin-file, unbanked and underbanked and credit rebuilding consumers. Our National Consumer Telecom & Utilities Exchange partnership is another unique data set focused on this space that has more than 420 million records and 250 million consumers, helping our customers to expand underwriting to no hit or thin-file customers. We are focused on expanding our unique alternative data from sources, including specialty finance companies, alternative lenders, telco companies, cable and satellite TV providers, municipalities and utilities to drive growth in the fast-growing alternative data markets. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our alternative databases through partnerships and M&A. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year, our increase in guidance for 2021 as well as our -- share our early read on 2022 assumptions and our financial framework for 2022.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, our 3Q results were very strong and much stronger than we discussed with you in July, with revenue about $50 million higher than the midpoint of the expectation we shared. For perspective, the strength was driven by our U.S. B2B businesses, principally Workforce Solutions and also USIS. Workforce Solutions Verification Services was stronger than discussed in July, principally in non-mortgage and talent solutions, card and auto as well as, to a lesser extent, in mortgage. Workforce Solutions employee retention credit and unemployment claims revenue was stronger than we discussed in July. We expect the strength in ERC to continue in the fourth quarter. USIS was also somewhat stronger than we discussed in July. The strength in mortgage relative to our discussion in July was partially a reflection of the mortgage market being down 21% versus the down 23% we discussed in July. Workforce Solutions' outperformance relative to the mortgage market was also stronger than we expected. This strong revenue drove upside in adjusted EPS relative to the expectations that we shared in July. Before discussing our increased guidance for 2021 and providing a framework for you to consider for 2022, let's briefly discuss our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market. As shown on Slide 14, we are expecting the 21% year-to-year decline in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries that we saw in the third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter, with the fourth quarter down about 20%. This results in 2021 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries being down just over 7% from 2020, slightly better than the down somewhat under 8% we discussed with you in July. For 2022, based on trends we are seeing in new purchase and refinance that I will discuss shortly, our 2022 framework assumes the U.S. mortgage market as measured by total credit market inquiries will decline about 15% from 2021. The 15% decline versus 2021 is most substantial in the first half of 2022, given the significant slowing we have seen in the U.S. mortgage market already in the second half of '21. Our assumed level of 2022 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries remains over 10% above the average levels we saw over the 2015 to '19 period. The left side of Slide 15 provides perspective on the number of homes that would benefit by 75 basis points or more from refinancing their mortgage at current rates. Despite the substantial refinancing activity that's occurred over the past year and current increases in U.S. treasuries, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing remains at a relatively strong level of about 12 million. Home prices have appreciated significantly over the past 18 months, which has provided many homeowners with cash-out refinancing opportunities, which in past cycles has led to increased refinancing activity from borrowers. For perspective, based upon our most recent data in April, mortgage refinancings remain at just under 1 million a month. As shown on the right side of Slide 15, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. This strong new purchase market is expected to continue throughout '21 and '22. Our 2022 assumption for our U.S. mortgage credit inquiries assumes that we see purchase mortgage financings at levels above the levels we saw in 2020, with refinancings declining significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021. Slide 16 provides our guidance for 4Q '21. We expect revenue in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 10% to 11.8%, including a 0.1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 5.4%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 4Q '21 to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share compared to 4Q '20 adjusted EPS of $2 per share. In 4Q '21, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $45 million or $0.27 per share. Excluding these costs, which were excluded from 4Q '20 adjusted EPS, 4Q '21 adjusted EPS would be $1.99 to $2.09 per share. Slide 17 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially, reflecting our very strong 3Q '21 performance. The acquisitions of Appriss, Health e(fx) and Teletrack are expected to add about $45 million of revenue in the quarter. 2021 revenue of between $4.901 billion and $4.921 billion reflects growth of about 18.7% to 19.2% versus 2020, including a 1.4% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 3.1%. EWS is expected to deliver over 38% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid- to high-single digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. Combined, EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to be up over 18% in 2021, about 25 percentage points stronger than the overall market decline of just over 7%. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 10%. And GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits in 2021. GCS revenue is expected to be up over 5% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These onetime costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2017 through 2020. In 2021, Equifax expects to incur onetime cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $165 million, a reduction of over 50% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of these onetime costs would reduce adjusted EPS by about $1.01 per share. 2021 adjusted EPS of $7.52 to $7.62 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is up 7.8% to 9.3% from 2020. Excluding the impact of tech transformation cost of $1.01 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 would show growth of about 22% to 24% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of about $80 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.50 per share and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about 7 percentage points in '21. We remain confident in our cloud transformation plan and the savings in 2022 and beyond that we have discussed previously with you. Now let's turn to a discussion of an early framework for 2022. Slide 18 provides the macro assumptions behind our 2022 framework. Given the continued significant uncertainties in the overall U.S. and global economy as well as in the U.S. mortgage market, we wanted to provide you with the assumptions we've been using at this stage in developing our framework for 2022. As I discussed previously, we expect the U.S. mortgage market, our proxy for which is U.S. mortgage credit inquiries, to decline about 15% in 2022 relative to 2021. Equifax's U.S. B2B mortgage revenue is expected to continue to significantly outperform the overall mortgage market and show growth in 2022 relative to 2021. Our overall framework is based on a continued U.S. economic recovery that is 2022 GDP growth of about 4% for the full year. We expect our USIS and Workforce Solutions non-mortgage businesses to outperform their underlying markets. We expect Workforce Solutions' UC and ERC businesses to decline by almost 30% in 2022. We also expect that International economies will continue to recover in 2022. Our International businesses are also expected to outperform their underlying markets. Slide 19 provides a view of Equifax's total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022 -- through the 2022 framework. In 4Q 2021, Equifax core revenue growth is expected to be a strong 17%, with core organic revenue growth of about 12%. Almost 2/3 of that core organic growth is driven by non-mortgage growth across all 4 BUs. In 2022, based on the assumptions I just shared, Equifax's total revenue is expected to be up about 8%. We anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 14%, reflecting organic growth of 11% -- organic core growth of 11% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021, which will more than offset the significant headwinds from the assumed declines in the U.S. mortgage market and the UC and ERC businesses. Slide 20 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8% revenue growth in 2022 from the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue framework, 2022 revenue of $5.3 billion. The 15% decline in the U.S. mortgage market and the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC businesses are expected to negatively impact revenue in 2022 by 5.75 percentage points. Core organic revenue growth is anticipated to be over 11%. Non-mortgage core organic growth is expected to drive about 2/3 of the growth. The largest contributor is Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. USIS non-mortgage, International and GCS are also expected to drive core growth. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining about 1/3 of the organic core growth. This is driven by strong outperformance in Workforce Solutions. The acquisitions completed in 2021 are expected to contribute about 3 percentage points of growth to 2022. Slide 21 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 14% growth from the midpoint of the 2021 guidance of $7.57 per share to the midpoint of our 2022 framework of $8.65 per share. Revenue growth of 8% at our 2021 EBITDA margins of about 33.8% would deliver 11% growth in adjusted EPS. In 2022, we expect to deliver EBITDA margin expansion of about 200 basis points. This margin expansion is expected to drive 9% growth in adjusted EPS. This margin expansion is expected to be delivered by the actions we have discussed with you throughout 2021. Our transformation investments will be reduced by about $100 million in 2022, with about half of this reduction or about $50 million being reinvested in new product and other development. We will begin to see net cloud cost savings in 2022 defined as the savings from improving production costs, driven by the decommissioning of our legacy on-prem systems and other improvements in our operations exceeding the cost of running our new cloud-native systems. Margins will also be enhanced by leverage on corporate and G&A. Partly offsetting these benefits to EBITDA are cost increases, particularly in salaries and contracted services as the tight labor market drives cost higher as well as lower EBITDA margins in 2022 from the 2021 acquisitions as we will just be ramping synergies during 2022. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $45 million in 2022, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 2 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the increased debt from our 2021 acquisitions. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.5% does not assume any changes in the U.S. federal tax rate. Should that occur, we will let you know the estimated impact on our 2022 results. As there remains significant uncertainty in underlying market drivers, including the pace of normalization of the U.S. mortgage market and the pace of economic growth worldwide, what we provided today for 2022 is a framework for you to consider. We'll provide formal guidance for 2022 in connection with our 4Q '21 earnings release early next year. Now I would like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. We hope this early view of our framework for 2022 is helpful and reinforces the power of the new Equifax to deliver 14% growth and 8% total growth at the midpoint of our range of thinking, assuming the mortgage market and UC and ERC declines impact our revenue growth by almost 6% in 2022. Stepping back and reviewing the macro trends outlined on Slide 22. These macros have been driving information services for the last decade. Over the last 24 months, we believe most of the macro factors have substantially accelerated. And through our 2021 acquisitions of Appriss, Kount and Teletrack and our EFX Cloud investments advantaged Equifax to benefit from these macro trends. We believe we also have unique levers at Equifax to deliver strong future growth, including Workforce Solutions above market and EFX growth and margins and our expanded focus on new data assets like Appriss Insights, the USIS recovery and non-mortgage growth and Kount ID and fraud growth; the new Equifax Cloud, which is driving our competitiveness NPIs top line and cost savings; and NPIs leveraging Equifax Cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products; and then, of course, M&A to broaden strength in Equifax. These attractive market macros along with the broad Equifax growth levers and our strong core outperformance in the past few years give us the confidence in our ability to deliver above-market growth in the future. Wrapping up on Slide 23. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter. We had strong momentum as we move into the fourth quarter to 2022. We now delivered 7 consecutive quarters of strong, above-market, double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is on offense. We remain confident in our outlook for 2021 and raised our full year midpoint revenue growth rate by approximately 300 basis points to 19% growth for the year. And we also raised our midpoint EPS by $0.22 to $7.57 per share. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter, powering our results, delivering 35% revenue growth and 54% EBITDA margins. EWS is our largest, fastest-growing and most valuable business, and Rudy and his team remain focused on delivering outsized growth. USIS also delivered a strong quarter with 16% non-mortgage growth and 9% organic non-mortgage growth, offsetting the impact of a sharp over 20% decline in the mortgage market. Sid Singh and his USIS team remain competitive and are winning in the marketplace. International grew for the fourth consecutive quarter with 10% growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes outside the United States. We have high expectations for International as we move into 2022. We spent the past 3 years building the Equifax Cloud and are now in the early days of leveraging the new and uniquely Equifax Cloud capabilities. As we move into '22 and beyond, we will increasingly realize the top line cost and cash benefits from these new only Equifax Cloud capabilities. As I mentioned earlier, our 2021 M&A has added $300 million of run rate revenue to Equifax. Reinvesting our strong cash flow in accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. We're now focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing our synergy and growth plans in order to leverage our new data products and capabilities. Our early look at a 2022 financial framework calls for 8% revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth of 14%, assuming a 15% decline in the mortgage market. More importantly, the framework includes strong 14% EFX growth -- core EFX growth. 2022 will be a pivotal year for Equifax as we shift towards leveraging the Equifax Cloud for innovation, new products and growth. And lastly, turning to Slide 24. Many of you have been closely following Equifax for many years and know we've been speaking to you about -- for some time about our plan to have our first Investor Day, which will be our first Investor Day since 2012 and the cyber event. It's been a long time. Let me now turn it over to Dorian, who will give you the details on our November 10 meeting focused on the new Equifax, and then we'll take some questions.\nDorian Hare: Thanks, Mark. I'm energized to announce that our Investor Day will take place on November 10 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time and will be held virtually. We've opened up online registration as of today, and the link to do so on Slide 24 is live. We are very excited to have the opportunity to update you on the progress we have made in making and executing our EFX2023 growth strategy; share with you our long-term financial framework and also our capital allocation plan; speak with you about how we are and will continue to leverage our EFX Cloud capabilities, including by continuing to accelerate our new product innovations; and provide you with overviews of the state of affairs of our business units relayed by their respective leaders. Investor Day will be an important day for our company and stakeholders, and we look forward to speaking with you then. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of David Togut with Evercore.\nDavid Togut: I appreciate the helpful detail in the initial 2022 framework. It appears that you're guiding above consensus for fourth quarter 2021 revenue and for 2022 revenue but somewhat below consensus on earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and for next year. John, you walked through some of the sources of pressure on margin for 2022. But I'm wondering if you could talk more broadly about headwinds and tailwinds so we can understand the variance. Is it really the $50 million, for example, of tech transformation savings that you're reinvesting in the business next year?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. Happy to. So again, as a reminder, right, we're talking about increasing EBITDA margins by -- on the order of 200 basis points, so a substantial increase in 2022 versus 2021, yes. And I think the drivers are what we've been talking about all year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We are reducing substantially tech transformation costs, but we are taking a significant amount of that in the order of $50 million and reinvesting it in NPI and other initiatives to drive growth and to deliver the higher revenue growth you're talking about, that you referenced in your question. Also, we do expect now to start seeing benefits, so net reductions in costs from decoms exceeding our cloud costs, and that will ramp as we go through 2022. And then -- but we are seeing some increased costs related to -- related -- in our COGS, as you would normally expect, related to increased costs for people and increased cost for some systems costs that are reducing 2021 EBITDA margins to a degree. That's not actually that unusual, generally speaking. Generally speaking, we see increased cost every year that we manage through high growth. Next year, part of what's happening, obviously, right, is we're seeing substantial negative impacts on our revenue from the weaker mortgage market as well as the reductions in EC -- sorry, in the UC and ERC markets. So that negative drive in revenue is also somewhat negatively impacting our margin expansion. But overall, 200 basis points of margin expansion next year, we think, is really an outstanding performance, especially given the fact that we're seeing such large declines in the mortgage market and then also the declines in the UC and ERC revenue that we talked about on the order of 30%.\nDavid Togut: Just as a quick follow-up. In your initial 2022 financial framework, you're guiding to 11.3% core organic revenue growth. Within that number, what is your expectation for EWS organic growth? And how do you think about headwinds and tailwinds for EWS next year?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So I think in terms of the details around how the BUs are going to perform next year, we're going to have to ask you to wait until November 10. But Obviously, we expect EWS to continue to perform extremely well.\nMark Begor: You should obviously -- we've been quite clear that we expect Workforce Solutions to grow above the rest of Equifax. So I think you should think about it that way in 2022. I went through -- we've been through many, many times, the multiple levers that Workforce, for example, has as they finish up the year and go into 2022, and records starts at the top of that list. Adding substantial records in the third quarter, those become a benefit through the next year, their new product introductions, continued penetration. There's a lot of levers in that business. USIS, their new deal pipeline is a positive lever going forward. But Workforce is clearly going to be above that -- the rest of Equifax for really as long as we can see in the future from a growth rate standpoint.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Mark, you talked about the vitality index up over 8%. Any sense of where you think that can go to? I mean, obviously, there's been a really significant step-up in the new product innovation. And what that can mean to the organic growth longer term?\nMark Begor: It's clearly a priority, Kevin. As you know, since I joined almost 4 years ago and really in the last, call it, 24 months, we've really stepped up our focus on new products. As you know, we've expanded the team. John and I both talked about it in our comments this morning about continuing to invest there. And of course, the cloud transformation is central to that. That's really -- we're going to get great benefits from the cloud around cost, but we really did it to change our competitiveness. And the big piece of that is the ability to bring new products to market that we couldn't do before through multi-data solutions. And that's really where our focus is, and we're in the early days of really leveraging that. So we see real opportunities going forward. We'll certainly talk in depth in our Investor Day in a couple of weeks around our longer-term outlook for new products. But it's an area that we've invested heavily, foundationally in the cloud. You add to that our existing differentiated data assets, which we've expanded substantially this year with the addition of new data solutions from Appriss, from Kount, from Teletrack and then our focus on new products. We believe it's an important lever for delivering strong future growth going forward, and we'll give you much more detail during our Investor Day.\nKevin McVeigh: And then just real quick on the customer migrations, it seems like you made a lot of progress on that. Where are you in that process? And then are you seeing any incremental step-up in revenue as these customers have cut over? Like is there any way to think about what the revenue impact has been? Just -- I know it's a hard question, but just like what percentage step-up you're seeing as these customers have converted?\nMark Begor: Yes. First on the progress, this is a big undertaking. I think you know that. We talk to you about it every quarter. We try to be quite transparent about the efforts. 2018, '19 and parts of '20 were building the technology. In '20 and '21, we've been heavily focused on implementing that with our customers, the migration. You've seen the great progress. We still got more to do. And we were clear that we expect North America, which is Canada, U.S. and EWS and USIS and, of course, TCS to be substantially complete as we get in 2022 and really complete the migrations next year. So we can see the finish line, but there's still plenty of work to do in the coming months to complete that. With regards to our impact commercially, there's a number of layers on that. And this is another area -- our intent is to go in substantial detail about how we think about that, what we're seeing during our Investor Day. We'll have our Chief Technology leader and product leader, Bryson Koehler, as well as the business unit leaders will talk about that. But you're starting to see some of the early days of that, in our view. The strong core growth, the ability to roll out new products are driving our competitiveness and driving our ability to drive our core growth. And there's no question, when we sit down with customers, we believe we're advantaged having a new tech stack that's in the cloud that can deliver 9-9s of stability, meaning very high, always-on stability, deliver data more quickly to our customers. We can deliver new products to them more quickly. It just changes who we are as a company, and it allows us to be a different company. So it's quite central to how we think about the new Equifax going forward, and it will be central to our long-term growth framework that we'll share with you in a couple of weeks.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company.\nKyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch on the U.S. auto market. I know there's been a lot of concerns over chip shortages and supply constraints potentially impacting auto credit. Thinking out [indiscernible] that it's been a little bit of a headwind to Canada, but what are you guys seeing in the U.S., particularly in the USIS segment for auto credit?\nMark Begor: Yes, similar, we could have and should have commented on that in the U.S. also. There's no question that the supply shortages are impacting the ability for consumers to identify cars or get cars, new and used and then, of course, the financing that comes with that and the business we get from that. What's been offsetting that to some regard, not fully, but is our continued penetration of new products and new solutions, like Workforce Solutions continuing to grow the use of TWN data in the auto space has been a positive. Would you add anything, John?\nJohn Gamble: No, I'd say that covers it. And we're -- the good news is we're continuing to grow in USIS and auto on an organic basis even in the headwinds of the difficult market. But yes, it certainly isn't at the pace that we expected when we started the year.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on EWS. Obviously, good to see really strong record growth in TWN and continued share gains. Moving forward, how should we think about records growth? I know you guys mentioned a few additional payroll processing partnerships in the pipeline. But how should we think about records and kind of a greenfield between some of these alternative data sources like gig workers and pension versus traditional W-2 records that you guys are going to see as prospects?\nMark Begor: Yes. It's obviously an important focus of Rudy and the Workforce Solutions team. You've seen continued success there. And remember, we've got 2, really, levers for growth. First, our Employer Services business, which is large and comprehensive as we've delivered new solutions to HR managers around I-9 or HSA or W-2 or WOTC, all the other services. We access payroll records. So that's a very powerful engine for us to go to individual companies to obtain records. And of course, we feel like we have some real momentum in adding the payroll processors that are not with us and going after the traditional nonfarm payroll. There's still 60 million-plus consumers or individuals that are available for us in the traditional nonfarm, and we're chasing that. So that's one. And of course, with records being up 12% in the quarter, that is a very strong lever for growth that translates pretty directly into revenue because of higher hit rates. As you point out, there's also a larger universe, the nonfarm payroll, the 160 million, 170 million that are in nonfarm payroll, the gig workers as well as pension recipients. Those are 2 big areas. There's 40 million to 50 million gig workers. So we're working different strategies to obtain those records and then the same with pension recipients. So there's a long runway from our roughly 60% of nonfarm payroll. If you include self-employed and gig in there, it's much less than the 60% to continue to grow our records, which is a very unique business growth lever for our business to continue to add new data assets because, as you know, in our system-to-system integrations in Workforce Solutions, we're getting the inquiries. We can only fulfill those that we have records on. And as we grow our records, they become monetized tomorrow afternoon. So that's very powerful. And the scale of Workforce gives us the ability to have large, dedicated teams both on the partnership side and on the direct side through Employer Services to continue to grow our records. And we'll likely talk a little bit at Investor Day about our International expansion, which, as you know, we're already in Canada, Australia and India. And those businesses are also growing their records, leveraging the core tech stack that we have from Workforce Solutions in the U.S. but also relationships that we have, either with multinationals or with payroll processors and, of course, growing those records locally. So big, big focus and big opportunity going forward. When you think about records, I think about us being in kind of middle innings still as far as the opportunity for Workforce Solutions. And these take time. The payroll processor we signed last week, we were probably talking to them for 3 years. It takes time to get organized around that. But there's real momentum particularly in that area of acquisition because so many others have signed up with Equifax and are having a positive experience. We're seeing real momentum there in adding other processors.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen and Company.\nGeorgios Mihalos: I appreciate you're willing to go out to 2022 in this environment. Very helpful as always. I guess, first question for me, John, if we can kind of circle back to the first question, just as it relates around margins for '22. I think you had said previously savings from redundancies and obviously, the tech transformation, we're going to be about, call it, $150 million. You're reinvesting $50 million of that now, it sounds like, so net $100 million. That roughly, by my math, gets us to kind of the 36% margin at sort of the high end, the 200 basis point increase. Is the reason why margins aren't expected to be higher than that, that the natural margin expansion within the business is being offset by some dilution from M&A and just sort of higher inflation-related expenses as it relates to wages? Is that roughly the way to think about it?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So George, as I walked through in my comments, right, so you're absolutely right. So we indicated we were going to -- we would improve our cost structure by -- on the order of $100 million by taking down transformation costs. And then we also said we'd improve our cost structure as we drove net savings, right, as decom and other cost reduction efforts drove us -- or exceeded cloud. And so we absolutely have indicated we're going to deliver on those savings, and we're still committed to delivering substantial savings in both of those areas in 2022 and beyond. But you are correct. Also, as I mentioned in my comments, we're reinvesting a substantial portion of that $50 million in new development and new development-related activities. Also, if you think about what's going on, given the fact that we're seeing a 600 basis point headwind, like the natural growth that you'd see in our underlying business that has the very high variable margins, that's somewhat lower than you would see in a period in which mortgage is not as negative as you're talking about. And you're correct, right, we're getting a nice bump from growth in acquisitions next year. But the EBITDA margins on those acquisitions in their first year is substantially lower than the contribution margin we get by growing our internal data assets. So when you kind of line all that stuff up and you include the fact that we are seeing cost increases as we do every year, right, that's certainly something we see every year, but there is a tighter labor market, so there's an expectation that some of those cost increases will be greater. When you line all those items up, you end up at about a 200 basis point increase is where we're comfortable talking about right now. Also, I just want to remind everybody, 200 basis points, right, and again, a 6% reduction in mortgage and UC, ERC is really a substantial improvement. We feel very good about delivering that. And so hopefully, the investment community can look at it in that vein.\nMark Begor: And George, I would add to that, we'll obviously talk about a long-term framework for revenue and margins in a couple of weeks. And we've been quite clear that we see a lot of ability to grow the top line -- or we're confident in our ability to grow our top line long term at above-market level as well as expand our margins. And we've also been very clear that while we have the ability to expand margins over the long-term basis, we're also going to invest in the business. We have the ability to invest in new products. And obviously, the tech transformation, which we're completing, it has really high leverage in driving the top line. So we'll continue to have that balance going forward of expanding margins while investing in the future of Equifax.\nGeorgios Mihalos: Okay. Great. I appreciate that because I think that's what's weighing on the stock this morning. So really, really appreciate you are breaking it down like that. And then just quickly, Mark, I think if I caught it correctly, you talked about as it relates to record growth going after some more of these -- what I think of as more unbanked individuals, gig workers and the like. Can you talk about the challenges or how you go about sourcing data from that constituency as opposed to traditional W-2 worker and the like? Is it going to require sort of a different effort in terms of going after like fintechs to partner with? Or how are you thinking about that?\nMark Begor: Yes. First, our primary focus is to continue to grow W-2 income kind of payroll records, and you see that we've had strong success in that over the last couple of years. And certainly again in the quarter, we're continuing to add to that. There's still a long runway there. When you think about 60 million, 70 million of additional individuals that are not in our data set that are inside of that, so that's kind of a primary focus. And then as you point out, we're expanding into gig. Some of the same relationships we have, companies process on their own contractor payroll, we'll be able to pick that up. Some payroll processors have kind of self-employed solutions where there's an ability to pick up data that way. There's other HR software providers that will help us through partnerships lead to some of those kind of records. And of course, the pensioner income at 20 million to 30 million comes from individual companies that process their own pension income or other companies that do that for companies. So we've got a multifaceted approach on that. Really, the point we make in identifying that is that our lens is wider now, and there's still a long runway of this important lever to grow records Workforce Solutions. As you know, we don't talk about adding data assets in our other businesses. What's unique about Workforce is that it's only a decade old, and it only has 60% of nonfarm payroll, so there's a ton of room to grow. And then that gets bigger, as we both pointed out, as you add gig and pension into that space.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: I wanted to start with Appriss. At the time of the acquisition, you had talked about strong accretion in '22 from that deal along with the Health e(fx) and Teletrack acquisitions. I guess, how much is embedded in your '22 EPS expectations from the deals? And maybe you could help with some of the assumptions behind the significant accretion because I think some investors and myself were getting a little bit more neutral.\nJohn Gamble: So it's absolutely accretive in 2022. Certainly, I'm not going to give a specific number for the level of accretion for the acquisitions. But kind of similar to the response I just gave with regard to margin movements, so we do expect good EBITDA margins from those acquisitions. And the level of margin that we're generating from that certainly exceeds the cost of the interest expense, which we also detailed in our revenue book. So we're seeing nice accretion, and so -- which would be consistent with strong from what we talked about back in August. But just in general, right, the level of margins we look at from an acquired company like Appriss or anybody else in the first year out, the incremental margin we generate from those companies isn't anywhere near the level of incremental margin we generate from incremental organic sales at Equifax. So the reason why they're somewhat dilutive to our EBITDA margin in total is because of the fact that the variable margin we achieved on our direct sales is certainly substantially higher than the level of margin we generate from the acquired company in its first year out.\nToni Kaplan: Got it. And then just looking at the revenue trends in the appendix, look like non-mortgage online info in U.S. was good at positive 15%, but it did decelerate relative to last quarter. Is that because of the auto softness? Or are there other verticals that are impacting that as well? And it does seem like the banks are talking about the lending environment getting better. Are you expecting that in the fourth quarter or next year? It did look like in your levers page, your macro levers page that maybe it gets better. But I'm just trying to understand sort of how much that is going to be a driver and what you're seeing in the lending environment.\nJohn Gamble: I think the biggest driver of the growth rates that you're looking at really is the fact that in 2020, we saw a meaningful improvement in the third quarter relative to the second, right? So the growth rate in the second quarter of 2020, as we talked about when we did the release, was elevated partially because of the fact that it was such a weak quarter and we saw some improvements in the third quarter last year, right? So that's part of what's driving the fact that the -- that's a significant driver of what's driving the growth rates to be down. But in terms of overall performance, I think as Mark referenced, we feel good about banking and lending. We have a nice growth there in the quarter, again, as we -- we had nice growth in insurance, nice growth in commercial. Identity and fraud was strong. And importantly, Financial Marketing Services was very strong, right? So -- but again, as you look into the fourth quarter, similarly to what I just talked about the fourth quarter of last year was a nice improvement from the third quarter. So we'll have some of the grow-over effects that we talked about in the third quarter. But we continue to believe we're going to see nice non-mortgage growth in USIS in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: My first question was just going to be on the talent solutions business. Obviously, as it gets to become a bigger and bigger piece of Workforce Solutions, I think you said 30% of non-mortgage. Just wondering how you think about the cyclicality of that business. We've talked about the tight labor market. But as you're thinking about '22 in particular and embedding that type of growth or some level of growth for that business, how do you think about new product innovation relative to existing client growth or hiring activity and how that impacts performance in that business over a shorter time frame?\nMark Begor: Yes. First, I think the underlying macro of 75 million people changing jobs every year, that macro doesn't really change much over time, meaning lots of people change jobs, and that may go up or down at some. But underlying that is that there's some level of data used in each of those job moves. So that's a macro that's quite good. The other thing that's changing that we think is going to be a permanent change is the desire by companies to complete that process more quickly. Meaning they've made an offer to someone getting them on the floor in the warehouse or the factory or in the retail establishment or in the restaurant in hours or days versus weeks. And the only way to do that is through instant decisioning. So I think that's the fundamental structural change in the business, the ability to use data to speed up the processes. For us, what we're really having the growth in is building out this data hub, which remember is only a year old or whatever. We're starting to leverage the 4.5, 5 jobs we have in the average American from our TWN database. Remember 0.5 billion of historical records and then adding to it new data elements like Appriss Insights, like medical credentialing, the National Student Clearinghouse of Education, that's all new turf for Equifax. As we combine those, you're going to see products coming out. You already are. We're rolling out new products quite rapidly for talent solutions where we have different solutions of more or less historical data. And we'll move to, in the coming year, solutions that are more targeted to specific jobs, a job that requires what was your last employer, what was your last 2 employers, verifying your licenses, verifying where did you go to school. Some jobs require that, some don't. So we'll come up with solutions that will be packaged to speed up that process for the background screeners and the hiring managers in order to speed up the ability to hire that individual more quickly. So we see a lot of opportunity for growth in that. That's a $5 billion TAM. Our business is quite small when you think about $5 billion worth of data. And that's why we're investing through new products and through innovation and, of course, through the acquisitions that we've made or the new partnerships like the National Student Clearinghouse.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. That's helpful. And then just 2 quick modeling questions. The first was, I think the legacy system savings that you had outlined in prior investor presentations was $85 million year-over-year. I just want to make sure that's still the number to think about. And then also, if you wouldn't mind speaking to whether or not the SSA contract was fully ramped this quarter.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So in terms of modeling, again, for 2022, what I'd ask you to focus on is the guidance we just gave, right? So what we try to do is give you a fairly detailed walk from this year to next year. And obviously, there's a lot of moving parts in what's driving our EBITDA margin movement, which was some of the questions we had earlier. So I ask would be a focus on the walk we gave in the 200 basis points of margin expansion when you think about 2022 relative to 2021.\nMark Begor: And on SSA in our comments, we -- I noted that we launched the program. We started delivering data to them at kind of early levels. And we expect that to ramp as we go through the fourth quarter and into 2022 and get to run rate sometime in 2022. It's a substantial and positive contract for us, but it's in the start-up mode now, which is positive to have it started after a lot of years of building this new solution and getting it integrated with SSA.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: My question is just around the integration of the M&A you've done. You kind of talked about 2022 seeing synergies roll through. Could you just give us examples maybe what integration is yet to come? What's behind you? And then when do you reengage in the M&A market? Is it more of a -- can you do that next year? Or is sort of we wait until this integration is done and then you get back more aggressive on M&A? Just any thoughts on that.\nMark Begor: Yes. No. We're actively -- as you know, we have completed 8 acquisitions this year and a couple of them substantial, particularly Kount and Appriss. We're much further along on integrating Kount, as you might imagine, because we completed that deal in the first quarter. Appriss was only completed a couple of weeks ago, so we're still early days of starting that integration. The cloud allows us to integrate more quickly. And as you know, our focus is to bring their unique data into our single data fabric. So that's underway with all of the acquisitions in order to drive their growth going forward. And we're seeing in Kount early positive days of top line synergies and very pleased with the plan on that acquisition. And we're very energized about Appriss and, of course, all the other acquisitions that we completed. The synergies from these acquisitions, I think we've been very clear when we announced the acquisitions, come in over multiple years. They start in year 1, like in 2021, there's some early synergies, they build. And year 2, in this case, 2022 for those 2 acquisitions and then they'll continue. And we've talked about kind of year 5 synergies in some of the acquisitions being quite substantial, and those build over time as you roll out the new solutions, the new products and fully integrate the business into our cloud capabilities and our single data fabric. With regards to your second question, we were clear when we announced Appriss a couple of months ago that we were going to pause on substantial M&A for a number of quarters, number one, to focus on integration; and number two, to bring our leverage back in line. So to answer your question, we would expect to be back doing M&A in the latter half of 2022 or somewhere in that time frame. We haven't stopped our corporate dev team of continuing to be in the market to look for M&A that would be a meaningful and accretive. And I hope you get a sense that we're quite disciplined about the kind of M&A we want to do. We've been very clear for a number of years about acquisitions we want to do around differentiated data, identity and fraud and broadening and strengthening Workforce Solutions. And the deals we've done this year have checked all those boxes, and you should expect the deals going forward to do the same. And also with the financial discipline that over the long term, they're accretive to our long-term growth rates and into our margins. We want to do deals that strengthen Equifax, broaden Equifax, but also enhance our financials and drive shareholder value.\nHamzah Mazari: That's very helpful. And just a follow-up question. Just on the International business. I know you flagged your expectation of Australia GDP for 2022. But any -- do you expect to see benefits from the tech transformation on the International business as early as next year? Or does that come a bit later?\nMark Begor: Most of it comes later, although Canada is well down the path of their tech transformation. They should get some benefits in '22. And there's some early benefits in U.K. and Spain and Australia as we get into 2022. But the bulk of that is going to really come particularly in Latin America in the latter parts of the year as we get into 2023.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Two questions. The first one, could you just tell us how much mortgage revenues as a percentage of total third quarter Equifax revenues there was? My second question is about tech transformation expense. I want to know if you can indicate what the tech transformation expense drag on '22 EPS is compared to the $1.01, the $1.01 for '21, which is referenced on Slide 7, Footnote 5.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So in terms of the mortgage as a percent of total, it's just under 32%, and that's obviously down significantly from where it was last year, and it will go down again in the fourth quarter. So in terms of tech transformation expense, I think what we've indicated is that this year, we expect to incur about $165 million, and that's how you get to the $1.01. And we've indicated that we expect to reduce by about $100 million. It's not a perfect number, right, but by about $100 million next year. So that would be on the order to -- on the order of $60 million to $65 million next year. But obviously, we'll refine that as we move through the fourth quarter and give you a really formal guidance as we get into early next year.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Your 3Q revenues beat guidance by about $50 million, while your full year guidance increased by about $130 million at the midpoint. I know Appriss is adding $150 million in annual revenue. But how much of the increase in the guide above the 3Q outperformance is due to contributions from Appriss and other acquisitions versus improved assumed performance in 4Q with the underlying business?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. I think we indicated in our prepared remarks, it's about $45 million.\nMark Begor: In the fourth quarter.\nJohn Gamble: In the fourth quarter. Sorry.\nMark Begor: Acquisitions, George.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Got it. And the remainder from performance -- outperformance in the underlying business?\nMark Begor: Correct.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. And then in your slides, you mentioned that USIS non-mortgage is expected to outperform the underlying margins in 2022. How much of that outperformance is due to M&A? And how much is due to organic outperformance versus underlying markets?\nMark Begor: You're breaking up, but I think your question, George, was in 2022, our mortgage outperformance, how much is from M&A versus the core business. Is that right?\nGeorge Tong: Yes, versus organic. Yes.\nMark Begor: Yes, it's substantially all organic.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So if the question was non-mortgage in USIS, then our statement was intended to be organic, right? So we're expecting them to outperform their core market on an organic basis.\nMark Begor: And the Workforce Solutions acquisitions are -- really don't have an impact on their outperformance in mortgage.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Meuler with Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes. On '22 margins, are you viewing '22 as a year where it's still pretty depressed by onetime expenses? Or are you viewing it as a good kind of underlying baseline where there's always going to be some puts and takes? I guess there's still $65 million of TTI on top of that. I think even though the net cloud costs are going down, there's still probably some fairly material duplicative systems cost that you can work down over time. Not trying to ask if you're at peak margin because I know you can increase margins at the acquired businesses, you have good incrementals on organic. But just trying to understand if you're viewing '22 as still a fairly depressed figure or if it's a good underlying for us to consider how we go forward from thereon.\nMark Begor: Well, I'll start on that one, and John can jump in. We'll -- in a couple of weeks in our Investor Day presentation, we'll certainly give you our long-term framework around top line and margin growth. And we've been very clear, you should expect that to include our ability to grow our margins going forward. And '22 is clearly -- I don't know if you want to call it still a transitionary year. There's -- you've got the mortgage market impact, obviously. And then as you point out, we still have substantial cloud transformation costs in 2022. So we're not at a normal run rate in 2022. John?\nJohn Gamble: No, you covered it, right? So we just -- I think we just had an earlier question about how much transformation expense was still -- investment was still in 2022, and we gave a number of -- we're at $165 million this year, and we said we'd reduce by about $100 million, so that's still in the P&L next year. And then also, we are delivering cloud savings. So our net cloud cost over decommissioning is a positive next year. But we've given a long-term model where we expect to deliver substantial savings when the cloud transformation is complete. We're still committed to that, right? So the exact timing as you move through any given year, obviously, moves around a lot based on decommissionings and the pace of ramp of individual systems. So it's hard to be specific in any -- about any specific number as far as 15 months out. But we are absolutely committed to delivering a net savings next year versus the net cost this year. And then also there's substantial savings still to come as we get through 2022 and then -- and into '23 and '24. Obviously, those don't complete until we complete the International transformation.\nJeffrey Meuler: Very helpful. And then we get asked a lot about BNPL and if it's cannibalistic to card, including from a bureau transaction or underwriting perspective. I would expect you to have a pretty unique view into that given Australia is a more developed BNPL market, plus you obviously have a nice bureau share there. So would just love your thoughts on BNPL and over time, if you'd expect it to be cannibalistic to card or not.\nMark Begor: That's a different question about cannibalistic card. As far as a card issuer, I think some card issuers are probably seeing some pressure from BNPL, meaning consumers are using that instead of using their credit card to make purchases. When it comes to Equifax and our industry is providing data, BNPL, we sell a bunch of identity data to BNPL players around the globe. And increasingly, they're starting to use alternative data as a part of their underwriting, even in some -- many cases, credit data, meaning credit file data going forward. So I think if you look at the total pie on consumers using cash or debit versus BNPL and credit, the pie is growing, meaning consumers are using this as another way to finance their purchases, which from an Equifax perspective, we view as a good thing. And we've got discussions with all of the BNPL players about using our data and our identity data because you have to verify the identity of the consumer before you offer them financing even on a pair of jeans, so going forward. So we view it as a net positive for the credit bureaus and Equifax.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: John, I agree the 200 basis point margin expansion is obviously strong given all the headwinds. But I was hoping you could just help us maybe with some order of magnitude. I heard 3 things that are the tight labor market and that increase in cost, the acquisition impact and then the 600 basis point decline in EC and UC revenues or whatever. So like how much of a headwind were each of those?\nMark Begor: I would start with number one is that, Manav, we're continuing to invest more next year than this year. We're intending to around new products innovation, DNA, customer growth. We see real leverage in doing that. So John talked about that. Go ahead, John.\nJohn Gamble: Absolutely. Look, Manav, I'm not going to size them specifically, right? But we referenced them because they're all meaningful to us, right? So they're all impacting margins. But again, 200 basis points increase in a market where there's 600 basis points of headwinds from mortgage and then obviously UC and ERC, which is we think is a very good outcome. So we think we're delivering substantial savings from reduction in transformation. And as we indicated, we will start delivering savings on net -- sorry, net cloud relative to decom and other cost savings. So we feel good about the direction we're headed, and we feel good about delivering 200 basis points of growth.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just some modeling items, just so that we get the directional numbers right. Could you just give us what the 2021 EC and UC revenues were so that we can model that 30% decline? And then the same thing, I guess, the D&A, interest expense and CapEx, please?\nJohn Gamble: For the third quarter? I think we gave it in the script. I think we...\nManav Patnaik: No, for 2021, like what is the number? Just so that we can do the 2022 modeling, you gave us some changes.\nJohn Gamble: So I understand the question. So we'll think about that. Obviously, we're going to be together again in a little over 2 weeks, and perhaps we can provide a bridge. But we gave -- I think we gave details on a 30% reduction. We said the 30% reduction was 1.25% of revenue. so I think between those 2 numbers, you'll get pretty close to the exact number, but we haven't disclosed it yet. But -- and I apologize, I don't have it at my fingertips. But I think with those 2 pieces of information, you can get really close to the UC and ERC revenue in '21 and 2022.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital.\nAshish Sabadra: Two questions. First one is on pricing. You obviously have a very strong pricing power, and there were some pretty good pricing increases in the verification business. How do we think about pricing increases going forward? And then just second one, on the $50 million of investment, how do we think about that investment? I know you talked a lot about it. But is this like a onetime investment? Or should we think about having this like $50 million investment every year over the next several years? So color on both fronts.\nMark Begor: Yes. And so on the investment one, we will continue to balance as we have, since I've been here, balance growing our margins while investing in the business. And the $50 million that was referenced is areas where we see opportunities to continue to grow our investments in new products and DNA in order to drive our top line, and that's really around leveraging the cloud. I'll leave the long-term discussion until a couple of weeks on November 10 during Investor Day, where we can talk in more detail about that balance. But we've been very clear that we expect our margin -- we expect to expand our margins going forward while investing in Equifax. And there'll be a balance there that we think is the right thing for Equifax and for our shareholders over the long term. John, do you want to take the first question? Your first question was around verification revenue, and you want...\nAshish Sabadra: That's right, the pricing power.\nMark Begor: Pricing, yes, yes. The pricing is one lever that we use across Equifax. Workforce clearly has more pricing power than our other businesses. And we expect to have price be a positive for us in 2022, and that's inside our early framework. And of course, we've got many, many other levers that we focus even more strongly on. New products is a big one in verification. Of course, the number of polls penetration, those will all drive the business and, of course, records underlie driving verification.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Maybe if you could touch on your personal finance area and the credit cards area within your traditional credit bureau business. How did that do in the quarter? What's your near-term outlook for that, please?\nMark Begor: Yes. I don't think we gave any real specific details on it. I can give you some color is that as we expected coming out of COVID, we expected cards and P loans to see some positive momentum, which we have, particularly around marketing. As you know, the card issuers and P loan issuers in 2020 really stopped a lot of the marketing because of the uncertainty around where the consumer was going to be. And now as you got into 2021 and certainly through the third quarter, we've seen an increase in marketing. You've seen that in our numbers. A lot of our marketing performance in USIS is from cards and some from P loans. And we expect to see issuers continue to try to acquire more customers and build up their balance sheets, which have come down as consumers have been paying down a lot of balances. So there's quite a bit of marketing activity going on, and we expect that to continue in the future.\nJohn Gamble: The bulk of our -- the bulk of that business for us, obviously, is in banking and lending. And Mark talked about the growth we're seeing in banking in the third quarter and second quarter, right? So we've seen double-digit growth both quarters.\nCraig Huber: I appreciate that. My follow-up question on the Global Consumer Solutions area, maybe just touch on your outlook there, the next couple of quarters, if you could, in the direct versus the indirect side. I think you just sort of touched on a little bit right there but just go a little further detail on that.\nMark Begor: Yes. I think we talked in our comments that we expect the partner business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. It was clearly impacted by the tightening of originations by a lot of their customers, and on the direct business, we expect the same.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.\nGary Bisbee: I wanted to go back to records growth for a minute, and you've had tremendous success with the payroll channel. And it sounds like you've got maybe at this point, the three major players. I know there's some reasonably chunky players after that, but then it fragments my understanding pretty quickly. Is that enough to continue to deliver double-digit records growth? And I guess, how meaningful at the moment or over the next 12 to 24 months or some of these other opportunities like the 1099 workers or pensions? And are there other sort of types of players beyond payroll that have data that could further -- you could do deals with to further support growth of records? Look, we get why it's been unbelievable. I guess I'm just not certain if payroll being a big piece of that can drive the next few years like it has the last few.\nMark Begor: So Gary, as we've talked about, we get the bulk of our records through our Employer Services business, and that's a steady increase in records, and 60% of our records come from that. So that's clearly a base area of focus where we have a dedicated team on the partnership side. They can be a little bit lumpy when you bring in a larger payroll processor. But there's still a lot of runway in that vertical, if you want to call it that, of continuing to expand those partnerships. And as we said, we've got continued momentum there and very active dialogues about them wanting to join. Another area for records is around HR software partnerships where they have access to records because of the software being embedded in an individual company. Both companies, as you know, process their own payroll. Some use their own systems, but most use some third-party systems. So that's another avenue for us in order to access records. And then we talked about our focus on gig and pension to go even further as far as our record addition. So we see a lot of runway in our ability to continue to grow records, which is, as you know, is a very valuable lever for top and bottom line growth at Workforce Solutions.\nGary Bisbee: And then just one more on that topic. You mentioned new products a lot. And I know a few times in the past, you've talked about substantially higher-priced products like $100, $150, $200 versus $10 and $20 or whatever the typical. But can you give us just maybe an example of one that is in the market driving revenue, what the price point is or what is unique about the new offering versus the traditional levels of income and employment? I just would love...\nMark Begor: Yes, sure. There's a bunch of them. I'll give you a couple in mortgage. In mortgage, our typical solution is a report that shows current income and employment, and it verifies that. And that might sell for $20 to $40, somewhere in that range. And as you know, because we have the 0.5 billion of historical records, in some mortgage applications, the complexity of the consumers' income, let's say, that they've changed jobs recently, so they don't have a lot of job history. Or let's say, that they get a lot of incentive-based income, he's either a salesperson or some other incentive-based income, meaning it's lumpy when the income comes in. They get it at the end of the year. And many of those solutions, you require more history. So we have it. So instead of selling that, call it, $20 to $40 solution, we'll sell a solution that has 24 months or 36 months or even 48 months, all different products, and those price points are in the $100, $150, $200 range, meaning substantially higher, and again, leveraging our historical data. Another mortgage solution is Mortgage Duo, which we rolled out in the last couple of months. Some mortgage applications have 2 income owners on it, a husband and wife using that example. And in the old solution, and it's still used, the originator would pull on the husband for $20 to $40 and then on the wife for $20 to $40 using that kind of a couple. We have a solution now that's priced between, I think, $175 and $200. It provides both reports at the same time. It also allows, I think, in that solution, a second poll somewhere in the mortgage application process. So substantially above the price point and again, delivering value to the originator because they're looking for speed and looking to complete it quickly. That's really the solution there. Turning to I-9, we've got an I-9 solution that typically, John, the I-9 traditional is in the $10 to $20 range?\nJohn Gamble: More like $30 to $40.\nMark Begor: $30 to $40.\nJohn Gamble: I-9, sorry, you're right, $10 to $20.\nMark Begor: $10 to $20 range is I-9, and we've got a new solution we've talked about the last couple of quarters that we rolled out that's an I-9 anywhere that allows the applicant to complete it on an Equifax app, the I-9 process, and then go verify it at a couple of thousand different sites across the United States that we do through our partnership. And that solution instead of being in, call it, that $10 range is in the $75 to $100 range, providing real value. Now the value is to that applicant and the employer to speed up the I-9 process so that individual can get on the job, on the floor, in the factory, in the restaurant. So a couple of different solutions in talent, same thing. We're starting to have solutions instead of just pulling a where does Mark work now solution, having more history because some employers want that. Some employers want where is Mark working now or the job that he's leaving. They want to verify that. Others will want to verify employment for the last 2 or 3 or 4 jobs. And as we mentioned earlier, we're going to be productizing a more comprehensive solutions that combine not only work history from our TWN database to 0.5 billion records that we have or the average 4.5 jobs on the average American. That work history, we're going to be adding to it incarceration data from Appriss, medical licensing and credentialing data from Appriss, university, secondary education college degrees from National Student Clearinghouse. Those will all be productized in a solution that will deliver more value, deliver more speed and at a higher price point than the individual solutions because of the value that it adds in speeding up that process. So those are all some examples of where we're focused on. And these are all driven by the new Equifax Cloud. These are things that would have been very challenging to do with the pace that we're doing it. In this case, we're talking mostly about Workforce Solutions, but the same across Equifax.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Dorian Hare for any closing remarks.\nDorian Hare: Thank you for joining today's call. Looking forward to joining you again for a robust discussion when we have our Investor Day on November 10.

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, our 3Q results were very strong and much stronger than we discussed with you in July, with revenue about $50 million higher than the midpoint of the expectation we shared. For perspective, the strength was driven by our U.S. B2B businesses, principally Workforce Solutions and also USIS. Workforce Solutions Verification Services was stronger than discussed in July, principally in non-mortgage and talent solutions, card and auto as well as, to a lesser extent, in mortgage. Workforce Solutions employee retention credit and unemployment claims revenue was stronger than we discussed in July. We expect the strength in ERC to continue in the fourth quarter. USIS was also somewhat stronger than we discussed in July. The strength in mortgage relative to our discussion in July was partially a reflection of the mortgage market being down 21% versus the down 23% we discussed in July. Workforce Solutions' outperformance relative to the mortgage market was also stronger than we expected. This strong revenue drove upside in adjusted EPS relative to the expectations that we shared in July. Before discussing our increased guidance for 2021 and providing a framework for you to consider for 2022, let's briefly discuss our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market. As shown on Slide 14, we are expecting the 21% year-to-year decline in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries that we saw in the third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter, with the fourth quarter down about 20%. This results in 2021 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries being down just over 7% from 2020, slightly better than the down somewhat under 8% we discussed with you in July. For 2022, based on trends we are seeing in new purchase and refinance that I will discuss shortly, our 2022 framework assumes the U.S. mortgage market as measured by total credit market inquiries will decline about 15% from 2021. The 15% decline versus 2021 is most substantial in the first half of 2022, given the significant slowing we have seen in the U.S. mortgage market already in the second half of '21. Our assumed level of 2022 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries remains over 10% above the average levels we saw over the 2015 to '19 period. The left side of Slide 15 provides perspective on the number of homes that would benefit by 75 basis points or more from refinancing their mortgage at current rates. Despite the substantial refinancing activity that's occurred over the past year and current increases in U.S. treasuries, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing remains at a relatively strong level of about 12 million. Home prices have appreciated significantly over the past 18 months, which has provided many homeowners with cash-out refinancing opportunities, which in past cycles has led to increased refinancing activity from borrowers. For perspective, based upon our most recent data in April, mortgage refinancings remain at just under 1 million a month. As shown on the right side of Slide 15, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. This strong new purchase market is expected to continue throughout '21 and '22. Our 2022 assumption for our U.S. mortgage credit inquiries assumes that we see purchase mortgage financings at levels above the levels we saw in 2020, with refinancings declining significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021. Slide 16 provides our guidance for 4Q '21. We expect revenue in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 10% to 11.8%, including a 0.1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 5.4%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 4Q '21 to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share compared to 4Q '20 adjusted EPS of $2 per share. In 4Q '21, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $45 million or $0.27 per share. Excluding these costs, which were excluded from 4Q '20 adjusted EPS, 4Q '21 adjusted EPS would be $1.99 to $2.09 per share. Slide 17 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially, reflecting our very strong 3Q '21 performance. The acquisitions of Appriss, Health e(fx) and Teletrack are expected to add about $45 million of revenue in the quarter. 2021 revenue of between $4.901 billion and $4.921 billion reflects growth of about 18.7% to 19.2% versus 2020, including a 1.4% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 3.1%. EWS is expected to deliver over 38% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid- to high-single digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. Combined, EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to be up over 18% in 2021, about 25 percentage points stronger than the overall market decline of just over 7%. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 10%. And GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits in 2021. GCS revenue is expected to be up over 5% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These onetime costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2017 through 2020. In 2021, Equifax expects to incur onetime cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $165 million, a reduction of over 50% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of these onetime costs would reduce adjusted EPS by about $1.01 per share. 2021 adjusted EPS of $7.52 to $7.62 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is up 7.8% to 9.3% from 2020. Excluding the impact of tech transformation cost of $1.01 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 would show growth of about 22% to 24% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of about $80 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.50 per share and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about 7 percentage points in '21. We remain confident in our cloud transformation plan and the savings in 2022 and beyond that we have discussed previously with you. Now let's turn to a discussion of an early framework for 2022. Slide 18 provides the macro assumptions behind our 2022 framework. Given the continued significant uncertainties in the overall U.S. and global economy as well as in the U.S. mortgage market, we wanted to provide you with the assumptions we've been using at this stage in developing our framework for 2022. As I discussed previously, we expect the U.S. mortgage market, our proxy for which is U.S. mortgage credit inquiries, to decline about 15% in 2022 relative to 2021. Equifax's U.S. B2B mortgage revenue is expected to continue to significantly outperform the overall mortgage market and show growth in 2022 relative to 2021. Our overall framework is based on a continued U.S. economic recovery that is 2022 GDP growth of about 4% for the full year. We expect our USIS and Workforce Solutions non-mortgage businesses to outperform their underlying markets. We expect Workforce Solutions' UC and ERC businesses to decline by almost 30% in 2022. We also expect that International economies will continue to recover in 2022. Our International businesses are also expected to outperform their underlying markets. Slide 19 provides a view of Equifax's total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022 -- through the 2022 framework. In 4Q 2021, Equifax core revenue growth is expected to be a strong 17%, with core organic revenue growth of about 12%. Almost 2/3 of that core organic growth is driven by non-mortgage growth across all 4 BUs. In 2022, based on the assumptions I just shared, Equifax's total revenue is expected to be up about 8%. We anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 14%, reflecting organic growth of 11% -- organic core growth of 11% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021, which will more than offset the significant headwinds from the assumed declines in the U.S. mortgage market and the UC and ERC businesses. Slide 20 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8% revenue growth in 2022 from the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue framework, 2022 revenue of $5.3 billion. The 15% decline in the U.S. mortgage market and the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC businesses are expected to negatively impact revenue in 2022 by 5.75 percentage points. Core organic revenue growth is anticipated to be over 11%. Non-mortgage core organic growth is expected to drive about 2/3 of the growth. The largest contributor is Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. USIS non-mortgage, International and GCS are also expected to drive core growth. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining about 1/3 of the organic core growth. This is driven by strong outperformance in Workforce Solutions. The acquisitions completed in 2021 are expected to contribute about 3 percentage points of growth to 2022. Slide 21 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 14% growth from the midpoint of the 2021 guidance of $7.57 per share to the midpoint of our 2022 framework of $8.65 per share. Revenue growth of 8% at our 2021 EBITDA margins of about 33.8% would deliver 11% growth in adjusted EPS. In 2022, we expect to deliver EBITDA margin expansion of about 200 basis points. This margin expansion is expected to drive 9% growth in adjusted EPS. This margin expansion is expected to be delivered by the actions we have discussed with you throughout 2021. Our transformation investments will be reduced by about $100 million in 2022, with about half of this reduction or about $50 million being reinvested in new product and other development. We will begin to see net cloud cost savings in 2022 defined as the savings from improving production costs, driven by the decommissioning of our legacy on-prem systems and other improvements in our operations exceeding the cost of running our new cloud-native systems. Margins will also be enhanced by leverage on corporate and G&A. Partly offsetting these benefits to EBITDA are cost increases, particularly in salaries and contracted services as the tight labor market drives cost higher as well as lower EBITDA margins in 2022 from the 2021 acquisitions as we will just be ramping synergies during 2022. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $45 million in 2022, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 2 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the increased debt from our 2021 acquisitions. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.5% does not assume any changes in the U.S. federal tax rate. Should that occur, we will let you know the estimated impact on our 2022 results. As there remains significant uncertainty in underlying market drivers, including the pace of normalization of the U.S. mortgage market and the pace of economic growth worldwide, what we provided today for 2022 is a framework for you to consider. We'll provide formal guidance for 2022 in connection with our 4Q '21 earnings release early next year. Now I would like to turn it back over to Mark. Yes. Happy to. So again, as a reminder, right, we're talking about increasing EBITDA margins by -- on the order of 200 basis points, so a substantial increase in 2022 versus 2021, yes. And I think the drivers are what we've been talking about all year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We are reducing substantially tech transformation costs, but we are taking a significant amount of that in the order of $50 million and reinvesting it in NPI and other initiatives to drive growth and to deliver the higher revenue growth you're talking about, that you referenced in your question. Also, we do expect now to start seeing benefits, so net reductions in costs from decoms exceeding our cloud costs, and that will ramp as we go through 2022. And then -- but we are seeing some increased costs related to -- related -- in our COGS, as you would normally expect, related to increased costs for people and increased cost for some systems costs that are reducing 2021 EBITDA margins to a degree. That's not actually that unusual, generally speaking. Generally speaking, we see increased cost every year that we manage through high growth. Next year, part of what's happening, obviously, right, is we're seeing substantial negative impacts on our revenue from the weaker mortgage market as well as the reductions in EC -- sorry, in the UC and ERC markets. So that negative drive in revenue is also somewhat negatively impacting our margin expansion. But overall, 200 basis points of margin expansion next year, we think, is really an outstanding performance, especially given the fact that we're seeing such large declines in the mortgage market and then also the declines in the UC and ERC revenue that we talked about on the order of 30%. Yes. So I think in terms of the details around how the BUs are going to perform next year, we're going to have to ask you to wait until November 10. But Obviously, we expect EWS to continue to perform extremely well. No, I'd say that covers it. And we're -- the good news is we're continuing to grow in USIS and auto on an organic basis even in the headwinds of the difficult market. But yes, it certainly isn't at the pace that we expected when we started the year. Yes. So George, as I walked through in my comments, right, so you're absolutely right. So we indicated we were going to -- we would improve our cost structure by -- on the order of $100 million by taking down transformation costs. And then we also said we'd improve our cost structure as we drove net savings, right, as decom and other cost reduction efforts drove us -- or exceeded cloud. And so we absolutely have indicated we're going to deliver on those savings, and we're still committed to delivering substantial savings in both of those areas in 2022 and beyond. But you are correct. Also, as I mentioned in my comments, we're reinvesting a substantial portion of that $50 million in new development and new development-related activities. Also, if you think about what's going on, given the fact that we're seeing a 600 basis point headwind, like the natural growth that you'd see in our underlying business that has the very high variable margins, that's somewhat lower than you would see in a period in which mortgage is not as negative as you're talking about. And you're correct, right, we're getting a nice bump from growth in acquisitions next year. But the EBITDA margins on those acquisitions in their first year is substantially lower than the contribution margin we get by growing our internal data assets. So when you kind of line all that stuff up and you include the fact that we are seeing cost increases as we do every year, right, that's certainly something we see every year, but there is a tighter labor market, so there's an expectation that some of those cost increases will be greater. When you line all those items up, you end up at about a 200 basis point increase is where we're comfortable talking about right now. Also, I just want to remind everybody, 200 basis points, right, and again, a 6% reduction in mortgage and UC, ERC is really a substantial improvement. We feel very good about delivering that. And so hopefully, the investment community can look at it in that vein. So it's absolutely accretive in 2022. Certainly, I'm not going to give a specific number for the level of accretion for the acquisitions. But kind of similar to the response I just gave with regard to margin movements, so we do expect good EBITDA margins from those acquisitions. And the level of margin that we're generating from that certainly exceeds the cost of the interest expense, which we also detailed in our revenue book. So we're seeing nice accretion, and so -- which would be consistent with strong from what we talked about back in August. But just in general, right, the level of margins we look at from an acquired company like Appriss or anybody else in the first year out, the incremental margin we generate from those companies isn't anywhere near the level of incremental margin we generate from incremental organic sales at Equifax. So the reason why they're somewhat dilutive to our EBITDA margin in total is because of the fact that the variable margin we achieved on our direct sales is certainly substantially higher than the level of margin we generate from the acquired company in its first year out. I think the biggest driver of the growth rates that you're looking at really is the fact that in 2020, we saw a meaningful improvement in the third quarter relative to the second, right? So the growth rate in the second quarter of 2020, as we talked about when we did the release, was elevated partially because of the fact that it was such a weak quarter and we saw some improvements in the third quarter last year, right? So that's part of what's driving the fact that the -- that's a significant driver of what's driving the growth rates to be down. But in terms of overall performance, I think as Mark referenced, we feel good about banking and lending. We have a nice growth there in the quarter, again, as we -- we had nice growth in insurance, nice growth in commercial. Identity and fraud was strong. And importantly, Financial Marketing Services was very strong, right? So -- but again, as you look into the fourth quarter, similarly to what I just talked about the fourth quarter of last year was a nice improvement from the third quarter. So we'll have some of the grow-over effects that we talked about in the third quarter. But we continue to believe we're going to see nice non-mortgage growth in USIS in the fourth quarter. Yes. So in terms of modeling, again, for 2022, what I'd ask you to focus on is the guidance we just gave, right? So what we try to do is give you a fairly detailed walk from this year to next year. And obviously, there's a lot of moving parts in what's driving our EBITDA margin movement, which was some of the questions we had earlier. So I ask would be a focus on the walk we gave in the 200 basis points of margin expansion when you think about 2022 relative to 2021. Yes. So in terms of the mortgage as a percent of total, it's just under 32%, and that's obviously down significantly from where it was last year, and it will go down again in the fourth quarter. So in terms of tech transformation expense, I think what we've indicated is that this year, we expect to incur about $165 million, and that's how you get to the $1.01. And we've indicated that we expect to reduce by about $100 million. It's not a perfect number, right, but by about $100 million next year. So that would be on the order to -- on the order of $60 million to $65 million next year. But obviously, we'll refine that as we move through the fourth quarter and give you a really formal guidance as we get into early next year. Yes. I think we indicated in our prepared remarks, it's about $45 million. In the fourth quarter. Sorry. Yes. So if the question was non-mortgage in USIS, then our statement was intended to be organic, right? So we're expecting them to outperform their core market on an organic basis. No, you covered it, right? So we just -- I think we just had an earlier question about how much transformation expense was still -- investment was still in 2022, and we gave a number of -- we're at $165 million this year, and we said we'd reduce by about $100 million, so that's still in the P&L next year. And then also, we are delivering cloud savings. So our net cloud cost over decommissioning is a positive next year. But we've given a long-term model where we expect to deliver substantial savings when the cloud transformation is complete. We're still committed to that, right? So the exact timing as you move through any given year, obviously, moves around a lot based on decommissionings and the pace of ramp of individual systems. So it's hard to be specific in any -- about any specific number as far as 15 months out. But we are absolutely committed to delivering a net savings next year versus the net cost this year. And then also there's substantial savings still to come as we get through 2022 and then -- and into '23 and '24. Obviously, those don't complete until we complete the International transformation. Absolutely. Look, Manav, I'm not going to size them specifically, right? But we referenced them because they're all meaningful to us, right? So they're all impacting margins. But again, 200 basis points increase in a market where there's 600 basis points of headwinds from mortgage and then obviously UC and ERC, which is we think is a very good outcome. So we think we're delivering substantial savings from reduction in transformation. And as we indicated, we will start delivering savings on net -- sorry, net cloud relative to decom and other cost savings. So we feel good about the direction we're headed, and we feel good about delivering 200 basis points of growth. For the third quarter? I think we gave it in the script. I think we... So I understand the question. So we'll think about that. Obviously, we're going to be together again in a little over 2 weeks, and perhaps we can provide a bridge. But we gave -- I think we gave details on a 30% reduction. We said the 30% reduction was 1.25% of revenue. so I think between those 2 numbers, you'll get pretty close to the exact number, but we haven't disclosed it yet. But -- and I apologize, I don't have it at my fingertips. But I think with those 2 pieces of information, you can get really close to the UC and ERC revenue in '21 and 2022. The bulk of our -- the bulk of that business for us, obviously, is in banking and lending. And Mark talked about the growth we're seeing in banking in the third quarter and second quarter, right? So we've seen double-digit growth both quarters. More like $30 to $40. I-9, sorry, you're right, $10 to $20."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. We had a very strong third quarter and first 9 months of 2021, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $1.223 billion, which was up over 14%, with core non-mortgage market and non-UC, ERC claims revenue growth of 20%. We are executing extremely well against the critical priorities of our EFX2023 strategy, as we highlighted on Slide 4. Our focus on leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, new products and growth is clearly driving our strong financial results. Our revenue growth has accelerated from 3% in 2019, as we were recovering from the 2017 cyber event and investing heavily in our EFX Cloud transformation to 17% last year. We are on track to deliver 19% core growth this year at the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance. More importantly, our core growth, which excludes the impact of the mortgage market, unemployment claims and ERC-related revenues is expected to accelerate to 21% this year, a powerful figure that reflects the strength of our underlying business model and EFX2023 growth strategy. Not only is our core growth accelerating above historical levels during '20 and '21 in challenging COVID markets. And more recently, in a declining mortgage market, we are also expanding EFX beyond our traditional credit bureau routes to a more diverse data analytics and technology company with our investments in the Equifax cloud, new data assets and NPIs, along with reinvesting our outperformance in bolt-on M&A in areas such as talent, government and ID and fraud. We are quickly pivoting from building the Equifax cloud to leveraging it for innovation of new products that will position the new Equifax for stronger and more diversified growth in the future. Our EFX2023 growth strategy remains our compass for the future and drives all of our top and bottom line growth initiatives as we move towards '22 and beyond. Turning to Slide 5. Equifax had a very strong quarter. Revenue at $1.22 billion was up 14.5%, with organic constant currency growth up a strong 12%. The almost 15% top line growth was off a strong 19% growth last year in a much stronger mortgage market. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. More importantly, our core growth was up a strong 20%. Our U.S. B2B businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 75% of Equifax revenue, again drove our growth, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the 21% decline in the U.S. mortgage market in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up over 30%, and organic non-mortgage revenue was up 24%, strengthening sequentially from the 16% and 20% we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year. Third quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $404 million, up slightly from third quarter last year with margins of 33%. As expected, margins were down versus 2020 due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $45 million in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year, and redundant cloud transformation systems cost of $15 million. These costs related to cloud tech transformation negatively impacted EBITDA margins by almost 500 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $1.85 a share was down slightly from last year. Adjusting for the cloud transformation costs of $45 million or $0.27 a share, adjusted EPS would have been up a strong 11%. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. In the quarter, we completed 4,000 B2B customer migrations for a total of 15,400 migrations completed so far this year. In September alone, USIS completed over 900 customer migrations. Since the beginning of the transformation, we've completed almost 97,000 B2B migrations, 3.5 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations. We remain on track and confident in our plan. We continue to expect the North American transformation to be principally complete in early '22, with the remaining customer migrations broadly completing by the end of next year. International transformation will follow, being principally completed by the end of 2023, with some customer migrations continuing into 2024.  We're still in the early days of leveraging the cloud but remain confident that will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line and expand our margins and the growth in cost savings in '22 and beyond. Our NPI performance also continues to accelerate. In the quarter, we released 30 new products. And we still expect our Vitality Index to accelerate from 5% last year to over 8% in 2021. Given our very strong third quarter performance, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 320 basis points or $131 million at the midpoint of a range between $4.9 billion to $4.921 billion, up 19% from last year, and increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 per share to a midpoint of $7.57 per share, which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a 23% growth in EPS. This includes our expectation that the U.S. mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries will decline just over 7% this year with the bulk of the return to normalization in the second half, which we expect to be down around 20%. Roughly 2/3 of the 320 basis point increase in our revenue growth framework to 19% is from organic business performance, with the balance from the acquisition of Appriss, Health e(fx) and Teletrack, which we expect to add about $45 million to revenue in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars on Slide 6, grew a very strong 20%, a third consecutive quarter of core growth at or above 20%. Non-mortgage growth in EWS and USIS and growth in International drove about 900 basis points to the core revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and FX, with mortgage outperformance primarily in Workforce Solutions driving about 800 basis points of organic core growth in the quarter. As we move through '22 and '23, we expect to continue to see strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the new EFX Cloud, accelerated NPIs, continued strong non-mortgage growth, both from organic growth and acquisitions, as well as continued strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $508 million, which was up 35%. This is the first quarter Workforce Solutions has delivered over $0.5 billion of revenue in a single quarter, a big milestone. This was against a very strong 57% growth last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up over -- were 54%. Non-mortgage revenue at Workforce Solutions was up over 48%, with organic non-mortgage revenue up 41%. The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness of their TWN income and employment data set was clear again in the third quarter. Workforce's Verification Services revenue of $403 million was up a strong 34%. Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 22% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market, with the EWS outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products. Importantly, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue was up 55% in the quarter, consistent with the very strong growth we saw last quarter. Our government vertical, which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs, including food and rental support, grew over 20% in the quarter. Government remains one of our largest non-mortgage segments with attractive growth potential in the future and represents about 1/3 of non-mortgage verification revenue. Our new SSA contract went live this quarter at relatively low start-up volumes, and we expect to see it ramp as we move through 2022. We expect new products, the addition of Appriss and expanded federal and state social services to fuel growth in our government vertical in the future. Talent solutions, which provides income employment verifications as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS data hub, had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and NPIs growing over 100%. Talent solutions now represents almost 30% of non-mortgage verification revenue. And as you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually, with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of the hiring process. The addition of Appriss Insights and our new partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse will fuel growth and new products in this important vertical. The non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well of about 90% in the quarter, both from deepening penetration with lenders and from some recovery in these markets, although auto has been impacted by inventory shortages. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was up $30 million in the quarter. This is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers records. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $65 million, up about $14 million from last year. Substantial declines in the UC revenue in the quarter were more than offset by ERC, which grew substantially -- sequentially as we support the businesses in obtaining federal employee retention credit payments. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of about $40 million, up 60%, with organic growth of about 35%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product, continue to show very strong growth, up about 80%. Our I-9 business is now almost half of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. Reflecting the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of Workforce Analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses to deliver total growth of about 40% and organic growth of about 25% in the year. Reflecting the uniqueness of the TWN data, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins of 54.3%. The decline versus last year is driven by investments in the tech transformation as well as redundant systems costs and as well as significant investments in data onboarding, sales and marketing to continue to drive Workforce Solutions growth. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a very strong '21, '22 and beyond. Turning now to USIS. Their revenue of $380 million was up slightly from last year. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $148 million was down 17%, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, slightly better than the down 23% we expected in July. USIS outperformance versus the overall market was driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products. Importantly, non-mortgage revenue of $240 million grew almost 8 -- sorry, 16% with organic growth of over 9%. Year-to-date, non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 17%, and organic non-mortgage revenue growth is over 10%. Banking, insurance, commercial and direct-to-consumer were all up over 10% in the quarter. Fraud was up almost 10% organically and up over 75% in total, with the inclusion of our Kount acquisition. Auto was up mid-single digits despite supply pressures, and telco was down just over 5%. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is, broadly speaking, our off-line or batch business, was $55 million in the quarter and up about 20%. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20%; and ID and fraud revenue, which grew over 15%. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 40% of FMS revenue; identity and fraud, above 20%; and risk decisioning, about 35%. The USIS sales team delivered record wins up over 20% versus last year and 40% sequentially in the quarter. The new deal pipeline in USIS remains very strong. During the quarter, USIS acquired Teletrack, a U.S. leader in alternative credit data. Teletrack is being consolidated with DataX, our specialty finance credit reporting agency that we acquired in 2018, to expand our capabilities in the fast-growing alternative data space serving unbanked and underbanked U.S. consumers. The USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 40% in the quarter, flat sequentially with second quarter. Similar to second quarter, the decline in margins in the quarter versus last year was due to both costs related to the cloud transformation, which include the cost of redundant systems and inclusion of our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs which are being excluded in 2020, and the expansion of our investments in sales and marketing as well as new products to leverage both the strengthening U.S. market and accelerate new product introductions to drive revenue growth in '22 and beyond. Turning to International. Their revenue of $245 million was up 10% on a local currency basis and up 100 basis points sequentially. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets following the COVID pandemic impacts. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed well in the quarter with revenue of $89 million, up about 7% in local currency. Australia delivered this growth despite the extended COVID lockdowns in many portions of that country. Australia consumer revenue continued to recover, up 3% versus last year and about flat sequentially. Our Commercial businesses combined online and off-line revenue was up 8% in the quarter. Fraud and identity was up 13%, following 22% growth in the first half. European revenues of $68 million were up 9% in local currency in the quarter and flat sequentially. Our European credit reporting business was up about 5% with continued growth in both the U.K. and Spain. Our European debt management business revenue increased by about 21% in local currency, off the lows we saw last year during the COVID recession. Canada delivered revenue of $44 million in the quarter, up over 8% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 15%. Canada experienced strong growth in fintech, while supply issues continue to impact our auto business. Latin American revenues of $45 million grew 16% in the quarter in local currency, which was the third consecutive quarter of growth coming out of COVID. We continue to see the benefit in Lat Am of the strong new product introductions introduced over the past 3 years. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 26.7% were down slightly from 27.3% in the second quarter. The sequential decline was driven by incremental technology costs in Australia and Canada as they accelerate their cloud transformation programs. The decline in the quarter was principally due to costs related to the cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs, which were being excluded last year. Margins were negatively impacted the quarter by -- also negatively impacted the quarter by our increased investments in sales and marketing and new products. Global Consumer Solutions revenue of $82 million was down 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a local currency basis in the quarter, slightly above our expectations. We saw growth of about 2% in our global consumer direct business, which sells directly to consumers through equifax.com and represents a little over half of GCS revenue.  The decline in GCS revenue in the quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead gen partner business. We expect the GCS partner business and GCS business overall to return to growth in the fourth quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.4% were up sequentially, reflecting lower operating costs. The decline versus last year was principally driven by revenue declines. Turning now to Slide 8. Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax as it's clearly our strongest, fastest-growing and most valuable business, with strong 35% growth in the quarter, up 57% growth a year ago. Core revenue growth was 42%, driven by the uniqueness of the TWN income and employment data, scale of the TWN database and consistent execution by Rudy and his team. EWS' ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by 3 factors. First, growing the work number database. At the end of the third quarter, TWN reached 125 million active records, an increase of 12% or 13 million records from a year ago and included 97 million unique records. At 97 million uniques, we now have over 60% of nonfarm payroll, which makes our TWN data set more valuable to our customers with higher hit rates. We are now receiving records every pay period from 1.9 million companies, up from 1 million when we started the year and 27,000 contributors a short 2 years ago. The exclusive agreement with a major payroll processor that we announced on our February call went live in the third quarter and contributed to this growth. Our strong momentum continues as we signed another large payroll processor last week on an exclusive basis that will come online in the coming months. We also expect to add further payroll processors in the coming months. As a reminder, almost 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers to which EWS provides comprehensive Employer Services like UC claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, ERC, HSA and other HR and compliance solutions. Our acquisitions of HIREtech, i2verify and Health e(fx) this year strengthened our ability to deliver these unique HR services, particularly through relationships with payroll processors and HR software companies. These partnerships have been built up over the past decade by the Workforce Solutions team. The remaining 40% of our records are contributed through partnerships with payroll providers and HR software companies, most of which are exclusive. We still have substantial room to grow our income and employment database and expect to continue to add new data contributors as well as reach agreements with several additional payroll processors in the fourth quarter to add their records on an exclusive basis to TWN in 2022. Beyond the over 50 million nonfarm payroll records not yet in the TWN database, we're focused on data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the U.S. marketplace to further broaden the TWN database. We have plenty of room to grow TWN. Second, increasing our average revenue transactions -- average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing, our existing products to value, recognizing the depth of information TWN allows us to deliver to customers. Workforce Solutions' new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And third, by increasing our penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets. For example, we continue to increase our penetration in the mortgage market. At the end of 2020, Workforce Solutions received an inquiry in almost 60% of completed mortgages, up from 55% in 2019. This 500 basis point increase is a big step forward, but we still have plenty of runway to expand the customers using TWN mortgage. We're also seeing substantial growth in TWN in other credit markets, including card and auto as these verticals take advantage of the unique lift from TWN income and employment data in the 60% hit rates with our database. Growing system-to-system integrations is another key lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of poll per transaction. During the quarter, about 75% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system-to-system, up over 2x from 32% in 2019. And again, we still have plenty of growth potential here. Workforce Solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above-market and above Equifax growth rates and margins that we expect to continue in the future. Slide 9 highlights the core growth performance of our U.S. B2B mortgage businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Our combined U.S. B2B businesses delivered 3% revenue growth in mortgage in the third quarter, outperforming the mortgage market by 24 basis points, with the market down 21%. This strong performance -- outperformance was again driven by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 43%, enabled by the multiple drivers that I just discussed. Slide 10 provides an update on new product innovation, leveraging the Equifax Cloud and our differentiated data, a key driver of our current and future growth. In the quarter, we delivered 30 new products with 150 new products in the market so far this year, which is up 18% from the 96 we delivered in the same time frame last year. We continue to expect our 2021 Vitality Index defined as a percent of revenue delivered from NPIs launched in the past 3 years to be over 8%. In the third quarter, we launched significant new products we expect to continue to drive growth in '22 and beyond. The SSA payroll exchange that went live as an EWS product that supports verifications of SSI and SSDI social services delivering critical income and employment status based on program requirements. OneView with DataX is a new integrated consumer credit report that redefines how we deliver display and provide insights to our customers. It also sets the stage for integrating nontraditional credit data in a single view solution for our customers. Alternative data from DataX, Teletrack, NC+, rental payments and other sources are a critical priority for Equifax, and we expect to continue to drive NPIs in this space in the future. Digital Identity Trust 2.0 product provides businesses with a comprehensive, passive identity verification service that delivers a trust/do not trust recommendation across both physical and digital identity vectors. This product will leverage Kount data by year-end. MarketMix Premier solution enables the ability for FIs to access market share and size of liquidity across geographics. This provides quick identification of targeted growth markets to deploy spend across branch sales and marketing efforts. And lastly, the new Equifax Affordability product in Australia uses bank transaction data and sophisticated categorization to provide an affordability view to customers while removing friction for the consumer. We're clearly focused on leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive our NPI rollouts and new product revenue in '21 and beyond. Growing the NPI is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. As detailed on Slide 11, in 2021, we reinvest our strong outperformance in strategic and accretive bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing growth markets and allow us to enter new markets with new capabilities. Our 2021 acquisitions add $300 million plus synergies to our run rate revenue. We are focused on executing acquisitions that are accretive to our long-term revenue growth and margins and deliver attractive shareholder returns. Our priorities for M&A are clear and aligned around, number one, expanding our differentiated data, which is at the core Equifax. We have scale and unique data sets that we want to expand and leverage with new data elements to drive enhanced decisioning for our customers. All of our acquisitions deliver new and differentiated data, and more data drive better decisions. Second, expanding and widening our largest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions, is a priority for our M&A. The Appriss Insights, HIREtech, Health e(fx) and i2verify acquisitions strengthen Workforce and position EWS for future outperformance. And last, broadening our ID and fraud capabilities in the fast-growing digital and e-commerce space is another M&A priority. Kount strongly advanced our capabilities in this fast-growing space. We closed the Appriss acquisition on October 1 and are focused on integration, new solutions and growth. Appriss Insights and our new partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse are a big step forward in our strategy to build out an EWS Data Hub centered off our almost 500 million historical TWN data records to address the fast-growing talent and government markets. As detailed on Slide 12, combining our scale TWN data with Appriss Insights criminal and health care credentialing and sections data, along with other partner data assets, including the exclusive partnership for college and university data we entered into in the third quarter with the National Student Clearinghouse, allows Workforce Solutions to deliver the most complete, real-time, 360-degree view of the prospective employee or applicant for government benefits available in the market. The talent solutions and government verticals offer large and growing markets for our Workforce Solutions business through the EWS Data Hub. We estimate an addressable market of $5 billion in the U.S. hiring space and onboarding process, with around 75 million new employees onboarded annually in the U.S. Workforce Solutions government vertical is focused on delivering data and solutions to support federal and state benefit programs as well as law enforcement agencies. This is a substantial and growing sector that we estimate to have an addressable market of about $2 billion. Appriss Insights strongly accelerates our ability to penetrate these large and fast-growing TAMs. Insights is anticipated to generate $150 million of run rate revenue during 2021 and to grow on a stand-alone basis at over 15% annually. We also anticipate building towards approximately $75 million in revenue synergies by 2025, leveraging the EFX Cloud to integrate Appriss Insights' rich people-based risk intelligence data in the EWS Data Hub to form a new multi-data solutions and through cross-selling efforts. Acquiring Appriss Insights and partnering with the National Student Clearinghouse provide strong pillars for Workforce Solutions growth and fast-growing markets going forward. Slide 13 highlights our focus on adding alternative data to our database focused on the 60 million un or underbanked population in the United States. According to a Federal Reserve study, 6% of U.S. adults do not have a checking, savings or money market account, although 2/5 use some form of alternative financial service. Moreover, 16% of adults have a bank account but also use an alternative financial service product generally at much higher costs. Providing services that help bring these underserved populations into the financial mainstream is core to our purpose of helping people live their financial best and is an important priority for our customers. Our acquisition of Teletrack in September, which we are combining with our DataX business, creates a leading U.S. specialty consumer reporting agency with data on more than 80 million thin-file, unbanked and underbanked and credit rebuilding consumers. Our National Consumer Telecom & Utilities Exchange partnership is another unique data set focused on this space that has more than 420 million records and 250 million consumers, helping our customers to expand underwriting to no hit or thin-file customers. We are focused on expanding our unique alternative data from sources, including specialty finance companies, alternative lenders, telco companies, cable and satellite TV providers, municipalities and utilities to drive growth in the fast-growing alternative data markets. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our alternative databases through partnerships and M&A. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year, our increase in guidance for 2021 as well as our -- share our early read on 2022 assumptions and our financial framework for 2022. Thanks, John. We hope this early view of our framework for 2022 is helpful and reinforces the power of the new Equifax to deliver 14% growth and 8% total growth at the midpoint of our range of thinking, assuming the mortgage market and UC and ERC declines impact our revenue growth by almost 6% in 2022. Stepping back and reviewing the macro trends outlined on Slide 22. These macros have been driving information services for the last decade. Over the last 24 months, we believe most of the macro factors have substantially accelerated. And through our 2021 acquisitions of Appriss, Kount and Teletrack and our EFX Cloud investments advantaged Equifax to benefit from these macro trends. We believe we also have unique levers at Equifax to deliver strong future growth, including Workforce Solutions above market and EFX growth and margins and our expanded focus on new data assets like Appriss Insights, the USIS recovery and non-mortgage growth and Kount ID and fraud growth; the new Equifax Cloud, which is driving our competitiveness NPIs top line and cost savings; and NPIs leveraging Equifax Cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products; and then, of course, M&A to broaden strength in Equifax. These attractive market macros along with the broad Equifax growth levers and our strong core outperformance in the past few years give us the confidence in our ability to deliver above-market growth in the future. Wrapping up on Slide 23. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter. We had strong momentum as we move into the fourth quarter to 2022. We now delivered 7 consecutive quarters of strong, above-market, double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is on offense. We remain confident in our outlook for 2021 and raised our full year midpoint revenue growth rate by approximately 300 basis points to 19% growth for the year. And we also raised our midpoint EPS by $0.22 to $7.57 per share. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter, powering our results, delivering 35% revenue growth and 54% EBITDA margins. EWS is our largest, fastest-growing and most valuable business, and Rudy and his team remain focused on delivering outsized growth. USIS also delivered a strong quarter with 16% non-mortgage growth and 9% organic non-mortgage growth, offsetting the impact of a sharp over 20% decline in the mortgage market. Sid Singh and his USIS team remain competitive and are winning in the marketplace. International grew for the fourth consecutive quarter with 10% growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes outside the United States. We have high expectations for International as we move into 2022. We spent the past 3 years building the Equifax Cloud and are now in the early days of leveraging the new and uniquely Equifax Cloud capabilities. As we move into '22 and beyond, we will increasingly realize the top line cost and cash benefits from these new only Equifax Cloud capabilities. As I mentioned earlier, our 2021 M&A has added $300 million of run rate revenue to Equifax. Reinvesting our strong cash flow in accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. We're now focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing our synergy and growth plans in order to leverage our new data products and capabilities. Our early look at a 2022 financial framework calls for 8% revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth of 14%, assuming a 15% decline in the mortgage market. More importantly, the framework includes strong 14% EFX growth -- core EFX growth. 2022 will be a pivotal year for Equifax as we shift towards leveraging the Equifax Cloud for innovation, new products and growth. And lastly, turning to Slide 24. Many of you have been closely following Equifax for many years and know we've been speaking to you about -- for some time about our plan to have our first Investor Day, which will be our first Investor Day since 2012 and the cyber event. It's been a long time. Let me now turn it over to Dorian, who will give you the details on our November 10 meeting focused on the new Equifax, and then we'll take some questions. You should obviously -- we've been quite clear that we expect Workforce Solutions to grow above the rest of Equifax. So I think you should think about it that way in 2022. I went through -- we've been through many, many times, the multiple levers that Workforce, for example, has as they finish up the year and go into 2022, and records starts at the top of that list. Adding substantial records in the third quarter, those become a benefit through the next year, their new product introductions, continued penetration. There's a lot of levers in that business. USIS, their new deal pipeline is a positive lever going forward. But Workforce is clearly going to be above that -- the rest of Equifax for really as long as we can see in the future from a growth rate standpoint. It's clearly a priority, Kevin. As you know, since I joined almost 4 years ago and really in the last, call it, 24 months, we've really stepped up our focus on new products. As you know, we've expanded the team. John and I both talked about it in our comments this morning about continuing to invest there. And of course, the cloud transformation is central to that. That's really -- we're going to get great benefits from the cloud around cost, but we really did it to change our competitiveness. And the big piece of that is the ability to bring new products to market that we couldn't do before through multi-data solutions. And that's really where our focus is, and we're in the early days of really leveraging that. So we see real opportunities going forward. We'll certainly talk in depth in our Investor Day in a couple of weeks around our longer-term outlook for new products. But it's an area that we've invested heavily, foundationally in the cloud. You add to that our existing differentiated data assets, which we've expanded substantially this year with the addition of new data solutions from Appriss, from Kount, from Teletrack and then our focus on new products. We believe it's an important lever for delivering strong future growth going forward, and we'll give you much more detail during our Investor Day. Yes. First on the progress, this is a big undertaking. I think you know that. We talk to you about it every quarter. We try to be quite transparent about the efforts. 2018, '19 and parts of '20 were building the technology. In '20 and '21, we've been heavily focused on implementing that with our customers, the migration. You've seen the great progress. We still got more to do. And we were clear that we expect North America, which is Canada, U.S. and EWS and USIS and, of course, TCS to be substantially complete as we get in 2022 and really complete the migrations next year. So we can see the finish line, but there's still plenty of work to do in the coming months to complete that. With regards to our impact commercially, there's a number of layers on that. And this is another area -- our intent is to go in substantial detail about how we think about that, what we're seeing during our Investor Day. We'll have our Chief Technology leader and product leader, Bryson Koehler, as well as the business unit leaders will talk about that. But you're starting to see some of the early days of that, in our view. The strong core growth, the ability to roll out new products are driving our competitiveness and driving our ability to drive our core growth. And there's no question, when we sit down with customers, we believe we're advantaged having a new tech stack that's in the cloud that can deliver 9-9s of stability, meaning very high, always-on stability, deliver data more quickly to our customers. We can deliver new products to them more quickly. It just changes who we are as a company, and it allows us to be a different company. So it's quite central to how we think about the new Equifax going forward, and it will be central to our long-term growth framework that we'll share with you in a couple of weeks. Yes, similar, we could have and should have commented on that in the U.S. also. There's no question that the supply shortages are impacting the ability for consumers to identify cars or get cars, new and used and then, of course, the financing that comes with that and the business we get from that. What's been offsetting that to some regard, not fully, but is our continued penetration of new products and new solutions, like Workforce Solutions continuing to grow the use of TWN data in the auto space has been a positive. Would you add anything, John? Yes. It's obviously an important focus of Rudy and the Workforce Solutions team. You've seen continued success there. And remember, we've got 2, really, levers for growth. First, our Employer Services business, which is large and comprehensive as we've delivered new solutions to HR managers around I-9 or HSA or W-2 or WOTC, all the other services. We access payroll records. So that's a very powerful engine for us to go to individual companies to obtain records. And of course, we feel like we have some real momentum in adding the payroll processors that are not with us and going after the traditional nonfarm payroll. There's still 60 million-plus consumers or individuals that are available for us in the traditional nonfarm, and we're chasing that. So that's one. And of course, with records being up 12% in the quarter, that is a very strong lever for growth that translates pretty directly into revenue because of higher hit rates. As you point out, there's also a larger universe, the nonfarm payroll, the 160 million, 170 million that are in nonfarm payroll, the gig workers as well as pension recipients. Those are 2 big areas. There's 40 million to 50 million gig workers. So we're working different strategies to obtain those records and then the same with pension recipients. So there's a long runway from our roughly 60% of nonfarm payroll. If you include self-employed and gig in there, it's much less than the 60% to continue to grow our records, which is a very unique business growth lever for our business to continue to add new data assets because, as you know, in our system-to-system integrations in Workforce Solutions, we're getting the inquiries. We can only fulfill those that we have records on. And as we grow our records, they become monetized tomorrow afternoon. So that's very powerful. And the scale of Workforce gives us the ability to have large, dedicated teams both on the partnership side and on the direct side through Employer Services to continue to grow our records. And we'll likely talk a little bit at Investor Day about our International expansion, which, as you know, we're already in Canada, Australia and India. And those businesses are also growing their records, leveraging the core tech stack that we have from Workforce Solutions in the U.S. but also relationships that we have, either with multinationals or with payroll processors and, of course, growing those records locally. So big, big focus and big opportunity going forward. When you think about records, I think about us being in kind of middle innings still as far as the opportunity for Workforce Solutions. And these take time. The payroll processor we signed last week, we were probably talking to them for 3 years. It takes time to get organized around that. But there's real momentum particularly in that area of acquisition because so many others have signed up with Equifax and are having a positive experience. We're seeing real momentum there in adding other processors. And George, I would add to that, we'll obviously talk about a long-term framework for revenue and margins in a couple of weeks. And we've been quite clear that we see a lot of ability to grow the top line -- or we're confident in our ability to grow our top line long term at above-market level as well as expand our margins. And we've also been very clear that while we have the ability to expand margins over the long-term basis, we're also going to invest in the business. We have the ability to invest in new products. And obviously, the tech transformation, which we're completing, it has really high leverage in driving the top line. So we'll continue to have that balance going forward of expanding margins while investing in the future of Equifax. Yes. First, our primary focus is to continue to grow W-2 income kind of payroll records, and you see that we've had strong success in that over the last couple of years. And certainly again in the quarter, we're continuing to add to that. There's still a long runway there. When you think about 60 million, 70 million of additional individuals that are not in our data set that are inside of that, so that's kind of a primary focus. And then as you point out, we're expanding into gig. Some of the same relationships we have, companies process on their own contractor payroll, we'll be able to pick that up. Some payroll processors have kind of self-employed solutions where there's an ability to pick up data that way. There's other HR software providers that will help us through partnerships lead to some of those kind of records. And of course, the pensioner income at 20 million to 30 million comes from individual companies that process their own pension income or other companies that do that for companies. So we've got a multifaceted approach on that. Really, the point we make in identifying that is that our lens is wider now, and there's still a long runway of this important lever to grow records Workforce Solutions. As you know, we don't talk about adding data assets in our other businesses. What's unique about Workforce is that it's only a decade old, and it only has 60% of nonfarm payroll, so there's a ton of room to grow. And then that gets bigger, as we both pointed out, as you add gig and pension into that space. Yes. First, I think the underlying macro of 75 million people changing jobs every year, that macro doesn't really change much over time, meaning lots of people change jobs, and that may go up or down at some. But underlying that is that there's some level of data used in each of those job moves. So that's a macro that's quite good. The other thing that's changing that we think is going to be a permanent change is the desire by companies to complete that process more quickly. Meaning they've made an offer to someone getting them on the floor in the warehouse or the factory or in the retail establishment or in the restaurant in hours or days versus weeks. And the only way to do that is through instant decisioning. So I think that's the fundamental structural change in the business, the ability to use data to speed up the processes. For us, what we're really having the growth in is building out this data hub, which remember is only a year old or whatever. We're starting to leverage the 4.5, 5 jobs we have in the average American from our TWN database. Remember 0.5 billion of historical records and then adding to it new data elements like Appriss Insights, like medical credentialing, the National Student Clearinghouse of Education, that's all new turf for Equifax. As we combine those, you're going to see products coming out. You already are. We're rolling out new products quite rapidly for talent solutions where we have different solutions of more or less historical data. And we'll move to, in the coming year, solutions that are more targeted to specific jobs, a job that requires what was your last employer, what was your last 2 employers, verifying your licenses, verifying where did you go to school. Some jobs require that, some don't. So we'll come up with solutions that will be packaged to speed up that process for the background screeners and the hiring managers in order to speed up the ability to hire that individual more quickly. So we see a lot of opportunity for growth in that. That's a $5 billion TAM. Our business is quite small when you think about $5 billion worth of data. And that's why we're investing through new products and through innovation and, of course, through the acquisitions that we've made or the new partnerships like the National Student Clearinghouse. And on SSA in our comments, we -- I noted that we launched the program. We started delivering data to them at kind of early levels. And we expect that to ramp as we go through the fourth quarter and into 2022 and get to run rate sometime in 2022. It's a substantial and positive contract for us, but it's in the start-up mode now, which is positive to have it started after a lot of years of building this new solution and getting it integrated with SSA. Yes. No. We're actively -- as you know, we have completed 8 acquisitions this year and a couple of them substantial, particularly Kount and Appriss. We're much further along on integrating Kount, as you might imagine, because we completed that deal in the first quarter. Appriss was only completed a couple of weeks ago, so we're still early days of starting that integration. The cloud allows us to integrate more quickly. And as you know, our focus is to bring their unique data into our single data fabric. So that's underway with all of the acquisitions in order to drive their growth going forward. And we're seeing in Kount early positive days of top line synergies and very pleased with the plan on that acquisition. And we're very energized about Appriss and, of course, all the other acquisitions that we completed. The synergies from these acquisitions, I think we've been very clear when we announced the acquisitions, come in over multiple years. They start in year 1, like in 2021, there's some early synergies, they build. And year 2, in this case, 2022 for those 2 acquisitions and then they'll continue. And we've talked about kind of year 5 synergies in some of the acquisitions being quite substantial, and those build over time as you roll out the new solutions, the new products and fully integrate the business into our cloud capabilities and our single data fabric. With regards to your second question, we were clear when we announced Appriss a couple of months ago that we were going to pause on substantial M&A for a number of quarters, number one, to focus on integration; and number two, to bring our leverage back in line. So to answer your question, we would expect to be back doing M&A in the latter half of 2022 or somewhere in that time frame. We haven't stopped our corporate dev team of continuing to be in the market to look for M&A that would be a meaningful and accretive. And I hope you get a sense that we're quite disciplined about the kind of M&A we want to do. We've been very clear for a number of years about acquisitions we want to do around differentiated data, identity and fraud and broadening and strengthening Workforce Solutions. And the deals we've done this year have checked all those boxes, and you should expect the deals going forward to do the same. And also with the financial discipline that over the long term, they're accretive to our long-term growth rates and into our margins. We want to do deals that strengthen Equifax, broaden Equifax, but also enhance our financials and drive shareholder value. Most of it comes later, although Canada is well down the path of their tech transformation. They should get some benefits in '22. And there's some early benefits in U.K. and Spain and Australia as we get into 2022. But the bulk of that is going to really come particularly in Latin America in the latter parts of the year as we get into 2023. In the fourth quarter. Acquisitions, George. Correct. You're breaking up, but I think your question, George, was in 2022, our mortgage outperformance, how much is from M&A versus the core business. Is that right? Yes, it's substantially all organic. And the Workforce Solutions acquisitions are -- really don't have an impact on their outperformance in mortgage. Well, I'll start on that one, and John can jump in. We'll -- in a couple of weeks in our Investor Day presentation, we'll certainly give you our long-term framework around top line and margin growth. And we've been very clear, you should expect that to include our ability to grow our margins going forward. And '22 is clearly -- I don't know if you want to call it still a transitionary year. There's -- you've got the mortgage market impact, obviously. And then as you point out, we still have substantial cloud transformation costs in 2022. So we're not at a normal run rate in 2022. John? That's a different question about cannibalistic card. As far as a card issuer, I think some card issuers are probably seeing some pressure from BNPL, meaning consumers are using that instead of using their credit card to make purchases. When it comes to Equifax and our industry is providing data, BNPL, we sell a bunch of identity data to BNPL players around the globe. And increasingly, they're starting to use alternative data as a part of their underwriting, even in some -- many cases, credit data, meaning credit file data going forward. So I think if you look at the total pie on consumers using cash or debit versus BNPL and credit, the pie is growing, meaning consumers are using this as another way to finance their purchases, which from an Equifax perspective, we view as a good thing. And we've got discussions with all of the BNPL players about using our data and our identity data because you have to verify the identity of the consumer before you offer them financing even on a pair of jeans, so going forward. So we view it as a net positive for the credit bureaus and Equifax. I would start with number one is that, Manav, we're continuing to invest more next year than this year. We're intending to around new products innovation, DNA, customer growth. We see real leverage in doing that. So John talked about that. Go ahead, John. Yes. And so on the investment one, we will continue to balance as we have, since I've been here, balance growing our margins while investing in the business. And the $50 million that was referenced is areas where we see opportunities to continue to grow our investments in new products and DNA in order to drive our top line, and that's really around leveraging the cloud. I'll leave the long-term discussion until a couple of weeks on November 10 during Investor Day, where we can talk in more detail about that balance. But we've been very clear that we expect our margin -- we expect to expand our margins going forward while investing in Equifax. And there'll be a balance there that we think is the right thing for Equifax and for our shareholders over the long term. John, do you want to take the first question? Your first question was around verification revenue, and you want... Pricing, yes, yes. The pricing is one lever that we use across Equifax. Workforce clearly has more pricing power than our other businesses. And we expect to have price be a positive for us in 2022, and that's inside our early framework. And of course, we've got many, many other levers that we focus even more strongly on. New products is a big one in verification. Of course, the number of polls penetration, those will all drive the business and, of course, records underlie driving verification. Yes. I don't think we gave any real specific details on it. I can give you some color is that as we expected coming out of COVID, we expected cards and P loans to see some positive momentum, which we have, particularly around marketing. As you know, the card issuers and P loan issuers in 2020 really stopped a lot of the marketing because of the uncertainty around where the consumer was going to be. And now as you got into 2021 and certainly through the third quarter, we've seen an increase in marketing. You've seen that in our numbers. A lot of our marketing performance in USIS is from cards and some from P loans. And we expect to see issuers continue to try to acquire more customers and build up their balance sheets, which have come down as consumers have been paying down a lot of balances. So there's quite a bit of marketing activity going on, and we expect that to continue in the future. Yes. I think we talked in our comments that we expect the partner business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. It was clearly impacted by the tightening of originations by a lot of their customers, and on the direct business, we expect the same. So Gary, as we've talked about, we get the bulk of our records through our Employer Services business, and that's a steady increase in records, and 60% of our records come from that. So that's clearly a base area of focus where we have a dedicated team on the partnership side. They can be a little bit lumpy when you bring in a larger payroll processor. But there's still a lot of runway in that vertical, if you want to call it that, of continuing to expand those partnerships. And as we said, we've got continued momentum there and very active dialogues about them wanting to join. Another area for records is around HR software partnerships where they have access to records because of the software being embedded in an individual company. Both companies, as you know, process their own payroll. Some use their own systems, but most use some third-party systems. So that's another avenue for us in order to access records. And then we talked about our focus on gig and pension to go even further as far as our record addition. So we see a lot of runway in our ability to continue to grow records, which is, as you know, is a very valuable lever for top and bottom line growth at Workforce Solutions. Yes, sure. There's a bunch of them. I'll give you a couple in mortgage. In mortgage, our typical solution is a report that shows current income and employment, and it verifies that. And that might sell for $20 to $40, somewhere in that range. And as you know, because we have the 0.5 billion of historical records, in some mortgage applications, the complexity of the consumers' income, let's say, that they've changed jobs recently, so they don't have a lot of job history. Or let's say, that they get a lot of incentive-based income, he's either a salesperson or some other incentive-based income, meaning it's lumpy when the income comes in. They get it at the end of the year. And many of those solutions, you require more history. So we have it. So instead of selling that, call it, $20 to $40 solution, we'll sell a solution that has 24 months or 36 months or even 48 months, all different products, and those price points are in the $100, $150, $200 range, meaning substantially higher, and again, leveraging our historical data. Another mortgage solution is Mortgage Duo, which we rolled out in the last couple of months. Some mortgage applications have 2 income owners on it, a husband and wife using that example. And in the old solution, and it's still used, the originator would pull on the husband for $20 to $40 and then on the wife for $20 to $40 using that kind of a couple. We have a solution now that's priced between, I think, $175 and $200. It provides both reports at the same time. It also allows, I think, in that solution, a second poll somewhere in the mortgage application process. So substantially above the price point and again, delivering value to the originator because they're looking for speed and looking to complete it quickly. That's really the solution there. Turning to I-9, we've got an I-9 solution that typically, John, the I-9 traditional is in the $10 to $20 range? $30 to $40. $10 to $20 range is I-9, and we've got a new solution we've talked about the last couple of quarters that we rolled out that's an I-9 anywhere that allows the applicant to complete it on an Equifax app, the I-9 process, and then go verify it at a couple of thousand different sites across the United States that we do through our partnership. And that solution instead of being in, call it, that $10 range is in the $75 to $100 range, providing real value. Now the value is to that applicant and the employer to speed up the I-9 process so that individual can get on the job, on the floor, in the factory, in the restaurant. So a couple of different solutions in talent, same thing. We're starting to have solutions instead of just pulling a where does Mark work now solution, having more history because some employers want that. Some employers want where is Mark working now or the job that he's leaving. They want to verify that. Others will want to verify employment for the last 2 or 3 or 4 jobs. And as we mentioned earlier, we're going to be productizing a more comprehensive solutions that combine not only work history from our TWN database to 0.5 billion records that we have or the average 4.5 jobs on the average American. That work history, we're going to be adding to it incarceration data from Appriss, medical licensing and credentialing data from Appriss, university, secondary education college degrees from National Student Clearinghouse. Those will all be productized in a solution that will deliver more value, deliver more speed and at a higher price point than the individual solutions because of the value that it adds in speeding up that process. So those are all some examples of where we're focused on. And these are all driven by the new Equifax Cloud. These are things that would have been very challenging to do with the pace that we're doing it. In this case, we're talking mostly about Workforce Solutions, but the same across Equifax."

[Operator Instructions] A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDorian Hare: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I am Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer.  Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today on the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR our website www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making references to certain materials that can also be found in the presentation section of the News &Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q2 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including third quarter and full year 2021 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. Before I address Equifax's strong second quarter results, I want to recognize our 11,000 associates around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication in these challenging times. Our team members are our most important asset and they play a vital role in helping millions of consumers around the world to get access to credit.  On July 1, we opened all of our U.S. offices fully and rolled out our new Equifax flex program, a hybrid working environment that gives our team the opportunity to work from home one day per week. Our four one program recognizes our learnings from the past year around remote work during COVID, but maintains the core of our Equifax culture of collaboration and team work that is optimized by an in-person work environment.  We\u2019ve also resumed in-person meetings with our customers and I\u2019ve been energized with the conversations that have taken place so far. It\u2019s great to be moving back to a new normal.  We had a very strong second quarter and first half, which built off our strong outperformance in 2020. Our team has executed extremely well against the critical priorities of our new Equifax 2023 strategy, which is shown on Slide 4.  We are accelerating new product introductions, beginning to leverage our expanding Equifax cloud capabilities, and our highly differentiated data assets. We continue to expand our differentiated data assets both organically and through acquisition and partnerships. While still in the early days, our new Equifax cloud data and technology capabilities are providing competitive advantages and capabilities that only Equifax can provide.  And our Customer First initiatives are deepening our relationships with customers and delivering new products and solutions along with above market Equifax growth. And as always we remain focused on extending our leadership in security. Our EFX2023 growth strategy is our compass for the future and drives all of our growth initiatives as we move through the second half and into 2022 and beyond. We expect this focus to drive our top-line and bottom-line in the future.  Turning now to Slide 5. Equifax\u2019s financial performance in the second quarter was very strong and outperformed our underlying markets. Revenue of $1.235 billion was the highest quarterly revenue in our history breaking the record from last quarter. Local currency revenue growth of 23% and organic local currency growth of 20% were both very strong in some of the highest growth rates in our history.  Our U.S. B2B businesses and Workforce Solutions and USIS which together represent over 70% of our revenue, again drove our overall growth delivering very strong 25% total and 22% organic revenue growth despite the headwinds from the mortgage market that declined about 5%. The 5% decline in the mortgage market was about 500 basis points more than our flat expectation we shared with you in April.  U.S. B2B organic non-mortgage growth of 20% accelerated sequentially from the 16% we delivered in the first quarter. The 20% organic growth is also a record and reflects the underlying strength of Workforce Solutions and USIS\u2019s return to a competitive position.  I\u2019ll cover the BU performance \u2013 level of performance in detail in a moment, but at a high level, Workforce Solutions again led Equifax growth with revenue up a strong 40%. And as a reminder, this is of growth of 53% in second quarter last year and the mortgage that declined 5% in the quarter. USIS delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 11%, driven by non-mortgage total revenue growth of over 20% and strong organic revenue growth of 14%.  International delivered a very strong quarter of COVID recovery with revenue growth of 25% in local currency and importantly, all regions internationally delivered growth above 20%. Slightly better than expected GCS revenue was down 3% in local currency. However, our Consumer Direct revenue delivered 11% growth in the quarter, its second consecutive quarter in double-digits.  Second quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $431 million, up 20% with margins of 34.9%. Margins were down 160 basis points versus last year due to the inclusion of the cloud technology transformation cost in our adjusted results in 2021, which were excluded last year. This negatively impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin by 310 basis points.  Adjusting for cloud transformation cost of $38 million in the quarter, our margins would have been up a strong 150 basis points. We are getting strong leverage out of our above-market revenue growth.  Adjusted EPS of $1.98 per share was up a strong 21% from last year. Again adjusting for the cloud transformation cost, adjusted EPS would have been up a very strong 36% reflecting the strong performance in operating leverage of Equifax.  During the quarter, we continue to make significant progress with the Equifax Cloud Data and Technology transformation including an additional 7,700 customer migrations to the cloud in the United States and more than 900 migrations internationally. We remain on track with our cloud transformation and are confident in our plan.  We continue to expect that North American transformation to be principally complete in early 2022 with the remaining customer migrations completed by the end of next year. International transformation will follow North America being principally completed by the end of 2023. And as you know, last year we started to ramp up our focus in resources on new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud Data and Capabilities.  In the second quarter, we released 46 new products, which is up almost 2x from the 24 products we released a year ago in the quarter. These new products are increasingly leveraging the new Equifax cloud to deliver better data decisioning for our customers.  Driving NPIs, leveraging the new Equifax cloud is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and we continue to expect our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years to exceed 8%, a big step up from the 5% last year and a reflection of the strong product focus across EFX.  Our first half performance exceeded our expectations and we are clearly seeing continued strong momentum as we move into the second half. Based on our strong first half results and confidence in the future, we increased our full year revenue guidance by $165 million to a midpoint of $4.78 billion, which is up 400 basis points which is 16% growth.  We also increased our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.45 per share to a midpoint of $7.35 per share, which adjusting for the technology transformation cost is up 700 basis points to 19% growth. This includes our expectation if the U.S. mortgage market is measured by credit enquiries will decline approximately 8% in the year, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in April.  In the second quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 6 accelerated to 29%. This is up significantly from the 20% core revenue contribution we delivered in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter and well above our historical core growth rates.  While our outperformance in the mortgage market continues to drive significant core growth, the contribution from U.S. non-mortgage and international increased significantly in the quarter reflecting approximately 50% of core revenue growth in the quarter, excluding acquisitions and FX favorability.  Turning now to Slide 7, our strong second quarter results were broad based and reflect better than expected performance for all four Equifax business units. Workforce Solutions, our largest business had another exceptional quarter delivering 40% revenue growth and 58% adjusted EBITDA margins. Again as a reminder, the 40% revenue growth is on top of 53% growth last year in the second quarter.  EWS is cementing itself as our largest and most valuable business and it\u2019s powering our results representing 40% of total Equifax revenue in the quarter. EWS Verification Services revenue of $395 million was up a strong 57%. Verification Services\u2019 mortgage revenue grew 52% in the quarter, despite the 5% decline in the mortgage market from increased records, penetration and new products.  Importantly, Verification Services\u2019 non-mortgage revenue was up over 60% in the quarter and up over 15% sequentially from the first quarter. Our government vertical which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs including food and rental support grew over 10% in the quarter. Government remains one of our largest non-mortgage segments representing about a third of non-mortgage verification revenue.  We continue to expand our products and solutions in the government vertical and expect our new social security administration contract to go live this quarter with revenue ramping to a $40 million to $50 million runrate in 2022.  Talent Solutions, which comprise income and employment verifications, as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding process through our EWS Data Hub had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and MGIs growing over 200%. Talent Solutions now represents almost 30% of non-mortgage verification revenue.  Building out the EWS Data Hub that leverages the work history in our TWN database with other unique data elements used in the hiring process is a priority for us. Over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of that hiring process.  Our non-mortgage consumer business principally in banking and auto showed strong growth of about 50% in the quarter as well, both from deepening penetration with lenders and some recovery in these markets. Debt Management also returned to growth in the quarter.  Employer Services revenue of $101 million was about flat in the quarter as expected. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $64 million, down over 15% from last year.  Substantial declines in UC revenue in the second quarter were partially offset by new ERC revenue that began in the quarter as we support businesses in obtaining federal employee retention credit payments. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue up over 50% in the quarter. Our I-9 business driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product continue to show very strong growth, up over 50%. Our I-9 business is now almost half of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. Reflecting on the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of Workforce Analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses to deliver organic growth of over 20% for the year.  Reflecting the power and uniqueness of the TWN dataset, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted EWS EBITDA margins of 68%, a 160 basis point expansion from last year. Excluding technology transformation expenses, EWS margins would have been up over 240 basis points.  Rudy Ploder and EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter and are position to deliver a very strong 2021. Workforce Solutions is our most powerful and unique business and is calling Equifax results would grow substantially above the rest of the company.  Turning now to USIS, they had another strong quarter with revenue up 11% driven by strong performance across the business. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $160 million was down about 2% in the quarter, while mortgage enquiries were down 5%, below the flat expectation we shared at April.  John will cover our updated view of the mortgage markets shortly. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by over 300 basis points driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products.  Importantly, non-mortgage revenue performance was up 21% with strong organic growth of 14%. This performance reflects the commercial focus of Sid Singh and his team and their competitive position in the marketplace. Importantly, organic non-mortgage revenue also delivered strong sequential growth acceleration of 250 basis points from the first quarter's 11%, an important indicator of the continued strengthening of the USIS business. Banking and Insurance, both grew over 20% in the quarter. Auto and Direct-to-Consumer were both up over 10% and Telco and Commercial were just about flat in the quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking, our offline or batch business was $59 million in the quarter and up about 14%.  The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which is up over 20% and ID and fraud revenue growth of over 15%, as consumer marketing and originations ramped up coming out of COVID. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20% and risk decisioning about 35%. This strong growth across our non-mortgage business is encouraging as we move into the third quarter and the rest of 2021. The USIS new deal pipeline remains very strong and comparable to the strong levels we've seen so far in 2021. We have seen the highest growth in auto, financial services and mortgage.  USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 40.3% in the quarter, the decline of 380 basis points from second quarter last year was principally due to the cost related with cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and the inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation cost, which were being excluded in 2020. Sales and marketing expenses also increased in the quarter and sequentially to leverage both the stronger U.S. markets and increased NPI rollouts to drive growth. Shifting now to international, the revenue was up a strong 25% on a local currency basis, which is a third consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets. Revenue growth was up over 20% in all of our markets in Canada, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Europe.  Asia-Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, had a very strong quarter with revenue up $91 million or up about 21% in local currencies. Australia consumer revenue turned positive and was up 23% versus last year and up about 2% sequentially. Our commercial business combined online and offline revenue was up a very strong 26% in the quarter and almost 18% - up almost 18% sequentially. Fraud and Identity was up 30% in the quarter following 15% growth in the first quarter.  European revenues of $68 million were up 27% in local currency in the quarter. Our European Credit Reporting business is up about 20% with strong growth in both the UK and Spain. In UK, which is our largest European market, we saw growth of over 25% in Consumer, Data Analytics and scores and over 40% growth in commercial.  Our European debt management business revenue increased about 30% in local currency, off the lows we saw in the second quarter last year during the COVID recession.  Canada delivered record-setting revenue of $47 million in the quarter, up about 26% in local currency. Consumer online was up about 26% in the quarter, an improvement of 12 percentage points from the first quarter. Double-digit growth in commercial, analytical and decision solutions and ID and Fraud also drove growth in the Canadian revenue in the quarter.  Latin American revenues of $44 million grew 30% in the quarter in local currency, which was the second consecutive quarter of growth coming out of COVID. We continue to see the benefits in Latin America of the strong new product introductions the team has rolled out over the past three years.  International adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.3% were up 540 basis points from last year, driven by leverage on revenue growth and continued very good cost control by the international team. Excluding the impact of the inclusion of the technology transformation costs in adjusted EBITDA, margins were up over 750 basis points.  Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis in the quarter and slightly above our expectations. We again saw strong double-digit growth in our Global Consumer Direct business, which sells directly to consumers through equifax.com and which represents a little over half of GCS revenue. Direct-to-Consumer revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter, their fourth consecutive quarter of growth.  The decline in overall GCS revenue in the second quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead generation partner business. We expect the GCS partner business and GCS business overall to return to growth in the fourth quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.5% were up just about 170 basis points, which was better than our expectations. Turning now to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax and is clearly our strongest fastest growing and most valuable business. Workforce Solutions revenue grew a very strong 40% in the quarter with core revenue growth of 46%. And again, the 40% growth in the quarter was on top of 53% growth in the second quarter last year.  This above-market performance is driven by the uniqueness of the TWN income and employment data, the scale of the TWN database and the consistent execution by Rudy and his team. At the end of the second quarter, TWN reached 119 million active records, an increase of 13% or 14 million records from a year ago and included 91 million unique records. At 91 million uniques, we now have over 60% of non-farm payrolls, which makes our TWN dataset more valuable to our customers by delivering higher hit rates.  Beyond focusing on adding the over 50 million non-farm payroll records not in the TWN database yet, we're also focused on adding data records from the 40 million to 50 million Gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the United States marketplace to further broaden the TWN database. We have plenty of room to grow. We are now receiving contributions from 1.2 million companies across the U.S., up from 27,000 employers a short two plus years ago. And as a reminder, over 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers that EWS provides comprehensive employer services to like unemployment claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, Employee Retention Credit, HSA and other HR and compliance-related solutions. These relationships have been built up over the past decade by the Workforce Solutions team. The remaining 35% are contributed through partnerships with payroll providers and HR software companies, most of which are exclusive. The exclusive arrangement with a major payroll processor that we announced on our February call is still on track to become active later this year. We have a dedicated team with an active pipeline of record additions to continue to expand our TWN database in the future. And as you know, as we add records to the dataset, they are monetized almost instantly with our customer system-to-system integrations interacting with our TWN database.  Workforce Solutions continues to grow, penetration in key existing markets while expanding into new markets. We continue to increase our penetration in the mortgage market. As of the most recent data available at the end of 2020, Workforce Solutions received an inquiry in almost 60% of completed U.S. mortgages, which is up from 55% in 2019. This 500 basis point increase shows a continuation of growth in TWN mortgage penetration, as well as the substantial opportunity for continued growth that exist in mortgage with only 60% of mortgages using TWN data today. We are also seeing substantial growth in TWN in the non-credit markets of Government and Talent Solutions as well as increased TWN usage within the card and auto verticals.  As we discussed in the past, growing system-to-system integrations is a key lever in driving both increased penetration and the increased number of polls per transaction for Workforce Solutions. During the quarter, about 75% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system-to-system, which was up 2x from the 32% in 2019.  The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding as our teams leveraged the power of our new Equifax Cloud infrastructure. We plan to rollout new products in mortgage Talent Solutions, Government and I-9 in the second half of the year. New product revenue will increase in 2021 and 2022 as we begin to reap the benefits of our new products introduced in the market by Workforce Solutions in the past 18 months.  Rudy and the Workforce Solutions team had multiple levers for growth in 2021, 2022 and beyond. Workforce is clearly our largest and most valuable business and we will continue to power our results in the future. Workforce Solutions growth rates and margins are highly accretive to Equifax, now and in the future. Slide 9 provides perspective on the tremendous growth Workforce has delivered since 2017 and the increasing impact of the business it has on Equifax with its highly accretive revenue growth rates and margins. In 2017, Workforce Solutions revenue and EBITDA made up 23% of Equifax revenue and 27% of business unit EBITDA.  For the first half of 2021, Workforce Solutions revenue and EBITDA have increased to 40% of Equifax revenue and over half of Equifax business unit EBITDA. In a short four years, Workforce Solutions has more than doubled in size and is now almost 50% in the first half versus the same period last year. It is up almost 50% in the first half versus same period last year. Our unique TWN employment and income assets and the continued expansion of employment-related assets within the Equifax Data Hub provides opportunities for both ongoing outsized growth in Equifax traditional financial markets of mortgage, banking, auto, as well as a substantial growth in new verticals in Government, Talent Solution and others to come.  We expect that Workforce Solutions will continue to be an increasingly large part of Equifax and power our top and bottom-line with the above-market growth in margins. Turning to Slide 10, this provides a perspective on the return to growth USIS delivered since 2018. USIS has delivered strong double-digit revenue growth over the past six quarters. Although the strong mortgage market has advantaged USIS as shown in the bottom left of the slide, USIS has driven consistent sequential improvement in non-mortgage growth since second quarter last year with the overall growth in USIS being driven by 18% non-mortgage growth in the first half of 2021.  The USIS team is also increasingly leveraging the Equifax Cloud to design and implement new NPIs for customers. The Equifax Cloud new products and our unique data assets are making USIS teams more competitive in the marketplace. And the USIS team is focused on integrating Kount into new Equifax Cloud and we are seeing increased used cases in opportunities with our ID and Fraud vertical from the Kount acquisition.  We expect ID and Fraud to play a large role in USIS growth in 2021 and beyond. I encourage you to review the ID and Fraud slides in our broader Investor Presentation, which can be found on our Investor Relations website following this call. Turning to Slide 11. This highlights the core growth performance in our mortgage for our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Our U.S. B2B businesses delivered a combined 25% revenue growth in mortgage in the second quarter, which was 30 points stronger than the 5% mortgage decline we saw in overall mortgage market.  The strong outperformance was again primarily driven by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 57%. Consistent with past quarters, EWS\u2019 outperformance was driven by new records, increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates and new products. Proof that lenders are increasingly becoming reliant on the unique TWN income and employment data when making credit decisions in the mortgage space. USIS delivered 4% core mortgage revenue growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions and further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow underlying markets is core to our business model and core to our future growth. I'll now turn the presentation over to John to discuss current trends in the mortgage market and to walk through our third quarter and revised full year 2021 guidance.\nJohn Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, our Q2 results were very much stronger than we discussed with you in April, with revenue about $85 million higher than the midpoint of the expectation we shared. For perspective, all we used performed well relative to the expectations we shared.  Performance in non-mortgage and our U.S. businesses, Workforce and USIS was very strong in absolute terms and relative to the expectations we shared. Our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses and Workforce Solutions declined in the quarter, but much less than expected.  International revenue performance was also very strong, again both in absolute terms and relative to our expectations. And although the mortgage market was down 5% versus our expectation of flat, our mortgage revenue principally in Workforce was not impacted to the same degree. This strong revenue drove the upside in adjusted EPS relative to the expectations we shared. Now, turning to mortgage, as shown on Slide 12, U.S. mortgage market credit increase declined 5% in 2Q 2021, weaker than the about flat we had included in our guidance. Our financial guidance for 2021 assumes that the trend in mortgage credit increase we saw in late June and July continues in 3Q 2021 resulting in a decline of mortgage market credit increase of about 23% in 3Q 2021 versus 3Q 2020.  Although our second half 2021 market credit inquiry assumptions are down significantly from the second half of 2020, they remain above the average as we saw prior to 2020. As shown in the left-side of Slide 13, mortgage market indicators remain above the peak seen in previous mortgage cycles.  Despite the substantial refinance activity that has occurred over the past year, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing remains at a relatively strong level of about $12 million. Refinance activity continues to benefit from low and recently declining mortgage rates and a substantial appreciation in home prices over the past year. Based upon our most recent data from January, mortgage refinancings continue to run just under $1 million per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 13, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. The strong new purchase market is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into 2022.  Slide 14 provides our guidance for 3Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.160 billion to $1.180 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 9% to 11%, including a 1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.8%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q 2021 to be $1.62 to $1.72 per share compared to 3Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.91 per share. In 3Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $40 million or $0.25 a share.  Excluding these costs, which were excluded from 3Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 3Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.87 to $1.97 per share. This performance is being delivered in the context of the U.S. mortgage market, which is expected to be down 23% versus 3Q 2020. Comparing the midpoint of our 3Q 2021guidance sequentially to our very strong 2Q 2021performance, revenue is down about $65 million. The drivers of this decline are two main factors. The largest factor is a decline in mortgage revenue, driven by the impact of the expectation we shared regarding the decline in the U.S. mortgage market.  The other significant factor is our expectation that we'll see a significant sequential decline in unemployment claims revenue. Our guidance for adjusted EPS declines about $0.30 per share sequentially. The bulk of this decline is driven by lower gross profit on the revenue expectation I just discussed. In addition, we are increasing investment sequentially in sales and marketing, particularly in the U.S. as well as increasing investment in products and technology.  Slide 15 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially, reflecting our very strong 2Q 2021 performance. In the second half of 2021, we expect strong growth in our U.S. non-mortgage business and international and a return to growth in GCS.  We also expect our U.S. mortgage business to grow about 15% in 2021 over 20 points faster than the expected approximately 8% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. 2021 revenue of between $4.76 billion and $4.8 billion reflects revenue growth of about 15% to 16% versus 2020 including a 1.5% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.9%.  EWS is expected to deliver about 30% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid-to-high single-digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 10% and GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single-digits in 2021. 3Q 2021 revenue is also expected to be down mid single-digits, with 4Q 2021 revenue returning to growth. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These one-time costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2017 through 2020.  In 2021, Equifax expects to incur one-time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately a $155 million, a reduction of over 55% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $155 million in one-time costs would reduce adjusted EPS by about $0.97 per share.  This estimate of one-time technology transformation cost is up $10 million from a $145 million we guided in April. Given our very strong performance in 2021, we are investing to accelerate our tech transformation globally. 2021 adjusted EPS of $7.25 to $7.45 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs is up 4% to 7% from 2020. Excluding the impact of the tech transformation cost of $0.97 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 will show growth of about 18% to 21% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by the redundant system costs of $79 million related to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about $0.49 per share and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about 7 percentage points. Additional assumptions included in 2021 guidance will be posted to the July Investor Relations presentation to be posted later today.  Slide 16 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth that is included in our current guidance. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of movements in the mortgage market and Equifax revenue, as well as the impact of changes in our UC claims and Employee Retention Credit businesses within our Employer Services business.  Employee Retention Credits are specific U.S. government incentives for companies to retain their employees in response to COVID-19 and the associated revenue is not expected to continue into 2022. The data shown for 3Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of the guidance ranges we provided.  In 1Q 2021 and 2Q 2021, we delivered very strong core revenue growth of 20% and 29% respectively. We continued to deliver strong core revenue growth in 3Q 2021 of 17% and 19% for all of 2021 in our expectations.  As Mark mentioned earlier, the composition of our core revenue growth is becoming more balanced, reflecting substantially increasing contributions from U.S. non-mortgage, International and as we enter 4Q 2021 GCS. And we continue to expect our mortgage business to grow at rates faster than the overall mortgage market. This very strong performance we believe positions us well entering 2022 and beyond. And now, I'd like to hand it back to Mark.\nMark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning now to Slide 17, as I referenced earlier, pricing power in our technology teams continue to make very strong progress on our new Equifax Cloud Data and Technology Transformation, with the North American technology transformation expected to be principally complete in early 2022 and the remainder of North America transformation and customer migrations completing by the end of next year and our international transformations following North America being principally complete by the end of 2023.  Equifax's transformation to a cloud-native environment delivers a host of capabilities that only Equifax can provide as the only cloud-native data and technology company. The Equifax Cloud will deliver always on stability, accelerated response time and built-in industry-leading security. It will provide our customers with real-time access to data and insights that they can rely on to make decisions. The Equifax Cloud through our Ignite analytics platform will allow customers and Equifax data scientists to work together utilizing EFX unique data assets and customer proprietary assets to define attributes and models to improve customer outcomes.  And we will continue to accelerate the time from analytics to production to bring new products and solutions to market faster and more efficiently enhancing customer benefits and Equifax revenue. Already the Equifax Cloud has enabled us to produce new products designed and delivered on our Cloud infrastructure four times faster than the past. We began to leverage these cloud benefits in 2020, as we more effectively developed new products and delivered them to market leveraging the new EFX cloud, growing new product introductions by 44% last year - in 2020. These new improvements have been further accelerated in 2021 as we are delivering the highest number of new products in our history and we are realizing higher revenue from new product introductions. Slide 18 provides an update on NPIs, a key driver of our current and future revenue growth. As we just discussed, the new cloud transformation has significantly strengthened our NPI capabilities allowing us to increase both the number of NPIs and the revenue generated from new products. We continue to expand our product resources and focus on transforming Equifax into a product-led organization, leveraging our best-in-class Equifax cloud-native data and technology to fuel top-line growth.  As I discussed earlier, in the second quarter, we delivered 46 new products, which is up about almost 2x from the 24 we delivered last year. Year-to-date, we've rolled out 85 new products, which is up 44% from the 59 that we delivered in the first half last year. We are energized as we continue to grow off an NPI record-setting 2020.  We wanted to highlight some of these products rolled out during the quarter, which we expect to drive revenue growth over the second half and in the next few years. Our new payment Insights products launched by USIS in April was delivered in partnership with Urjanet and uses consumer permission utility in telco data to improve views of customers, consumers' financial picture and help credit invisibles.  The cloud-based solution promotes greater financial inclusion regardless of the consumers' traditional credit score by empowering consumers to show utility and telco payment history with banks or lenders when applying for loans or other services. The product also allows lenders to seamlessly integrate data into review processes while meeting industry-leading standards for protection of consumer data security, confidentiality and integrity. Workforce Solution launched a new mortgage 36 product in May. This solution addresses income verification needs by enabling mortgage lenders to pull an extended set of both active and inactive income and employment data for a more complex income mortgage applicants where additional history may be needed in the underwriting process.  EWS also launched a new talent report employment staffing product in April. This solution provides flexibility on the number of past employers pulled to meet the employment verification needs of the employer. Staffing agencies leverage VOE as a reference check was often looking to verify only to employers, which this product helps deliver. In the United Kingdom, we launched the Credit Vitality View app. This Ignite-based app visualizes key credit data trends across the UK versus a company's own performance. It uses a range of macroeconomic measures and includes filtering capabilities, so our customers can focus on the performance of their own portfolio and product lines such as mortgages or credit cards. The app also can illustrate these company and market trends over multiple years. Lastly, we introduced the Equifax Affordability Solutions in Australia, New Zealand. These solutions deliver automated, categorized income and expense verifications in a way that delivers meaningful and actionable insights for our customers. Our customers can easily digest and act on these insights through the delivery of comprehensive consumer affordability reports, which are now required from a regulatory standpoint in these markets. This new solution will reduce loan application processing timing cost, improve conversion rates and maximize efficiency, while fulfilling responsible lending regulatory requirements, delivering overall improvements to the consumer experience.  These are just some examples of the new solutions we launched during the quarter. We are focused on leveraging our new cloud capabilities to increase NPI rollouts and new product revenue in 2021 and beyond. Growing NPIs is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. And as a reminder, our Vitality Index is defined as the percentage of revenue delivered by NPIs launched during the past three years. In April, we increased our Vitality Index outlook for 2021 from 7% to 8% and we remain confident in this framework for 2021. As you can see from the left of the slide, our 8% vitality outlook for 2021 is a big step forward from the 5% vitality we delivered last year. NPIs are a big priority for me and the team as we leverage the Equifax Cloud for innovation new products and growth. Slide 19 showcases the capabilities we've been building over the past three years that only Equifax can bring to the marketplace. We have unique market-leading differentiated data at scale that includes our 228 million ACRO credit records, 119 million TWN income and employment records and additional data at scale that comes from our alternative datasets including Kount and CTUE, PayNet, IXI and others. Our advanced analytics allow us to build and test attributes faster, leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning, and develop models in days and weeks where used to take months. Our team of 320 data scientists located around the world are leveraging our advanced analytics and Equifax Cloud-native infrastructure to define and deploy cloud-native products and solutions. And our cloud-native data fabric is allowing us to key EnLink our unique data asset in ways that we could never do before. Our data fabric stretches across the globe and we are in the early innings of leveraging its global capabilities. Only Equifax can provide these capabilities and we are on offense as we deploy these into the marketplace.  Wrapping up on Slide 20, Equifax delivered a record-setting second quarter. We have strong momentum as we move into the second half. Our 26% overall and 29% core revenue growth in the quarter reflects the strength and breadth of our business model and early benefits from our Equifax Cloud investments and of course, its enhanced focus on new products. We\u2019ve delivered six consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth. Our strong performance reflects the execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities, Equifax's on offense. As we discussed earlier, we are confident in our outlook for 2021 and we raised our full year midpoint revenue guidance to $4.78 billion, increasing our 2021 growth rate by over 370 basis points to almost 16%. We also raised our midpoint EPS guidance to $7.35 increasing the growth rate by over 640 basis points. As we discussed earlier, Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter delivering 40% revenue growth and 58% EBITDA margins. EWS is our largest fastest growing and most valuable business. During the quarter, Workforce Solutions delivered 40% of Equifax revenue and we expect EWS to continue to drive Equifax's operating performance throughout 2021 and beyond as consumers recognize the value of our growing TWN database. Rudy and his team remain focused on driving outsized growth by focusing on their key growth drivers of adding new records, rolling out new products, driving penetration, driving their new Talent Solutions Data Hub, expansion into new verticals and leveraging their new EFX cloud capabilities.  USIS also delivered another strong quarter of 11% growth, driven by their 14% non-mortgage organic growth. We expect USIS non-mortgage growth to continue to be strong due to the economic recovery, the commercial focus of the team, new products and our unique alternative data assets. Sid and the USIS teams are competitive and winning in the marketplace and will continue to deliver in 2021 and beyond.  International grew for the third consecutive quarter, accelerating to 25% in local currency in the second quarter as economies reopen and business activity resumes. Our new international leader, Lisa Nelson has high expectations for her team and we expect continued strong growth through the rest of 2021. We are beginning to realize the benefits of our EFX Cloud Data and Technology transformation as we accelerate new product innovation with products designed and built off of our new EFX Cloud infrastructure. We\u2019ve spent the last three years building the Equifax Cloud and we're now starting to leverage our new cloud capabilities. As we move through the rest of the year and into 2022, we'll be increasingly realize the top-line, cost and cash benefits from these new cloud capabilities.  Accelerating new products, leveraging our differentiated data and the new EFX cloud capabilities is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. We are beginning to see the benefits of our new product focus and resources leveraging the EFX cloud with the 85 NPIs completed in the first half, pacing well ahead of the record 134 we delivered last year. As we discussed in the past, bolt-on acquisitions that expand our differentiated data assets, strengthening Workforce Solutions and broadening our ID and fraud capabilities are integral to our future growth framework. We have reinvested our strong cash flow in five bolt-on acquisitions so far this year that will add 170 basis points to our revenue in the second half. We will continue to focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen Workforce Solutions. I am more energized now than when I joined Equifax three years ago what the future holds as we move from building the cloud to our next chapter of growth leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, growth and new products. We have strong momentum across our business as we move into the second half and we are beginning to deliver on the benefits of the significant cloud data and technology investments we made over the past three years. Equifax's on offense and positioned to bring new and unique solutions for our customers that only Equifax can deliver leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities. With that operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now live. \nDavid Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, John. Good to see the strong growth and NPI continuing in the 13% new record growth. Clearly, the first half outperformance versus your guidance continue to come from the strength in Workforce Solutions. So, as we look at the second half guidance, what\u2019s embedded in terms of the outperformance of EWS core mortgage growth versus the mortgage market 62 percentage points in Q2. How are you thinking about the back half in terms of EWS core mortgage outperformance?\nMark Begor : Yes. So, David, we don\u2019t give specifics by BU in terms of how we break down core. But as you can see from the detail we gave we are expecting to have very good core growth in the third quarter at 17%. We are expecting EWS with the continued performance extremely well and we are expecting them to continue to substantially outgrow the mortgage market.  And as we indicated for the full year, we expect our mortgage revenue to grow 15%, that\u2019s up from what we talked about in April and it\u2019s more than 20 points higher than the 8% decline that we are talking about for the overall mortgage market itself. So, we expect EWS to continue to substantially outperform and to continue to deliver very high core revenue growth.  To give you data there is multiple levers by the Workforce Solutions team to drive that outperformance, it\u2019s specifically in mortgage and of course all the other verticals that the record additions help fuel that the new product roll outs that the team did last year and are continuing this year in the mortgage space will drive that.  We gave some visibility around our growth in the mortgage market itself. As you know, we don\u2019t see every mortgage. So the team is focused on adding income and employment from Equifax. The large portion of mortgage is we still don\u2019t see. And of course, we are continuing to drive the system-to-system integration.  So, all of those libraries that are what Rudy and his team are deploying to continue to drive that outperformance not only the mortgage market, but all of their markets. \nDavid Togut : Appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, looking at the 14% USIS organic non-mortgage growth in Q2, in which verticals are you gaining significant market share? And if you could maybe kind of compare where you are today in kind of non-mortgage USIS versus where you were a year ago? \nMark Begor : Yes. I would say, first, we are certainly benefiting from the economic recovery. We\u2019ve seen that in card issuers and really all of the financial institutions are doing more marketing. You\u2019ve seen strong performance there in the consumers back in accessing credit products. So you\u2019ve seen that both in the mortgage side but I think you are focused more on the non-mortgage of course.  The new product rollouts are benefiting Sid and his team as they are focused on bringing new products to market. And really broadly, we\u2019ve got a strong focus as we\u2019ve been very clear over the last, really almost 24 months about the focus that the team has on building out their deal pipeline. They are focused on their customers.  We\u2019ve rebuilt and enhanced our commercial team with more coverage. We\u2019ve added more resources. We\u2019ve re-levered the commercial team. So, all of those are benefiting from us and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in our ability to be competitive in the non-mortgage market in USIS going forward. \nDavid Togut : Thanks very much. Appreciate all the insights. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question today is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. [Operator Instructions] Kevin, your line is now live. \nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks. I am going to ask one question, because I got a couple parts to it. But, hey Mark, you\u2019ve got EWS\u2019 40% of revenue today, 53% of EBITDA versus about 23% in 2017, somewhere around there. It feels to me like, what\u2019s happening with the TTI as you are accelerating the shift to EWS. So, can you help us understand kind of the dynamics of how the cloud transition impacts EWS versus the core business?  And then, within the context to that, if my math is right, the average client size was about 4000 contributors in terms of employees in 2018 versus about a 100 today. So, how do those dynamics kind of impact EWS?  What I am trying to get at is, it feels like, there is going to be structurally higher level of growth looking beyond the volatilities just mortgage overall. And again, it feels like that\u2019s something structural. So, just maybe trying to frame that to the extent you can help us. \nMark Begor : Sure. And just broadly, as you know, we are focused on growing all of our businesses, all four business units. And clearly, Workforce Solution is very unique and really driven by the uniqueness of the income and employment data that it has at scale and the value of that. And we\u2019ve talked I think, Kevin, in the past that there was an element of catalyst from our perspective when the dataset got over 50% of non-farm payroll, call it a year ago.  And it just made the dataset more valuable. And when you think about someone\u2019s credit history, did they pay their bills is very valuable, but are they working and how much do they make is equally valuable. And really only Equifax has that dataset. The Workforce Solutions business has levers as we talked a couple of times on the call already they are really quite unique.  And I think it starts with records. Most data businesses have all the records. Workforce Solutions has shown a history of building out their dataset and as I talked in my comments, we added 14 million \u2013 rough 14 million records on a year-over-year basis. So we are continuing to add records. As you know, we got visibility for a significant addition or meaningful addition from a large payroll processor in the second half of the year.  And we are out there talking to individual companies to grow the dataset, which we do through our Employer Services business by providing those services. And then of course, the other payroll processors or that we don\u2019t have now with Equifax we are working to add. So records is a very important lever for that business and there is a long runway not only with non-farm payroll, where we are at 91 million unique versus 150 million or so total non-farm payroll.  But we are focused on the Gig economy, which is another 40 million to 50 million individuals that have either first or second jobs or self-employed outside of the non-farm payroll and then of course pensioners. So, records are big opportunity for Workforce to grow.  And then you\u2019ve seen a lot of growth over the last couple of years beyond mortgage. Mortgage was always a place that this business is focused on and we\u2019ve been able to grow very, very strongly in the government vertical and of course you know, we got the large SSA contract that\u2019s going live in the second half and ramp to $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue in 2022. So, that\u2019s an example of the dataset being used in another use case.  And the other area that we\u2019ve been focused on outside of just kind of the core growth of the products and attrition, more usage and records is around strengthening the business through M&A. As you know, we\u2019ve done two acquisitions so far this year. HIREtech and i2Verify to strengthen our Employer Services business, which delivered records.  Of course, that\u2019s just a good core business. We talked about some of the solutions we have in the market like on anywhere they are growing outside of some of our traditional financial markets. So that focus on the hiring process where 75 million people are hired every year or change jobs and most of them have to have some kind of background screening done that relies on work history along with government data elements.  And today, we are building out the Equifax Data Hub, our Workforce Solutions Data Hub that includes our TWN data, but also other unique data elements and we\u2019d like to do more M&A in that space to strengthen Workforce Solutions as I mentioned in my comments that we are focused on building that out.  And just maybe closing on Workforce, the business has a long history of outperforming its underlying markets and I think if you look back a couple of years, you\u2019ve seen a step-up in that outperformance in the last couple of years that we link to the scale of the dataset. The cloud has allowed us to ingest more data more quickly.  Think about it two years ago, maybe three years ago, we had 27,000 contributors or companies contributing. Now we have a 1.2 million and there is different numbers about there and how many companies there are in the United States, 3 million, 4 million, 5 million. But we are really scaling that dataset quite substantially. So, it\u2019s a very unique business. It\u2019s one that we are investing in organically.  The cloud is allowing them to ingest more data and you\u2019ve seen a ramp up in new products coming out from Workforce Solutions as they start to leverage the new product capabilities and of course that\u2019s happening across Equifax. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. \nManav Patnaik : Thank you. Mark, I apologize, just what you said on the Workforce M&A. Did you say that background screening was an area you are interested in or what was the comment? \nMark Begor : No, no. No, I didn\u2019t say that. What I said was that, what\u2019s really interests us and when we talked about it before is, number one, strengthening the core Workforce Solutions. It\u2019s our strongest business. It\u2019s our largest business. It\u2019s our fastest growing business. And doing acquisitions like HIREtech and i2Verify is clearly a priority for Equifax.  The other area that we\u2019ve talked before with you and others about is the Talent Solutions Data Hub. We want to be in the data business around the hiring process. We are now, as you know, with our work history. We have an average of 4.5 jobs on the average American in our database and that work history is very valuable in the hiring process.  And beyond work history, as you know, other data elements like, where did you go to school. What licenses did you have. Have you ever been incarcerated before. Have you been arrested before. All those data elements are very, very valuable and we are building now our data hub of partnerships. If we could find a good way to M&A in that space, we\u2019d like to do it. \nManav Patnaik : Okay. That makes sense. And just, John, I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but I was hoping you to help us just how to think about what you\u2019ve baked into your guidance, so just the growth in verification and employee services for the back half of the year? \nJohn Gamble: Yes. So, I think what we talked about is we gave a good view, I think what we expect the growth to be for the full year and as we indicated, we expect Workforce Solutions to grow over 30% in the year. So, obviously, that\u2019s up substantially from what we talked about in April. So, it reflects the much stronger performance in the second quarter but also continuing very strong performance in the third and fourth quarters. And we are expecting as I said, as we continue the strong performance across really all the businesses as we talked about I think effectively, we held or increased our expectation for growth in all of our businesses in the full year and therefore in the second half. So, we are feeling very good about the trend. \nManav Patnaik : Alright. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live. \nMario Cortellacci: Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just a quick question on your international business and I guess, specifically Australia. Could you just walk us through how margins in that business differ from other international markets? And then, if you could also just talk about your view on the recovery there? I think they did went into lockdown again. So, just want to get your outlook. \nMark Begor : Yes. International still is broadly kind of lagging the United States, maybe Canada is quite similar as far as the vaccine rollouts. But other markets, I guess, UK is similar. But that\u2019s been choppier internationally than it has in the United States for sure and as you point out, Australia has got another lockdown, because the vaccines are really lagging there. The market has adjusted lot of international markets like it did in the United States quicker, meaning customers and consumers figure how to live their lives and operate their businesses in more of a virtual environment. And I think that\u2019s what we are seeing in Australia with \u2013 and our international markets that are still lagging in some regards, particularly in Latin America around the COVID lockdowns being relapsed.  The margins, John, we are not growing dramatically different and on a global basis, I wouldn\u2019t characterize them differently by market. We really don\u2019t talk about on a market basis. \nJohn Gamble: Yes. We don\u2019t talk about them on a market basis, right. But what we\u2019ve indicated historically is, markets that look very much like the U.S., so we talk about Canada tends to run at higher margins than some other businesses. Australia looks probably more like international averages than you think about Canada that would be stronger. \nMario Cortellacci: Understood. And then, just my follow-up, could you just comment on the Fraud segment of the business? And how much further scale can you gain there more through more M&A post the Kount deal. Obviously, it\u2019s a highly fragmented market there. And then, any initial views on synergies that you are seeing as you are integrating Kount? \nMark Begor : Yes. I commented earlier that we are quite encouraged by that. We are really very energized and pleased with the acquisition in the team that we brought on board from Kount. ID and fraud is a very strategic growth area. It\u2019s also an area as you pointed out, if we could find more M&A, we\u2019d like to do it to broaden. It\u2019s a very big space and as you pointed out, it\u2019s very fragmented.  We think we\u2019ve got very unique data assets to play in identity and fraud and kind of really augments that and that\u2019s really the power of the Kount combination and synergies with Equifax. It\u2019s really leveraging their data at scale from the ecommerce world. They have something like 32 billion interactions every year with consumers.  They have really scaled data assets around email addresses, IP addresses, cellphone numbers, over 400 million verified elements. And with ecommerce, you are interacting very quickly, because a lot of people are doing ecommerce. So the data is very current. And the combination of that data from Kount with Equifax is really the power.  And ID and fraud, we believe starts with data and that\u2019s why we think we have a license to play and if we could find more and we are looking for more M&A in the ID and Fraud space to further strengthen our position is a huge TAM that the market is, I think, close to $18 billion globally for ID and Fraud and it\u2019s growing at 20% with the large digital macro meaning more consumers interacting in really every aspect of their lives, whether it\u2019s financial services, insurance, telco, or of course, ecommerce and retail digitally.  And with that digital interaction, the requirement to verify that Mark is really Mark, it\u2019s critically important. And that\u2019s where the data assets come in. And also to do it seamlessly meaning where the consumer doesn\u2019t feel it. And the way to do that is to power it with more data. So, we are quite energized about the integration with Kount. The progress so far and it\u2019s an area we\u2019d like to be bigger in going forward both organically through the products and the synergies of the Kount acquisition, but also inorganically if we could find some M&A that would strengthen us. \nMario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now live. \nMark Begor : Hey, George. \nGeorge Mihalos: Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on another strong quarter. Wanted to ask a broad question to kind of start things off, obviously, there is a lot of debate going on looking at the bond markets and alike. But, to the extent, we enter a more inflationary period going forward, is that\u2019s something that could be a catalyst for you guys both in terms of people relying more on credit and obviously, potentially the help of some of your FI customers in an environment where rates go up. I am just curious how you guys are thinking about that, if you are thinking about that at all? \nMark Begor : Yes. We think about it and so, obviously, something that is hard to forecast. But when you think about interest rates going up, or inflation going up I think you got to step back and look at the consumer itself. The consumer coming out of COVID is very strong. But at the same time they are coming out of COVID with some pent-up demand.  When we think that bodes well for the credit environment, meaning that the consumers are healthier, meaning they can access more credit and there is an underlying desire to going vacations, expand your home, buy new car, all those elements I think are a catalyst for the economy which we are already seeing and obviously quite strong.  And for the credit bureaus in Equifax, that means our customers are going to be spending more in marketing, spending more on originations and looking for new solutions to identify the consumers. If you think about our customers, they are very healthy. They really managed the pandemic much more strongly because their consumer was stronger.  Their losses were not anywhere near what were anticipated. So, our customers are strong and they are looking to grow. And if you got a consumer that\u2019s been paying down balances in lots of areas like cards and others during the pandemic because the stimulus and their broad financial strengths.  Our customers need to build up their balance sheets by getting more loans on their books, whether it\u2019s credit card or personal loan, an auto loan or a mortgage and of course, the other area that we watch is what impact higher interest rates may have in the future on the mortgage market. The one counter to that is there is still at least in current rates, a loan pipeline and John talked about it of consumers that will still benefit from a refi.  And then, the other element that we are watching is, home price appreciation is up dramatically. And that home price appreciation is an asset for consumers that historically they will access through either home equity loans or a refi of their mortgage to cash out refi. So that\u2019s another catalyst that there we keep an eye on. So, there is a lot of variables there which, - but when we think about our guidance for the second half, we got a lot of confidence in the underlying Equifax business, our ability to perform, which is why we raise guidance. \nGeorge Mihalos: Okay. Great. Appreciate that color. Obviously, there are lot of puts and takes there. And then, John, just a housekeeping question and forgive me if you have answered this, I maybe missed it. But the margins in USIS, I think you called out several factors, some related to the inclusion of some of the tech expenses and then some additional sales and marketing as you would invest more in the segment. Is there a way to think about what the margins would have been in the year-over-year basis, apples-to-apples, so basically excluding what the contribution to expenses were from increased tech costs? \nJohn Gamble: Yes. I think, what we said is that, the biggest driver were the tech-related costs and the decline of about I think it was 380 basis points year-on-year. We\u2019ve also definitely invested more in marketing and sales given new NPI rollouts in the improving economy. And that\u2019s certainly impacted year-on-year and that would have been more impactful if you think about sequential. But we didn\u2019t give specifics. But we did indicate that the biggest driver of year-on-year decline is the tech-related cost. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. \nMark Begor : Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman : Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. So, two questions. One, John, could you tell us the percentage of revenues in mortgage for just the second quarter just reported? And the second question is, I wanted to get back to a comment in Mark\u2019s prepared remarks about growth in Employer Services. I am pretty sure, Mark, that you said 20% growth this year outside of UC and ERC. Just again, correct me if I heard it right. And is that organic number and how much would we think that UC and ERC would change that number when thinking about ES growth for the whole year? \nMark Begor : Andrew, mortgage was about 32% of revenue in the quarter. \nAndrew Steinerman : Thank you. \nMark Begor : And on the Employer Services, we did say that we expect it to be up 20% for the year. And that\u2019s really driven by a lot of the new product roll outs that we have, the I-9 Anywhere solutions. We are just seeing real traction in the hiring process that\u2019s really driving that. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live. \nSimon Clinch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up again with Verification Service in particular. I\u2019ve been quite excited by the step-up in growth rates for the non-mortgage portion in the second quarter. And this is before you\u2019ve got the Social Security Contract before you\u2019ve got the new record coming in. So, I was wondering if you help me understand or give me some color around how to think about that pace of growth as we move through the next year or two, because I am struggling to work a wide or such a big step-up in the fourth quarter. \nMark Begor : Yes. There is an element of COVID recovery in there in some of the markets like cards and in auto and P loans, so that there is an element to that. Records are a piece of it for sure. As you add records, our hit rates go up. So that\u2019s clearly an element. Our real focus on new products in that space and as you point out, SSA contract that will go live in the second half will really ramp in \u2013 somewhat in the second half of the year. But it\u2019s really a 2022 benefit as it gets to full \u2013 the full runrate. There is just a lot of opportunities for us in the non-mortgage space. In Talent Solutions, we talked about a very strong growth there. And then, some of the other non-mortgage financial verticals are performing well. \nJohn Gamble: Yes. Mark mentioned huge growth in Talent Solutions and government, which are the two biggest segments by far in Verification Services. \nSimon Clinch : Okay. Understood. Thank you. And just a follow-up. I was wondering just more broadly, with some of the fin-tech startups growing in the market today, that are effectively using multiple or alternative datasets just like you are, yourselves.  But it\u2019 also using the credit reports in data as well to sort of improve models for risk assessments and decision-making in the credit process. As that where you have gone today, but it\u2019s not kind of market opportunity grows. You become \u2013 I am assuming you become more competitive along with. And I was wondering if you could talk about that that\u2019s the longer term competitive dynamic and how you are planning to navigate that? \nMark Begor : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t think about them as competitors. They are customers and partners. The bulk of the data they use in their processes comes from us or our competitors. They have some of their own data from historical interactions with consumers. But whether that\u2019s going to be broad data to verify, their consumers who they say they are in a BNPL transaction or a lot of the fin-techs are in P loans and sub-prime auto and mortgage and of course in cards, they are using our credit file.  They are using our MC Plus data. We sell quite a bit of in fin-tech of our TWN income and employment data that\u2019s used in some of the larger ticket transactions there. So, they are very data savvy. Very data sophisticated and as you point out, they look for more data to enhance the crediting decision, which plays well for us, because as we continue to build out our differentiated datasets, we can bring real value in enhancing the credit decision or the decision they are making with the addition of more data.  So, we view it as a positive. I think as you know, we weren\u2019t focused on fin-tech three, four years ago. We changed that and really expanded our resources and capabilities there and we think our cloud investment plays well for fin-tech. Our differentiated data plays well for fin-tech. And our new product focus plays well for fin-tech. So it\u2019s a place we want to be larger in. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Nicholas, please go ahead sir. \nAndrew Nicholas: Thank you for taking my question. My first one, I wanted to ask another one on international. You mentioned in your prepared remarks and it\u2019s noted on a few of the slides that you are outgrowing underlying markets. So, I was wondering if there is any region in particular, or countries in particular where your share gains are outsized internationally? And then, to the extent that\u2019s the case, what is specifically driving your gains in those markets? \nMark Begor : Yes. Our \u2013 all the markets really were quite strong in the second quarter with every region really up over 20%. So, with broad base, there is definitely an element that\u2019s meaningful in the quarter from the COVID recovery. I think all the international markets after a year of COVID it really figured out how to operate. Because they all have a different flavor of COVID challenges and they are still operating with \u2013 like the Australia lockdown or UK opened up on Monday.  But there is still some hesitancy, I think for some consumers to go out. But they don\u2019t have operates. I think that\u2019s a big driver. I wouldn\u2019t really highlight any market differently than the other. We have a very strong market position in Australia.  In Canada, we have a very strong market position. We do it in Latin America in a lot of the markets that we operate in. I think broadly, our international markets are very NPI focused. They always have been by really leveraging new products created in the United States or unique to their markets and in getting those out. Those are a big fuel for growth going forward.  And in a lot of our markets, we are continuing to grow our data assets. You\u2019ve heard, I think, one or two of the new products I highlighted are our new solutions in our international markets. \nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Thank you. And then, for my follow-up, I know it\u2019s been touched on a few times already, but to flush out Talent Solutions a little bit further, I think you said 200% plus growth there. Is there any additional color you could give on specific products that are contributing? And maybe more importantly, from my perspective, how should I think about how much of that strength is tied to better hiring volumes to the extent that it is, particularly relative to the second quarter of last year? Thank you. \nMark Begor : Yes. So, there has been a really substantial focus on new products in Talent Solutions and they are generally built around for allowing the party that\u2019s purchasing the product, right. Whether it be a background screen or somebody else, to buy specifically the information they need for the duration they require it. And we\u2019ve launched a series of products that allow them to do that in ways and they tend to be at very attractive price points for Equifax. So, - so, we are seeing very good improvement in NPI in Talent Solutions. Really it\u2019s a real strength for EWS. But obviously, we\u2019ve also seen very substantial increase in hiring as we get into the second quarter relative to last year. So, I think it gives you a break down. But what I can say is and I think we\u2019ve been talking about this consistently since at least the third quarter that new products have driven a substantial amount of growth in Talent Solutions really starting about midway through last year. \nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham. Your line is now live. \nKyle Peterson : Hey. Good morning. Thanks guys for taking the questions. Just want to start on EWS picked any Employer Services. It looks like the momentum has been really stronger on the Talent side. How should we think about some of the puts and takes in that business as things open up between growth on that side of the business versus like some of the excess UC claims kind of declining as long as things keep improving? \nMark Begor : Yes. We\u2019ve been very clear that we expect UC claims to decline from their extraordinary levels of a year ago and that\u2019s a part of our guidance and when you think about some of the other solutions we have, the hiring process is generally good news for a lot of those. Whether it\u2019s I-9s onboarding an employee. The employer resource credit is one that\u2019s really still a COVID benefit that we expect to benefit through the rest of the year. But that\u2019s an area that we are focused on expanding and as you know, we did two acquisitions, particularly HIREtech that we acquired in the first quarter is helping us get stronger and work opportunity tax credits, which is a space that we\u2019ve been growing going forward. \nJohn Gamble: Yes. The only thing the Employer Services excluding UC and ERC, right, which is what we exclude from core growth. The two biggest businesses there are I-9 and our business that supports ACA and our I-9 business as we talk to is growing very fast, right. And that\u2019s new solutions and new \u2013 using our new commerce platform to get the much smaller customers. So they can access us more quickly and directly and then also obviously with the changes in what\u2019s occurring in the ACA we are seeing that return to growth. So, I think those two factors are been very beneficial in the growth of the businesses excluding obviously UC and ERC, which Mark already talked about. \nKyle Peterson : It\u2019s super helpful. And then, maybe just a follow-up. You guys have mentioned the large payroll partnership that\u2019s planned going live later in the year. Maybe if you could give us any color on potential size and the rate of monetization once that goes live and how that could influence the back half of the year? \nMark Begor : Yes. I don\u2019t think we want to get into the exact size on it. But we\u2019ve been trying to be clear, it was one of the top payroll processors and we are pleased to be adding them to the TWN database and we factor this into our framework or guidance for the second half. And obviously, if it\u2019s added, it will benefit us in 2022, benefit Workforce Solutions as those records are added. Those turn into revenue in our system integrations. \nKyle Peterson : Thanks guys. \nOperator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. \nToni Kaplan : Thanks very much and good morning. You mentioned the final pay leader in a recent question and that\u2019s seeing a lot of growth right now. Can you just talk about your position in that market? Any sort of current revenue contributions and growth rates you are seeing there? And how you view the opportunity little bit more generally like in terms of future potential for that market? \nMark Begor : Yes. We are participating in the BNPL space in the states and other markets around the globe where Australia and UK and Canada I think our markets also have \u2013 we have the BNPL relationships. We provide identity to them after verify who the consumer is and some of the BNPL players are starting to move to larger ticket transactions and looking to do more of an underwriting of the consumer. If you are doing a BNPL on a $100 pair of blue jeans, there is a risk profile that you can do less underwriting, if you will. Maybe just verify the identity of the consumer to make sure it\u2019s not a fraudster when you start doing a refrigerator or a couch or a larger ticket transaction. So, in all of our BNPL discussions we are talking to them about their desire to move into bigger ticket transactions and leveraging Equifax data to do that including the credit trial, some of our alternative data like NC Plus or incremental employment data from Workforce Solutions. \nToni Kaplan : Great. And then, for my follow-up, consumer indirect has got slightly better in the quarter. But it\u2019s still down. I know you said you expected it to return to growth in 4Q. But we did see that one of your clients \u2013 one of the larger players in the space reported a very strong quarter. Just wondering is there just sort of a lag to get to \u2013 basically to get to you? Or I guess, why isn\u2019t that better yet? \nMark Begor : Yes. I don\u2019t know which competitor you are referring to. But as you might imagine, we all don\u2019t have the same customer relationships and there is a different level of COVID recovery I think with that space. And when you think about lead gen players, if you are a bank, you are going to restart your own lead gen first before you start buying third-party leads from a lead gen player. So, I think there is some lag in that that we expect improve as we go through the second half. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist. Your line is now live. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Lots of terrific information here. Appreciate it. Mark, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about within EWS verifier in particular. The volume which I assume is being driven nicely by NPI, as well as the TWN database but also price and I am thinking about price to value around some of your newer solutions but also the impact of more digital verifications in mortgage for example. Is there a dynamic you can call out sort of between price and unit, so we can think about yield in that business? \nMark Begor : Yes. We don\u2019t talk about specific price, but we try to exercise price in all of our businesses. So, as you might imagine, through our uniqueness of the solution or the dataset and of course Workforce Solutions is for sure our most differentiated data asset. So, we do use price, but product is also a very strong way to enhance revenues.  We talked in the past about historically, we have a single whole solution that we might sell for $15, $20, $25, $30 of Workforce Solutions and some of the newer products we\u2019ve rolled out in the last 12 to 18 months deliver more value to our customers whether it\u2019s more historical data at a $150 price point or it\u2019s allowing a co-borrower solution called, we call it Mortgage Duo where you can pull a husband and wife that are both applying for a mortgage in a single pool, that\u2019s priced at more of the $150 solution.  Multiple pool alternatives in order to incent the usage out of those, you can decide, define it whether you want to call it price or product, but it all results in higher revenue and higher margins. And that\u2019s definitely influence the strategy is to leverage the new cloud capabilities around the use of our data in Workforce Solutions to bring new solutions to market.  And then as you referenced earlier, records are obviously result in higher hit rates. Remember, we are getting in system-to-system integrations. We get a hit on our database on every customer where we consumer that our customer has and now we are in that kind of 60% hit range on the non-farm payroll as we add records and go to 61%, 62%, 63%, that drives revenue of course.  And the systems \u2013 system integrations that we have, which are growing, we are now at 75% at mortgage, continuing to grow that. We only see 60% of mortgages meaning there is a lot of customers out there that we still have to add to our relationships. So that\u2019s another growth lever.  So there is just a lot of place here in growing that business which is why I said the outsized growth is you\u2019ve seen for really a decade that the stronger growth in the last couple of years from the scale of the dataset where it just becomes more valuable to integrate into our customers\u2019 workflows because of the higher hit rates that it delivers. \nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. I appreciate that. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. \nCraig Huber : Yes, good morning. My first question on Fraud and ID, can you potentially size that for us in the U.S.? I am just \u2013 I know it\u2019s across multiple products you have there and then just, what the growth rate is if you could break that out for us please? \nJohn Gamble: Yes. I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, right that as we look at 2021, we are expecting to see our total Fraud and IT business, even that\u2019s when I break out the U.S. separately to be over $200 million. so, that includes the addition of Kount. But in total, we are expecting our Fraud and ID business to exceed $200 million in 2021. \nMark Begor : And that\u2019s a space as you know we want to grow. That\u2019s why we did the Kount acquisition and we are still in the early days of that integration and really driving the synergies and combining the data assets and rolling out the new solutions that the combination of Equifax data and Kount data is going to deliver principally in the U.S. but Kount also got global capabilities. so, it will benefit us at some of our global markets too. \nCraig Huber : And what sort of revenue growth and what would that imply for the full year? And then my follow-up question if I could ask please? In USIS, can you just hit on a little bit on autos, credit card, personal loans in your core credit card \u2013 credit bureau business? How well that did in the last quarter and what\u2019s your sort of outlook more importantly for the second half of the year? Thank you. \nMark Begor : Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given in Identity and Fraud a growth rate. But I think we have shared broadly and you know this \u2013 the market itself is growing 20%. So, that\u2019s underlying why we invested in Kount and why we are still very open in looking \u2013 it\u2019s a priority of us to do more M&A because the size of the TAM is $18 billion growing at 20%. The digital macro of more consumers doing things online on their phone, on their tablets, on their computers is really driving us which is why we want to be bigger in it.  As far as in USIS, auto has been impacted by some of the inventory issues. So that\u2019s clearly dampened some of their growth. We\u2019ve seen strong growth in card as marketing and broadly originations, if we come back and same with P loans. \nJohn Gamble: And as Mark mentioned in his comments, right, FI grew over 20% and auto grew double-digits \u2013 so, in the quarter. \nOperator: Thanks. And our next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. \nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. Within your non-mortgage USIS business, how does revenue in 2Q 2021 approximately compare with 2Q 2019 levels? And then secondly, how is your non-mortgage USIS business performing relative to the broader industry from a growth perspective? \nJohn Gamble: Hey, George, go with the first question, I am sorry. \nMark Begor : How did we compare to \u2013 how does our second quarter in USIS compare to 2019? \nJohn Gamble: Yes. So, we haven\u2019t given the specific detail. But what we have indicated is we are seeing growth relative to 2019 really across most of the businesses, right? \nMark Begor : And then, second one is versus the \u2013 I think your second question, George, is versus the industry, which I assume needs versus our competitors. One of our competitors hasn\u2019t reported yet and I think versus the other that did, I think we are in line and quite pleased with our performance in competitiveness in the marketplace and we are seeing that with the kind of core growth that we are delivering in non-mortgage. \nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. \nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. For Employment and Income Verification, do you have a sense of how often the cost are borne out of the profit pool of the originator versus pass-through because the consumer and their closing costs. And on the 60% metric that you gave us, any sense if you over or under index to the purchase first refi market relative to broader enquiries, specific on the verification services? \nMark Begor : Yes. And I think you are talking about mortgage, Jeff. In mortgage, you know, the credit file that was used in virtually a 100% in mortgage and that\u2019s a pass-through clause for the consumer. We are starting to have some originators move the income and employment data as a closing statement in I guess, early days on that and we think that\u2019s an opportunity going forward it\u2019s going to take some time. \nJohn Gamble: Yes. In terms of whether our penetrates is different in refi versus purchase, we don\u2019t think so. We think it\u2019s relatively consistent. It\u2019s basically driven more by the underwriter or the provider of the mortgage than it is by the refi versus new purchase. \nJeff Meuler: Got it. \nJohn Gamble: I think, Jeff, you know the difference in number of polls on the credit side versus the income and employment, we\u2019ve been closing that gap on income and employment with there is an average of four to five credit polls for a mortgage and now we were in kind of the two plus range on income and employment data which is up from a number of years ago or closer to one and that\u2019s when we want to continue to grow and we think there is opportunity there. \nJeff Meuler: Yes. I hear you. And then on Slide 11, the mortgage outgrowth within verify relative to end-market inquiries, where do you expect it to level off in coming years? And maybe at least you\u2019d say, do you expect it to be higher than this kind of 11% to 21% range it was in pre-2020 because of all of the structural growth drivers you are talking about? \nJohn Gamble: Well, I don\u2019t think we want to get into guidance that level given it\u2019s outside of 2021. If you think about the opportunities we\u2019ve laid out and what the cloud benefits are, we believe there is a lot of opportunity for Workforce Solutions broadly and in mortgage. When you are adding records, obviously it allows you to grow the market whether it\u2019s up, down or sideways. So, and that\u2019s a big focus for us and we start a lot of runway on records and the scale of the dataset, more system to system integrations, we get a 25% lift in polls in our system to system integration versus coming to our website. The number of polls, closing that gap with the 4 to 5 on the credit file. New products is another way to continue to outgrowth the market which we are focused on pure price. Obviously, it allows you to outperform the market. So, we are confident in the scale of the levers there, but I don\u2019t think we want to give any guidance on what it\u2019s going to look like over the long-term. \nJeff Meuler: But those levers are increasing relative to prior periods, correct? That\u2019s the right interpretation?\nJohn Gamble: 100%. \nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. \nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick \u2013 wondering if you can provide a quick update on your FICO partnership and the data decisions cloud. Have you seen better traction there, particularly as consumer marketing and consumer lending picks up? Thanks. \nMark Begor : Yes. It\u2019s an important relationship for us. I do a quarterly review with Will Lansing the CEO of FICO and myself and the team. We \u2013 actually, it\u2019s not quarterly, it\u2019s monthly. So we are excited about that and decide the data decisions cloud which is the integration of their solution with Ignite. We are also in market with a joint solution on AMLKYC that we are very pleased with and we are looking for other solutions going forward. So, we are pleased with the progress. We are in the market commercially and looking to benefit both of what makes sense and of course we go to market independently where it makes sense to. \nAshish Sabadra: Actually helpful color. That\u2019s great. And then, maybe just a quick question on any update on the regulatory front? Again, I know you\u2019ve spoken about this in the past. But just there was a financial services committee hearing in June. And then, there were certainly things around regulators are talking about the changing the CRA.  I was just wondering if you can talk about how that can potentially, any impact to the business, but also how we think about increased demand for alternate data as there is more focus on non-bank and under bank customer? Thanks. \nMark Begor : Yes. I think there is a couple of net questioning. I think maybe the first one you are focused on is that some discussions around a public credit bureau. We don\u2019t think there is a lot of traction on that. There never was and we don\u2019t think that there is a real path to that. It doesn\u2019t make sense. There is three large credit bureaus. There is another 30 CRAs underneath the three large credit bureaus. So I think there is plenty of competition in investments to support consumers. The second half of your question around real desire in Washington and with \u2013 we\u2019ve heard the CFPB talk about it around access to credit for those that are challenged in getting to credit and really drive around alternative data. That\u2019s clearly a big focus of ours.  You\u2019ve heard us talk about it on this call and others around expanding our alternative data, using the Equifax cloud to combine our differentiated data assets and really open up credit using things like utility bills, payment records, cellphone payment records, income and employment data to expand access to the credit. It\u2019s clearly a focus of ours and it is of our customers, the financial institutions and banks and that is aligned with the push that Washington has. \nAshish Sabadra: That\u2019s very helpful. Congrats again on the solid results. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe John, maybe you could help me out there is just a little bit of just sequentially on the Online Information Services, it was down about $4 million despite the fact that we are getting more opening up a little bit of Kount in there. Is the whole difference will be the impact of mortgage just the decline sequentially in mortgage applications and how that hit or is there anything else I should be thinking about there? \nJohn Gamble: No. I mean, as we talked about the fact that we saw very good organic and total growth obviously, which includes the acquisitions in our non-mortgage business. Actually, non-mortgage growth was a little bit stronger. And so, obviously because of the acquisitions in online and so what you are seeing obviously is the negative impact on mortgage \u2013 from the decline in mortgage and that would be the negative impact that you are seeing in OIS. So I don\u2019t think there is anything more complicated in that. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Great. And then, just as a follow-up, I am not sure if there is a qualitative way to ask this, but maybe quantitatively, particularly in international and maybe some of the other locations very strong growth. But there has been generally a very good difference in terms of the reopening. And is there any way for you or how do you view this internally in terms of how much are you getting from Equifax really returning to being on offense with all the efforts you\u2019ve made versus just, hey the markets are opening up. Is there some way for us to think about that? \nMark Begor : Yes. It\u2019s challenging. I would say, we are still cautious in the second half around some of those recoveries and even in the United States the delta concerns is that getting impact things is something obviously we watch. I think the thing that John and I keep an eye on is kind of deal pipelines. Where are winning in the marketplace. Where are we adding new customers. Where are we rolling out new products. Those are kind of the above market kind of growth that we are pleased with the momentum. We talked a bunch about the USIS and Workforce, but also what the teams are doing internationally on that front. \nJohn Gamble: And we are accelerating NPI. As Mark talked about in his comments, the new product rollouts really, as you know, we are doing as to bring new solutions to our customers, but we are also doing it to grow our top-line and new product rollouts generate revenue as they come into market in a very positive way. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Caroline Conway from AllianceBernstein. Your line is now live. \nCaroline Conway: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask about the spread of new product introductions between USIS and EWS at the stage and specifically when we might expect to see USIS revenue contribution from NPIs that are on par with EWS? And then, my second separate question is on capital allocation. I just noted that there is a few decisions that are being made based on the business outperformance to accelerate the tech transition. There seems to be a hint that share repurchases could exceed $100 million. So just wanted to get an update on the prioritization of different capital allocation choices as we see that excess strength?\nMark Begor : Sure. On your first question about NPIs, all our teams \u2013 all four business units are intently focused on NPIs. It\u2019s a priority that\u2019s really central to our EFX2023 strategy. So, I don\u2019t think there is real difference of activity that the pipelines that John and I have a monthly review with the teams on \u2013 with the product teams around how they are working to leverage our new client capabilities to bring new solutions to market and they all have very robust pipelines and we are seeing revenues. I don\u2019t think \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose the vitality index by business unit. But it\u2019s a broad based as far as everyone\u2019s focus.  As far as capital allocation, we are clearly committed to completing the cloud. We are obviously spending the dollars there and we\u2019ve been quite consistent. Those dollars are coming down as we go through and into 2022. But we are quite significant to last three years and we are starting to really pivot \u2013 leveraging the cloud and getting the benefits from the cloud, which are quite meaningful.  And there was no intended hints around changing our stock buyback. So, I don\u2019t know you picked that up in the comments. But that wasn\u2019t an intent. We are quite clear in launching a buyback earlier this year to offset solution from employee plans that that was a step forward, but nothing more than that.  The third leg on capital allocation that you didn\u2019t mention is M&A and we try to be very clear that we see meaningful opportunities to enhance Equifax through M&A whether it\u2019s in differentiated data solutions which Kount check that box, Identity and Fraud, if that\u2019s growing space that we want to be bigger in and we think we\u2019ve got to check at the play there because of our data.  Kount that check that one. Second is or third really is, strengthening our Workforce Solutions. It\u2019s our fastest and strongest \u2013 fastest growing and strongest business and strengthening the core Workforce through HIREtech and i2Verify is key to our strategy and as we mentioned earlier, we are really focused on widening Workforce Solutions really in the Talent Solution space through data assets. Data that would be additive to our income and employment work history that we have in the database.  And then, I mentioned earlier differentiated data assets, we are always looking for unique data assets that we can combine to existing Equifax data assets. So, M&A is a priority of ours and as we mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve done five transactions this year, Kount being quite significant. But we are on the lookout for acquisitions. What I would characterize as bolt-ons that I will really check those three areas of differentiated data, identity and fraud and strengthening and broadening Workforce Solutions. \nCaroline Conway: That makes sense and thank you for the clarification. \nMark Begor : Sure.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. \nGary Bisbee : Yes. Thanks. Thanks for the patience and staying this long. Just one quick clarification question if I could. Mark, you commented when talking about employer about the employee retention credits which I see in your Slide 23, I think it was you lumped in with the unemployment. And so, did I hear right that effectively those are credits that you are getting that you think will end at the end of this year? And is it right to think that that sort of pushes off a little bit when you\u2019ll face the real severe declines from unemployment normalizing? Or is it \u2013 was there something else this quarter that allowed the combination of that in the unemployment claims to do exceptionally well relative to the brutally tough comp you had? Thank you. \nMark Begor : Yes. It\u2019s actually this quarter, but ERC was a little stronger than we thought obviously with the new credits. So difficult to forecast. And you see it was a little stronger than we thought, right? So, the unemployment claims filings were a little higher than we expected when we gave guidance initially. And you have to \u2013 as you move through the rest of this year, ERC does tend to offset a little bit via declining UC. But as we said, the ERC credits will be something that we\u2019ll only see this year and it will be gone as we get into next year. \nGary Bisbee : Alright. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Dorian for any further or closing comments. \nDorian Hare: Thank you for joining today. Mark, John and I look forward to engaging with you in individual meetings and in conferences and other forums throughout the summer. This conclude today\u2019s call.  Operator Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our call. Thank you. You may disconnect and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, our Q2 results were very much stronger than we discussed with you in April, with revenue about $85 million higher than the midpoint of the expectation we shared. For perspective, all we used performed well relative to the expectations we shared.  Performance in non-mortgage and our U.S. businesses, Workforce and USIS was very strong in absolute terms and relative to the expectations we shared. Our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses and Workforce Solutions declined in the quarter, but much less than expected.  International revenue performance was also very strong, again both in absolute terms and relative to our expectations. And although the mortgage market was down 5% versus our expectation of flat, our mortgage revenue principally in Workforce was not impacted to the same degree. This strong revenue drove the upside in adjusted EPS relative to the expectations we shared. Now, turning to mortgage, as shown on Slide 12, U.S. mortgage market credit increase declined 5% in 2Q 2021, weaker than the about flat we had included in our guidance. Our financial guidance for 2021 assumes that the trend in mortgage credit increase we saw in late June and July continues in 3Q 2021 resulting in a decline of mortgage market credit increase of about 23% in 3Q 2021 versus 3Q 2020.  Although our second half 2021 market credit inquiry assumptions are down significantly from the second half of 2020, they remain above the average as we saw prior to 2020. As shown in the left-side of Slide 13, mortgage market indicators remain above the peak seen in previous mortgage cycles.  Despite the substantial refinance activity that has occurred over the past year, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing remains at a relatively strong level of about $12 million. Refinance activity continues to benefit from low and recently declining mortgage rates and a substantial appreciation in home prices over the past year. Based upon our most recent data from January, mortgage refinancings continue to run just under $1 million per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 13, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. The strong new purchase market is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into 2022.  Slide 14 provides our guidance for 3Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.160 billion to $1.180 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 9% to 11%, including a 1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.8%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q 2021 to be $1.62 to $1.72 per share compared to 3Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.91 per share. In 3Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $40 million or $0.25 a share.  Excluding these costs, which were excluded from 3Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 3Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.87 to $1.97 per share. This performance is being delivered in the context of the U.S. mortgage market, which is expected to be down 23% versus 3Q 2020. Comparing the midpoint of our 3Q 2021guidance sequentially to our very strong 2Q 2021performance, revenue is down about $65 million. The drivers of this decline are two main factors. The largest factor is a decline in mortgage revenue, driven by the impact of the expectation we shared regarding the decline in the U.S. mortgage market.  The other significant factor is our expectation that we'll see a significant sequential decline in unemployment claims revenue. Our guidance for adjusted EPS declines about $0.30 per share sequentially. The bulk of this decline is driven by lower gross profit on the revenue expectation I just discussed. In addition, we are increasing investment sequentially in sales and marketing, particularly in the U.S. as well as increasing investment in products and technology.  Slide 15 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially, reflecting our very strong 2Q 2021 performance. In the second half of 2021, we expect strong growth in our U.S. non-mortgage business and international and a return to growth in GCS.  We also expect our U.S. mortgage business to grow about 15% in 2021 over 20 points faster than the expected approximately 8% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. 2021 revenue of between $4.76 billion and $4.8 billion reflects revenue growth of about 15% to 16% versus 2020 including a 1.5% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.9%.  EWS is expected to deliver about 30% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid-to-high single-digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 10% and GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single-digits in 2021. 3Q 2021 revenue is also expected to be down mid single-digits, with 4Q 2021 revenue returning to growth. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These one-time costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2017 through 2020.  In 2021, Equifax expects to incur one-time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately a $155 million, a reduction of over 55% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $155 million in one-time costs would reduce adjusted EPS by about $0.97 per share.  This estimate of one-time technology transformation cost is up $10 million from a $145 million we guided in April. Given our very strong performance in 2021, we are investing to accelerate our tech transformation globally. 2021 adjusted EPS of $7.25 to $7.45 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs is up 4% to 7% from 2020. Excluding the impact of the tech transformation cost of $0.97 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 will show growth of about 18% to 21% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by the redundant system costs of $79 million related to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about $0.49 per share and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about 7 percentage points. Additional assumptions included in 2021 guidance will be posted to the July Investor Relations presentation to be posted later today.  Slide 16 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth that is included in our current guidance. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of movements in the mortgage market and Equifax revenue, as well as the impact of changes in our UC claims and Employee Retention Credit businesses within our Employer Services business.  Employee Retention Credits are specific U.S. government incentives for companies to retain their employees in response to COVID-19 and the associated revenue is not expected to continue into 2022. The data shown for 3Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of the guidance ranges we provided.  In 1Q 2021 and 2Q 2021, we delivered very strong core revenue growth of 20% and 29% respectively. We continued to deliver strong core revenue growth in 3Q 2021 of 17% and 19% for all of 2021 in our expectations.  As Mark mentioned earlier, the composition of our core revenue growth is becoming more balanced, reflecting substantially increasing contributions from U.S. non-mortgage, International and as we enter 4Q 2021 GCS. And we continue to expect our mortgage business to grow at rates faster than the overall mortgage market. This very strong performance we believe positions us well entering 2022 and beyond. And now, I'd like to hand it back to Mark. Yes. So, I think what we talked about is we gave a good view, I think what we expect the growth to be for the full year and as we indicated, we expect Workforce Solutions to grow over 30% in the year. So, obviously, that's up substantially from what we talked about in April. So, it reflects the much stronger performance in the second quarter but also continuing very strong performance in the third and fourth quarters. And we are expecting as I said, as we continue the strong performance across really all the businesses as we talked about I think effectively, we held or increased our expectation for growth in all of our businesses in the full year and therefore in the second half. So, we are feeling very good about the trend. Yes. We don't talk about them on a market basis, right. But what we've indicated historically is, markets that look very much like the U.S., so we talk about Canada tends to run at higher margins than some other businesses. Australia looks probably more like international averages than you think about Canada that would be stronger. Yes. I think, what we said is that, the biggest driver were the tech-related costs and the decline of about I think it was 380 basis points year-on-year. We've also definitely invested more in marketing and sales given new NPI rollouts in the improving economy. And that's certainly impacted year-on-year and that would have been more impactful if you think about sequential. But we didn't give specifics. But we did indicate that the biggest driver of year-on-year decline is the tech-related cost. Yes. Mark mentioned huge growth in Talent Solutions and government, which are the two biggest segments by far in Verification Services. Yes. The only thing the Employer Services excluding UC and ERC, right, which is what we exclude from core growth. The two biggest businesses there are I-9 and our business that supports ACA and our I-9 business as we talk to is growing very fast, right. And that's new solutions and new \u2013 using our new commerce platform to get the much smaller customers. So they can access us more quickly and directly and then also obviously with the changes in what's occurring in the ACA we are seeing that return to growth. So, I think those two factors are been very beneficial in the growth of the businesses excluding obviously UC and ERC, which Mark already talked about. Yes. I think we've talked about this in the past, right that as we look at 2021, we are expecting to see our total Fraud and IT business, even that's when I break out the U.S. separately to be over $200 million. so, that includes the addition of Kount. But in total, we are expecting our Fraud and ID business to exceed $200 million in 2021. And as Mark mentioned in his comments, right, FI grew over 20% and auto grew double-digits \u2013 so, in the quarter. Hey, George, go with the first question, I am sorry. Yes. So, we haven't given the specific detail. But what we have indicated is we are seeing growth relative to 2019 really across most of the businesses, right? Yes. In terms of whether our penetrates is different in refi versus purchase, we don't think so. We think it's relatively consistent. It's basically driven more by the underwriter or the provider of the mortgage than it is by the refi versus new purchase. I think, Jeff, you know the difference in number of polls on the credit side versus the income and employment, we've been closing that gap on income and employment with there is an average of four to five credit polls for a mortgage and now we were in kind of the two plus range on income and employment data which is up from a number of years ago or closer to one and that's when we want to continue to grow and we think there is opportunity there. Well, I don't think we want to get into guidance that level given it's outside of 2021. If you think about the opportunities we've laid out and what the cloud benefits are, we believe there is a lot of opportunity for Workforce Solutions broadly and in mortgage. When you are adding records, obviously it allows you to grow the market whether it's up, down or sideways. So, and that's a big focus for us and we start a lot of runway on records and the scale of the dataset, more system to system integrations, we get a 25% lift in polls in our system to system integration versus coming to our website. The number of polls, closing that gap with the 4 to 5 on the credit file. New products is another way to continue to outgrowth the market which we are focused on pure price. Obviously, it allows you to outperform the market. So, we are confident in the scale of the levers there, but I don't think we want to give any guidance on what it's going to look like over the long-term. 100%. No. I mean, as we talked about the fact that we saw very good organic and total growth obviously, which includes the acquisitions in our non-mortgage business. Actually, non-mortgage growth was a little bit stronger. And so, obviously because of the acquisitions in online and so what you are seeing obviously is the negative impact on mortgage \u2013 from the decline in mortgage and that would be the negative impact that you are seeing in OIS. So I don't think there is anything more complicated in that. And we are accelerating NPI. As Mark talked about in his comments, the new product rollouts really, as you know, we are doing as to bring new solutions to our customers, but we are also doing it to grow our top-line and new product rollouts generate revenue as they come into market in a very positive way."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. Before I address Equifax's strong second quarter results, I want to recognize our 11,000 associates around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication in these challenging times. Our team members are our most important asset and they play a vital role in helping millions of consumers around the world to get access to credit.  On July 1, we opened all of our U.S. offices fully and rolled out our new Equifax flex program, a hybrid working environment that gives our team the opportunity to work from home one day per week. Our four one program recognizes our learnings from the past year around remote work during COVID, but maintains the core of our Equifax culture of collaboration and team work that is optimized by an in-person work environment.  We've also resumed in-person meetings with our customers and I've been energized with the conversations that have taken place so far. It's great to be moving back to a new normal.  We had a very strong second quarter and first half, which built off our strong outperformance in 2020. Our team has executed extremely well against the critical priorities of our new Equifax 2023 strategy, which is shown on Slide 4.  We are accelerating new product introductions, beginning to leverage our expanding Equifax cloud capabilities, and our highly differentiated data assets. We continue to expand our differentiated data assets both organically and through acquisition and partnerships. While still in the early days, our new Equifax cloud data and technology capabilities are providing competitive advantages and capabilities that only Equifax can provide.  And our Customer First initiatives are deepening our relationships with customers and delivering new products and solutions along with above market Equifax growth. And as always we remain focused on extending our leadership in security. Our EFX2023 growth strategy is our compass for the future and drives all of our growth initiatives as we move through the second half and into 2022 and beyond. We expect this focus to drive our top-line and bottom-line in the future.  Turning now to Slide 5. Equifax's financial performance in the second quarter was very strong and outperformed our underlying markets. Revenue of $1.235 billion was the highest quarterly revenue in our history breaking the record from last quarter. Local currency revenue growth of 23% and organic local currency growth of 20% were both very strong in some of the highest growth rates in our history.  Our U.S. B2B businesses and Workforce Solutions and USIS which together represent over 70% of our revenue, again drove our overall growth delivering very strong 25% total and 22% organic revenue growth despite the headwinds from the mortgage market that declined about 5%. The 5% decline in the mortgage market was about 500 basis points more than our flat expectation we shared with you in April.  U.S. B2B organic non-mortgage growth of 20% accelerated sequentially from the 16% we delivered in the first quarter. The 20% organic growth is also a record and reflects the underlying strength of Workforce Solutions and USIS's return to a competitive position.  I'll cover the BU performance \u2013 level of performance in detail in a moment, but at a high level, Workforce Solutions again led Equifax growth with revenue up a strong 40%. And as a reminder, this is of growth of 53% in second quarter last year and the mortgage that declined 5% in the quarter. USIS delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 11%, driven by non-mortgage total revenue growth of over 20% and strong organic revenue growth of 14%.  International delivered a very strong quarter of COVID recovery with revenue growth of 25% in local currency and importantly, all regions internationally delivered growth above 20%. Slightly better than expected GCS revenue was down 3% in local currency. However, our Consumer Direct revenue delivered 11% growth in the quarter, its second consecutive quarter in double-digits.  Second quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $431 million, up 20% with margins of 34.9%. Margins were down 160 basis points versus last year due to the inclusion of the cloud technology transformation cost in our adjusted results in 2021, which were excluded last year. This negatively impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin by 310 basis points.  Adjusting for cloud transformation cost of $38 million in the quarter, our margins would have been up a strong 150 basis points. We are getting strong leverage out of our above-market revenue growth.  Adjusted EPS of $1.98 per share was up a strong 21% from last year. Again adjusting for the cloud transformation cost, adjusted EPS would have been up a very strong 36% reflecting the strong performance in operating leverage of Equifax.  During the quarter, we continue to make significant progress with the Equifax Cloud Data and Technology transformation including an additional 7,700 customer migrations to the cloud in the United States and more than 900 migrations internationally. We remain on track with our cloud transformation and are confident in our plan.  We continue to expect that North American transformation to be principally complete in early 2022 with the remaining customer migrations completed by the end of next year. International transformation will follow North America being principally completed by the end of 2023. And as you know, last year we started to ramp up our focus in resources on new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud Data and Capabilities.  In the second quarter, we released 46 new products, which is up almost 2x from the 24 products we released a year ago in the quarter. These new products are increasingly leveraging the new Equifax cloud to deliver better data decisioning for our customers.  Driving NPIs, leveraging the new Equifax cloud is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and we continue to expect our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years to exceed 8%, a big step up from the 5% last year and a reflection of the strong product focus across EFX.  Our first half performance exceeded our expectations and we are clearly seeing continued strong momentum as we move into the second half. Based on our strong first half results and confidence in the future, we increased our full year revenue guidance by $165 million to a midpoint of $4.78 billion, which is up 400 basis points which is 16% growth.  We also increased our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.45 per share to a midpoint of $7.35 per share, which adjusting for the technology transformation cost is up 700 basis points to 19% growth. This includes our expectation if the U.S. mortgage market is measured by credit enquiries will decline approximately 8% in the year, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in April.  In the second quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 6 accelerated to 29%. This is up significantly from the 20% core revenue contribution we delivered in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter and well above our historical core growth rates.  While our outperformance in the mortgage market continues to drive significant core growth, the contribution from U.S. non-mortgage and international increased significantly in the quarter reflecting approximately 50% of core revenue growth in the quarter, excluding acquisitions and FX favorability.  Turning now to Slide 7, our strong second quarter results were broad based and reflect better than expected performance for all four Equifax business units. Workforce Solutions, our largest business had another exceptional quarter delivering 40% revenue growth and 58% adjusted EBITDA margins. Again as a reminder, the 40% revenue growth is on top of 53% growth last year in the second quarter.  EWS is cementing itself as our largest and most valuable business and it's powering our results representing 40% of total Equifax revenue in the quarter. EWS Verification Services revenue of $395 million was up a strong 57%. Verification Services' mortgage revenue grew 52% in the quarter, despite the 5% decline in the mortgage market from increased records, penetration and new products.  Importantly, Verification Services' non-mortgage revenue was up over 60% in the quarter and up over 15% sequentially from the first quarter. Our government vertical which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs including food and rental support grew over 10% in the quarter. Government remains one of our largest non-mortgage segments representing about a third of non-mortgage verification revenue.  We continue to expand our products and solutions in the government vertical and expect our new social security administration contract to go live this quarter with revenue ramping to a $40 million to $50 million runrate in 2022.  Talent Solutions, which comprise income and employment verifications, as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding process through our EWS Data Hub had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and MGIs growing over 200%. Talent Solutions now represents almost 30% of non-mortgage verification revenue.  Building out the EWS Data Hub that leverages the work history in our TWN database with other unique data elements used in the hiring process is a priority for us. Over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of that hiring process.  Our non-mortgage consumer business principally in banking and auto showed strong growth of about 50% in the quarter as well, both from deepening penetration with lenders and some recovery in these markets. Debt Management also returned to growth in the quarter.  Employer Services revenue of $101 million was about flat in the quarter as expected. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $64 million, down over 15% from last year.  Substantial declines in UC revenue in the second quarter were partially offset by new ERC revenue that began in the quarter as we support businesses in obtaining federal employee retention credit payments. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue up over 50% in the quarter. Our I-9 business driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product continue to show very strong growth, up over 50%. Our I-9 business is now almost half of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. Reflecting on the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of Workforce Analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses to deliver organic growth of over 20% for the year.  Reflecting the power and uniqueness of the TWN dataset, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted EWS EBITDA margins of 68%, a 160 basis point expansion from last year. Excluding technology transformation expenses, EWS margins would have been up over 240 basis points.  Rudy Ploder and EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter and are position to deliver a very strong 2021. Workforce Solutions is our most powerful and unique business and is calling Equifax results would grow substantially above the rest of the company.  Turning now to USIS, they had another strong quarter with revenue up 11% driven by strong performance across the business. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $160 million was down about 2% in the quarter, while mortgage enquiries were down 5%, below the flat expectation we shared at April.  John will cover our updated view of the mortgage markets shortly. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by over 300 basis points driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products.  Importantly, non-mortgage revenue performance was up 21% with strong organic growth of 14%. This performance reflects the commercial focus of Sid Singh and his team and their competitive position in the marketplace. Importantly, organic non-mortgage revenue also delivered strong sequential growth acceleration of 250 basis points from the first quarter's 11%, an important indicator of the continued strengthening of the USIS business. Banking and Insurance, both grew over 20% in the quarter. Auto and Direct-to-Consumer were both up over 10% and Telco and Commercial were just about flat in the quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking, our offline or batch business was $59 million in the quarter and up about 14%.  The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which is up over 20% and ID and fraud revenue growth of over 15%, as consumer marketing and originations ramped up coming out of COVID. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20% and risk decisioning about 35%. This strong growth across our non-mortgage business is encouraging as we move into the third quarter and the rest of 2021. The USIS new deal pipeline remains very strong and comparable to the strong levels we've seen so far in 2021. We have seen the highest growth in auto, financial services and mortgage.  USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 40.3% in the quarter, the decline of 380 basis points from second quarter last year was principally due to the cost related with cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and the inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation cost, which were being excluded in 2020. Sales and marketing expenses also increased in the quarter and sequentially to leverage both the stronger U.S. markets and increased NPI rollouts to drive growth. Shifting now to international, the revenue was up a strong 25% on a local currency basis, which is a third consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets. Revenue growth was up over 20% in all of our markets in Canada, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Europe.  Asia-Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, had a very strong quarter with revenue up $91 million or up about 21% in local currencies. Australia consumer revenue turned positive and was up 23% versus last year and up about 2% sequentially. Our commercial business combined online and offline revenue was up a very strong 26% in the quarter and almost 18% - up almost 18% sequentially. Fraud and Identity was up 30% in the quarter following 15% growth in the first quarter.  European revenues of $68 million were up 27% in local currency in the quarter. Our European Credit Reporting business is up about 20% with strong growth in both the UK and Spain. In UK, which is our largest European market, we saw growth of over 25% in Consumer, Data Analytics and scores and over 40% growth in commercial.  Our European debt management business revenue increased about 30% in local currency, off the lows we saw in the second quarter last year during the COVID recession.  Canada delivered record-setting revenue of $47 million in the quarter, up about 26% in local currency. Consumer online was up about 26% in the quarter, an improvement of 12 percentage points from the first quarter. Double-digit growth in commercial, analytical and decision solutions and ID and Fraud also drove growth in the Canadian revenue in the quarter.  Latin American revenues of $44 million grew 30% in the quarter in local currency, which was the second consecutive quarter of growth coming out of COVID. We continue to see the benefits in Latin America of the strong new product introductions the team has rolled out over the past three years.  International adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.3% were up 540 basis points from last year, driven by leverage on revenue growth and continued very good cost control by the international team. Excluding the impact of the inclusion of the technology transformation costs in adjusted EBITDA, margins were up over 750 basis points.  Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis in the quarter and slightly above our expectations. We again saw strong double-digit growth in our Global Consumer Direct business, which sells directly to consumers through equifax.com and which represents a little over half of GCS revenue. Direct-to-Consumer revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter, their fourth consecutive quarter of growth.  The decline in overall GCS revenue in the second quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead generation partner business. We expect the GCS partner business and GCS business overall to return to growth in the fourth quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.5% were up just about 170 basis points, which was better than our expectations. Turning now to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax and is clearly our strongest fastest growing and most valuable business. Workforce Solutions revenue grew a very strong 40% in the quarter with core revenue growth of 46%. And again, the 40% growth in the quarter was on top of 53% growth in the second quarter last year.  This above-market performance is driven by the uniqueness of the TWN income and employment data, the scale of the TWN database and the consistent execution by Rudy and his team. At the end of the second quarter, TWN reached 119 million active records, an increase of 13% or 14 million records from a year ago and included 91 million unique records. At 91 million uniques, we now have over 60% of non-farm payrolls, which makes our TWN dataset more valuable to our customers by delivering higher hit rates.  Beyond focusing on adding the over 50 million non-farm payroll records not in the TWN database yet, we're also focused on adding data records from the 40 million to 50 million Gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the United States marketplace to further broaden the TWN database. We have plenty of room to grow. We are now receiving contributions from 1.2 million companies across the U.S., up from 27,000 employers a short two plus years ago. And as a reminder, over 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers that EWS provides comprehensive employer services to like unemployment claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, Employee Retention Credit, HSA and other HR and compliance-related solutions. These relationships have been built up over the past decade by the Workforce Solutions team. The remaining 35% are contributed through partnerships with payroll providers and HR software companies, most of which are exclusive. The exclusive arrangement with a major payroll processor that we announced on our February call is still on track to become active later this year. We have a dedicated team with an active pipeline of record additions to continue to expand our TWN database in the future. And as you know, as we add records to the dataset, they are monetized almost instantly with our customer system-to-system integrations interacting with our TWN database.  Workforce Solutions continues to grow, penetration in key existing markets while expanding into new markets. We continue to increase our penetration in the mortgage market. As of the most recent data available at the end of 2020, Workforce Solutions received an inquiry in almost 60% of completed U.S. mortgages, which is up from 55% in 2019. This 500 basis point increase shows a continuation of growth in TWN mortgage penetration, as well as the substantial opportunity for continued growth that exist in mortgage with only 60% of mortgages using TWN data today. We are also seeing substantial growth in TWN in the non-credit markets of Government and Talent Solutions as well as increased TWN usage within the card and auto verticals.  As we discussed in the past, growing system-to-system integrations is a key lever in driving both increased penetration and the increased number of polls per transaction for Workforce Solutions. During the quarter, about 75% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system-to-system, which was up 2x from the 32% in 2019.  The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding as our teams leveraged the power of our new Equifax Cloud infrastructure. We plan to rollout new products in mortgage Talent Solutions, Government and I-9 in the second half of the year. New product revenue will increase in 2021 and 2022 as we begin to reap the benefits of our new products introduced in the market by Workforce Solutions in the past 18 months.  Rudy and the Workforce Solutions team had multiple levers for growth in 2021, 2022 and beyond. Workforce is clearly our largest and most valuable business and we will continue to power our results in the future. Workforce Solutions growth rates and margins are highly accretive to Equifax, now and in the future. Slide 9 provides perspective on the tremendous growth Workforce has delivered since 2017 and the increasing impact of the business it has on Equifax with its highly accretive revenue growth rates and margins. In 2017, Workforce Solutions revenue and EBITDA made up 23% of Equifax revenue and 27% of business unit EBITDA.  For the first half of 2021, Workforce Solutions revenue and EBITDA have increased to 40% of Equifax revenue and over half of Equifax business unit EBITDA. In a short four years, Workforce Solutions has more than doubled in size and is now almost 50% in the first half versus the same period last year. It is up almost 50% in the first half versus same period last year. Our unique TWN employment and income assets and the continued expansion of employment-related assets within the Equifax Data Hub provides opportunities for both ongoing outsized growth in Equifax traditional financial markets of mortgage, banking, auto, as well as a substantial growth in new verticals in Government, Talent Solution and others to come.  We expect that Workforce Solutions will continue to be an increasingly large part of Equifax and power our top and bottom-line with the above-market growth in margins. Turning to Slide 10, this provides a perspective on the return to growth USIS delivered since 2018. USIS has delivered strong double-digit revenue growth over the past six quarters. Although the strong mortgage market has advantaged USIS as shown in the bottom left of the slide, USIS has driven consistent sequential improvement in non-mortgage growth since second quarter last year with the overall growth in USIS being driven by 18% non-mortgage growth in the first half of 2021.  The USIS team is also increasingly leveraging the Equifax Cloud to design and implement new NPIs for customers. The Equifax Cloud new products and our unique data assets are making USIS teams more competitive in the marketplace. And the USIS team is focused on integrating Kount into new Equifax Cloud and we are seeing increased used cases in opportunities with our ID and Fraud vertical from the Kount acquisition.  We expect ID and Fraud to play a large role in USIS growth in 2021 and beyond. I encourage you to review the ID and Fraud slides in our broader Investor Presentation, which can be found on our Investor Relations website following this call. Turning to Slide 11. This highlights the core growth performance in our mortgage for our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Our U.S. B2B businesses delivered a combined 25% revenue growth in mortgage in the second quarter, which was 30 points stronger than the 5% mortgage decline we saw in overall mortgage market.  The strong outperformance was again primarily driven by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 57%. Consistent with past quarters, EWS' outperformance was driven by new records, increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates and new products. Proof that lenders are increasingly becoming reliant on the unique TWN income and employment data when making credit decisions in the mortgage space. USIS delivered 4% core mortgage revenue growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions and further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow underlying markets is core to our business model and core to our future growth. I'll now turn the presentation over to John to discuss current trends in the mortgage market and to walk through our third quarter and revised full year 2021 guidance. Thanks, John. Turning now to Slide 17, as I referenced earlier, pricing power in our technology teams continue to make very strong progress on our new Equifax Cloud Data and Technology Transformation, with the North American technology transformation expected to be principally complete in early 2022 and the remainder of North America transformation and customer migrations completing by the end of next year and our international transformations following North America being principally complete by the end of 2023.  Equifax's transformation to a cloud-native environment delivers a host of capabilities that only Equifax can provide as the only cloud-native data and technology company. The Equifax Cloud will deliver always on stability, accelerated response time and built-in industry-leading security. It will provide our customers with real-time access to data and insights that they can rely on to make decisions. The Equifax Cloud through our Ignite analytics platform will allow customers and Equifax data scientists to work together utilizing EFX unique data assets and customer proprietary assets to define attributes and models to improve customer outcomes.  And we will continue to accelerate the time from analytics to production to bring new products and solutions to market faster and more efficiently enhancing customer benefits and Equifax revenue. Already the Equifax Cloud has enabled us to produce new products designed and delivered on our Cloud infrastructure four times faster than the past. We began to leverage these cloud benefits in 2020, as we more effectively developed new products and delivered them to market leveraging the new EFX cloud, growing new product introductions by 44% last year - in 2020. These new improvements have been further accelerated in 2021 as we are delivering the highest number of new products in our history and we are realizing higher revenue from new product introductions. Slide 18 provides an update on NPIs, a key driver of our current and future revenue growth. As we just discussed, the new cloud transformation has significantly strengthened our NPI capabilities allowing us to increase both the number of NPIs and the revenue generated from new products. We continue to expand our product resources and focus on transforming Equifax into a product-led organization, leveraging our best-in-class Equifax cloud-native data and technology to fuel top-line growth.  As I discussed earlier, in the second quarter, we delivered 46 new products, which is up about almost 2x from the 24 we delivered last year. Year-to-date, we've rolled out 85 new products, which is up 44% from the 59 that we delivered in the first half last year. We are energized as we continue to grow off an NPI record-setting 2020.  We wanted to highlight some of these products rolled out during the quarter, which we expect to drive revenue growth over the second half and in the next few years. Our new payment Insights products launched by USIS in April was delivered in partnership with Urjanet and uses consumer permission utility in telco data to improve views of customers, consumers' financial picture and help credit invisibles.  The cloud-based solution promotes greater financial inclusion regardless of the consumers' traditional credit score by empowering consumers to show utility and telco payment history with banks or lenders when applying for loans or other services. The product also allows lenders to seamlessly integrate data into review processes while meeting industry-leading standards for protection of consumer data security, confidentiality and integrity. Workforce Solution launched a new mortgage 36 product in May. This solution addresses income verification needs by enabling mortgage lenders to pull an extended set of both active and inactive income and employment data for a more complex income mortgage applicants where additional history may be needed in the underwriting process.  EWS also launched a new talent report employment staffing product in April. This solution provides flexibility on the number of past employers pulled to meet the employment verification needs of the employer. Staffing agencies leverage VOE as a reference check was often looking to verify only to employers, which this product helps deliver. In the United Kingdom, we launched the Credit Vitality View app. This Ignite-based app visualizes key credit data trends across the UK versus a company's own performance. It uses a range of macroeconomic measures and includes filtering capabilities, so our customers can focus on the performance of their own portfolio and product lines such as mortgages or credit cards. The app also can illustrate these company and market trends over multiple years. Lastly, we introduced the Equifax Affordability Solutions in Australia, New Zealand. These solutions deliver automated, categorized income and expense verifications in a way that delivers meaningful and actionable insights for our customers. Our customers can easily digest and act on these insights through the delivery of comprehensive consumer affordability reports, which are now required from a regulatory standpoint in these markets. This new solution will reduce loan application processing timing cost, improve conversion rates and maximize efficiency, while fulfilling responsible lending regulatory requirements, delivering overall improvements to the consumer experience.  These are just some examples of the new solutions we launched during the quarter. We are focused on leveraging our new cloud capabilities to increase NPI rollouts and new product revenue in 2021 and beyond. Growing NPIs is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. And as a reminder, our Vitality Index is defined as the percentage of revenue delivered by NPIs launched during the past three years. In April, we increased our Vitality Index outlook for 2021 from 7% to 8% and we remain confident in this framework for 2021. As you can see from the left of the slide, our 8% vitality outlook for 2021 is a big step forward from the 5% vitality we delivered last year. NPIs are a big priority for me and the team as we leverage the Equifax Cloud for innovation new products and growth. Slide 19 showcases the capabilities we've been building over the past three years that only Equifax can bring to the marketplace. We have unique market-leading differentiated data at scale that includes our 228 million ACRO credit records, 119 million TWN income and employment records and additional data at scale that comes from our alternative datasets including Kount and CTUE, PayNet, IXI and others. Our advanced analytics allow us to build and test attributes faster, leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning, and develop models in days and weeks where used to take months. Our team of 320 data scientists located around the world are leveraging our advanced analytics and Equifax Cloud-native infrastructure to define and deploy cloud-native products and solutions. And our cloud-native data fabric is allowing us to key EnLink our unique data asset in ways that we could never do before. Our data fabric stretches across the globe and we are in the early innings of leveraging its global capabilities. Only Equifax can provide these capabilities and we are on offense as we deploy these into the marketplace.  Wrapping up on Slide 20, Equifax delivered a record-setting second quarter. We have strong momentum as we move into the second half. Our 26% overall and 29% core revenue growth in the quarter reflects the strength and breadth of our business model and early benefits from our Equifax Cloud investments and of course, its enhanced focus on new products. We've delivered six consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth. Our strong performance reflects the execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities, Equifax's on offense. As we discussed earlier, we are confident in our outlook for 2021 and we raised our full year midpoint revenue guidance to $4.78 billion, increasing our 2021 growth rate by over 370 basis points to almost 16%. We also raised our midpoint EPS guidance to $7.35 increasing the growth rate by over 640 basis points. As we discussed earlier, Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter delivering 40% revenue growth and 58% EBITDA margins. EWS is our largest fastest growing and most valuable business. During the quarter, Workforce Solutions delivered 40% of Equifax revenue and we expect EWS to continue to drive Equifax's operating performance throughout 2021 and beyond as consumers recognize the value of our growing TWN database. Rudy and his team remain focused on driving outsized growth by focusing on their key growth drivers of adding new records, rolling out new products, driving penetration, driving their new Talent Solutions Data Hub, expansion into new verticals and leveraging their new EFX cloud capabilities.  USIS also delivered another strong quarter of 11% growth, driven by their 14% non-mortgage organic growth. We expect USIS non-mortgage growth to continue to be strong due to the economic recovery, the commercial focus of the team, new products and our unique alternative data assets. Sid and the USIS teams are competitive and winning in the marketplace and will continue to deliver in 2021 and beyond.  International grew for the third consecutive quarter, accelerating to 25% in local currency in the second quarter as economies reopen and business activity resumes. Our new international leader, Lisa Nelson has high expectations for her team and we expect continued strong growth through the rest of 2021. We are beginning to realize the benefits of our EFX Cloud Data and Technology transformation as we accelerate new product innovation with products designed and built off of our new EFX Cloud infrastructure. We've spent the last three years building the Equifax Cloud and we're now starting to leverage our new cloud capabilities. As we move through the rest of the year and into 2022, we'll be increasingly realize the top-line, cost and cash benefits from these new cloud capabilities.  Accelerating new products, leveraging our differentiated data and the new EFX cloud capabilities is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. We are beginning to see the benefits of our new product focus and resources leveraging the EFX cloud with the 85 NPIs completed in the first half, pacing well ahead of the record 134 we delivered last year. As we discussed in the past, bolt-on acquisitions that expand our differentiated data assets, strengthening Workforce Solutions and broadening our ID and fraud capabilities are integral to our future growth framework. We have reinvested our strong cash flow in five bolt-on acquisitions so far this year that will add 170 basis points to our revenue in the second half. We will continue to focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen Workforce Solutions. I am more energized now than when I joined Equifax three years ago what the future holds as we move from building the cloud to our next chapter of growth leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, growth and new products. We have strong momentum across our business as we move into the second half and we are beginning to deliver on the benefits of the significant cloud data and technology investments we made over the past three years. Equifax's on offense and positioned to bring new and unique solutions for our customers that only Equifax can deliver leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities. With that operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes. So, David, we don't give specifics by BU in terms of how we break down core. But as you can see from the detail we gave we are expecting to have very good core growth in the third quarter at 17%. We are expecting EWS with the continued performance extremely well and we are expecting them to continue to substantially outgrow the mortgage market.  And as we indicated for the full year, we expect our mortgage revenue to grow 15%, that's up from what we talked about in April and it's more than 20 points higher than the 8% decline that we are talking about for the overall mortgage market itself. So, we expect EWS to continue to substantially outperform and to continue to deliver very high core revenue growth.  To give you data there is multiple levers by the Workforce Solutions team to drive that outperformance, it's specifically in mortgage and of course all the other verticals that the record additions help fuel that the new product roll outs that the team did last year and are continuing this year in the mortgage space will drive that.  We gave some visibility around our growth in the mortgage market itself. As you know, we don't see every mortgage. So the team is focused on adding income and employment from Equifax. The large portion of mortgage is we still don't see. And of course, we are continuing to drive the system-to-system integration.  So, all of those libraries that are what Rudy and his team are deploying to continue to drive that outperformance not only the mortgage market, but all of their markets. Yes. I would say, first, we are certainly benefiting from the economic recovery. We've seen that in card issuers and really all of the financial institutions are doing more marketing. You've seen strong performance there in the consumers back in accessing credit products. So you've seen that both in the mortgage side but I think you are focused more on the non-mortgage of course.  The new product rollouts are benefiting Sid and his team as they are focused on bringing new products to market. And really broadly, we've got a strong focus as we've been very clear over the last, really almost 24 months about the focus that the team has on building out their deal pipeline. They are focused on their customers.  We've rebuilt and enhanced our commercial team with more coverage. We've added more resources. We've re-levered the commercial team. So, all of those are benefiting from us and we've got a lot of confidence in our ability to be competitive in the non-mortgage market in USIS going forward. Sure. And just broadly, as you know, we are focused on growing all of our businesses, all four business units. And clearly, Workforce Solution is very unique and really driven by the uniqueness of the income and employment data that it has at scale and the value of that. And we've talked I think, Kevin, in the past that there was an element of catalyst from our perspective when the dataset got over 50% of non-farm payroll, call it a year ago.  And it just made the dataset more valuable. And when you think about someone's credit history, did they pay their bills is very valuable, but are they working and how much do they make is equally valuable. And really only Equifax has that dataset. The Workforce Solutions business has levers as we talked a couple of times on the call already they are really quite unique.  And I think it starts with records. Most data businesses have all the records. Workforce Solutions has shown a history of building out their dataset and as I talked in my comments, we added 14 million \u2013 rough 14 million records on a year-over-year basis. So we are continuing to add records. As you know, we got visibility for a significant addition or meaningful addition from a large payroll processor in the second half of the year.  And we are out there talking to individual companies to grow the dataset, which we do through our Employer Services business by providing those services. And then of course, the other payroll processors or that we don't have now with Equifax we are working to add. So records is a very important lever for that business and there is a long runway not only with non-farm payroll, where we are at 91 million unique versus 150 million or so total non-farm payroll.  But we are focused on the Gig economy, which is another 40 million to 50 million individuals that have either first or second jobs or self-employed outside of the non-farm payroll and then of course pensioners. So, records are big opportunity for Workforce to grow.  And then you've seen a lot of growth over the last couple of years beyond mortgage. Mortgage was always a place that this business is focused on and we've been able to grow very, very strongly in the government vertical and of course you know, we got the large SSA contract that's going live in the second half and ramp to $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue in 2022. So, that's an example of the dataset being used in another use case.  And the other area that we've been focused on outside of just kind of the core growth of the products and attrition, more usage and records is around strengthening the business through M&A. As you know, we've done two acquisitions so far this year. HIREtech and i2Verify to strengthen our Employer Services business, which delivered records.  Of course, that's just a good core business. We talked about some of the solutions we have in the market like on anywhere they are growing outside of some of our traditional financial markets. So that focus on the hiring process where 75 million people are hired every year or change jobs and most of them have to have some kind of background screening done that relies on work history along with government data elements.  And today, we are building out the Equifax Data Hub, our Workforce Solutions Data Hub that includes our TWN data, but also other unique data elements and we'd like to do more M&A in that space to strengthen Workforce Solutions as I mentioned in my comments that we are focused on building that out.  And just maybe closing on Workforce, the business has a long history of outperforming its underlying markets and I think if you look back a couple of years, you've seen a step-up in that outperformance in the last couple of years that we link to the scale of the dataset. The cloud has allowed us to ingest more data more quickly.  Think about it two years ago, maybe three years ago, we had 27,000 contributors or companies contributing. Now we have a 1.2 million and there is different numbers about there and how many companies there are in the United States, 3 million, 4 million, 5 million. But we are really scaling that dataset quite substantially. So, it's a very unique business. It's one that we are investing in organically.  The cloud is allowing them to ingest more data and you've seen a ramp up in new products coming out from Workforce Solutions as they start to leverage the new product capabilities and of course that's happening across Equifax. No, no. No, I didn't say that. What I said was that, what's really interests us and when we talked about it before is, number one, strengthening the core Workforce Solutions. It's our strongest business. It's our largest business. It's our fastest growing business. And doing acquisitions like HIREtech and i2Verify is clearly a priority for Equifax.  The other area that we've talked before with you and others about is the Talent Solutions Data Hub. We want to be in the data business around the hiring process. We are now, as you know, with our work history. We have an average of 4.5 jobs on the average American in our database and that work history is very valuable in the hiring process.  And beyond work history, as you know, other data elements like, where did you go to school. What licenses did you have. Have you ever been incarcerated before. Have you been arrested before. All those data elements are very, very valuable and we are building now our data hub of partnerships. If we could find a good way to M&A in that space, we'd like to do it. Yes. International still is broadly kind of lagging the United States, maybe Canada is quite similar as far as the vaccine rollouts. But other markets, I guess, UK is similar. But that's been choppier internationally than it has in the United States for sure and as you point out, Australia has got another lockdown, because the vaccines are really lagging there. The market has adjusted lot of international markets like it did in the United States quicker, meaning customers and consumers figure how to live their lives and operate their businesses in more of a virtual environment. And I think that's what we are seeing in Australia with \u2013 and our international markets that are still lagging in some regards, particularly in Latin America around the COVID lockdowns being relapsed.  The margins, John, we are not growing dramatically different and on a global basis, I wouldn't characterize them differently by market. We really don't talk about on a market basis. Yes. I commented earlier that we are quite encouraged by that. We are really very energized and pleased with the acquisition in the team that we brought on board from Kount. ID and fraud is a very strategic growth area. It's also an area as you pointed out, if we could find more M&A, we'd like to do it to broaden. It's a very big space and as you pointed out, it's very fragmented.  We think we've got very unique data assets to play in identity and fraud and kind of really augments that and that's really the power of the Kount combination and synergies with Equifax. It's really leveraging their data at scale from the ecommerce world. They have something like 32 billion interactions every year with consumers.  They have really scaled data assets around email addresses, IP addresses, cellphone numbers, over 400 million verified elements. And with ecommerce, you are interacting very quickly, because a lot of people are doing ecommerce. So the data is very current. And the combination of that data from Kount with Equifax is really the power.  And ID and fraud, we believe starts with data and that's why we think we have a license to play and if we could find more and we are looking for more M&A in the ID and Fraud space to further strengthen our position is a huge TAM that the market is, I think, close to $18 billion globally for ID and Fraud and it's growing at 20% with the large digital macro meaning more consumers interacting in really every aspect of their lives, whether it's financial services, insurance, telco, or of course, ecommerce and retail digitally.  And with that digital interaction, the requirement to verify that Mark is really Mark, it's critically important. And that's where the data assets come in. And also to do it seamlessly meaning where the consumer doesn't feel it. And the way to do that is to power it with more data. So, we are quite energized about the integration with Kount. The progress so far and it's an area we'd like to be bigger in going forward both organically through the products and the synergies of the Kount acquisition, but also inorganically if we could find some M&A that would strengthen us. Hey, George. Yes. We think about it and so, obviously, something that is hard to forecast. But when you think about interest rates going up, or inflation going up I think you got to step back and look at the consumer itself. The consumer coming out of COVID is very strong. But at the same time they are coming out of COVID with some pent-up demand.  When we think that bodes well for the credit environment, meaning that the consumers are healthier, meaning they can access more credit and there is an underlying desire to going vacations, expand your home, buy new car, all those elements I think are a catalyst for the economy which we are already seeing and obviously quite strong.  And for the credit bureaus in Equifax, that means our customers are going to be spending more in marketing, spending more on originations and looking for new solutions to identify the consumers. If you think about our customers, they are very healthy. They really managed the pandemic much more strongly because their consumer was stronger.  Their losses were not anywhere near what were anticipated. So, our customers are strong and they are looking to grow. And if you got a consumer that's been paying down balances in lots of areas like cards and others during the pandemic because the stimulus and their broad financial strengths.  Our customers need to build up their balance sheets by getting more loans on their books, whether it's credit card or personal loan, an auto loan or a mortgage and of course, the other area that we watch is what impact higher interest rates may have in the future on the mortgage market. The one counter to that is there is still at least in current rates, a loan pipeline and John talked about it of consumers that will still benefit from a refi.  And then, the other element that we are watching is, home price appreciation is up dramatically. And that home price appreciation is an asset for consumers that historically they will access through either home equity loans or a refi of their mortgage to cash out refi. So that's another catalyst that there we keep an eye on. So, there is a lot of variables there which, - but when we think about our guidance for the second half, we got a lot of confidence in the underlying Equifax business, our ability to perform, which is why we raise guidance. Hey, Andrew. Andrew, mortgage was about 32% of revenue in the quarter. And on the Employer Services, we did say that we expect it to be up 20% for the year. And that's really driven by a lot of the new product roll outs that we have, the I-9 Anywhere solutions. We are just seeing real traction in the hiring process that's really driving that. Yes. There is an element of COVID recovery in there in some of the markets like cards and in auto and P loans, so that there is an element to that. Records are a piece of it for sure. As you add records, our hit rates go up. So that's clearly an element. Our real focus on new products in that space and as you point out, SSA contract that will go live in the second half will really ramp in \u2013 somewhat in the second half of the year. But it's really a 2022 benefit as it gets to full \u2013 the full runrate. There is just a lot of opportunities for us in the non-mortgage space. In Talent Solutions, we talked about a very strong growth there. And then, some of the other non-mortgage financial verticals are performing well. Yes. I wouldn't think about them as competitors. They are customers and partners. The bulk of the data they use in their processes comes from us or our competitors. They have some of their own data from historical interactions with consumers. But whether that's going to be broad data to verify, their consumers who they say they are in a BNPL transaction or a lot of the fin-techs are in P loans and sub-prime auto and mortgage and of course in cards, they are using our credit file.  They are using our MC Plus data. We sell quite a bit of in fin-tech of our TWN income and employment data that's used in some of the larger ticket transactions there. So, they are very data savvy. Very data sophisticated and as you point out, they look for more data to enhance the crediting decision, which plays well for us, because as we continue to build out our differentiated datasets, we can bring real value in enhancing the credit decision or the decision they are making with the addition of more data.  So, we view it as a positive. I think as you know, we weren't focused on fin-tech three, four years ago. We changed that and really expanded our resources and capabilities there and we think our cloud investment plays well for fin-tech. Our differentiated data plays well for fin-tech. And our new product focus plays well for fin-tech. So it's a place we want to be larger in. Yes. Our \u2013 all the markets really were quite strong in the second quarter with every region really up over 20%. So, with broad base, there is definitely an element that's meaningful in the quarter from the COVID recovery. I think all the international markets after a year of COVID it really figured out how to operate. Because they all have a different flavor of COVID challenges and they are still operating with \u2013 like the Australia lockdown or UK opened up on Monday.  But there is still some hesitancy, I think for some consumers to go out. But they don't have operates. I think that's a big driver. I wouldn't really highlight any market differently than the other. We have a very strong market position in Australia.  In Canada, we have a very strong market position. We do it in Latin America in a lot of the markets that we operate in. I think broadly, our international markets are very NPI focused. They always have been by really leveraging new products created in the United States or unique to their markets and in getting those out. Those are a big fuel for growth going forward.  And in a lot of our markets, we are continuing to grow our data assets. You've heard, I think, one or two of the new products I highlighted are our new solutions in our international markets. Yes. So, there has been a really substantial focus on new products in Talent Solutions and they are generally built around for allowing the party that's purchasing the product, right. Whether it be a background screen or somebody else, to buy specifically the information they need for the duration they require it. And we've launched a series of products that allow them to do that in ways and they tend to be at very attractive price points for Equifax. So, - so, we are seeing very good improvement in NPI in Talent Solutions. Really it's a real strength for EWS. But obviously, we've also seen very substantial increase in hiring as we get into the second quarter relative to last year. So, I think it gives you a break down. But what I can say is and I think we've been talking about this consistently since at least the third quarter that new products have driven a substantial amount of growth in Talent Solutions really starting about midway through last year. Yes. We've been very clear that we expect UC claims to decline from their extraordinary levels of a year ago and that's a part of our guidance and when you think about some of the other solutions we have, the hiring process is generally good news for a lot of those. Whether it's I-9s onboarding an employee. The employer resource credit is one that's really still a COVID benefit that we expect to benefit through the rest of the year. But that's an area that we are focused on expanding and as you know, we did two acquisitions, particularly HIREtech that we acquired in the first quarter is helping us get stronger and work opportunity tax credits, which is a space that we've been growing going forward. Yes. I don't think we want to get into the exact size on it. But we've been trying to be clear, it was one of the top payroll processors and we are pleased to be adding them to the TWN database and we factor this into our framework or guidance for the second half. And obviously, if it's added, it will benefit us in 2022, benefit Workforce Solutions as those records are added. Those turn into revenue in our system integrations. Yes. We are participating in the BNPL space in the states and other markets around the globe where Australia and UK and Canada I think our markets also have \u2013 we have the BNPL relationships. We provide identity to them after verify who the consumer is and some of the BNPL players are starting to move to larger ticket transactions and looking to do more of an underwriting of the consumer. If you are doing a BNPL on a $100 pair of blue jeans, there is a risk profile that you can do less underwriting, if you will. Maybe just verify the identity of the consumer to make sure it's not a fraudster when you start doing a refrigerator or a couch or a larger ticket transaction. So, in all of our BNPL discussions we are talking to them about their desire to move into bigger ticket transactions and leveraging Equifax data to do that including the credit trial, some of our alternative data like NC Plus or incremental employment data from Workforce Solutions. Yes. I don't know which competitor you are referring to. But as you might imagine, we all don't have the same customer relationships and there is a different level of COVID recovery I think with that space. And when you think about lead gen players, if you are a bank, you are going to restart your own lead gen first before you start buying third-party leads from a lead gen player. So, I think there is some lag in that that we expect improve as we go through the second half. Yes. We don't talk about specific price, but we try to exercise price in all of our businesses. So, as you might imagine, through our uniqueness of the solution or the dataset and of course Workforce Solutions is for sure our most differentiated data asset. So, we do use price, but product is also a very strong way to enhance revenues.  We talked in the past about historically, we have a single whole solution that we might sell for $15, $20, $25, $30 of Workforce Solutions and some of the newer products we've rolled out in the last 12 to 18 months deliver more value to our customers whether it's more historical data at a $150 price point or it's allowing a co-borrower solution called, we call it Mortgage Duo where you can pull a husband and wife that are both applying for a mortgage in a single pool, that's priced at more of the $150 solution.  Multiple pool alternatives in order to incent the usage out of those, you can decide, define it whether you want to call it price or product, but it all results in higher revenue and higher margins. And that's definitely influence the strategy is to leverage the new cloud capabilities around the use of our data in Workforce Solutions to bring new solutions to market.  And then as you referenced earlier, records are obviously result in higher hit rates. Remember, we are getting in system-to-system integrations. We get a hit on our database on every customer where we consumer that our customer has and now we are in that kind of 60% hit range on the non-farm payroll as we add records and go to 61%, 62%, 63%, that drives revenue of course.  And the systems \u2013 system integrations that we have, which are growing, we are now at 75% at mortgage, continuing to grow that. We only see 60% of mortgages meaning there is a lot of customers out there that we still have to add to our relationships. So that's another growth lever.  So there is just a lot of place here in growing that business which is why I said the outsized growth is you've seen for really a decade that the stronger growth in the last couple of years from the scale of the dataset where it just becomes more valuable to integrate into our customers' workflows because of the higher hit rates that it delivers. And that's a space as you know we want to grow. That's why we did the Kount acquisition and we are still in the early days of that integration and really driving the synergies and combining the data assets and rolling out the new solutions that the combination of Equifax data and Kount data is going to deliver principally in the U.S. but Kount also got global capabilities. so, it will benefit us at some of our global markets too. Yes, I don't think we've given in Identity and Fraud a growth rate. But I think we have shared broadly and you know this \u2013 the market itself is growing 20%. So, that's underlying why we invested in Kount and why we are still very open in looking \u2013 it's a priority of us to do more M&A because the size of the TAM is $18 billion growing at 20%. The digital macro of more consumers doing things online on their phone, on their tablets, on their computers is really driving us which is why we want to be bigger in it.  As far as in USIS, auto has been impacted by some of the inventory issues. So that's clearly dampened some of their growth. We've seen strong growth in card as marketing and broadly originations, if we come back and same with P loans. How did we compare to \u2013 how does our second quarter in USIS compare to 2019? And then, second one is versus the \u2013 I think your second question, George, is versus the industry, which I assume needs versus our competitors. One of our competitors hasn't reported yet and I think versus the other that did, I think we are in line and quite pleased with our performance in competitiveness in the marketplace and we are seeing that with the kind of core growth that we are delivering in non-mortgage. Yes. And I think you are talking about mortgage, Jeff. In mortgage, you know, the credit file that was used in virtually a 100% in mortgage and that's a pass-through clause for the consumer. We are starting to have some originators move the income and employment data as a closing statement in I guess, early days on that and we think that's an opportunity going forward it's going to take some time. Yes. It's an important relationship for us. I do a quarterly review with Will Lansing the CEO of FICO and myself and the team. We \u2013 actually, it's not quarterly, it's monthly. So we are excited about that and decide the data decisions cloud which is the integration of their solution with Ignite. We are also in market with a joint solution on AMLKYC that we are very pleased with and we are looking for other solutions going forward. So, we are pleased with the progress. We are in the market commercially and looking to benefit both of what makes sense and of course we go to market independently where it makes sense to. Yes. I think there is a couple of net questioning. I think maybe the first one you are focused on is that some discussions around a public credit bureau. We don't think there is a lot of traction on that. There never was and we don't think that there is a real path to that. It doesn't make sense. There is three large credit bureaus. There is another 30 CRAs underneath the three large credit bureaus. So I think there is plenty of competition in investments to support consumers. The second half of your question around real desire in Washington and with \u2013 we've heard the CFPB talk about it around access to credit for those that are challenged in getting to credit and really drive around alternative data. That's clearly a big focus of ours.  You've heard us talk about it on this call and others around expanding our alternative data, using the Equifax cloud to combine our differentiated data assets and really open up credit using things like utility bills, payment records, cellphone payment records, income and employment data to expand access to the credit. It's clearly a focus of ours and it is of our customers, the financial institutions and banks and that is aligned with the push that Washington has. Yes. It's challenging. I would say, we are still cautious in the second half around some of those recoveries and even in the United States the delta concerns is that getting impact things is something obviously we watch. I think the thing that John and I keep an eye on is kind of deal pipelines. Where are winning in the marketplace. Where are we adding new customers. Where are we rolling out new products. Those are kind of the above market kind of growth that we are pleased with the momentum. We talked a bunch about the USIS and Workforce, but also what the teams are doing internationally on that front. Sure. On your first question about NPIs, all our teams \u2013 all four business units are intently focused on NPIs. It's a priority that's really central to our EFX2023 strategy. So, I don't think there is real difference of activity that the pipelines that John and I have a monthly review with the teams on \u2013 with the product teams around how they are working to leverage our new client capabilities to bring new solutions to market and they all have very robust pipelines and we are seeing revenues. I don't think \u2013 we don't disclose the vitality index by business unit. But it's a broad based as far as everyone's focus.  As far as capital allocation, we are clearly committed to completing the cloud. We are obviously spending the dollars there and we've been quite consistent. Those dollars are coming down as we go through and into 2022. But we are quite significant to last three years and we are starting to really pivot \u2013 leveraging the cloud and getting the benefits from the cloud, which are quite meaningful.  And there was no intended hints around changing our stock buyback. So, I don't know you picked that up in the comments. But that wasn't an intent. We are quite clear in launching a buyback earlier this year to offset solution from employee plans that that was a step forward, but nothing more than that.  The third leg on capital allocation that you didn't mention is M&A and we try to be very clear that we see meaningful opportunities to enhance Equifax through M&A whether it's in differentiated data solutions which Kount check that box, Identity and Fraud, if that's growing space that we want to be bigger in and we think we've got to check at the play there because of our data.  Kount that check that one. Second is or third really is, strengthening our Workforce Solutions. It's our fastest and strongest \u2013 fastest growing and strongest business and strengthening the core Workforce through HIREtech and i2Verify is key to our strategy and as we mentioned earlier, we are really focused on widening Workforce Solutions really in the Talent Solution space through data assets. Data that would be additive to our income and employment work history that we have in the database.  And then, I mentioned earlier differentiated data assets, we are always looking for unique data assets that we can combine to existing Equifax data assets. So, M&A is a priority of ours and as we mentioned earlier, we've done five transactions this year, Kount being quite significant. But we are on the lookout for acquisitions. What I would characterize as bolt-ons that I will really check those three areas of differentiated data, identity and fraud and strengthening and broadening Workforce Solutions. Sure. Yes. It's actually this quarter, but ERC was a little stronger than we thought obviously with the new credits. So difficult to forecast. And you see it was a little stronger than we thought, right? So, the unemployment claims filings were a little higher than we expected when we gave guidance initially. And you have to \u2013 as you move through the rest of this year, ERC does tend to offset a little bit via declining UC. But as we said, the ERC credits will be something that we'll only see this year and it will be gone as we get into next year."

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDorian Hare: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentations. These materials are labeled Q1 2021 Earnings Release Presentation. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2021 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, under our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Dorian. Before I address Equifax's very strong first quarter results, I want to again thank our 11,000 employees and families that supported them for the tremendous dedication they continue to show under the challenging COVID environment over the past year. We continue to make the health and safety of our employees a top priority and I hope that you and those close to you remain safe. Turning to Slide 4, and as I will cover in a moment, Equifax delivered an outstanding first quarter with record revenue and strong sequential growth versus fourth quarter. The tremendous progress we have made executing against our strategic priorities and building out our Equifax cloud capabilities is allowing us to outperform our underlying markets and deliver outstanding revenue growth and margin expansion. In the U.S. where the economy is still recovering from the COVID pandemic more rapidly than we anticipated, we continue to outperform the overall mortgage market, which remains strong in the first quarter. We're also seeing a real recovery and strong growth across our core banking, auto, insurance, government, and talent business segments. We delivered growth again in the first quarter internationally with continued challenging COVID restrictions in place in most of our global markets and we expect to see acceleration in this growth as economies recover outside the U.S. First quarter was a great start to 2021. We are energized by our strong momentum and pivoting to our next chapter of growth with the launch of EFX2023, our new strategic growth framework that will serve as our company-wide compass over the next three years. With our new Equifax Cloud foundation increasingly in place, we're focused on leveraging our new Equifax Cloud data and technology infrastructure to accelerate innovation, new products, and growth. Innovation and new products will fuel our growth in 2021 and beyond as we leverage our new EFX Cloud capabilities to bring new products and solutions and multi-data insights to customers faster, more securely, and more reliably. As you know, we ramped our investments in product and innovation resources over the past 12 months to accelerate our new product rollouts leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. Our highly unique and diverse data assets are at the heart of what creates Equifax\u2019s differentiation in the marketplace. We have data assets at scale that our competitors do not have, including TWN, NCTUE, DataX, IXI and more and we are committed to expanding and deepening these differentiated data assets through organic actions, partnerships and M&A. We're also relentlessly focused on a customer-first mentality, which moves us closer to our customers with a focus on delivering solutions to help solve their problems and drive their growth. Another critical level of our strategy is to reinvest our accelerating free cash flow in smart, strategic and accretive bolt-on acquisitions that both expand and strengthen our capabilities with a goal of increasing our revenue growth by 1% to 2% annually for M&A and data security is deeply embedded in our culture, we have clearly established Equifax as an industry leader in data security. Working together as one aligned global Equifax team, where we leverage our commercial strengths, our new products and our capabilities across our EFX Cloud global platform, will allow us to deliver solutions that only Equifax can bring to the marketplace. We're energized around our new EFX2023 strategic priorities that will serve as our guidepost over the next three years and support our new long-term growth framework that we plan to put in place later this year. Turning now to Slide 5, Equifax performance in the first quarter was very strong. Revenue at $1.2 billion was the strongest quarterly revenue in our history. In first quarter, constant currency revenue growth was a very strong 25% with our growing organic growth at 23%, which was also an Equifax record. As a reminder, we're coming off a solid 13% growth in first quarter last year. All business units performed -- outperformed our expectations and we are seeing positive signs of a COVID recovery beginning to accelerate, particularly in the U.S. Our growth was again powered by our two U.S. B2B Businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS, with combined revenue up a very strong 38%. Mortgage-related revenue remained robust, and importantly, our non-mortgage-related verticals grew organically by a very strong 16%. The adjusted EBITDA margins of our U.S. B2B businesses were 52%, up 400 basis points, with EWS delivering close to 60% margins. As a reminder, Workforce Solutions and USIS are over 70% of Equifax revenue and 80% of Equifax business unit EBITDA. First quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $431 million, up 36% with over 250 basis points of expansion in our margins to 35.6%. This margin expansion was delivered while including all cloud technology transformation costs and our adjusted results, which negatively impacted first quarter adjusted EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points. Excluding Kount cloud transformation costs, our margins would have been up over 500 basis points. We are clearly getting strong leverage out of our revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA -- adjusted EPS at $1.97 per share, was up a very strong 37% from last year, which was also impacted by the inclusion of cloud transformation costs. Adjusted EPS would have been $2.20 and up 54% excluding these costs. We continue to accelerate our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter, including migrating an additional 2,000 customers to the cloud in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 customers internationally. Leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure, we also continue to accelerate new product innovation. In the first quarter, we released 39 new products, which is up from 35 launched a year ago in the first quarter, continuing the momentum from 2020 where we launched a record 134 new products. And we're seeing increased revenue generation from these new products leveraging our new EFX cloud. For 2021, we expect our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years to exceed 8%. This is 100 basis point improvement from the 7% guidance we provided in our vitality index back in February. And in the first quarter, we completed five strategic bolt-on acquisitions, with a focus on identity and fraud capability through our acquisition of Talent and accelerating growth in Workforce Solutions with the acquisitions of HIREtech and i2Verify. Acquisitions that will broaden and strengthen Equifax are a strong lever for continuing to accelerate our growth and a big focus. We were energized by our fast start to 2021 and are clearly seeing the momentum of our only Equifax model, leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities. Our first quarter results were substantially stronger than the guidance we provided in February with over 90% of the revenue outperformance delivered in our two U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Importantly, as we'll discuss in more detail shortly, over 60% of this outperformance in the U.S. B2B revenue was in our non-mortgage segments in both USIS and Workforce Solutions. Non-mortgage revenue strengthened consistently during the first quarter with March revenue up significantly versus February in both USIS and EWS. This broad-based strength was above our expectations and gives us confidence about further strengthening in the second quarter and second half as the COVID recovery unfolds. Mortgage revenue was also stronger than we expected, despite the growth in U.S. mortgage market at 21% being slightly below our expectations from a slowing -- from slowing mortgage inquiries in late March, which have continued into April. Our continued strong mortgage results and outperformance was driven by Workforce Solutions, with stronger market penetration, record growth, and positive impact from new products. USIS mortgage revenue also exceeded expectations slightly. The stronger revenue delivered strong operating leverage with substantial improvement in our EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS. The strength of our first quarter results in Workforce Solutions and in U.S. non-mortgage revenue across USIS and Workforce Solutions more broadly, gave us the confidence to substantially raise our 2021 guidance for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $225 million to a midpoint of $4.65 billion and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.55 a share to a midpoint of $6.90 per share. This includes our expectation that the U.S. mortgage market for 2021, as measured by credit inquiries, will decline more in our February guidance of down 5% to a decline of approximately 8%. Our framework assumes that the mortgage market slows primarily in the third and fourth quarter, which is consistent with our prior guidance. John will discuss our mortgage assumptions in more detail in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 6, our outstanding first quarter results were broad-based and reflect better-than-expected performance for all - from all four business units. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering 59% revenue growth and almost 60% adjusted EBITDA margins. Workforce Solutions is now our largest business, representing almost 40% of total Equifax revenue in the fourth quarter and is clearly powering our results. Verification Services revenue of $385 million was up a strong 75%. Verification Service mortgage revenue again more than doubled for the fourth consecutive quarter growing almost 100 percentage points faster than the 21% underlying growth we saw in the mortgage market credit inquiries in the first quarter. Importantly, verification services non-mortgage revenue was up over 25% in the quarter. This segment of verification services continues to expand its market coverage and benefit from NPIs new records, new use cases and as a long-term growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Talent Solutions, which represents over 30% of verifier non-mortgage revenue almost doubled, driven by both new products and recovery in U.S. hiring. Government Solutions, which represents almost 40% of verifier non-mortgage revenue also returned to growth driven by greater usage in multiple states of our differentiated data. As a reminder, we continue to work closely with the Social Security Administration on our new contract that we expect to go live in the second half and ramp to $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue at run rate in 2022. Our non-mortgage consumer business, principally in banking and auto, also showed strong growth in the quarter as well, both from deepening penetration with new lenders and from some recovery in those markets that I'll cover more fully in the discussion of USIS. Debt management, which now represents under 10% of verifier non-mortgage revenue was, as we expected, down versus last year, but is stabilized and we expect to see growth in that vertical as we move through 2021. Employer Services revenue of $96 million increased 17% in the quarter, driven again by our unemployment claims business which had revenue of $47 million, up around 47% compared to last year. In the first quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 2.8 million UC claims, which is up from 2.6 million in the fourth quarter. EWS processed roughly one-in-three U.S. initial unemployment claims in the quarter, which was up from one in five that they had been processing in recent periods, reflecting the growth in Workforce Solutions UC market position.  As a reminder, we continue to expect UC claims revenue to decline sequentially in the second quarter and throughout the balance of 2021 as the U.S. economy recovers and job losses dissipate. We currently expect to decline in the second quarter UC revenue of about 45% versus last year and a full year 2021 decline in UC claims revenue of just under 30%. Employer Services non-UC businesses had revenue down slightly in the quarter. Our I-9 business driven by our new I-9 Anywhere Solution continued to show very strong growth with revenue up 15%. Our I-9 business is expected to continue to grow substantially to become our largest Employer Services business in 2021 and represent about 40% of non-UC revenue. Reflecting the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of workforce analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC businesses to deliver organic growth of over 20% in 2021. The HIREtech and i2Verify acquisitions that we closed in March had a de minimis impact on revenue in the quarter, but will add \u2013 will further add to Workforce Solutions growth during the rest of 2021. I'll discuss both HIREtech and i2Verify a little bit later. Reflecting the power and uniqueness of TWN data, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 59.3% and almost 800 basis point expansion from last year in Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions' team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a strong 2021. Workforce Solutions is clearly Equifax's largest and fastest-growing business. USIS revenue was up a very strong 19% in the quarter with organic growth also a strong 17%. Total USIS mortgage revenue growth of $177 million was up 25% in the quarter, while mortgage credit inquiry growth up 21% was slightly below the 24% expectation we shared in February. As I mentioned John will cover our updated view of the mortgage market for 2021 in a few minutes. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by 500 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in marketing and debt -- new debt monitoring products. Non-mortgage revenue performance was very strong, with growth of 15% and organic growth of 11%, which is a record for USIS and of a fairly strong first quarter last year. We view this outperformance by US as meaningful and a reflection of the competitiveness and commercial focus of the USIS team. Importantly, non-mortgage online revenue grew a very strong 16% in the quarter with organic growth of almost 11%. We saw non-mortgage revenue growth accelerate in February and March as vaccine rollouts increased and financial institutions gained confidence in the consumer and the economy. Banking, auto, ID and fraud, insurance, and the direct-to-consumer all showed growth in the quarter, which is encouraging as we move into second quarter and the rest of 2021. Commercial was about flat, while only Telco was down in the quarter as we expected. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our offline or batch business, was $53 million in the quarter, up almost 12%, which is also very positive. The performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20% and ID and fraud revenue growth of just under 10% as consumer marketing and originations ramped up. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 45% of FMS revenue with identity and fraud about 25% and risk decisioning about 30%. This strong growth across our non-mortgage businesses, including strong growth in marketing specific offline revenue, is very encouraging for both the recovery of our underlying markets and our non-mortgage performance as we move into second quarter and the rest of 2021. The USIS team continues to drive growth in their new deal pipeline with first quarter pipeline up 30% over last year, driven by growth in both the volume and the size of new opportunities and NPI roll outs. First quarter win rates were also higher than levels seen in 2020. Sid Singh and his USIS team continue to be on offense and are competitive in winning in their marketplace. In addition to driving core business growth in the first quarter, USIS also achieved an important strategic milestone in closing the acquisition of Kount, an industry leader in providing AI-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions. Integration efforts are now underway with a key focus on technology and product, leveraging the joint Equifax and Kount data and capabilities. Kount's technology platform will migrate to the Equifax Cloud in the next 12 to 18 months, which will allow for the full integration of Kount and Equifax capabilities for new solutions, new products and market expansion in the fast-growing identity and fraud marketplace. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 42.9% in the first quarter were down about 180 basis points from last year. About two-thirds of the decline was due to the inclusion of tech transformation costs in our adjusted EBITDA in 2021. The remainder of the decline was principally driven by the higher mix of mortgage products and redundant system costs from our cloud transformation.  Moving now to international, their revenue was up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, which is the second consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets that are still very challenged by COVID lockdowns and slow vaccine rollouts. Revenue growth improved significantly in Canada, Asia Pacific, which is our Australian business and Latin America. This was partially offset by revenue declines in the UK, principally due to continued UK lockdowns in response to the COVID pandemic. Asia-Pacific, which is principally Australia business, had a very good performance in the first quarter with revenue of $87 million, up 7% in local currency. Australia consumer revenue continues to improve relative to prior quarters and was down only about 2% versus last year compared to down 5% in the fourth quarter. Our commercial business combined online and offline revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter, a solid improvement from fourth quarter. And fraud and identity was up 15% in the quarter following strong performance in the fourth quarter. European revenues of $69 million were down 5% in local currency in the first quarter. Our European credit business was down about 5% in local currency. Spain revenue was down about 1%, while the UK was down about 6% in local currency similar to the fourth quarter from continued challenging COVID environments.  Our European debt management business revenue declined by about 4% in local currency in the quarter. Both the CRA and debt management businesses were impacted in the quarter by actions taken by the UK government to curtail debt placements in response to the pandemic resurgence in the United Kingdom. As the lockdown and other actions lift in April and May, we anticipate improvements in UK CRA revenue in the second quarter and improvements in debt management revenue in the second half of 2021 as collection activity restarts in the latter part of the second quarter. Latin American revenues of $42 million grew about 1% in the quarter in local currency, which was an improvement from the down 1% we saw in the fourth quarter. These markets also continue to be heavily impacted negatively by continued COVID lockdowns and slow vaccine roll-ups. We continue to see the benefit in LatAm of strong new product introductions over the past three years, which is benefiting their top line. Canada delivered record revenue of $44 million in the quarter, up about 13% in local currency. Consumer online was up about 3% in the quarter, an improvement from the fourth quarter. Improving growth in commercial, analytical and decision solutions and ID and fraud also drove growth in Canadian revenue in the first quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 28.2% were down 30 basis points from last year, excluding the impact of the tech transformation costs that we've included in adjusted EBITDA, margins were up about 200 basis points. This improvement was principally due to revenue growth and operating leverage, partially offset by system -- redundant system costs from our cloud transformation. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a local currency basis in the quarter and slightly better than our expectations. We saw better-than-expected performance in our global consumer direct business, which sells directly to consumers through Equifax.com and myEquifax and which represents about half of total GCS revenue.  Direct-to-consumer revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter, their third consecutive quarter of growth. Decline in overall GCrevenue in the quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead generation partner business, which has been significantly impacted from COVID beginning in mid-2020. As we discussed, we expect a decline in total GCS revenue from our partner vertical to moderate substantially as we move into the second quarter and return to growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.6% were up about 150 basis points. We expect margins to be pressured to around 20% in the second quarter, reflecting planned costs to complete the migration of our consumer direct business, cloud transformations in the US, UK, and Canada, to our new Equifax Cloud platform. Moving to Slide 7, this chart provides an updated view of Equifax's core revenue growth. As a reminder, core revenue growth is defined as Equifax revenue growth, excluding: number one, the extraordinary revenue growth in our UC claims business in 2020 and 2021; and number two, the impact on revenue from U.S. mortgage market activity as measured by changes in total U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries. Core revenue growth is our attempt to provide a more normalized view of Equifax revenue growth, excluding these unusual UC and U.S. mortgage market factors. In the first quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 7, was up a very strong 20%, reflecting the broad-based growth across Equifax. And this is up significantly from the 11% core revenue growth we delivered in the fourth quarter and well above our historic core growth rates. Workforce Solutions and USIS have continued to strongly outperform the mortgage market. The 16% organic growth in U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue also drove our core revenue growth. Importantly, our core revenue growth has accelerated over the past five quarters from 5% in first quarter 2020 to 11% in the fourth quarter of last year and to 20% this quarter, reflecting the strength and resiliency of our broad-based business model, power of Workforce Solutions, the market competitiveness of USIS and benefits from our cloud Equifax -- our cloud, data, and technology investments and our increasing focus on leveraging the cloud for innovation new products. As you know, the strong growth is in the midst of a global market that is still recovering from the COVID pandemic. Turning to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax and clearly is our strongest and most valuable and largest business. Workforce Solutions revenue grew a very strong 59% in the first quarter with core revenue growth accelerating to 46%. As a reminder, the 59% growth is off 32% growth in first quarter of 2020. The strong outperformance in sequential improvement reflects the power of the unique TWN database and Workforce Solutions business model. At the end of the first quarter, the TWN database reached 115 million active users and 90 million unique records, an increase of 9% or 10 million active records from a year ago. And as a reminder, over 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers that Workforce Solutions provides Employer Services like UC Claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC and other solutions, too, and we've built these relationships over -- with these \u2013 with our customers and contributors over the past decade. The remaining 35% are contributed through partnerships, most of which are exclusive. The major payroll processor agreement that we announced on our February call is still on track to go live later this year, which will add to our TWN database. And we have a dedicated team, as you know, focused on growing our TWN database with an active pipeline of record additions to continue to expand our TWN database. The Workforce Solutions team continues to focus on expanding the number of mortgage companies and financial institutions with which we have real-time system-to-system integrations, which as you know, drives increased usage of our TWN data. The team is also focused on extending our operations into card and auto verticals, as well as across our growing government vertical. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to work closely with the SSA and expect to go live with our new solution in the second half of this year, which will deliver $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue and run rate in 2022. The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding, as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax cloud infrastructure. We are anticipating new products in mortgage, talent solutions, government and I-9 in 2021. New product revenue will increase in 2021 and 2022 as we begin to reap the benefits of our new products introduced to the market during last year and in 2021. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team have multiple levers for growth in 2021, 2022 and beyond. Workforce Solutions are the most -- Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business and will continue to power our results in the future. Slide 9 highlights the ongoing exceptional core growth performance in mortgage for our U.S. B2B business -- mortgage businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Workforce and USIS outgrew the underlying U.S. mortgage market again in first quarter with combined core growth of 48%, up from 37% in 2020 and in line with the 49% growth they delivered in the fourth quarter -- 49% core growth. This outperformance was driven strongly by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 99%. Consistent with past quarters, Workforce Solutions outperformance was driven by new records, increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates and new products, proof that lenders are increasingly becoming reliant on the unique TWN income and employment data when making credit decisions. USIS delivered 5% core mortgage revenue growth in the quarter, driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions with further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow all of our underlying markets is core to our business model and core to our future growth. I'd now like to turn it over to John to discuss current trends in the mortgage market and to walk through our revised second quarter and full year 2021 guidance.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. As Mark referenced earlier, U.S. mortgage market inquiries remained very strong in 1Q 2021 and up 21%, but that growth was slightly lower than the 24% we had expected when we provided guidance in early February. As shown on the left side of Slide 10, as mortgage rates increased over the past few months and refinancing activity continues, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing has declined to about $30 million. Although still very strong by historic standards, this is down from the levels we saw in 4Q 2020 and early 1Q 2021. Based upon our most recent data from 4Q 2020, mortgage refinancings were continuing at about $1 million per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 10, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. This strong purchase market is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into 2022. Based on these trends and specifically, the reduction in the pool of mortgages that would benefit from refinancing, we are reducing our expectation for the mortgage market financing activity in 2021. As shown on Slide 11, we now expect mortgage credit inquiries to be about flat in 2Q 2021 versus 2Q 2020 and to be down about 25% in the second half of 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020. Overall, for 2021, we expect mortgage market credit inquiries to be down approximately 8%. This compares to the down approximately 5% we discussed with you in February. Slide 12 provides our guidance for 2Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 16% to 18%, including a 2.1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 2%. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q 2021 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.63 per share. In 2Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $44 million or $0.27 per share. Excluding these costs that were excluded from 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 2Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.87 to $1.97 per share, up 15% to 21% from 2Q 2020. This performance is being delivered in the context of the U.S. mortgage market, which is expected to be flat versus 2Q 2020. Slide 13 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially despite the expectation of a weaker U.S. mortgage market. 2021 revenue of between $4.575 billion and $4.675 billion reflects revenue growth of about 11% to 13% versus 2020, including a 1.4% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.7%. EWS is expected to deliver over 20% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid to high single digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth in the upper single digits, and GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits in 2021. 2Q 2021 revenue was also expected to be down mid-single digits for DCS. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. These one-time costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS through 2020. In 2021, Equifax expects to incur one-time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $145 million, a reduction of about 60% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $145 million in one-time costs would reduce adjusted EPS by $0.91 per share. This is consistent with our guidance for 2021 that we gave in February. 2021 adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $7.05 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is down approximately 3% to up 1% from 2020. Excluding the impact of tech transformation costs of $0.91 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021, which show growth of about 10% to 14% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of over $65 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.40 a share. Additional assumptions included in 2021 guidance are provided -- will be provided in the 1Q 2021 earnings slide deck to be posted later this morning. Slide 14 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2019 through 2021. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of movements in the mortgage market on Equifax revenue, as well as the impact of changes in our UC claims business within our EWS Employer Services business, and also the employee retention credit revenue from our recently acquired HIREtech business. Employee retention credits are specific U.S. government incentives for companies to retain their employees in response to COVID-19 and the associated revenue is not expected to continue into 2022. The data shown for 2Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of guidance ranges we provided. In 1Q 2021, we delivered very strong core revenue growth of 20% and expect to continue to deliver strong core revenue growth in 2Q 2021 of about 20% and 16% for all of 2021. This very strong performance, we believe, positions us well entering 2022 and beyond. And now I'd like to hand it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 15. This highlights our continued focus on new product innovation, which is a critical component of our next chapter of growth as we leverage the Equifax Cloud for innovation, new products and growth. We continue to focus on transforming Equifax into a product-led organization, leveraging our best-in-class Equifax cloud-native data and technology to fuel top line growth. In the first quarter, we delivered 39 new products, which is up from the 35 we delivered last year. We're encouraged by this continued strong performance, especially following the record 135 new products we delivered last year. We wanted to highlight some of these new products, which we expect to drive revenue in 2021 and beyond. First, Insight Score for credit card launched by USIS provides the credit card industry with a specific credit risk score created using credit and alternative data that predicts the likelihood of a consumer becoming 90 days past due or more within 24 months of origination. USIS also launched a new commercial real estate tenant risk assessment product suite, which provides real-time and unmatched data analytics and risk assessment for tenants, buildings and portfolio strength, delivered through an interactive, ignite marketplace app or as a stand-alone report. And Workforce Solutions continues to expand its suite of products focused on the government vertical. Their government enhanced solutions, Social Services Verification product, gives the ability for the customer to choose the desired period of employment history with options ranging from three months, six months, one year, three years or the full employment history. These products help government agencies quickly and efficiently administer federally \u2013 federal supplement -- supplementary nutrition, child health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare benefits, managed child support and insurance program integrity. In the first quarter, over two-thirds of our new products launched or in development leveraged our new Equifax cloud-based global product platforms. This enables significant synergies and efficiencies in how we build the new products, our speed to bring the products to market and our ability to move the new products easily to our global markets. Our new cloud-based Luminate platform for fraud management is a great example, which is launching in Canada and the U.S. simultaneously and will soon launch in the United Kingdom, Australia, and India. This would have taken much longer and been much more expensive in a legacy environment. We're also rolling out our Equifax Cloud-based Interconnect and Ignite platforms for marketing and risk and decisioning and management products throughout Latin America, Europe, Canada, as well as the United States. As we discussed on our call in February, we're focused on leveraging our new cloud capabilities to increase NPI rollouts and new product revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. As a reminder, our NPI revenue is defined as the revenue delivered by new products launched over the past three years and our vitality index is defined as the percentage of current year revenue delivered by NPI revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we've increased our 2021 vitality index guidance from 7% by 100 basis points to 8%, as you can see from the left side of the slide, is a significant increase from about 500 basis points in 2020. NPIs are a big priority for me and the team as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation, new products, and growth. Turning to Slide 16, M&A plays an important role in our growth strategy and will be central to our long-term growth framework. Our team is focused on building an active pipeline of bolt-on targets that will both broaden and strengthen Equifax. Our M&A strategy centers on acquiring accretive and strategic companies to add unique data assets, new capabilities, deliver expansion into identity and fraud, or expand our geographic footprint. In the first quarter, we closed five acquisitions totaling $866 million across strategic focus areas of identity and fraud, Workforce Solutions, open data, and SME. We discussed three of these transactions with you in February, which were the acquisitions of Kount and Kount score, and Credit Works. As I discussed earlier, we're excited about expanding opportunities we see from the combined Kount and Equifax in the fast-growing identity and fraud marketplace. In March, we closed two Workforce Solutions bolt-on transactions, HIREtech and i2Verify, which will further broaden and strengthen our Workforce Solutions business. HIREtech is a Houston-based company that provides employee-related tax credit services as well as verification services. HIREtech also has unique channel relationships to provide these services through payroll providers, consulting firms, and CPA firms. i2Verify is a Newburyport, Massachusetts-based company that provides secure digital verifications of income and employment services. The company has a unique nationwide set of record contributing employers with concentrations in the healthcare and education sectors. i2Verify also brings unique records to the TWN database, all of which are contributed by direct relationships. You should expect Equifax to continue to make acquisitions in these strategic growth areas that offer unique data and analytics to our customers with a goal of increasing our top line by 100 to 200 basis points annually from M&A. Before wrapping up, I want to speak to you about an area of significant focus at Equifax and importance to me personally. Slide 17 provides an overview of Equifax's ESG strategy and how it helps position us for long-term sustainability. I hope you saw and had a chance to read our annual report letter that highlighted our increased focus on ESG. First, Equifax plays an important role in helping consumers live their financial best. A primary example of this is that, our alternative data assets, such as utility and phone payment data, provide lenders with a better picture of the approximately 30 million U.S. individuals that do not have traditional credit files or access to the formal financial system. I've also made advancing inclusion and diversity, a personal priority since I joined Equifax. Believing that diversity of thought leads to better decisions, we've taken clear steps to broaden diversity at Equifax, including the last three Directors added to our Board are diverse, and all seven individuals have been added to my senior leadership team since I joined three years ago, have also been diverse. We're carrying out this focus on inclusion and diversity across Equifax. We're also focused on environment -- on our environmental impact and greenhouse gas footprint. Our cloud transformation will move our existing legacy technology infrastructure to the cloud, which will dramatically reduce our environmental impact as we leverage the efficiencies and carbon-neutral infrastructure at our cloud service providers. Over the course of this year, we -- or over the course of last year, we decommissioned six data centers, over 6,800 legacy data assets and over 1,000 legacy applications. We have a detailed program underway to baseline our energy usage and benefits from our cloud transformation as we work towards a commitment regarding carbon emissions and a net zero footprint. We're also committed to being the industry leaders regarding security. With the leadership of our CSO, Jamil Farshchi, our culture puts security first. All employees are required to take a mandatory security-focused training sessions every year. And all of our 4,000 bonus eligible employees have a security role in their annual MBOs. We believe -- we also believe in sharing our security protocols and strategies with our partners, customers and competitors to collaborate to keep us all safe. In 2020, we hosted our inaugural Customer Security Summit, where we detailed our progress on security transformation and discussed advancements in supply chain security. As threats continue to evolve, we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our security efforts. Wrapping up on Slide 18. Equifax delivered a record-setting first quarter and we have strong momentum as we move into second quarter in 2021. Our 27% overall and 20% core growth in first quarter reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model while still operating in a challenging COVID environment. We've now delivered five consecutive quarters of sequentially improving double-digit growth. We're confident in our outlook for 2021. And as John described, are raising our full year midpoint revenue by 500 basis points to $4.65 billion and our EPS midpoint by 9% to $6.90 a share. Our revised revenue estimate of 12% growth in 2021 at the midpoint of the range, off of a very strong 17% in 2020 reflects the resiliency, strength and momentum of the EFX business model. Our increased 2021 growth framework incorporated our expectation as John discussed that the U.S. mortgage market will decline about 8% in 2021 and while operating in a still recovering COVID economy. Our expectation for core revenue growth of 16% in 2021 reflects how our EFX2023 strategic priorities are delivering. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter of 59% growth and will continue to power Equifax's operating performance throughout 2021 and beyond. The work number is our most differentiated data asset and Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business. Rudy Ploder and his team are driving outsized growth by focusing on their key levers, new records, new products, penetration, and expansion into new verticals with our differentiated TWN database. USIS also delivered an outstanding quarter of 19% growth highlighted by non-mortgage revenue growth of 15% and 11% organic non-mortgage growth. We expect our non-mortgage growth to accelerate as the U.S. economy recovers. The acquisition of Kount is providing new opportunities and products in the rapidly expanding identity and fraud marketplace and USIS continues to outperform the mortgage market from new products, pricing, and increased penetration. USIS is clearly competitive and winning in the marketplace and will continue to deliver in 2021 and beyond. International grew in the first quarter for the second consecutive quarter, overcoming economic headwinds from significant COVID lockdowns and slower vaccine rollouts in our global markets. Our expectations are high for ongoing sequential improvement in international during 2021 and for accelerating growth as their underlying markets recover from the COVID pandemic. We're also making strong progress rolling out our new EFX cloud technology and data infrastructure and remain confident, as John described, in the significant top line, cost, and cash benefits from our new EFX Cloud capabilities. These financial benefits will ramp as we move through 2021 and continue to grow in 2022 and are enabled by our always on stability, speed-to-market and ability to rapidly build and move products around the globe. Our strong performance -- operating performance is allowing us to continue to accelerate investments in new products leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And we're off to a strong start in 2021 with 39 NPIs in the first quarter on top of the record 134 we launched in 2020. And our strong outperformance is fueling our cash generation, which is allowing us to reinvest in accretive and strategic bolt-on acquisitions. As discussed earlier, we closed five acquisitions in strategic growth areas in the first quarter and we have an active M&A pipeline. We look for bolt-on acquisitions that will strengthen our technology and data assets and that are financially accretive with a goal of adding 100 to 200 basis points to our top line growth rate in the future. I'm energized about what the future holds for Equifax. We have strong momentum across all of our businesses as we move into second quarter. We're on offense and position to bring new and unique solutions to our customers that only Equifax can deliver, leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities and our strong results and the increased guidance that we provided reflect that. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions. \nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] All right. We'll take the first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Looking at the over 20% EWS revenue growth guide for this year, can you quantify contributions you expect from new unique record growth, pricing, and new use cases?\nMark Begor: Yes, I think the answer is yes. Those are all meaningful levers. I would add the system, system integrations in our mortgage market and other solutions is also a lever for growth. David, I think, as you know, we don't break those out specifically, but it starts with records. We've clearly got a real focus on and some real momentum in adding records to the TWN Database. As you know, we have a dedicated team that that's all they do. And we've got active dialogues going with individual corporations to bring their data to us as we add new services like UC claims and WOTC and all the myriad of services that we provide and also with other payroll processors. And as you know, in February, we announced that our plan -- and we're on track to add one of the major payroll processors records to our database in the second half of 2021, which will add meaningfully. And I think you know, our business model as we grow records, we're able to monetize those really instantly because of the inquiries that we receive just drive our hit rates up. We clearly have the ability to use price, which we talked about. I think you've seen a real increase in the focus on new products at Workforce Solutions, particularly as they're becoming cloud-enabled. It's giving them the opportunity to bring new solutions to the marketplace to really leverage their data sets. And these new solutions are typically at higher price points and delivering more value to our customers. So that's another big lever. We've talked about \u2013 in the second half that, they're continuing to focus on systems and system integrations, and we just find higher usage when customers move from accessing the TWN database through the web to system-to-system integrations, we get really all their volume, which is another big lift. And as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still on track to launch our new agreement with the Social Security Administration. It's a very meaningful contract that will go live in the second half and we expect that to be $40 million to $50 million in run rate. So there's a large amount of levers available for Workforce Solutions. As you point out, it starts with records. And while we've grown records to 90 million uniques in the quarter, as you know, there's 155 million non-farm payroll. So there's a lot of room between 90 million and $155 million as we continue to grow towards having the full data set. And then we talked before that we're also widening dataset beyond W-2 income, including 1099 and other data sources as we look for other ways to include other portions of the U.S. population around are they working and how much do they make.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up. You closed 2020 at almost 60% EBITDA margin for EWS. Can you quantify operating leverage in this business for 2021?\nMark Begor: Well, it\u2019s - there's a lot of leverage, as you could see in the first quarter results. I think you're talking about Workforce Solutions. We're continuing to invest in the business. There's no question about that. But with the revenue growth that we're getting on both the mortgage and non-mortgage side in Workforce Solutions, there's real operating leverage that we expect to continue through 2021.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping, Mark, you could talk about the comments you made towards the end of the call around acceleration of the non-mortgage business with this reopening? And perhaps off that $225 million that you raised revenue by, like how much of that was just the strong performance in EWS, you called out versus maybe some incremental M&A and this reopening benefit that you think you'll see?\nMark Begor: Yes, we don't have any incremental M&A in that guide. We wouldn't include that acquisitions that we haven't completed yet. I think we talked that we have a pipeline and a goal of increasing acquisitions. Of course, we're off to a very fast start this year on M&A. You know this, Manav, we took down our framework for mortgage inside of that revenue framework that we shared, which is quite significant. We think that we've got mortgage in the right spot now at down 8% versus the down 5% for the year. And as you know, that the way we frame that is most of that happens, really all of it really happens in the second half. And an expectation that there will be a recovery in the economies as vaccine rollouts continue and lockdowns are reduced, there's still some impact, we believe, of the COVID pandemic in the U.S. market. Although, as we pointed out, we saw some real recovery by our customers. And I characterize that as confidence, meaning they're starting originations in the latter part of the first quarter and into April, which we expect that to continue. But you still have -- our international markets are still significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic and we expect that to unfold at some pace during 2021 and that will be a positive as we move forward. Would you add anything, John?\nJohn Gamble: No, we've just said in the past, right, that increasingly, as we go through 2021, as the non-mortgage markets recover, increasingly, their contribution to core growth is going up, right? So, we're -- so we expect that to continue as we go through the year. And the outperformance in the first quarter, as we said, more than half of it was driven in our non-mortgage segments, and you're seeing that obviously flow through the rest of this year as well.\nMark Begor: And then I would add to it, too, that I hope you caught our comments around, we really feel like the Equifax Cloud is providing benefits. Our NPI focus is providing benefits that will benefit our mortgage business as well as our non-mortgage business. And. of course, the majority of Equifax is non-mortgage, but the initiatives that we launched over the last couple of years, the investments that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel are starting to pay off. When you talk about USIS, we mentioned many times even over the last year, on each of these quarterly calls that we feel a real strength in the marketplace by our USIS team competitively. Commercially, how they're going to market, I think, we've talked about we've rebuilt that team a year ago and there's some room momentum there. And again, the focus on new products, those are driving revenue growth and we guided up 100 basis points in our vitality index. The bulk of that is going to come in our non-mortgage business.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, got it. And Mark, I was hoping you could just help us also, just appreciate the different moving pieces in the -- I think you talked about Workforce Solutions growing about 20% this year, but there's obviously a lot of moving pieces between Employer and Verification Services. I was just hoping you could give us some guidance there on how they should end up in the year.\nMark Begor: You want to try that one, John?\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So -- yes, I think in Mark's script, we tried to walk through what the real big drivers, right? Verifier is continuing to perform extremely well. Obviously, mortgage is a bit of a draw -- a drag. But as you go through the rest of this year, if you think about what we said in February, we'd indicated that for total mortgage for Equifax, that even though the market was down 5%, we expected revenue to grow more than 10%. And even though we now have the market weaker at down 8%, we still expect mortgage revenue to grow more than 10%. But some significant drivers of EWS in 2021 continue to be in the non-mortgage segment. We talked about talent solutions growing very, very fast, almost doubling, I think we said in the first quarter and I-9 also growing very, very fast and a recovery in WFA. So what we think you're going to see is very nice growth across the non-mortgage segments, obviously, excluding UC, where we gave very specific guidance. And then also continued good performance in mortgage despite the fact that the market is slowing, right? We're not going to quantify each of those. But directionally, that's what's going on.\nManav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. The next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKyle Peterson: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I just wanted to touch on EWS, particularly the momentum and increased adoption you guys are seeing in some of the non-mortgage. Could you guys dive a little more into where the strongest areas s that \u2013 is that in other lending products like auto or card or where is some of the strength that you guys are seeing coming from right now?\nMark Begor: Yes. Non-mortgage is obviously more than financial services. I'll come back to that, but we've talked a bunch about our government vertical, which is growing quite positively. Our Employer Services is non-mortgage. Our talent solutions business, so we talked about the growth there. And I think specifically, you're talking about non-mortgage verification. So, I'll go back to that versus non-mortgage broadly in workforce because we've got a bunch of levers that are outside of verification that are growing quite positively, again, excluding the negative impact of UC Claims on a year-over-year basis. So in financial services, as you know, mortgage is our largest in verification, for sure and we're getting real leverage and outgrowing the market there. So first, records health everywhere, right? So, in -- whatever the solution is, as we grow our records and, of course, they're up 10% year-over-year and we've got a clear path to increase them in 2021, and that's part of our framework. Those hit rates are good in any vertical you're in, whether it's mortgage or auto or government, et cetera. So records are number one. We\u2019ve had a real focus on new products broadly in Equifax and in Workforce Solutions. And then you talk about some of the verticals, we're seeing increased usage in auto, where -- kind of year ago or two years ago, it was more of a subprime usage along with the credit file. Now we're seeing it more in near prime. So there's just more usage in the auto sector and broader usage at those lower credit scores. So that's helping there. Personal loans has always been a pretty strong space for us in the Fintech market for verification, using it because if you think about a personal loan, it's $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, it's a very large transaction. And verifying how much someone makes and are they employed at the time of the loan is a very important lift in the predictability. And then we've talked really for the last, I think, three or four quarters about the fact that we're seeing a number of card issuers take our data and, of course, a sliver of our data. We don't \u2013 given the depth of data that they would have in a mortgage application and using it in originations, in other applications in the card space. And we've got now, I believe, two of the large card issuers that are using our data ad origination, along with the credit file, which is a big breakthrough. We've been chasing this market for some time. I'm an old card originator. I did that for a decade before Equifax. The predictability of adding is someone working and how much do they make to the credit file enhances every credit decision period. And it was really around getting our database to scale. And we've talked the last couple of quarters that as we've gone over 50% hit rates in the database, as we get to that 90 million uniques versus the $155 million non-farm payroll, it becomes a data set that's more usable because you get more hit rates. So, that's another thing that we -- reason we think we're getting more new uses of it in things like that cards.\nJohn Gamble: The only thing I'd add, right, and as Mark said, our two biggest segments in verifier are government and talent solutions, and they're growing very fast. And both of those are highly benefited by the depth of the database by the fact that we have over 450 million total records. Being able to pry history in those market segments is very important. So, we're seeing very strong growth in the two biggest non-mortgage verifier segments of both government and talent solutions.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's really helpful color. And then I guess just a quick follow-up on the verification side of the business, like increased noise in the last few months with TransUnion and Plaid, both making some splashes in that space. Have you guys noticed any change in competition when you guys go-to-market either with users of the verification services or potential employers, payroll providers, et cetera?\nMark Begor: We have not. We actually hear mostly about it from you, meaning the sell-side. And we talked many times that we think we have a strong franchise. The scale of our database is extremely large. I think of the 90 million uniques at 115 million actives, the ability to get those kind of records is quite challenging, we believe, meaning to have a database that's usable. And having a database that has 1 million or 2 million or 3 million or 10 million records, it's just very challenging for -- to take that to market. When we can deliver over 50% hit rates, it just is quite challenging. And I think you know, 60% of our records come from individual companies and we get those records through long-term relationships. We've been doing this for a decade. We have a full suite of services. We provide HR managers that allow us access to those records and we provide that service, the income employment piece of that for free to the company and to their employees, and it's a real benefit to them. So, those kind of services are really required, we think, to have a database of our scale. And as we've talked, the other 35% or so of our database comes from payroll partnerships and the bulk of those are exclusive, meaning we're an exclusive arrangement, they're not going to provide those records to someone else. So, we think that's quite challenging. And you add on top of that, that we've been investing in this business for over a decade. We've put about $2 billion into it, including a couple of acquisitions just in the last 30 days to strengthen Workforce Solutions. In the last two or three years, we probably invested $200 million to $300 million in the technology of the business. This is -- requires a massive investment. And I'm not sure the competitor you reference is thinking about or planning to have the kind of investments that we have. And just to be clear, we intend to protect and grow our franchise.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful color. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.\nMark Begor: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. My question is just on the fraud and ID business. You had mentioned e-commerce, maybe retail as new verticals with the Kount deal. And at the same time, you talked about scale. Could you maybe talk about whether the fraud and ID business is at scale today? How do you define scale? And just as part of that discussion, you've seen companies like Mastercard recently buy Ekata. Mitek is doing some stuff around ID. Is there a lot more M&A opportunity in this market? Or how do you think about sort of when this business scales or if it's at scale today?\nMark Begor: Yes. It's a great question. It's one that's been a deliberate focus of ours. You've heard us talk about it for the last couple of years that it's a fast-growing space, the ID and broad space globally is, I don't know, $18 billion, something like that, growing at 20%. You've seen -- we've had growth there. We've been in it for a long time. We have a lot of existing differentiated data assets at Equifax around ID and fraud and the Kount acquisition was quite strategic for us. They have real scale. And I think as a reminder, they play in the retail e-commerce space. Have real scale around their interactions. I think it's 32 billion consumer interactions per year. They've got 400 million unique e-mail addresses verified. They've got cellphone addresses are verified, IP addresses. So just a wealth of data. And the power is really combining their data with ours. And that's really why we acquired Kount. And as you point out, it also brings us into a new vertical. We weren't in the retail e-commerce space and that's where Kount plays. And, of course, we're going to bring Kount and their data into financial services, banking, telco, insurance, where we play. So that's why we acquired Kount. The answer is yes. You heard me comment earlier this morning on the call that, when we think about new M&A or additional M&A, ID and fraud is a place that we want to continue playing in. We see opportunities. We have opportunities in our pipeline to continue to strengthen the combination of Equifax and Kount going forward. And then when you -- your question of scale, from our perspective, the combination of Equifax and Kount gets us into kind of a strong market position, but it's a huge market at $18 billion. So, there's a lot of room to grow and we look at product introductions. We're investing in like our new Luminate platform, gets us more capabilities organically in this marketplace. And as I mentioned earlier, we're rolling that out. And then acquisitions like Kount really strengthen our data assets and the combination of Equifax and Kount is quite powerful. So, you should look for us over the coming years to find ways to grow. Certainly, we're going to invest organically, but also to invest through M&A to strengthen this. We like the space and we want to be bigger in it.\nHamzah Mazari: Gotcha. And my second question, I've asked this before a couple of quarters ago, but I think I'm going to ask it a bit differently. So, if we exclude Workforce Solutions and we just look at USIS and the margin differential just between USIS and international, it's pretty large. And then if you look at your international margin and you compare it to your competitors, there's also a big gap. And so I realize that -- so we're taking Workforce Solutions out of the mix. And so then maybe there's some mix differentials between USIS and international. And I realize international has to get the revenue where you get the incremental margin and the op leverage, and that's maybe in earlier innings. But could you -- how much of the gap can you close between international and USIS and how much of the gap is structural? And we're excluding Workforce Solutions here.\nMark Begor: And again, we don't exclude Workforce Solutions, but we'll just do that for your discussion and really focus on those other businesses. Obviously, USIS has real scale, and that scale drives their margins. And that's clearly a big difference when you think about our international. International, we're in 25 countries. We have some larger businesses like Australia, that's over $300 million and then some smaller countries that we play in. So, that drives a difference in the margins between our USIS, which has really massive scale versus our international businesses. We're always focused on improving our margins. The cloud investments that we're making will benefit Workforce Solutions margins, USIS margins and international and GCS margins. That's part of our strategy to improve our cost structure. But there's no question the subscale nature of some of our international markets result in margins being lower, which I would characterize as structural, but we see opportunities to improve those margins going forward. Would you add anything, John?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. As you look at the countries we're in, the countries that are looking more like USIS, where they're more specifically, like, for example, Canada, margins are much better, right? And so as Mark said, it really depends on the size of the market and then the diversity of the market that we're playing in. And then -- and so we certainly expect to see improvements in margins as we go to the cloud. But some of it certainly is structural just by the fact that we're in so many markets, and some of those businesses are very small. So, not to get into specific numbers, we do expect to see improvements in those margins over time. But some of it is structural. We have no expectation that they're going to reach the type of margins we see with USIS.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. I wanted to hear about the different areas of U.S. credit applications, meaning card and auto and personal loan with the large pickup in non-mortgage USIS online revenues accelerating to 16% in the first quarter, in particular, I don't think we've heard the credit card issuers talk about loan growth picking up yet, and I just wanted to know if you anticipate that soon?\nMark Begor: I think we said, Andrew, that it was fairly broad-based. And some of the marketing spend is card issuers starting to, I would characterize, restart originations but that's the marketing piece. That doesn't necessarily result in loan growth yet. I think that's the -- starting to spend money and starting to put new offers out in the marketplace that presumably would result in some loan growth either in second or third quarter, but there's a lag on that between the marketing spend and when those originations go on their books and become loans. Broadly, I would say, what we hear from the U.S. customers is an element of confidence that wasn't in place certainly for most of 2020, certainly, the early parts of 2021. And I think as we've all seen vaccine rollouts in the United States really accelerate and now really, everyone over age 16 can get one, that's resulting in consumer confidence as we seen it in retail spending. And that you've seen banks in their earnings releasing reserves, so I think there's an element of confidence of we're moving towards a more normal economy. I would say, we're not there yet, but we saw some real increases what I would call in confidence and it's in our numbers in March and as we moved into April.\nAndrew Steinerman: And auto was strong?\nMark Begor: So auto was stronger than card, right? So if you just kind of tier our structure, auto was stronger than card and identity and fraud was also very strong.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Yes, hi. Thank you. I wanted to focus on costs, if I could, please. Can you give us a sense what your hiring plans are this year in terms of full-time equivalent employees? Are you thinking your plans should maybe pick up hire than other say, 5% more employees in the U.S.? That's my first question. Another related question to that is, as we move through this virus things, hopefully get better, your employees will return to the offices and stuff in the U.S., should we expect your cost base to materially go up when that happens?\nMark Begor: Yes. First off, Craig, welcome. I think this is your first Equifax call or at least in recent times. So, it's great to have you covering the company.\nCraig Huber: Yes. Thank you.\nMark Begor: On the people side, I would say our employment will be fairly stable. There's some areas where we're investing, like in product resources, in some technology areas. But at the same time, I think you know, we've got plans to reduce some of our technology costs as the cloud transformation unfolds. So, there'll be some reductions in that area, which is in our framework. So, I wouldn't think about big changes in our employment. But you should think about Equifax being on offense, meaning we're investing with our strong performance. And, of course, our acquisitions that we talked about, the five acquisitions bring incremental employees into our headcount, which is in our framework that we've shared with you. With regards to the return to office, we've been open since last June. We've been very careful about that. It's been really up to our team, if they want to come in. We've limited our occupancy to 50%, no more than 50%, and of course, exercising all those protocols. And we've seen in the last -- I don't know, 30 to 60 days as vaccine rollouts have increased, an increase of people coming back to our office. And what we've been telling our employees, when you're vaccinated come back and start operating with Equifax. We also announced post whatever our full reopening is, which is hard to see what that date is. We're going to -- we introduced what we call an Equifax Flex Day, where we're going to have some flexibility in our workforce that they can pick on one day per week with their managers approval to work remotely. And it was really a reflection on that there are many benefits that we learned over the last year that we can be productive from working from home, but so-called 4/1, meaning we're going to work from the office at least four days per week is a reflection that we're a collaborative culture, the teamwork is how we operate, whether it's doing NPIs or technology or new customer solutions, we think that happens best in the office. And to your question about we don't expect our cost to go up. We haven't changed our footprints. We don't expect them to go down as a result of this return to office.\nJohn Gamble: And just as you think about our cost structure, just for perspective, right, we're like most technology companies, obviously, a significant portion of our cost structure is our own employees. We also have a very significant footprint of contract employees and contractors, right? So, we end up -- we move cost, but obviously, the contractor workforce is more variable to us.\nCraig Huber: And then also if I could ask guys, in the U.S., where do you think the biggest opportunity is to be able to raise price steady as each year goes on to - in the U.S. operations?\nMark Begor: Yes, we don't talk a lot about price, but if you think about our U.S. businesses, which is really - I'll leave our consumer business aside GCS, but you think about USIS and Workforce Solutions. We focus on new product rollouts that become incremental margin and many times at a higher price point because they're delivering incremental value to the customer. So, that's one way to get revenue pricing margins. Workflow Solutions is clearly our most differentiated business and differentiated data asset and has more ability to bring more value to our customers that we can monetize with different price points of the solutions we're delivering. And if you think about it, if you look at our hit rates now that are over 50%, and you go back two years ago when they were, I don't know, pick the right number, 40%, 50%-plus hit rate is more valuable to our customers, becomes a data asset that they can use more broadly in their solutions. So, Workforce is clearly a business that has more ability to drive its top line through multiple levers that we've talked about a couple of times on this call.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much. Just wanted to ask a bit of a different question on the guide. My interpretation is that it seems like the vast majority of the increase is from the 1Q beat. And then the rest I'm expecting is maybe a better 2Q with 2H in line with your expectations previously. Is that a fair assessment? And I know your mortgage expectations are a little bit lower than before in the rest of the year. It just seems like a lot of your non-mortgage trends are positive. So, I'm just hoping you could provide any extra color on how you're thinking about whether these positive trends continue through the year or not? Thank you. \nMark Begor: Yes, I think, Toni, you got to remember, we have seen in the last 60 days, a weakening -- slight weakening of mortgage inquiries, which we rolled into our new framework. So, we took down mortgage by 300 basis points for the year, which we think is prudent, offsetting that and our ability to guide up is that our outsized and strong performance in non-mortgage in the quarter, and our expectation is that will continue. John?\nJohn Gamble: Well, if you're looking at revenue, Toni, right, I mean, the over $200 million increase, right, only less than half of it was really out of the first quarter. And then obviously, yes, the second quarter is stronger. And then the third -- as Mark said, third and fourth quarter are impacted somewhat by the much greater decline in the mortgage market. But we are seeing very substantial growth, and we think improvement in the non-mortgage segments. And as you look at revenue, we think a significant amount of the improvement in the guide is from periods after the first quarter.\nToni Kaplan: Okay. And then looking at financial marketing, you mentioned the 20% marketing-related growth. Just curious about why there's -- why marketing dollars are being spent there, but within the consumer indirect business you're still seeing pressure. Just wondering what the disconnect is between that and when you expect the indirect business and consumer to show signs of recovery?\nMark Begor: Yes. Toni, I think about it quite naturally. What we saw and what I would have done when I was running GE Capital's credit card business is when you get in a tough economy, you tighten up originations and stop spending marketing money. In the first place you stop spending marketing money is with third parties, meaning lead gen companies. Same thing when you come out of a difficult environment, the first place you'll start is your own, you have more confidence in that. It's generally lower cost. It's more efficient desire predictability, and that's what we're seeing. And we do expect our indirect to improve, but it's going to be lag some at least the framework we put together and happened later in the year.\nToni Kaplan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And then we'll take the next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. You\u2019ve touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could walk through the i2Verify acquisition a bit further. How should we think about it contributing to the TWN database in terms of record count? And then relatedly, can you give us a sense for how many other assets like this are out there that could add records to the database in a meaningful way? Certainly, it seems like these types of deals come with some pretty immediate revenue synergies. So, any additional detail on that opportunity set would be helpful?\nMark Begor: Yes. There aren't many of them. We know who all of it \u2013 they all are, and we talk to them all the time. There are a handful of companies like i2Verify and HIREtech. And as you may know, you've followed us for a while that we've made acquisitions like this over the last couple, three, four, five years. So, when they're available, we like to make them. And maybe I'll just touch on HIREtech first. HIREtech has what we thought was a very attractive WOTC Solution, particularly delivered through third parties to companies. And again, one of the ways to get records is to deliver value-added services like WOTC, like I-9, like Unemployment Claims like W-2 Management, like ACA to companies. And then in order to complete those services for them, which are regulatory requirements, you get access to records. And in HIREtech's case, we have a WOTC business so today, and - but there was -- we thought very attractive and how they deliver those solutions through partners. And we'd like to grow our partner WOTC business, which not only will bring the records they already have, but get access to records in the future. And, of course, there's a revenue stream just from providing those WOTC services. As John mentioned, they also have an Economic Recovery Credit, ERC, which is a very special and unique credit in 2021 that there's another way to gain access to records, which will benefit us this year. In i2Verify, a bit different in their approach to market. They have a very attractive. We like the team a lot. As we do in HIREtech, the i2Verify team was very advanced around relationships and how they went to market with non-profit organizations, with the healthcare industry or hospitals -- and hospitals and the education or think universities. And there's lots of employees in those kinds of organizations and companies, and they developed a very attractive go-to-market of how they built relationships and delivered those services. And so we like that, which is why we were very attracted to i2Verify, and we're looking for them to really expand our relationships through different services we provide to those kind of companies and then allow us to get records in order to grow our records. And again, at 90 million uniques, we're very pleased with the scale of our database, but there's a lot of runway between 90 million and 155 million.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Makes sense. That's all very helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, you've mentioned 100 basis point improvement in your vitality index expectation a couple of times. I imagine that's primarily a consequence of faster than expected adoption on the new product side. So, I was just kind of hoping you could talk about what's driving that specifically through the first couple of months of the year? And then relatedly, what do you think that pickup in adoption means as you think about the vitality index in 2022 and beyond? And how NPIs are expected to contribute over a longer-term timeframe? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. I think you know, we've been pretty clear that we've been talking for well over a year, maybe two years about the power of NPI, and that's not new to Equifax. It's not new to our industry. Our competitors are focused on new products. And it really is the fuel for growth that allows us to grow multiples of GDP. That's the inherent in the data analytics business. And we talked a bunch about our investment in the cloud transformation over the last three years from 2018 through 2020, the $1.5 billion we invested in our new infrastructure, we did that for lots of reasons. Sorry, we get the fire.\nOperator: Please stand by. [Operator Instructions]\nMark Begor: Sorry, we're back. We had a fire alarm go off here, and we just got to shut it off. We're fine. Andrew, sorry, could you repeat your question again?\nAndrew Nicholas: No problem. I can't -- not surprised if that would throw anyone off. Yes. My question was just on the vitality index and how you might look at 2022 and beyond on that metric given the faster than expected adoption so far this year?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think I was talking about the cloud investment. We invested in the cloud because we knew it was going to give us cost benefits, security, a competitive advantage, but we really invested in the cloud to deliver new products and growth. And we've been really focused on that over the last 12, 18 months. We talked last year that we've been expanding our resources in new product capabilities. And we think we're starting to see the leverage of the cloud, our ability to bring new solutions to the marketplace. And our guide up was really \u2013 we increased our NPI rollouts last year to 139, which was a record. We're at 39 in the first quarter, which is up from 35. So, we've got more products in the marketplace. And you've got a commercial team that's out there selling them. So that's why we feel the confidence of increasing the guidance going forward, at least, for 2021. I don't want to get into 2022 guidance. We'll include that in our long-term framework, which we intend to put in place later this year, and the vitality index of new products will be central and really important to us in how we grow the business going forward.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nAdam Parrington: All right. Adam on for Shlomo. Can you talk a little bit more about the unemployment claims strength? Is it from better industry volumes than expected, or does it have more to do with more product sales or more clients? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yes. We've been taking advantage of what's a strong unemployment claims market over the last year and looking for new customer relationships, the teams out there still selling and growing our space. And I think we mentioned we've grown our share slightly to -- we believe, 1-in-3 claims we process versus 1-in-5 maybe in 2020. So, it's just another area of growth we're focused on. And as we also guided, we clearly expect our revenue in 2021 to come down kind of sequentially in the second, third and fourth quarter. But this is a business that is important to Workforce Solutions, processing unemployment claims for companies. It gives us a very nice revenue source long-term. We generally sell these on a subscription basis with limits, if you go over a certain number of claims processed, which is why we've had such strong incremental revenue in the high unemployment market in the last couple of years. But we have a very sophisticated solution that operates well in the marketplace. And remember, the second benefit in processing these claims and having this as a business is it gets us access to records that then we can monetize over in our TWN database in our verification business.\nAdam Parrington: Thanks.\nOperator: All right. And your next question is from George Mihalos with Cowen.\nGeorge Mihalos: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the outlook. I wanted to start off on mortgage. Again, if we look at verification revenues up another 100%, that's well higher than what you saw in the USIS revenue growth. And as a matter of fact, the growth in EWS has stayed kind of consistent at 100% even if when sort of USIS volumes in mortgage have come down. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that decoupling? Is it as simple, a strong record growth? Or is there something else that's allowing you to outperform that massively even when volumes come down a bit on the USIS side?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think if you -- we've shown these charts before that Workforce Solutions have been consistently outperforming all markets that they operate in, including the mortgage market. And much more substantially than USIS. They just have more levers. So, they'll use the same levers that USIS use, which is price. So, if you increase price in an up or down market, you're going to have more revenue. New products is one where they just had more opportunities. And you've heard us talk over the last I don't know, four or five quarters about their increased focus on new products. Things like historically, we've had a single report that we'd offer, and now we're offering one with more history on it, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. And instead of having a report that we sell at $25, we've got price points at $150 and $200, and that provides real value to the mortgage originator. And we rolled out a product that's for co-borrowers. A lot of mortgages in the states that have a dual career couple underwritten -- underwriting the mortgage and so we have a new solution there. Instead of having $225 reports polled, we've got a $200 solution. We've got solutions and new products now that encourage more polls. So, we'll have a solution where we sell it at a higher price point that includes multiple polls. So, new products is a real lever for Workforce Solutions. Of course, records we've talked multiple times in this call, adding records drive set rates. Because remember, we're getting inquiries on those mortgages, all those credit cards or auto loans, but your question was around mortgage. We're getting inquiries for the full database, the full set of consumers. And I say, we only have 90 million uniques. And as we grow that database, those hit rates go up automatically. So, records are a very central part of Workforce Solutions' ability to outgrow the mortgage and all their underlying markets. There's also a large portion of mortgages we don't see still. We only see, I think it's 65% of mortgages. So, we're out in the marketplace talking to those that are not doing business with Equifax and are using pay stubs or some other mechanism for approving the income and employment elements of a mortgage application to use our solution. The move from a customer, we saw a lot of our customers, I think, over one-third that access our data through the web. Meaning they're actually keying in the mortgage applicants social security number, date of birth, name, et cetera. There's a lot of friction there, meaning it doesn't happen in every mortgage application for that originator or we don't get multiple polls. So, going to system-to-system integrations is a big part of our strategy, and we're increasing those system integrations every quarter. We've got a dedicated team that works with mortgage originators to have them do system-to-system integrations. Another lever is the number of polls in a mortgage application. In a credit application -- on the credit side, there's four to five polls in many mortgage applications of the credit file. Historically, there was more like one to two in the income employment data. We're seeing the more sophisticated originators pull our data more often on every mortgage application. And remember, you think about a couple of elements. Number one, it's a big ticket transaction, $250,000, $300,000, $400,000 or more is the loan. And then second is the mortgage originator that's spending $4,000, $5,000 in the application process, they want to make sure that they're spending time on an applicant that they can close on. So, not only verifying their credit multiple times in the process, but making sure that applicant is still working and how much they make as a part of the application process is another big opportunity. So, there's just a half dozen of very strong levers that all have dedicated teams on it, and they've been executing very strongly on those levers. Another kind of overriding macro, if you will, for Workforce Solutions is just really the scale of the database. Now, if you go back at our last economic crisis in 2008, 2009 or pick your year, go back three, four, five years ago, our database in TWN might have been having hit rates of 30% or 40%. Now that we're well over 50%, it becomes a very valuable data asset and all of our customers know that you enhance the credit decisioning of an applicant, if you add is someone working and how much do they make to their credit file. That drives predictability. And so, when you have a database that almost is at a catalyst or an inflection point of going over 50%, we think that's another positive factor. Of course, we've got a lot of opportunity and a lot of work to do in workforce. And we're quite optimistic about the long-term impact of our fastest-growing business with margins and revenue growth rates that are highly accretive to Equifax.\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay. That's super comprehensive. So really appreciate that. And just really quickly, Mark, maybe going back to Andrew's question, on the FMS side, the increase that you're seeing in marketing for card solicitations and the like. Is it too early to know, if the success rate or the hit rate for the banks are in line with what they saw historically as they rolled out those programs?\nMark Begor: Yes. We wouldn't have visibility to that. But what -- I'll tell you what we do find is that all of our finance \u2013 this is a macro that started before COVID is that all applications, all uses of data, whether it's in banking, credit cards, mortgage, auto, lending, telco, all of our customers want to use more data. And they want to use more differentiated and alternative data because it enhances the predictability of the decision they're making. And let's use originations. And that's why you're seeing more alternative data being used. We think our cloud transformation is going to differentiate us and the ability to house that data to \u2013 and as well as surface and deliver that data to our customers. And then, of course, TWN, we talked earlier in this conversation in the call this morning about the power of that data set in that credit decisioning, meaning, is someone working, how much are they making added to the credit file and the other alternative data is very, very powerful.\nGeorge Mihalos: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wondered if -- first off, so apologies, I was actually dropped off on my Internet connection during this call. And I was wondering if you could just refresh me on the growth targets for 2021 for the segments that you laid out, please?\nMark Begor: Sure, Simon. We had a dropped off, too. We had a fire alarm go off, but there was not a fire. So we were off for a few minutes, too. Do you want to go a little bit on it? It\u2019s just the growth rates by segment that we raised earlier. Yes. Okay, sure.\nJohn Gamble: Yes, yes, because that used us in...\nMark Begor: So we indicated that we expected Workforce Solutions to be up over 20%. We indicated we expected USIS to be up mid to high single digits. We indicated we expected international to be up constant currency high single digits and that we expected GCS to be down mid-single digits and also expected GCS to be down mid-single digits in the second quarter.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. Great. So, I was wondering, if I could follow-on on that, just on the international business then. I mean, this is -- obviously, with what happened through the pandemic because the comparisons are incredibly easy. And given sort of where we're expecting the framework you provided for a recovery out of the pandemic at the back end of this year. I'm curious as to sort of how sensitive do you think about that sort of high single-digit number is? Because it seems to me it should be fairly easy in some ways to drive significantly higher growth for this -- for the international segment. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color around that.\nMark Begor: Yes, I would say, Simon, we're counting on a recovery of the international markets, but I think there's still a pretty decent amount of uncertainty in those markets. And you follow it, too, but Canada's vaccine rollout is really slow. And they've got lockdowns back in place in other markets. Australia's vaccine rollout is like really slow, like, not happening. I'm not sure when they're going to get a vaccine rollout. So, there when kind of locked down, there's still pressure on that economy. UK, they've got the vaccines out there, but they've still got high COVID cases. So, we've got lockdowns in the UK. With some other markets, a big market for us like Chile, they used, I think, the Chinese vaccine that turns out to be not effective. So, it rolled out. So, they've got lockdowns in place. So, I think the -- we expect them to recover. We expect the vaccines to get in place during 2021, but I think there's still some uncertainty there. And in our framework, we do -- we are counting on and expect to see some improvement. And you saw in our numbers, we've got some markets that are adapting to COVID, like the U.S. did. I think some of the international markets took longer to adapt, meaning the U.S. in some markets like auto and others in second and third quarter last year figured out how to sell cars virtually and other things. That happened more slowly from our perspective in international markets, but you're starting to see that. Canada had a very strong quarter for us in the first quarter. Australia did too, even notwithstanding these COVID lockdowns. So, we expect international to improve, but I'd say that we're watching it because there's still some uncertainty there.\nJohn Gamble: And remember, our fourth quarter of 2020 in international was okay. We grew in the fourth quarter of 2020, right? So\u2026\nSimon Clinch: Yes.\nJohn Gamble: Yes.\nSimon Clinch: Of course. Okay. I was wondering if I could just have a quick follow-up as well. And maybe just one more for you, John. Just when I think about the push and pull for the USIS margins going forward, because I know you don't break out the tech transition costs by quarter, but when I think about the underlying incremental margins of this business. I mean, could you give me a little color how to think about that? And then layer on top, the potential dilution from acquisitions to margins and how we should think about that beyond once we move beyond that sort of the year post those deals?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So we did give some perspective, right, on USIS this quarter. We indicated kind of the negative movement in their margins was up two-thirds driven by tech transformation, so to give you some perspective. And what we said is over the longer-term, we expect to see improvements in margins, driven by the fact that we're going to drive substantial cost benefits related to the tech transformation. But we wouldn't start to see those benefits occur until late 2021 and then really kicking in, in earnest in 2022. So, as we think about the movement in margins, the drivers of the margin, obviously, will be as tech transformation spend start to decline as you move through 2021 and into 2022, really moving into 2022. And then as we start to get savings related to those decommissionings that will occur as tech transformation completes, and that doesn't really start to have a net savings of decommissioning more than cloud costs until very late in 2021 and then obviously accelerating in 2022.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. And so incremental costs from acquisitions that you've already made are really going to be minimal?\nJohn Gamble: So, we expect acquisitions we make to move to USIS-type margins over a reasonable period of time, right? So, certainly not in the first year. But then as we move into year two and certainly year three, we expect them to deliver margins like the rest of the business.\nMark Begor: And the acquisitions are all accretive to generally, our revenue growth rates in each of the businesses. For example, Kount, we're really excited about the space they play in and their historical growth and the opportunities with the synergies between USIS and Kount on both the top line and some of the cost synergies.\nSimon Clinch: Yes. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hey, good morning. Appreciate taking the question. I know it's been kind of a long call. Just very high level, Mark. What I'd like to try to understand, if you can help is, just simplistically, how much do you think of your non-mortgage strength, in particular, is being driven by a snapback in share gain? Obviously, there was a period of time over the last few years where Equifax was focused internally. And you\u2019ve clearly ridden the ship and accelerated NPI and are making what is apparently a very effective cloud transition. Are we seeing normalization in share? How much of that is playing a role in this growth, non-mortgage and mortgage in that matter, just broadly?\nMark Begor: Yeah. I think we tried to be clear and we used this phrase last year for -- I think all four quarters last year that we feel like based on the wins, the USIS and Sid Singh and his team are landing in the U.S. marketplace in USIS space that we're competitive and we're winning in the marketplace. We've talked about the deal pipeline. We shared some metrics earlier in the call that it's up 30%. And so, what are the factors there? There's no question, we were pressured in 2018 and 2019 after the cyber event competitively. We were in the penalty box with a lot of customers. It took us a while to get out of them, meaning through the end of 2019. In 2020, we were on, what I would characterize in the first quarter, kind of, a normal competitive footing and then COVID hit, which created some visibility challenges, perhaps for you. But in that time frame, we kept a consistent dialogue with you that USIS was winning and was competitive in the marketplace. So you've got the commercial -- the post cyber event is clearly behind us. We're on our strong footing commercially. We think we're advantaged commercially with the cloud transformation. When you think about it, it's actually quite logical. If you're a commercial leader and you're out talking to one of your customers and say, hey, Equifax just invested $1.5 billion in our technology to support you. That creates a very positive dialogue. And then you add to it Equifax's differentiated data assets that we have, data assets, our competitors don't, which we think helps us commercially. And you can lead with TWN, obviously, which, as you know, USIS sells in the marketplace for us is one commercial team. They sell TWN to all our financial customers. And then add to it, NCTUE, IXI, DataX. So we think that\u2019s advantaging us. The leveraging of the cloud for new products is clearly taking hold. USIS is -- the rest of the business rolling out these new cloud-based products that we think are giving us an ability to bring new solutions to drive incremental revenue with our customers in the mortgage and non-mortgage space, which is quite positive. So we think there's a lot of momentum. There\u2019s still more to do. But the team is really focused. I think the last point I'd raise is that, we brought in no longer, a new leader, two years ago, Sid Singh, but he used 2019 to rebuild the business and the team and continue that in 2020, they're hitting on their strides. We relever the team. We've got a new Chief Revenue Officer. We've got Sid, who's a very commercially oriented leader. I think that's benefiting USIS also in how they're operating in the marketplace.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe for John, just quickly. Any kind of unusual timing items we should be thinking about, John? I mean, just it seems like EWS mortgage is holding up really well as the mortgage market kind of weaken. Is there any sort of timing vis-\u00e0-vis your growth versus the market as a whole?\nJohn Gamble: The time you would be aware of, which I'm sure you're aware of because it happens every year, right, in EWS and Employer Services. The Employer Services revenue was strongest in the first quarter substantially because several of the services they provide, think W-2, think workforce analytics are directly related to tax filings. And since that's the case, their revenue is much higher in those segments in the first quarter. And during that period, obviously, the margins are very strong in those businesses. So you see stronger margin in Workforce Solutions. And it also obviously benefits Equifax in the first quarter. And generally, there's a negative trend sequentially going into the second quarter for that reason. The other thing that just timing related, related to Equifax is our annual salary increases, our merit increases are generally pretty much uniformly at April 1st. So, you tend to see a cost increase occur in the company in the second quarter, okay? And that brings margins down, okay? So those are two things that are just timing-related. But other than that, no, I think we're just what we're seeing in EWS and really across the business is just good execution.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your guidance for 2021 core revenue growth was upwardly revised from 10.5% previously to 16% at the midpoint. Approximately how much of the increase in core revenue growth the estimate is coming from non-mortgage compared to outperformance within the mortgage market?\nMark Begor: Remember, we took our mortgage guidance down, so you should think about that. That clearly is a negative impact on that. And the whole offset is from nonmortgage is why we're raising it. John?\nJohn Gamble: Yeah. So George, we've said pretty consistently, right, that as we move through 2021, you're going to see an increasing contribution to core revenue growth from non-mortgage relative to mortgage. Obviously, in the first quarter, we saw really good outperformance relative to the mortgage market across EWS as well as USIS, and we indicated I think in an earlier answer to a question that even though the mortgage market is going to be weaker by 3 points in the year, we'll still grow faster than 10%, right? So we're going to see better performance, better outperformance relative to the market than we had previously guided. So there is some benefit to core revenue growth from better outperformance in the mortgage market. But, obviously, also you're seeing a substantial contribution now that's starting to occur as you move through 2021 from the non-mortgage market.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. And then secondly, Equifax hasn't yet reinstated its long-term financial framework. What do you need to see in the business before you feel comfortable reinstating long-term target?\nMark Begor: Yeah, George, we talked to you before and I was clear earlier in the discussion this morning that we're intending to put that in place in 2021. We said in February and kind of same comment to you now is that we wanted to see a few more quarters -- a few more months perhaps of the COVID recovery. Things are still -- volatile is the wrong word, but still evolving. The mortgage market from just, I don't know, less than 90 days ago is - has softened. And, of course, the COVID recovery, I would say, is stronger than we anticipated in the last 60 days in the non-mortgage side. So, we want to see a few more months of that, but we know what we want to do. We're ready to do it. We've given, hopefully, you a lot of indications of how that's going to be framed. And it's our intention to put that in place in concert with likely an Investor Day. In \u2013 before the end of the year in 2021.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. So my question is on Slide 9 and the middle chart, EWS core mortgage growth. So, it was 99%. And I think you have 9% records growth. So it's a 90% core ex records growth, mortgage growth and verification services. If I look back to 2020, it also had this massive step up, 80%, maybe high 60s or 70x records growth. It used to be in this -- I guess, 11% to 21% range and probably half or more than half of that was record. So there's a much bigger contribution starting in 2020 from those ex records factors. And Mark, you repeated several times, all of the factors that go into that. So, I don't need you to repeat that. But what is so different about 2020 and going into 2021 in terms of -- like, I don't know if it's the inflection, if it's the tech transformation, like if it's a specific factor, just what's so different about 2020 and 2021 in that regard?\nMark Begor: I think there's a couple of things there, Jeff. And we've said to you and others repeatedly, there is a degree of inflection point. When you're north of 50% kind of hit rates, we think it becomes a more valuable asset in so many other cases. And I'll just use my example, 10 years ago, when I was at GE Capital, we didn't use the data asset because the hit rates were, I don't know, 25%. It just didn't make sense to put it in your workflows when you can only hit 1-and-4 customers. Now that you're over 50, we believe there's an element of inflection there. We also believe that cloud transformation is a big deal. And that's across Equifax, but workforce is benefiting from that. For example, ingesting the amount of records, but even more complex is ingesting the amount of employers that we now have in the data set. If you go back 18 months ago, we may have had 150,000 employers or 200,000, something like that. And now we're well over 1 million companies contributing a data set. We couldn't have done that without the cloud. And remember, when we get those data records, they're generally in different formats, and your cloud capabilities allow you to normalize those and then put them in a format that you can bring them to your customers. And then I won't go through all of the other levers that workforce has. But you know, they're pretty wide and broad. And with the scale of the business, meaning the infrastructure we have, the people, we have the resources to invest in really dedicated teams. And I don't mean to repeat this, but we have a dedicated team focused on records, period. That's hard to do. And this is a multi-person team. We have a dedicated team focused on working with our mortgage customers on system-to-system integrations. That's all they do on the benefits. We have another team that's focused on convincing the mortgage originators that aren't doing business to go forward with us. The scale of our business almost becomes a flywheel that allows us to invest in the business. So, I think there's all those, just going back up, what are the bigger macros. It's -- I would say, the inflection point of being north of 50 and the cloud transformation taking hold. And if you followed us for a long time, you know that on a new product front, you didn't hear a lot out of Workforce Solutions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 around new products. Now, with the cloud, we can really take advantage of this data asset. And you know the power of coming up with a new way to monetize a data asset that you've already paid for, meaning the dual borrower mortgage solution; the mortgage solution that allows a mortgage originator to have multiple pools. The mortgage solution that has 36 months of history in it at a higher price point. Those are all opportunities that we've started to deploy in 2020 when we had the EFX Cloud really taking hold inside of workforce and across Equifax. And those are the kind of solutions, you should see. And as you know, central to our EFX2023 strategy is really leveraging the cloud around innovation and new products and we're excited about our progress there. But we're in early innings on this.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thanks, Mark.\nJohn Gamble: And, Jeff, just part of it, just penetrating, right? We talked about three years ago, for every four credit pools, there was one or less than one employer pool, right? verifications pool. Now, for every two, there's more than one, right? So the level of penetration is up dramatically in the time period you're describing, which substantially adds to growth, right? And then you also know, obviously, in a period of very rapidly growing market benefit, all variances improved, right? So, we'll certainly benefit across the business by the fact that the market is so large, right, but the -- and grew so much faster this year. But the increase in penetration is a huge driver in the past three years.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nMark Begor: Hey, Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, how are you? Hey, Mark or John, can you give us a sense just given the new product innovation, how are we thinking about if this is more from a longer-term subscription perspective versus transactions. And I think there's always been historical that this is much more transaction-oriented. Given the incremental cloud shift, it seems like you're going to be more embedded in your clients, you're introducing more products that become more monitoring. So, how are you thinking about subscription versus transaction growth maybe historically? And where that can be in the business longer-term?\nMark Begor: Yes. So, I think our business continues to be heavily transaction focused and likely will continue to be. What -- increasingly, you see minimums in our contracts, but generally not subscriptions, right? We do have some products that are subscriptions, like you said, monitoring services tend to look more like subscriptions. But the vast majority of our revenue generation continues to be driven by -- continues to be driven by transactions. And we benefited from that, obviously, very substantially over the past several years. Businesses where you can -- where you see more things that look like subscriptions are, certainly the unemployment insurance claims business, you see things that look like subscriptions with minimum -- with volume caps in them. So, we have businesses that are structured like that. And we have some businesses that are somewhat more software-focused, where you see more subscriptions. But generally speaking, we're still heavily transaction-based and that will likely continue.\nKevin McVeigh: That's helpful. And then can you just remind us, if think about the pool of records within EWS. I know that the target is, I remember, has kind of been about $158 million. But as you think about alternative income sources, things like that, what's the total addressable market you think that's potentially out there based on the capabilities that you have today?\nMark Begor: Yeah. You talked about the non-farm payroll. There's a lot of runway there, and as you know, a lot of economic value as we grow the database in the traditional non-farm payroll or W-2 income. 1099 is a very big market. I think it's 30 million or 40 million people that have 1099-type income. That's a space that we're adding data records. We don't talk about those, because it's not in our $90 million or $150 million in total. Another data set that we're starting to add, and we have some records now is pensioner income. I think there's 20 million or 30 million defined benefit pensioners in the United States that receive monthly pension checks, either at the state, federal or corporate level. They're applying for credit products. So that's another data set that we're out there chasing. It just goes back to the power of the scale of our business, we have those relationships. For example, a company that we're collecting their active employees from many of those companies also process their pensioner income. So it's an opportunity for us to bring that income into our data set. Same thing with a payroll processor that's doing primarily W-2 income, they're also, in some cases can have 1099 income. So it's another way for us to build those out. So we've got a very clear focus of not only building out W-2, but going beyond that. Another focus that's in early stages is really just getting data around someone logging in or checking in and checking out of their employment, whether it's a restaurant worker logging in through their software that they use to operate in the restaurant, getting that data asset. We might not know how much they're making, but we'll know they're working. So it's another element of data. So we've got a broad focus there around going beyond W-2.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our last question is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.\nGary Bisbee: I appreciate you sticking around long enough to answer the question. Just one on the non-mortgage acceleration, which was impressive across the businesses. When I look at USIS, in particular, I don't think that's grown meaningfully in a couple of years. And if I heard you right, ex the acquisitions, it was nearly 11% year-to-year growth in the quarter. Would it be reasonable to think a decent portion of that is an easy comp in March? And -- or is this much more momentum that's really picked up? And if so, what are the key one or two drivers of that sequential improvement in the non-mortgage growth in USIS? Thank you,\nMark Begor: Gary, you know this and just remember is that, USIS had a decent quarter in first quarter last year. I think was that 3.5%.\nJohn Gamble: It was certainly, it was low single digits.\nMark Begor: Yeah, something like that in the first quarter last year. And the COVID pandemic really didn't hit them or us until the last two weeks of March. And that 3.5% was inside of the two weeks in March, which really were significantly impacted. So we felt quite good about the progress we have really all through 2020 that the team is really delivering. You've got a lot of factors there. We've already talked about it a bunch in the call about the commercial focus by the team. We think that's real. We think they're getting benefits already from the cloud transformation competitively, meaning wanting to do business with Equifax because we have a different technology infrastructure than our competitors. So that's a positive for them, whether it's on share. You can think about other factors like the NPIs. Those are -- a reminder, we were building NPIs in 2018 and 2019. We really couldn't sell them because we were in the penalty box. We started selling them in 2020, but that's really benefiting them, and we're continuing to accelerate our NPI rollouts. So I think that's a benefit for the business. And then there's an element of COVID recovery. I think we were clear that in March and April, we've seen some of their verticals move back much more strongly than they were earlier in the quarter and certainly stronger than they were in 2020. So I think that's part of that, too.\nGary Bisbee: So would it be safe to say that the step function element of just dramatically better-looking growth has more to do with -- you've been making progress, but the COVID impact through much of last year sort of offset that or we couldn't see it through because of progression of that?\nMark Begor: Correct. I think that's fair. I think that\u2019s fair that the COVID environment masks their performance, which is why every quarter, we talked about their deal pipeline to at least give you a metric that we look at on what their commercial activity looks like.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: And I think, as Mark mentioned on the call, right, it got better each month, right? So March was certainly by far the strongest month of the three.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nOperator: All right. There appears to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Hare, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nDorian Hare: Thanks, everybody, for your interest in Equifax and for joining us today. This does conclude our first quarter earnings call. We look forward to joining you later on this summer to review our second quarter results.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As Mark referenced earlier, U.S. mortgage market inquiries remained very strong in 1Q 2021 and up 21%, but that growth was slightly lower than the 24% we had expected when we provided guidance in early February. As shown on the left side of Slide 10, as mortgage rates increased over the past few months and refinancing activity continues, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing has declined to about $30 million. Although still very strong by historic standards, this is down from the levels we saw in 4Q 2020 and early 1Q 2021. Based upon our most recent data from 4Q 2020, mortgage refinancings were continuing at about $1 million per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 10, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. This strong purchase market is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into 2022. Based on these trends and specifically, the reduction in the pool of mortgages that would benefit from refinancing, we are reducing our expectation for the mortgage market financing activity in 2021. As shown on Slide 11, we now expect mortgage credit inquiries to be about flat in 2Q 2021 versus 2Q 2020 and to be down about 25% in the second half of 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020. Overall, for 2021, we expect mortgage market credit inquiries to be down approximately 8%. This compares to the down approximately 5% we discussed with you in February. Slide 12 provides our guidance for 2Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 16% to 18%, including a 2.1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 2%. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q 2021 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.63 per share. In 2Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $44 million or $0.27 per share. Excluding these costs that were excluded from 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 2Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.87 to $1.97 per share, up 15% to 21% from 2Q 2020. This performance is being delivered in the context of the U.S. mortgage market, which is expected to be flat versus 2Q 2020. Slide 13 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially despite the expectation of a weaker U.S. mortgage market. 2021 revenue of between $4.575 billion and $4.675 billion reflects revenue growth of about 11% to 13% versus 2020, including a 1.4% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.7%. EWS is expected to deliver over 20% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid to high single digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth in the upper single digits, and GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits in 2021. 2Q 2021 revenue was also expected to be down mid-single digits for DCS. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. These one-time costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS through 2020. In 2021, Equifax expects to incur one-time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $145 million, a reduction of about 60% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $145 million in one-time costs would reduce adjusted EPS by $0.91 per share. This is consistent with our guidance for 2021 that we gave in February. 2021 adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $7.05 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is down approximately 3% to up 1% from 2020. Excluding the impact of tech transformation costs of $0.91 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021, which show growth of about 10% to 14% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of over $65 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.40 a share. Additional assumptions included in 2021 guidance are provided -- will be provided in the 1Q 2021 earnings slide deck to be posted later this morning. Slide 14 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2019 through 2021. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of movements in the mortgage market on Equifax revenue, as well as the impact of changes in our UC claims business within our EWS Employer Services business, and also the employee retention credit revenue from our recently acquired HIREtech business. Employee retention credits are specific U.S. government incentives for companies to retain their employees in response to COVID-19 and the associated revenue is not expected to continue into 2022. The data shown for 2Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of guidance ranges we provided. In 1Q 2021, we delivered very strong core revenue growth of 20% and expect to continue to deliver strong core revenue growth in 2Q 2021 of about 20% and 16% for all of 2021. This very strong performance, we believe, positions us well entering 2022 and beyond. And now I'd like to hand it back over to Mark. No, we've just said in the past, right, that increasingly, as we go through 2021, as the non-mortgage markets recover, increasingly, their contribution to core growth is going up, right? So, we're -- so we expect that to continue as we go through the year. And the outperformance in the first quarter, as we said, more than half of it was driven in our non-mortgage segments, and you're seeing that obviously flow through the rest of this year as well. Sure. So -- yes, I think in Mark's script, we tried to walk through what the real big drivers, right? Verifier is continuing to perform extremely well. Obviously, mortgage is a bit of a draw -- a drag. But as you go through the rest of this year, if you think about what we said in February, we'd indicated that for total mortgage for Equifax, that even though the market was down 5%, we expected revenue to grow more than 10%. And even though we now have the market weaker at down 8%, we still expect mortgage revenue to grow more than 10%. But some significant drivers of EWS in 2021 continue to be in the non-mortgage segment. We talked about talent solutions growing very, very fast, almost doubling, I think we said in the first quarter and I-9 also growing very, very fast and a recovery in WFA. So what we think you're going to see is very nice growth across the non-mortgage segments, obviously, excluding UC, where we gave very specific guidance. And then also continued good performance in mortgage despite the fact that the market is slowing, right? We're not going to quantify each of those. But directionally, that's what's going on. The only thing I'd add, right, and as Mark said, our two biggest segments in verifier are government and talent solutions, and they're growing very fast. And both of those are highly benefited by the depth of the database by the fact that we have over 450 million total records. Being able to pry history in those market segments is very important. So, we're seeing very strong growth in the two biggest non-mortgage verifier segments of both government and talent solutions. Yes. As you look at the countries we're in, the countries that are looking more like USIS, where they're more specifically, like, for example, Canada, margins are much better, right? And so as Mark said, it really depends on the size of the market and then the diversity of the market that we're playing in. And then -- and so we certainly expect to see improvements in margins as we go to the cloud. But some of it certainly is structural just by the fact that we're in so many markets, and some of those businesses are very small. So, not to get into specific numbers, we do expect to see improvements in those margins over time. But some of it is structural. We have no expectation that they're going to reach the type of margins we see with USIS. And just as you think about our cost structure, just for perspective, right, we're like most technology companies, obviously, a significant portion of our cost structure is our own employees. We also have a very significant footprint of contract employees and contractors, right? So, we end up -- we move cost, but obviously, the contractor workforce is more variable to us. Well, if you're looking at revenue, Toni, right, I mean, the over $200 million increase, right, only less than half of it was really out of the first quarter. And then obviously, yes, the second quarter is stronger. And then the third -- as Mark said, third and fourth quarter are impacted somewhat by the much greater decline in the mortgage market. But we are seeing very substantial growth, and we think improvement in the non-mortgage segments. And as you look at revenue, we think a significant amount of the improvement in the guide is from periods after the first quarter. Yes, yes, because that used us in... And remember, our fourth quarter of 2020 in international was okay. We grew in the fourth quarter of 2020, right? So... Yes. Yes. So we did give some perspective, right, on USIS this quarter. We indicated kind of the negative movement in their margins was up two-thirds driven by tech transformation, so to give you some perspective. And what we said is over the longer-term, we expect to see improvements in margins, driven by the fact that we're going to drive substantial cost benefits related to the tech transformation. But we wouldn't start to see those benefits occur until late 2021 and then really kicking in, in earnest in 2022. So, as we think about the movement in margins, the drivers of the margin, obviously, will be as tech transformation spend start to decline as you move through 2021 and into 2022, really moving into 2022. And then as we start to get savings related to those decommissionings that will occur as tech transformation completes, and that doesn't really start to have a net savings of decommissioning more than cloud costs until very late in 2021 and then obviously accelerating in 2022. So, we expect acquisitions we make to move to USIS-type margins over a reasonable period of time, right? So, certainly not in the first year. But then as we move into year two and certainly year three, we expect them to deliver margins like the rest of the business. The time you would be aware of, which I'm sure you're aware of because it happens every year, right, in EWS and Employer Services. The Employer Services revenue was strongest in the first quarter substantially because several of the services they provide, think W-2, think workforce analytics are directly related to tax filings. And since that's the case, their revenue is much higher in those segments in the first quarter. And during that period, obviously, the margins are very strong in those businesses. So you see stronger margin in Workforce Solutions. And it also obviously benefits Equifax in the first quarter. And generally, there's a negative trend sequentially going into the second quarter for that reason. The other thing that just timing related, related to Equifax is our annual salary increases, our merit increases are generally pretty much uniformly at April 1st. So, you tend to see a cost increase occur in the company in the second quarter, okay? And that brings margins down, okay? So those are two things that are just timing-related. But other than that, no, I think we're just what we're seeing in EWS and really across the business is just good execution. Yeah. So George, we've said pretty consistently, right, that as we move through 2021, you're going to see an increasing contribution to core revenue growth from non-mortgage relative to mortgage. Obviously, in the first quarter, we saw really good outperformance relative to the mortgage market across EWS as well as USIS, and we indicated I think in an earlier answer to a question that even though the mortgage market is going to be weaker by 3 points in the year, we'll still grow faster than 10%, right? So we're going to see better performance, better outperformance relative to the market than we had previously guided. So there is some benefit to core revenue growth from better outperformance in the mortgage market. But, obviously, also you're seeing a substantial contribution now that's starting to occur as you move through 2021 from the non-mortgage market. And, Jeff, just part of it, just penetrating, right? We talked about three years ago, for every four credit pools, there was one or less than one employer pool, right? verifications pool. Now, for every two, there's more than one, right? So the level of penetration is up dramatically in the time period you're describing, which substantially adds to growth, right? And then you also know, obviously, in a period of very rapidly growing market benefit, all variances improved, right? So, we'll certainly benefit across the business by the fact that the market is so large, right, but the -- and grew so much faster this year. But the increase in penetration is a huge driver in the past three years. It was certainly, it was low single digits. And I think, as Mark mentioned on the call, right, it got better each month, right? So March was certainly by far the strongest month of the three."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Dorian. Before I address Equifax's very strong first quarter results, I want to again thank our 11,000 employees and families that supported them for the tremendous dedication they continue to show under the challenging COVID environment over the past year. We continue to make the health and safety of our employees a top priority and I hope that you and those close to you remain safe. Turning to Slide 4, and as I will cover in a moment, Equifax delivered an outstanding first quarter with record revenue and strong sequential growth versus fourth quarter. The tremendous progress we have made executing against our strategic priorities and building out our Equifax cloud capabilities is allowing us to outperform our underlying markets and deliver outstanding revenue growth and margin expansion. In the U.S. where the economy is still recovering from the COVID pandemic more rapidly than we anticipated, we continue to outperform the overall mortgage market, which remains strong in the first quarter. We're also seeing a real recovery and strong growth across our core banking, auto, insurance, government, and talent business segments. We delivered growth again in the first quarter internationally with continued challenging COVID restrictions in place in most of our global markets and we expect to see acceleration in this growth as economies recover outside the U.S. First quarter was a great start to 2021. We are energized by our strong momentum and pivoting to our next chapter of growth with the launch of EFX2023, our new strategic growth framework that will serve as our company-wide compass over the next three years. With our new Equifax Cloud foundation increasingly in place, we're focused on leveraging our new Equifax Cloud data and technology infrastructure to accelerate innovation, new products, and growth. Innovation and new products will fuel our growth in 2021 and beyond as we leverage our new EFX Cloud capabilities to bring new products and solutions and multi-data insights to customers faster, more securely, and more reliably. As you know, we ramped our investments in product and innovation resources over the past 12 months to accelerate our new product rollouts leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. Our highly unique and diverse data assets are at the heart of what creates Equifax's differentiation in the marketplace. We have data assets at scale that our competitors do not have, including TWN, NCTUE, DataX, IXI and more and we are committed to expanding and deepening these differentiated data assets through organic actions, partnerships and M&A. We're also relentlessly focused on a customer-first mentality, which moves us closer to our customers with a focus on delivering solutions to help solve their problems and drive their growth. Another critical level of our strategy is to reinvest our accelerating free cash flow in smart, strategic and accretive bolt-on acquisitions that both expand and strengthen our capabilities with a goal of increasing our revenue growth by 1% to 2% annually for M&A and data security is deeply embedded in our culture, we have clearly established Equifax as an industry leader in data security. Working together as one aligned global Equifax team, where we leverage our commercial strengths, our new products and our capabilities across our EFX Cloud global platform, will allow us to deliver solutions that only Equifax can bring to the marketplace. We're energized around our new EFX2023 strategic priorities that will serve as our guidepost over the next three years and support our new long-term growth framework that we plan to put in place later this year. Turning now to Slide 5, Equifax performance in the first quarter was very strong. Revenue at $1.2 billion was the strongest quarterly revenue in our history. In first quarter, constant currency revenue growth was a very strong 25% with our growing organic growth at 23%, which was also an Equifax record. As a reminder, we're coming off a solid 13% growth in first quarter last year. All business units performed -- outperformed our expectations and we are seeing positive signs of a COVID recovery beginning to accelerate, particularly in the U.S. Our growth was again powered by our two U.S. B2B Businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS, with combined revenue up a very strong 38%. Mortgage-related revenue remained robust, and importantly, our non-mortgage-related verticals grew organically by a very strong 16%. The adjusted EBITDA margins of our U.S. B2B businesses were 52%, up 400 basis points, with EWS delivering close to 60% margins. As a reminder, Workforce Solutions and USIS are over 70% of Equifax revenue and 80% of Equifax business unit EBITDA. First quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $431 million, up 36% with over 250 basis points of expansion in our margins to 35.6%. This margin expansion was delivered while including all cloud technology transformation costs and our adjusted results, which negatively impacted first quarter adjusted EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points. Excluding Kount cloud transformation costs, our margins would have been up over 500 basis points. We are clearly getting strong leverage out of our revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA -- adjusted EPS at $1.97 per share, was up a very strong 37% from last year, which was also impacted by the inclusion of cloud transformation costs. Adjusted EPS would have been $2.20 and up 54% excluding these costs. We continue to accelerate our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter, including migrating an additional 2,000 customers to the cloud in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 customers internationally. Leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure, we also continue to accelerate new product innovation. In the first quarter, we released 39 new products, which is up from 35 launched a year ago in the first quarter, continuing the momentum from 2020 where we launched a record 134 new products. And we're seeing increased revenue generation from these new products leveraging our new EFX cloud. For 2021, we expect our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years to exceed 8%. This is 100 basis point improvement from the 7% guidance we provided in our vitality index back in February. And in the first quarter, we completed five strategic bolt-on acquisitions, with a focus on identity and fraud capability through our acquisition of Talent and accelerating growth in Workforce Solutions with the acquisitions of HIREtech and i2Verify. Acquisitions that will broaden and strengthen Equifax are a strong lever for continuing to accelerate our growth and a big focus. We were energized by our fast start to 2021 and are clearly seeing the momentum of our only Equifax model, leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities. Our first quarter results were substantially stronger than the guidance we provided in February with over 90% of the revenue outperformance delivered in our two U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Importantly, as we'll discuss in more detail shortly, over 60% of this outperformance in the U.S. B2B revenue was in our non-mortgage segments in both USIS and Workforce Solutions. Non-mortgage revenue strengthened consistently during the first quarter with March revenue up significantly versus February in both USIS and EWS. This broad-based strength was above our expectations and gives us confidence about further strengthening in the second quarter and second half as the COVID recovery unfolds. Mortgage revenue was also stronger than we expected, despite the growth in U.S. mortgage market at 21% being slightly below our expectations from a slowing -- from slowing mortgage inquiries in late March, which have continued into April. Our continued strong mortgage results and outperformance was driven by Workforce Solutions, with stronger market penetration, record growth, and positive impact from new products. USIS mortgage revenue also exceeded expectations slightly. The stronger revenue delivered strong operating leverage with substantial improvement in our EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS. The strength of our first quarter results in Workforce Solutions and in U.S. non-mortgage revenue across USIS and Workforce Solutions more broadly, gave us the confidence to substantially raise our 2021 guidance for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $225 million to a midpoint of $4.65 billion and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.55 a share to a midpoint of $6.90 per share. This includes our expectation that the U.S. mortgage market for 2021, as measured by credit inquiries, will decline more in our February guidance of down 5% to a decline of approximately 8%. Our framework assumes that the mortgage market slows primarily in the third and fourth quarter, which is consistent with our prior guidance. John will discuss our mortgage assumptions in more detail in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 6, our outstanding first quarter results were broad-based and reflect better-than-expected performance for all - from all four business units. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering 59% revenue growth and almost 60% adjusted EBITDA margins. Workforce Solutions is now our largest business, representing almost 40% of total Equifax revenue in the fourth quarter and is clearly powering our results. Verification Services revenue of $385 million was up a strong 75%. Verification Service mortgage revenue again more than doubled for the fourth consecutive quarter growing almost 100 percentage points faster than the 21% underlying growth we saw in the mortgage market credit inquiries in the first quarter. Importantly, verification services non-mortgage revenue was up over 25% in the quarter. This segment of verification services continues to expand its market coverage and benefit from NPIs new records, new use cases and as a long-term growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Talent Solutions, which represents over 30% of verifier non-mortgage revenue almost doubled, driven by both new products and recovery in U.S. hiring. Government Solutions, which represents almost 40% of verifier non-mortgage revenue also returned to growth driven by greater usage in multiple states of our differentiated data. As a reminder, we continue to work closely with the Social Security Administration on our new contract that we expect to go live in the second half and ramp to $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue at run rate in 2022. Our non-mortgage consumer business, principally in banking and auto, also showed strong growth in the quarter as well, both from deepening penetration with new lenders and from some recovery in those markets that I'll cover more fully in the discussion of USIS. Debt management, which now represents under 10% of verifier non-mortgage revenue was, as we expected, down versus last year, but is stabilized and we expect to see growth in that vertical as we move through 2021. Employer Services revenue of $96 million increased 17% in the quarter, driven again by our unemployment claims business which had revenue of $47 million, up around 47% compared to last year. In the first quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 2.8 million UC claims, which is up from 2.6 million in the fourth quarter. EWS processed roughly one-in-three U.S. initial unemployment claims in the quarter, which was up from one in five that they had been processing in recent periods, reflecting the growth in Workforce Solutions UC market position.  As a reminder, we continue to expect UC claims revenue to decline sequentially in the second quarter and throughout the balance of 2021 as the U.S. economy recovers and job losses dissipate. We currently expect to decline in the second quarter UC revenue of about 45% versus last year and a full year 2021 decline in UC claims revenue of just under 30%. Employer Services non-UC businesses had revenue down slightly in the quarter. Our I-9 business driven by our new I-9 Anywhere Solution continued to show very strong growth with revenue up 15%. Our I-9 business is expected to continue to grow substantially to become our largest Employer Services business in 2021 and represent about 40% of non-UC revenue. Reflecting the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of workforce analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC businesses to deliver organic growth of over 20% in 2021. The HIREtech and i2Verify acquisitions that we closed in March had a de minimis impact on revenue in the quarter, but will add \u2013 will further add to Workforce Solutions growth during the rest of 2021. I'll discuss both HIREtech and i2Verify a little bit later. Reflecting the power and uniqueness of TWN data, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 59.3% and almost 800 basis point expansion from last year in Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions' team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a strong 2021. Workforce Solutions is clearly Equifax's largest and fastest-growing business. USIS revenue was up a very strong 19% in the quarter with organic growth also a strong 17%. Total USIS mortgage revenue growth of $177 million was up 25% in the quarter, while mortgage credit inquiry growth up 21% was slightly below the 24% expectation we shared in February. As I mentioned John will cover our updated view of the mortgage market for 2021 in a few minutes. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by 500 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in marketing and debt -- new debt monitoring products. Non-mortgage revenue performance was very strong, with growth of 15% and organic growth of 11%, which is a record for USIS and of a fairly strong first quarter last year. We view this outperformance by US as meaningful and a reflection of the competitiveness and commercial focus of the USIS team. Importantly, non-mortgage online revenue grew a very strong 16% in the quarter with organic growth of almost 11%. We saw non-mortgage revenue growth accelerate in February and March as vaccine rollouts increased and financial institutions gained confidence in the consumer and the economy. Banking, auto, ID and fraud, insurance, and the direct-to-consumer all showed growth in the quarter, which is encouraging as we move into second quarter and the rest of 2021. Commercial was about flat, while only Telco was down in the quarter as we expected. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our offline or batch business, was $53 million in the quarter, up almost 12%, which is also very positive. The performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20% and ID and fraud revenue growth of just under 10% as consumer marketing and originations ramped up. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 45% of FMS revenue with identity and fraud about 25% and risk decisioning about 30%. This strong growth across our non-mortgage businesses, including strong growth in marketing specific offline revenue, is very encouraging for both the recovery of our underlying markets and our non-mortgage performance as we move into second quarter and the rest of 2021. The USIS team continues to drive growth in their new deal pipeline with first quarter pipeline up 30% over last year, driven by growth in both the volume and the size of new opportunities and NPI roll outs. First quarter win rates were also higher than levels seen in 2020. Sid Singh and his USIS team continue to be on offense and are competitive in winning in their marketplace. In addition to driving core business growth in the first quarter, USIS also achieved an important strategic milestone in closing the acquisition of Kount, an industry leader in providing AI-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions. Integration efforts are now underway with a key focus on technology and product, leveraging the joint Equifax and Kount data and capabilities. Kount's technology platform will migrate to the Equifax Cloud in the next 12 to 18 months, which will allow for the full integration of Kount and Equifax capabilities for new solutions, new products and market expansion in the fast-growing identity and fraud marketplace. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 42.9% in the first quarter were down about 180 basis points from last year. About two-thirds of the decline was due to the inclusion of tech transformation costs in our adjusted EBITDA in 2021. The remainder of the decline was principally driven by the higher mix of mortgage products and redundant system costs from our cloud transformation.  Moving now to international, their revenue was up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, which is the second consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets that are still very challenged by COVID lockdowns and slow vaccine rollouts. Revenue growth improved significantly in Canada, Asia Pacific, which is our Australian business and Latin America. This was partially offset by revenue declines in the UK, principally due to continued UK lockdowns in response to the COVID pandemic. Asia-Pacific, which is principally Australia business, had a very good performance in the first quarter with revenue of $87 million, up 7% in local currency. Australia consumer revenue continues to improve relative to prior quarters and was down only about 2% versus last year compared to down 5% in the fourth quarter. Our commercial business combined online and offline revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter, a solid improvement from fourth quarter. And fraud and identity was up 15% in the quarter following strong performance in the fourth quarter. European revenues of $69 million were down 5% in local currency in the first quarter. Our European credit business was down about 5% in local currency. Spain revenue was down about 1%, while the UK was down about 6% in local currency similar to the fourth quarter from continued challenging COVID environments.  Our European debt management business revenue declined by about 4% in local currency in the quarter. Both the CRA and debt management businesses were impacted in the quarter by actions taken by the UK government to curtail debt placements in response to the pandemic resurgence in the United Kingdom. As the lockdown and other actions lift in April and May, we anticipate improvements in UK CRA revenue in the second quarter and improvements in debt management revenue in the second half of 2021 as collection activity restarts in the latter part of the second quarter. Latin American revenues of $42 million grew about 1% in the quarter in local currency, which was an improvement from the down 1% we saw in the fourth quarter. These markets also continue to be heavily impacted negatively by continued COVID lockdowns and slow vaccine roll-ups. We continue to see the benefit in LatAm of strong new product introductions over the past three years, which is benefiting their top line. Canada delivered record revenue of $44 million in the quarter, up about 13% in local currency. Consumer online was up about 3% in the quarter, an improvement from the fourth quarter. Improving growth in commercial, analytical and decision solutions and ID and fraud also drove growth in Canadian revenue in the first quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 28.2% were down 30 basis points from last year, excluding the impact of the tech transformation costs that we've included in adjusted EBITDA, margins were up about 200 basis points. This improvement was principally due to revenue growth and operating leverage, partially offset by system -- redundant system costs from our cloud transformation. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a local currency basis in the quarter and slightly better than our expectations. We saw better-than-expected performance in our global consumer direct business, which sells directly to consumers through Equifax.com and myEquifax and which represents about half of total GCS revenue.  Direct-to-consumer revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter, their third consecutive quarter of growth. Decline in overall GCrevenue in the quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead generation partner business, which has been significantly impacted from COVID beginning in mid-2020. As we discussed, we expect a decline in total GCS revenue from our partner vertical to moderate substantially as we move into the second quarter and return to growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.6% were up about 150 basis points. We expect margins to be pressured to around 20% in the second quarter, reflecting planned costs to complete the migration of our consumer direct business, cloud transformations in the US, UK, and Canada, to our new Equifax Cloud platform. Moving to Slide 7, this chart provides an updated view of Equifax's core revenue growth. As a reminder, core revenue growth is defined as Equifax revenue growth, excluding: number one, the extraordinary revenue growth in our UC claims business in 2020 and 2021; and number two, the impact on revenue from U.S. mortgage market activity as measured by changes in total U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries. Core revenue growth is our attempt to provide a more normalized view of Equifax revenue growth, excluding these unusual UC and U.S. mortgage market factors. In the first quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 7, was up a very strong 20%, reflecting the broad-based growth across Equifax. And this is up significantly from the 11% core revenue growth we delivered in the fourth quarter and well above our historic core growth rates. Workforce Solutions and USIS have continued to strongly outperform the mortgage market. The 16% organic growth in U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue also drove our core revenue growth. Importantly, our core revenue growth has accelerated over the past five quarters from 5% in first quarter 2020 to 11% in the fourth quarter of last year and to 20% this quarter, reflecting the strength and resiliency of our broad-based business model, power of Workforce Solutions, the market competitiveness of USIS and benefits from our cloud Equifax -- our cloud, data, and technology investments and our increasing focus on leveraging the cloud for innovation new products. As you know, the strong growth is in the midst of a global market that is still recovering from the COVID pandemic. Turning to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax and clearly is our strongest and most valuable and largest business. Workforce Solutions revenue grew a very strong 59% in the first quarter with core revenue growth accelerating to 46%. As a reminder, the 59% growth is off 32% growth in first quarter of 2020. The strong outperformance in sequential improvement reflects the power of the unique TWN database and Workforce Solutions business model. At the end of the first quarter, the TWN database reached 115 million active users and 90 million unique records, an increase of 9% or 10 million active records from a year ago. And as a reminder, over 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers that Workforce Solutions provides Employer Services like UC Claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC and other solutions, too, and we've built these relationships over -- with these \u2013 with our customers and contributors over the past decade. The remaining 35% are contributed through partnerships, most of which are exclusive. The major payroll processor agreement that we announced on our February call is still on track to go live later this year, which will add to our TWN database. And we have a dedicated team, as you know, focused on growing our TWN database with an active pipeline of record additions to continue to expand our TWN database. The Workforce Solutions team continues to focus on expanding the number of mortgage companies and financial institutions with which we have real-time system-to-system integrations, which as you know, drives increased usage of our TWN data. The team is also focused on extending our operations into card and auto verticals, as well as across our growing government vertical. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to work closely with the SSA and expect to go live with our new solution in the second half of this year, which will deliver $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue and run rate in 2022. The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding, as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax cloud infrastructure. We are anticipating new products in mortgage, talent solutions, government and I-9 in 2021. New product revenue will increase in 2021 and 2022 as we begin to reap the benefits of our new products introduced to the market during last year and in 2021. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team have multiple levers for growth in 2021, 2022 and beyond. Workforce Solutions are the most -- Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business and will continue to power our results in the future. Slide 9 highlights the ongoing exceptional core growth performance in mortgage for our U.S. B2B business -- mortgage businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Workforce and USIS outgrew the underlying U.S. mortgage market again in first quarter with combined core growth of 48%, up from 37% in 2020 and in line with the 49% growth they delivered in the fourth quarter -- 49% core growth. This outperformance was driven strongly by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 99%. Consistent with past quarters, Workforce Solutions outperformance was driven by new records, increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates and new products, proof that lenders are increasingly becoming reliant on the unique TWN income and employment data when making credit decisions. USIS delivered 5% core mortgage revenue growth in the quarter, driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions with further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow all of our underlying markets is core to our business model and core to our future growth. I'd now like to turn it over to John to discuss current trends in the mortgage market and to walk through our revised second quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 15. This highlights our continued focus on new product innovation, which is a critical component of our next chapter of growth as we leverage the Equifax Cloud for innovation, new products and growth. We continue to focus on transforming Equifax into a product-led organization, leveraging our best-in-class Equifax cloud-native data and technology to fuel top line growth. In the first quarter, we delivered 39 new products, which is up from the 35 we delivered last year. We're encouraged by this continued strong performance, especially following the record 135 new products we delivered last year. We wanted to highlight some of these new products, which we expect to drive revenue in 2021 and beyond. First, Insight Score for credit card launched by USIS provides the credit card industry with a specific credit risk score created using credit and alternative data that predicts the likelihood of a consumer becoming 90 days past due or more within 24 months of origination. USIS also launched a new commercial real estate tenant risk assessment product suite, which provides real-time and unmatched data analytics and risk assessment for tenants, buildings and portfolio strength, delivered through an interactive, ignite marketplace app or as a stand-alone report. And Workforce Solutions continues to expand its suite of products focused on the government vertical. Their government enhanced solutions, Social Services Verification product, gives the ability for the customer to choose the desired period of employment history with options ranging from three months, six months, one year, three years or the full employment history. These products help government agencies quickly and efficiently administer federally \u2013 federal supplement -- supplementary nutrition, child health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare benefits, managed child support and insurance program integrity. In the first quarter, over two-thirds of our new products launched or in development leveraged our new Equifax cloud-based global product platforms. This enables significant synergies and efficiencies in how we build the new products, our speed to bring the products to market and our ability to move the new products easily to our global markets. Our new cloud-based Luminate platform for fraud management is a great example, which is launching in Canada and the U.S. simultaneously and will soon launch in the United Kingdom, Australia, and India. This would have taken much longer and been much more expensive in a legacy environment. We're also rolling out our Equifax Cloud-based Interconnect and Ignite platforms for marketing and risk and decisioning and management products throughout Latin America, Europe, Canada, as well as the United States. As we discussed on our call in February, we're focused on leveraging our new cloud capabilities to increase NPI rollouts and new product revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. As a reminder, our NPI revenue is defined as the revenue delivered by new products launched over the past three years and our vitality index is defined as the percentage of current year revenue delivered by NPI revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we've increased our 2021 vitality index guidance from 7% by 100 basis points to 8%, as you can see from the left side of the slide, is a significant increase from about 500 basis points in 2020. NPIs are a big priority for me and the team as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation, new products, and growth. Turning to Slide 16, M&A plays an important role in our growth strategy and will be central to our long-term growth framework. Our team is focused on building an active pipeline of bolt-on targets that will both broaden and strengthen Equifax. Our M&A strategy centers on acquiring accretive and strategic companies to add unique data assets, new capabilities, deliver expansion into identity and fraud, or expand our geographic footprint. In the first quarter, we closed five acquisitions totaling $866 million across strategic focus areas of identity and fraud, Workforce Solutions, open data, and SME. We discussed three of these transactions with you in February, which were the acquisitions of Kount and Kount score, and Credit Works. As I discussed earlier, we're excited about expanding opportunities we see from the combined Kount and Equifax in the fast-growing identity and fraud marketplace. In March, we closed two Workforce Solutions bolt-on transactions, HIREtech and i2Verify, which will further broaden and strengthen our Workforce Solutions business. HIREtech is a Houston-based company that provides employee-related tax credit services as well as verification services. HIREtech also has unique channel relationships to provide these services through payroll providers, consulting firms, and CPA firms. i2Verify is a Newburyport, Massachusetts-based company that provides secure digital verifications of income and employment services. The company has a unique nationwide set of record contributing employers with concentrations in the healthcare and education sectors. i2Verify also brings unique records to the TWN database, all of which are contributed by direct relationships. You should expect Equifax to continue to make acquisitions in these strategic growth areas that offer unique data and analytics to our customers with a goal of increasing our top line by 100 to 200 basis points annually from M&A. Before wrapping up, I want to speak to you about an area of significant focus at Equifax and importance to me personally. Slide 17 provides an overview of Equifax's ESG strategy and how it helps position us for long-term sustainability. I hope you saw and had a chance to read our annual report letter that highlighted our increased focus on ESG. First, Equifax plays an important role in helping consumers live their financial best. A primary example of this is that, our alternative data assets, such as utility and phone payment data, provide lenders with a better picture of the approximately 30 million U.S. individuals that do not have traditional credit files or access to the formal financial system. I've also made advancing inclusion and diversity, a personal priority since I joined Equifax. Believing that diversity of thought leads to better decisions, we've taken clear steps to broaden diversity at Equifax, including the last three Directors added to our Board are diverse, and all seven individuals have been added to my senior leadership team since I joined three years ago, have also been diverse. We're carrying out this focus on inclusion and diversity across Equifax. We're also focused on environment -- on our environmental impact and greenhouse gas footprint. Our cloud transformation will move our existing legacy technology infrastructure to the cloud, which will dramatically reduce our environmental impact as we leverage the efficiencies and carbon-neutral infrastructure at our cloud service providers. Over the course of this year, we -- or over the course of last year, we decommissioned six data centers, over 6,800 legacy data assets and over 1,000 legacy applications. We have a detailed program underway to baseline our energy usage and benefits from our cloud transformation as we work towards a commitment regarding carbon emissions and a net zero footprint. We're also committed to being the industry leaders regarding security. With the leadership of our CSO, Jamil Farshchi, our culture puts security first. All employees are required to take a mandatory security-focused training sessions every year. And all of our 4,000 bonus eligible employees have a security role in their annual MBOs. We believe -- we also believe in sharing our security protocols and strategies with our partners, customers and competitors to collaborate to keep us all safe. In 2020, we hosted our inaugural Customer Security Summit, where we detailed our progress on security transformation and discussed advancements in supply chain security. As threats continue to evolve, we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our security efforts. Wrapping up on Slide 18. Equifax delivered a record-setting first quarter and we have strong momentum as we move into second quarter in 2021. Our 27% overall and 20% core growth in first quarter reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model while still operating in a challenging COVID environment. We've now delivered five consecutive quarters of sequentially improving double-digit growth. We're confident in our outlook for 2021. And as John described, are raising our full year midpoint revenue by 500 basis points to $4.65 billion and our EPS midpoint by 9% to $6.90 a share. Our revised revenue estimate of 12% growth in 2021 at the midpoint of the range, off of a very strong 17% in 2020 reflects the resiliency, strength and momentum of the EFX business model. Our increased 2021 growth framework incorporated our expectation as John discussed that the U.S. mortgage market will decline about 8% in 2021 and while operating in a still recovering COVID economy. Our expectation for core revenue growth of 16% in 2021 reflects how our EFX2023 strategic priorities are delivering. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter of 59% growth and will continue to power Equifax's operating performance throughout 2021 and beyond. The work number is our most differentiated data asset and Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business. Rudy Ploder and his team are driving outsized growth by focusing on their key levers, new records, new products, penetration, and expansion into new verticals with our differentiated TWN database. USIS also delivered an outstanding quarter of 19% growth highlighted by non-mortgage revenue growth of 15% and 11% organic non-mortgage growth. We expect our non-mortgage growth to accelerate as the U.S. economy recovers. The acquisition of Kount is providing new opportunities and products in the rapidly expanding identity and fraud marketplace and USIS continues to outperform the mortgage market from new products, pricing, and increased penetration. USIS is clearly competitive and winning in the marketplace and will continue to deliver in 2021 and beyond. International grew in the first quarter for the second consecutive quarter, overcoming economic headwinds from significant COVID lockdowns and slower vaccine rollouts in our global markets. Our expectations are high for ongoing sequential improvement in international during 2021 and for accelerating growth as their underlying markets recover from the COVID pandemic. We're also making strong progress rolling out our new EFX cloud technology and data infrastructure and remain confident, as John described, in the significant top line, cost, and cash benefits from our new EFX Cloud capabilities. These financial benefits will ramp as we move through 2021 and continue to grow in 2022 and are enabled by our always on stability, speed-to-market and ability to rapidly build and move products around the globe. Our strong performance -- operating performance is allowing us to continue to accelerate investments in new products leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And we're off to a strong start in 2021 with 39 NPIs in the first quarter on top of the record 134 we launched in 2020. And our strong outperformance is fueling our cash generation, which is allowing us to reinvest in accretive and strategic bolt-on acquisitions. As discussed earlier, we closed five acquisitions in strategic growth areas in the first quarter and we have an active M&A pipeline. We look for bolt-on acquisitions that will strengthen our technology and data assets and that are financially accretive with a goal of adding 100 to 200 basis points to our top line growth rate in the future. I'm energized about what the future holds for Equifax. We have strong momentum across all of our businesses as we move into second quarter. We're on offense and position to bring new and unique solutions to our customers that only Equifax can deliver, leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities and our strong results and the increased guidance that we provided reflect that. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes, I think the answer is yes. Those are all meaningful levers. I would add the system, system integrations in our mortgage market and other solutions is also a lever for growth. David, I think, as you know, we don't break those out specifically, but it starts with records. We've clearly got a real focus on and some real momentum in adding records to the TWN Database. As you know, we have a dedicated team that that's all they do. And we've got active dialogues going with individual corporations to bring their data to us as we add new services like UC claims and WOTC and all the myriad of services that we provide and also with other payroll processors. And as you know, in February, we announced that our plan -- and we're on track to add one of the major payroll processors records to our database in the second half of 2021, which will add meaningfully. And I think you know, our business model as we grow records, we're able to monetize those really instantly because of the inquiries that we receive just drive our hit rates up. We clearly have the ability to use price, which we talked about. I think you've seen a real increase in the focus on new products at Workforce Solutions, particularly as they're becoming cloud-enabled. It's giving them the opportunity to bring new solutions to the marketplace to really leverage their data sets. And these new solutions are typically at higher price points and delivering more value to our customers. So that's another big lever. We've talked about \u2013 in the second half that, they're continuing to focus on systems and system integrations, and we just find higher usage when customers move from accessing the TWN database through the web to system-to-system integrations, we get really all their volume, which is another big lift. And as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still on track to launch our new agreement with the Social Security Administration. It's a very meaningful contract that will go live in the second half and we expect that to be $40 million to $50 million in run rate. So there's a large amount of levers available for Workforce Solutions. As you point out, it starts with records. And while we've grown records to 90 million uniques in the quarter, as you know, there's 155 million non-farm payroll. So there's a lot of room between 90 million and $155 million as we continue to grow towards having the full data set. And then we talked before that we're also widening dataset beyond W-2 income, including 1099 and other data sources as we look for other ways to include other portions of the U.S. population around are they working and how much do they make. Well, it's - there's a lot of leverage, as you could see in the first quarter results. I think you're talking about Workforce Solutions. We're continuing to invest in the business. There's no question about that. But with the revenue growth that we're getting on both the mortgage and non-mortgage side in Workforce Solutions, there's real operating leverage that we expect to continue through 2021. Yes, we don't have any incremental M&A in that guide. We wouldn't include that acquisitions that we haven't completed yet. I think we talked that we have a pipeline and a goal of increasing acquisitions. Of course, we're off to a very fast start this year on M&A. You know this, Manav, we took down our framework for mortgage inside of that revenue framework that we shared, which is quite significant. We think that we've got mortgage in the right spot now at down 8% versus the down 5% for the year. And as you know, that the way we frame that is most of that happens, really all of it really happens in the second half. And an expectation that there will be a recovery in the economies as vaccine rollouts continue and lockdowns are reduced, there's still some impact, we believe, of the COVID pandemic in the U.S. market. Although, as we pointed out, we saw some real recovery by our customers. And I characterize that as confidence, meaning they're starting originations in the latter part of the first quarter and into April, which we expect that to continue. But you still have -- our international markets are still significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic and we expect that to unfold at some pace during 2021 and that will be a positive as we move forward. Would you add anything, John? And then I would add to it, too, that I hope you caught our comments around, we really feel like the Equifax Cloud is providing benefits. Our NPI focus is providing benefits that will benefit our mortgage business as well as our non-mortgage business. And. of course, the majority of Equifax is non-mortgage, but the initiatives that we launched over the last couple of years, the investments that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel are starting to pay off. When you talk about USIS, we mentioned many times even over the last year, on each of these quarterly calls that we feel a real strength in the marketplace by our USIS team competitively. Commercially, how they're going to market, I think, we've talked about we've rebuilt that team a year ago and there's some room momentum there. And again, the focus on new products, those are driving revenue growth and we guided up 100 basis points in our vitality index. The bulk of that is going to come in our non-mortgage business. You want to try that one, John? Yes. Non-mortgage is obviously more than financial services. I'll come back to that, but we've talked a bunch about our government vertical, which is growing quite positively. Our Employer Services is non-mortgage. Our talent solutions business, so we talked about the growth there. And I think specifically, you're talking about non-mortgage verification. So, I'll go back to that versus non-mortgage broadly in workforce because we've got a bunch of levers that are outside of verification that are growing quite positively, again, excluding the negative impact of UC Claims on a year-over-year basis. So in financial services, as you know, mortgage is our largest in verification, for sure and we're getting real leverage and outgrowing the market there. So first, records health everywhere, right? So, in -- whatever the solution is, as we grow our records and, of course, they're up 10% year-over-year and we've got a clear path to increase them in 2021, and that's part of our framework. Those hit rates are good in any vertical you're in, whether it's mortgage or auto or government, et cetera. So records are number one. We've had a real focus on new products broadly in Equifax and in Workforce Solutions. And then you talk about some of the verticals, we're seeing increased usage in auto, where -- kind of year ago or two years ago, it was more of a subprime usage along with the credit file. Now we're seeing it more in near prime. So there's just more usage in the auto sector and broader usage at those lower credit scores. So that's helping there. Personal loans has always been a pretty strong space for us in the Fintech market for verification, using it because if you think about a personal loan, it's $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, it's a very large transaction. And verifying how much someone makes and are they employed at the time of the loan is a very important lift in the predictability. And then we've talked really for the last, I think, three or four quarters about the fact that we're seeing a number of card issuers take our data and, of course, a sliver of our data. We don't \u2013 given the depth of data that they would have in a mortgage application and using it in originations, in other applications in the card space. And we've got now, I believe, two of the large card issuers that are using our data ad origination, along with the credit file, which is a big breakthrough. We've been chasing this market for some time. I'm an old card originator. I did that for a decade before Equifax. The predictability of adding is someone working and how much do they make to the credit file enhances every credit decision period. And it was really around getting our database to scale. And we've talked the last couple of quarters that as we've gone over 50% hit rates in the database, as we get to that 90 million uniques versus the $155 million non-farm payroll, it becomes a data set that's more usable because you get more hit rates. So, that's another thing that we -- reason we think we're getting more new uses of it in things like that cards. We have not. We actually hear mostly about it from you, meaning the sell-side. And we talked many times that we think we have a strong franchise. The scale of our database is extremely large. I think of the 90 million uniques at 115 million actives, the ability to get those kind of records is quite challenging, we believe, meaning to have a database that's usable. And having a database that has 1 million or 2 million or 3 million or 10 million records, it's just very challenging for -- to take that to market. When we can deliver over 50% hit rates, it just is quite challenging. And I think you know, 60% of our records come from individual companies and we get those records through long-term relationships. We've been doing this for a decade. We have a full suite of services. We provide HR managers that allow us access to those records and we provide that service, the income employment piece of that for free to the company and to their employees, and it's a real benefit to them. So, those kind of services are really required, we think, to have a database of our scale. And as we've talked, the other 35% or so of our database comes from payroll partnerships and the bulk of those are exclusive, meaning we're an exclusive arrangement, they're not going to provide those records to someone else. So, we think that's quite challenging. And you add on top of that, that we've been investing in this business for over a decade. We've put about $2 billion into it, including a couple of acquisitions just in the last 30 days to strengthen Workforce Solutions. In the last two or three years, we probably invested $200 million to $300 million in the technology of the business. This is -- requires a massive investment. And I'm not sure the competitor you reference is thinking about or planning to have the kind of investments that we have. And just to be clear, we intend to protect and grow our franchise. Thanks. Yes. It's a great question. It's one that's been a deliberate focus of ours. You've heard us talk about it for the last couple of years that it's a fast-growing space, the ID and broad space globally is, I don't know, $18 billion, something like that, growing at 20%. You've seen -- we've had growth there. We've been in it for a long time. We have a lot of existing differentiated data assets at Equifax around ID and fraud and the Kount acquisition was quite strategic for us. They have real scale. And I think as a reminder, they play in the retail e-commerce space. Have real scale around their interactions. I think it's 32 billion consumer interactions per year. They've got 400 million unique e-mail addresses verified. They've got cellphone addresses are verified, IP addresses. So just a wealth of data. And the power is really combining their data with ours. And that's really why we acquired Kount. And as you point out, it also brings us into a new vertical. We weren't in the retail e-commerce space and that's where Kount plays. And, of course, we're going to bring Kount and their data into financial services, banking, telco, insurance, where we play. So that's why we acquired Kount. The answer is yes. You heard me comment earlier this morning on the call that, when we think about new M&A or additional M&A, ID and fraud is a place that we want to continue playing in. We see opportunities. We have opportunities in our pipeline to continue to strengthen the combination of Equifax and Kount going forward. And then when you -- your question of scale, from our perspective, the combination of Equifax and Kount gets us into kind of a strong market position, but it's a huge market at $18 billion. So, there's a lot of room to grow and we look at product introductions. We're investing in like our new Luminate platform, gets us more capabilities organically in this marketplace. And as I mentioned earlier, we're rolling that out. And then acquisitions like Kount really strengthen our data assets and the combination of Equifax and Kount is quite powerful. So, you should look for us over the coming years to find ways to grow. Certainly, we're going to invest organically, but also to invest through M&A to strengthen this. We like the space and we want to be bigger in it. And again, we don't exclude Workforce Solutions, but we'll just do that for your discussion and really focus on those other businesses. Obviously, USIS has real scale, and that scale drives their margins. And that's clearly a big difference when you think about our international. International, we're in 25 countries. We have some larger businesses like Australia, that's over $300 million and then some smaller countries that we play in. So, that drives a difference in the margins between our USIS, which has really massive scale versus our international businesses. We're always focused on improving our margins. The cloud investments that we're making will benefit Workforce Solutions margins, USIS margins and international and GCS margins. That's part of our strategy to improve our cost structure. But there's no question the subscale nature of some of our international markets result in margins being lower, which I would characterize as structural, but we see opportunities to improve those margins going forward. Would you add anything, John? I think we said, Andrew, that it was fairly broad-based. And some of the marketing spend is card issuers starting to, I would characterize, restart originations but that's the marketing piece. That doesn't necessarily result in loan growth yet. I think that's the -- starting to spend money and starting to put new offers out in the marketplace that presumably would result in some loan growth either in second or third quarter, but there's a lag on that between the marketing spend and when those originations go on their books and become loans. Broadly, I would say, what we hear from the U.S. customers is an element of confidence that wasn't in place certainly for most of 2020, certainly, the early parts of 2021. And I think as we've all seen vaccine rollouts in the United States really accelerate and now really, everyone over age 16 can get one, that's resulting in consumer confidence as we seen it in retail spending. And that you've seen banks in their earnings releasing reserves, so I think there's an element of confidence of we're moving towards a more normal economy. I would say, we're not there yet, but we saw some real increases what I would call in confidence and it's in our numbers in March and as we moved into April. So auto was stronger than card, right? So if you just kind of tier our structure, auto was stronger than card and identity and fraud was also very strong. Yes. First off, Craig, welcome. I think this is your first Equifax call or at least in recent times. So, it's great to have you covering the company. On the people side, I would say our employment will be fairly stable. There's some areas where we're investing, like in product resources, in some technology areas. But at the same time, I think you know, we've got plans to reduce some of our technology costs as the cloud transformation unfolds. So, there'll be some reductions in that area, which is in our framework. So, I wouldn't think about big changes in our employment. But you should think about Equifax being on offense, meaning we're investing with our strong performance. And, of course, our acquisitions that we talked about, the five acquisitions bring incremental employees into our headcount, which is in our framework that we've shared with you. With regards to the return to office, we've been open since last June. We've been very careful about that. It's been really up to our team, if they want to come in. We've limited our occupancy to 50%, no more than 50%, and of course, exercising all those protocols. And we've seen in the last -- I don't know, 30 to 60 days as vaccine rollouts have increased, an increase of people coming back to our office. And what we've been telling our employees, when you're vaccinated come back and start operating with Equifax. We also announced post whatever our full reopening is, which is hard to see what that date is. We're going to -- we introduced what we call an Equifax Flex Day, where we're going to have some flexibility in our workforce that they can pick on one day per week with their managers approval to work remotely. And it was really a reflection on that there are many benefits that we learned over the last year that we can be productive from working from home, but so-called 4/1, meaning we're going to work from the office at least four days per week is a reflection that we're a collaborative culture, the teamwork is how we operate, whether it's doing NPIs or technology or new customer solutions, we think that happens best in the office. And to your question about we don't expect our cost to go up. We haven't changed our footprints. We don't expect them to go down as a result of this return to office. Yes, we don't talk a lot about price, but if you think about our U.S. businesses, which is really - I'll leave our consumer business aside GCS, but you think about USIS and Workforce Solutions. We focus on new product rollouts that become incremental margin and many times at a higher price point because they're delivering incremental value to the customer. So, that's one way to get revenue pricing margins. Workflow Solutions is clearly our most differentiated business and differentiated data asset and has more ability to bring more value to our customers that we can monetize with different price points of the solutions we're delivering. And if you think about it, if you look at our hit rates now that are over 50%, and you go back two years ago when they were, I don't know, pick the right number, 40%, 50%-plus hit rate is more valuable to our customers, becomes a data asset that they can use more broadly in their solutions. So, Workforce is clearly a business that has more ability to drive its top line through multiple levers that we've talked about a couple of times on this call. Yes, I think, Toni, you got to remember, we have seen in the last 60 days, a weakening -- slight weakening of mortgage inquiries, which we rolled into our new framework. So, we took down mortgage by 300 basis points for the year, which we think is prudent, offsetting that and our ability to guide up is that our outsized and strong performance in non-mortgage in the quarter, and our expectation is that will continue. John? Yes. Toni, I think about it quite naturally. What we saw and what I would have done when I was running GE Capital's credit card business is when you get in a tough economy, you tighten up originations and stop spending marketing money. In the first place you stop spending marketing money is with third parties, meaning lead gen companies. Same thing when you come out of a difficult environment, the first place you'll start is your own, you have more confidence in that. It's generally lower cost. It's more efficient desire predictability, and that's what we're seeing. And we do expect our indirect to improve, but it's going to be lag some at least the framework we put together and happened later in the year. Yes. There aren't many of them. We know who all of it \u2013 they all are, and we talk to them all the time. There are a handful of companies like i2Verify and HIREtech. And as you may know, you've followed us for a while that we've made acquisitions like this over the last couple, three, four, five years. So, when they're available, we like to make them. And maybe I'll just touch on HIREtech first. HIREtech has what we thought was a very attractive WOTC Solution, particularly delivered through third parties to companies. And again, one of the ways to get records is to deliver value-added services like WOTC, like I-9, like Unemployment Claims like W-2 Management, like ACA to companies. And then in order to complete those services for them, which are regulatory requirements, you get access to records. And in HIREtech's case, we have a WOTC business so today, and - but there was -- we thought very attractive and how they deliver those solutions through partners. And we'd like to grow our partner WOTC business, which not only will bring the records they already have, but get access to records in the future. And, of course, there's a revenue stream just from providing those WOTC services. As John mentioned, they also have an Economic Recovery Credit, ERC, which is a very special and unique credit in 2021 that there's another way to gain access to records, which will benefit us this year. In i2Verify, a bit different in their approach to market. They have a very attractive. We like the team a lot. As we do in HIREtech, the i2Verify team was very advanced around relationships and how they went to market with non-profit organizations, with the healthcare industry or hospitals -- and hospitals and the education or think universities. And there's lots of employees in those kinds of organizations and companies, and they developed a very attractive go-to-market of how they built relationships and delivered those services. And so we like that, which is why we were very attracted to i2Verify, and we're looking for them to really expand our relationships through different services we provide to those kind of companies and then allow us to get records in order to grow our records. And again, at 90 million uniques, we're very pleased with the scale of our database, but there's a lot of runway between 90 million and 155 million. Yes. I think you know, we've been pretty clear that we've been talking for well over a year, maybe two years about the power of NPI, and that's not new to Equifax. It's not new to our industry. Our competitors are focused on new products. And it really is the fuel for growth that allows us to grow multiples of GDP. That's the inherent in the data analytics business. And we talked a bunch about our investment in the cloud transformation over the last three years from 2018 through 2020, the $1.5 billion we invested in our new infrastructure, we did that for lots of reasons. Sorry, we get the fire. Sorry, we're back. We had a fire alarm go off here, and we just got to shut it off. We're fine. Andrew, sorry, could you repeat your question again? Yes. I think I was talking about the cloud investment. We invested in the cloud because we knew it was going to give us cost benefits, security, a competitive advantage, but we really invested in the cloud to deliver new products and growth. And we've been really focused on that over the last 12, 18 months. We talked last year that we've been expanding our resources in new product capabilities. And we think we're starting to see the leverage of the cloud, our ability to bring new solutions to the marketplace. And our guide up was really \u2013 we increased our NPI rollouts last year to 139, which was a record. We're at 39 in the first quarter, which is up from 35. So, we've got more products in the marketplace. And you've got a commercial team that's out there selling them. So that's why we feel the confidence of increasing the guidance going forward, at least, for 2021. I don't want to get into 2022 guidance. We'll include that in our long-term framework, which we intend to put in place later this year, and the vitality index of new products will be central and really important to us in how we grow the business going forward. Yes. I think if you -- we've shown these charts before that Workforce Solutions have been consistently outperforming all markets that they operate in, including the mortgage market. And much more substantially than USIS. They just have more levers. So, they'll use the same levers that USIS use, which is price. So, if you increase price in an up or down market, you're going to have more revenue. New products is one where they just had more opportunities. And you've heard us talk over the last I don't know, four or five quarters about their increased focus on new products. Things like historically, we've had a single report that we'd offer, and now we're offering one with more history on it, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. And instead of having a report that we sell at $25, we've got price points at $150 and $200, and that provides real value to the mortgage originator. And we rolled out a product that's for co-borrowers. A lot of mortgages in the states that have a dual career couple underwritten -- underwriting the mortgage and so we have a new solution there. Instead of having $225 reports polled, we've got a $200 solution. We've got solutions and new products now that encourage more polls. So, we'll have a solution where we sell it at a higher price point that includes multiple polls. So, new products is a real lever for Workforce Solutions. Of course, records we've talked multiple times in this call, adding records drive set rates. Because remember, we're getting inquiries on those mortgages, all those credit cards or auto loans, but your question was around mortgage. We're getting inquiries for the full database, the full set of consumers. And I say, we only have 90 million uniques. And as we grow that database, those hit rates go up automatically. So, records are a very central part of Workforce Solutions' ability to outgrow the mortgage and all their underlying markets. There's also a large portion of mortgages we don't see still. We only see, I think it's 65% of mortgages. So, we're out in the marketplace talking to those that are not doing business with Equifax and are using pay stubs or some other mechanism for approving the income and employment elements of a mortgage application to use our solution. The move from a customer, we saw a lot of our customers, I think, over one-third that access our data through the web. Meaning they're actually keying in the mortgage applicants social security number, date of birth, name, et cetera. There's a lot of friction there, meaning it doesn't happen in every mortgage application for that originator or we don't get multiple polls. So, going to system-to-system integrations is a big part of our strategy, and we're increasing those system integrations every quarter. We've got a dedicated team that works with mortgage originators to have them do system-to-system integrations. Another lever is the number of polls in a mortgage application. In a credit application -- on the credit side, there's four to five polls in many mortgage applications of the credit file. Historically, there was more like one to two in the income employment data. We're seeing the more sophisticated originators pull our data more often on every mortgage application. And remember, you think about a couple of elements. Number one, it's a big ticket transaction, $250,000, $300,000, $400,000 or more is the loan. And then second is the mortgage originator that's spending $4,000, $5,000 in the application process, they want to make sure that they're spending time on an applicant that they can close on. So, not only verifying their credit multiple times in the process, but making sure that applicant is still working and how much they make as a part of the application process is another big opportunity. So, there's just a half dozen of very strong levers that all have dedicated teams on it, and they've been executing very strongly on those levers. Another kind of overriding macro, if you will, for Workforce Solutions is just really the scale of the database. Now, if you go back at our last economic crisis in 2008, 2009 or pick your year, go back three, four, five years ago, our database in TWN might have been having hit rates of 30% or 40%. Now that we're well over 50%, it becomes a very valuable data asset and all of our customers know that you enhance the credit decisioning of an applicant, if you add is someone working and how much do they make to their credit file. That drives predictability. And so, when you have a database that almost is at a catalyst or an inflection point of going over 50%, we think that's another positive factor. Of course, we've got a lot of opportunity and a lot of work to do in workforce. And we're quite optimistic about the long-term impact of our fastest-growing business with margins and revenue growth rates that are highly accretive to Equifax. Yes. We wouldn't have visibility to that. But what -- I'll tell you what we do find is that all of our finance \u2013 this is a macro that started before COVID is that all applications, all uses of data, whether it's in banking, credit cards, mortgage, auto, lending, telco, all of our customers want to use more data. And they want to use more differentiated and alternative data because it enhances the predictability of the decision they're making. And let's use originations. And that's why you're seeing more alternative data being used. We think our cloud transformation is going to differentiate us and the ability to house that data to \u2013 and as well as surface and deliver that data to our customers. And then, of course, TWN, we talked earlier in this conversation in the call this morning about the power of that data set in that credit decisioning, meaning, is someone working, how much are they making added to the credit file and the other alternative data is very, very powerful. Sure, Simon. We had a dropped off, too. We had a fire alarm go off, but there was not a fire. So we were off for a few minutes, too. Do you want to go a little bit on it? It's just the growth rates by segment that we raised earlier. Yes. Okay, sure. So we indicated that we expected Workforce Solutions to be up over 20%. We indicated we expected USIS to be up mid to high single digits. We indicated we expected international to be up constant currency high single digits and that we expected GCS to be down mid-single digits and also expected GCS to be down mid-single digits in the second quarter. Yes, I would say, Simon, we're counting on a recovery of the international markets, but I think there's still a pretty decent amount of uncertainty in those markets. And you follow it, too, but Canada's vaccine rollout is really slow. And they've got lockdowns back in place in other markets. Australia's vaccine rollout is like really slow, like, not happening. I'm not sure when they're going to get a vaccine rollout. So, there when kind of locked down, there's still pressure on that economy. UK, they've got the vaccines out there, but they've still got high COVID cases. So, we've got lockdowns in the UK. With some other markets, a big market for us like Chile, they used, I think, the Chinese vaccine that turns out to be not effective. So, it rolled out. So, they've got lockdowns in place. So, I think the -- we expect them to recover. We expect the vaccines to get in place during 2021, but I think there's still some uncertainty there. And in our framework, we do -- we are counting on and expect to see some improvement. And you saw in our numbers, we've got some markets that are adapting to COVID, like the U.S. did. I think some of the international markets took longer to adapt, meaning the U.S. in some markets like auto and others in second and third quarter last year figured out how to sell cars virtually and other things. That happened more slowly from our perspective in international markets, but you're starting to see that. Canada had a very strong quarter for us in the first quarter. Australia did too, even notwithstanding these COVID lockdowns. So, we expect international to improve, but I'd say that we're watching it because there's still some uncertainty there. And the acquisitions are all accretive to generally, our revenue growth rates in each of the businesses. For example, Kount, we're really excited about the space they play in and their historical growth and the opportunities with the synergies between USIS and Kount on both the top line and some of the cost synergies. Yeah. I think we tried to be clear and we used this phrase last year for -- I think all four quarters last year that we feel like based on the wins, the USIS and Sid Singh and his team are landing in the U.S. marketplace in USIS space that we're competitive and we're winning in the marketplace. We've talked about the deal pipeline. We shared some metrics earlier in the call that it's up 30%. And so, what are the factors there? There's no question, we were pressured in 2018 and 2019 after the cyber event competitively. We were in the penalty box with a lot of customers. It took us a while to get out of them, meaning through the end of 2019. In 2020, we were on, what I would characterize in the first quarter, kind of, a normal competitive footing and then COVID hit, which created some visibility challenges, perhaps for you. But in that time frame, we kept a consistent dialogue with you that USIS was winning and was competitive in the marketplace. So you've got the commercial -- the post cyber event is clearly behind us. We're on our strong footing commercially. We think we're advantaged commercially with the cloud transformation. When you think about it, it's actually quite logical. If you're a commercial leader and you're out talking to one of your customers and say, hey, Equifax just invested $1.5 billion in our technology to support you. That creates a very positive dialogue. And then you add to it Equifax's differentiated data assets that we have, data assets, our competitors don't, which we think helps us commercially. And you can lead with TWN, obviously, which, as you know, USIS sells in the marketplace for us is one commercial team. They sell TWN to all our financial customers. And then add to it, NCTUE, IXI, DataX. So we think that's advantaging us. The leveraging of the cloud for new products is clearly taking hold. USIS is -- the rest of the business rolling out these new cloud-based products that we think are giving us an ability to bring new solutions to drive incremental revenue with our customers in the mortgage and non-mortgage space, which is quite positive. So we think there's a lot of momentum. There's still more to do. But the team is really focused. I think the last point I'd raise is that, we brought in no longer, a new leader, two years ago, Sid Singh, but he used 2019 to rebuild the business and the team and continue that in 2020, they're hitting on their strides. We relever the team. We've got a new Chief Revenue Officer. We've got Sid, who's a very commercially oriented leader. I think that's benefiting USIS also in how they're operating in the marketplace. Remember, we took our mortgage guidance down, so you should think about that. That clearly is a negative impact on that. And the whole offset is from nonmortgage is why we're raising it. John? Yeah, George, we talked to you before and I was clear earlier in the discussion this morning that we're intending to put that in place in 2021. We said in February and kind of same comment to you now is that we wanted to see a few more quarters -- a few more months perhaps of the COVID recovery. Things are still -- volatile is the wrong word, but still evolving. The mortgage market from just, I don't know, less than 90 days ago is - has softened. And, of course, the COVID recovery, I would say, is stronger than we anticipated in the last 60 days in the non-mortgage side. So, we want to see a few more months of that, but we know what we want to do. We're ready to do it. We've given, hopefully, you a lot of indications of how that's going to be framed. And it's our intention to put that in place in concert with likely an Investor Day. In \u2013 before the end of the year in 2021. I think there's a couple of things there, Jeff. And we've said to you and others repeatedly, there is a degree of inflection point. When you're north of 50% kind of hit rates, we think it becomes a more valuable asset in so many other cases. And I'll just use my example, 10 years ago, when I was at GE Capital, we didn't use the data asset because the hit rates were, I don't know, 25%. It just didn't make sense to put it in your workflows when you can only hit 1-and-4 customers. Now that you're over 50, we believe there's an element of inflection there. We also believe that cloud transformation is a big deal. And that's across Equifax, but workforce is benefiting from that. For example, ingesting the amount of records, but even more complex is ingesting the amount of employers that we now have in the data set. If you go back 18 months ago, we may have had 150,000 employers or 200,000, something like that. And now we're well over 1 million companies contributing a data set. We couldn't have done that without the cloud. And remember, when we get those data records, they're generally in different formats, and your cloud capabilities allow you to normalize those and then put them in a format that you can bring them to your customers. And then I won't go through all of the other levers that workforce has. But you know, they're pretty wide and broad. And with the scale of the business, meaning the infrastructure we have, the people, we have the resources to invest in really dedicated teams. And I don't mean to repeat this, but we have a dedicated team focused on records, period. That's hard to do. And this is a multi-person team. We have a dedicated team focused on working with our mortgage customers on system-to-system integrations. That's all they do on the benefits. We have another team that's focused on convincing the mortgage originators that aren't doing business to go forward with us. The scale of our business almost becomes a flywheel that allows us to invest in the business. So, I think there's all those, just going back up, what are the bigger macros. It's -- I would say, the inflection point of being north of 50 and the cloud transformation taking hold. And if you followed us for a long time, you know that on a new product front, you didn't hear a lot out of Workforce Solutions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 around new products. Now, with the cloud, we can really take advantage of this data asset. And you know the power of coming up with a new way to monetize a data asset that you've already paid for, meaning the dual borrower mortgage solution; the mortgage solution that allows a mortgage originator to have multiple pools. The mortgage solution that has 36 months of history in it at a higher price point. Those are all opportunities that we've started to deploy in 2020 when we had the EFX Cloud really taking hold inside of workforce and across Equifax. And those are the kind of solutions, you should see. And as you know, central to our EFX2023 strategy is really leveraging the cloud around innovation and new products and we're excited about our progress there. But we're in early innings on this. Hey, Kevin. Yes. So, I think our business continues to be heavily transaction focused and likely will continue to be. What -- increasingly, you see minimums in our contracts, but generally not subscriptions, right? We do have some products that are subscriptions, like you said, monitoring services tend to look more like subscriptions. But the vast majority of our revenue generation continues to be driven by -- continues to be driven by transactions. And we benefited from that, obviously, very substantially over the past several years. Businesses where you can -- where you see more things that look like subscriptions are, certainly the unemployment insurance claims business, you see things that look like subscriptions with minimum -- with volume caps in them. So, we have businesses that are structured like that. And we have some businesses that are somewhat more software-focused, where you see more subscriptions. But generally speaking, we're still heavily transaction-based and that will likely continue. Yeah. You talked about the non-farm payroll. There's a lot of runway there, and as you know, a lot of economic value as we grow the database in the traditional non-farm payroll or W-2 income. 1099 is a very big market. I think it's 30 million or 40 million people that have 1099-type income. That's a space that we're adding data records. We don't talk about those, because it's not in our $90 million or $150 million in total. Another data set that we're starting to add, and we have some records now is pensioner income. I think there's 20 million or 30 million defined benefit pensioners in the United States that receive monthly pension checks, either at the state, federal or corporate level. They're applying for credit products. So that's another data set that we're out there chasing. It just goes back to the power of the scale of our business, we have those relationships. For example, a company that we're collecting their active employees from many of those companies also process their pensioner income. So it's an opportunity for us to bring that income into our data set. Same thing with a payroll processor that's doing primarily W-2 income, they're also, in some cases can have 1099 income. So it's another way for us to build those out. So we've got a very clear focus of not only building out W-2, but going beyond that. Another focus that's in early stages is really just getting data around someone logging in or checking in and checking out of their employment, whether it's a restaurant worker logging in through their software that they use to operate in the restaurant, getting that data asset. We might not know how much they're making, but we'll know they're working. So it's another element of data. So we've got a broad focus there around going beyond W-2. Gary, you know this and just remember is that, USIS had a decent quarter in first quarter last year. I think was that 3.5%. Yeah, something like that in the first quarter last year. And the COVID pandemic really didn't hit them or us until the last two weeks of March. And that 3.5% was inside of the two weeks in March, which really were significantly impacted. So we felt quite good about the progress we have really all through 2020 that the team is really delivering. You've got a lot of factors there. We've already talked about it a bunch in the call about the commercial focus by the team. We think that's real. We think they're getting benefits already from the cloud transformation competitively, meaning wanting to do business with Equifax because we have a different technology infrastructure than our competitors. So that's a positive for them, whether it's on share. You can think about other factors like the NPIs. Those are -- a reminder, we were building NPIs in 2018 and 2019. We really couldn't sell them because we were in the penalty box. We started selling them in 2020, but that's really benefiting them, and we're continuing to accelerate our NPI rollouts. So I think that's a benefit for the business. And then there's an element of COVID recovery. I think we were clear that in March and April, we've seen some of their verticals move back much more strongly than they were earlier in the quarter and certainly stronger than they were in 2020. So I think that's part of that, too. Correct. I think that's fair. I think that's fair that the COVID environment masks their performance, which is why every quarter, we talked about their deal pipeline to at least give you a metric that we look at on what their commercial activity looks like."

During the call today, we\u2019ll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q4 2022 earnings conference call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full year 2023 guidance. We hope you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors may impact our business forth in filings with the SEC, including 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We'll also be making certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS for Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the financial results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. In the fourth quarter, Equifax incurred restructuring charge of $24 million, or $0.15 a share. This charge was principally incurred to reduce headcount in 2023 as we realign our business functions ahead of completing our technology transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark on Slide 4.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another very strong quarter to close out 2022 with continuing execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. Fourth quarter reported revenue of $1.2 billion was down about 4.5% and down 4% on an organic constant currency basis, both as expected against an unprecedented mortgage market decline, but above the high end of our October guidance from broad-based strength across Equifax and stronger NPI rollouts. Fourth quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $371 million with an EBITDA margin of 31%. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 per share was at the upper end of our October guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and John will provide more detail in a few minutes. Equifax US mortgage revenue was down 41% in the quarter, but outperformed the overall market by 27 percentage points with estimated US mortgage originations down 68%. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 84% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, were very strong with 12% constant currency and 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in October and at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. This strong growth was driven again by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions with 17% non-mortgage revenue growth overall and 23% non-mortgage revenue growth in Verifier. As I'll discuss more later, Government continued very strong in Workforce Solutions with growth at over 40%, and Talent and I-9 boarding delivered over 20% growth but were impacted by slowing US hiring in November and December. Delivering 20% growth in that vertical against a slowing hiring market was a very strong performance. And second, USIS nonmortgage had an outstanding quarter, delivering very strong double-digit B2B non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 19% online, which was much better than our expectations. And last, International delivered another strong quarter with 9% constant dollar and 8% organic constant dollar growth, led by very strong performance in Latin America. We continue to make strong progress against the final chapter of our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in 2022. Currently, about 70% of North American revenue is delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. During 2022, we made the decision to increase capital spending by approximately $175 million to a total of $625 million to accelerate the completion of our North American cloud transformation. The progress made in 2022 will enable the substantial completion of North America transformation and customer migrations this year, including decommissioning of applications in our major North America data centers. Capital spending will decline significantly in 2023 due to the strong progress at completing the cloud last year. Our new EFX Cloud infrastructure is delivering always-on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise-level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. New product innovation is also executing at a very high level. Our new product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and a 500 basis point improvement from the 9% Vitality Index last year and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term new product vitality goal. Our focus on new solutions, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud is paying off. As a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of Equifax revenue from new products launched in the past three years. As our fourth quarter performance highlights, we continue to execute very well, driving strong non-mortgage growth across Equifax and record levels of new product revenue. In addition to accelerating long-term revenue growth, two critical goals of our EFX 2025 strategic framework are significant and consistent EBITDA margin expansion and the lowering of the capital intensity of our business to drive our free cash flow. In 2023, we are executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation and a broader focus on operational process improvements. We will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023 as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers as we complete the cloud and other broader spending controls. Total spending reductions from these actions in 2023 are expected to be about $200 million with about $120 million reduction in expenses and an $80 million reduction in CapEx. I'll cover our 2023 plan in more detail shortly, but first, we'll provide more detail on our strong performance in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage performance with revenue growth up 12% in constant currency, led by EWS Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which was up 23%, led by Talent, which was up 19% and Government up 43%; EWS, I-9 and onboarding, which was up over 40%; USIS B2B online mortgage was up almost 20%; and Latin America was up over 30%, all very strong performances. Fourth quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 12% was at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in the US hiring activity impacting our Workforce Solutions Talent vertical. Non-mortgage revenue growth continues to be very strong across Equifax. Turning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter. Mortgage revenue outperformed the overall mortgage market as measured by originations by about 30% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year. And verifier non-mortgage revenue was again very strong with organic growth of 23% in the quarter and 40% for the total year. During 2022, we signed 10 new agreements with US payroll processors, including four in the quarter that will be added to the TWN database during 2023. Recently, we also signed a substantial direct relationship that added over 2 million new TWN records. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in existing partner records and the new direct contributors through our Employer Services business, are delivering continuing strong growth in our TWN database with current records of 6 million record sequentially, reaching 142 million records -- 152 million records with 114 million unique and over 600 million total current historical records from over 2.6 million employers. Industry-leading data security and operational processes as well as our ability to provide substantial value to our direct contributors and revenue share to our payroll partners are delivering exceptional record growth for Workforce Solutions. 114 million unique individuals in TWN deliver high hit rates and represent almost 70% of the 165 million US non-farm payroll. Adding gig and pension records, we have the ability to almost double our TWN records in the future, which is a big driver of EWS revenue and margins. As a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers, with the remaining contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. Workforce Solutions also continues to lead Equifax and new products, delivering a Vitality Index at over 2x of our long-term 10% vitality goal, which is a great proof point for the power of the Equifax Cloud to drive innovation in new products. Workforce Solutions Vitality Index has expanded from low single digits a short four years ago to over 20% vitality in 2022. Workforce Solutions, as you know, was the first Equifax business to be substantially complete with their cloud transformation over a year ago, allowing the team to fully focus on innovation and NPIs, leveraging their new cloud capabilities. The Work Number is also seeing accelerated expansion outside the United States in the UK, Canada and Australia. In January, Workforce Solutions signed an agreement with a leading UK payroll technology partner, obtaining access to over 40% of UK private sector employees. Workforce Solutions now has access to over 20 million active and historical records in Australia, Canada and the UK in addition to over 40 million active and historical alternative income records, including pension data and tax returns. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions delivered revenue of $508 million, down 4% in the fourth quarter. Revenue was slightly weaker than expected driven by slower growth in talent and onboarding businesses from declines we saw in US hiring in November and December. Verification Services revenue of $399 million was down 7%, driven by the unprecedented 68% decline in US mortgage originations. As mentioned earlier, EWS mortgage revenue outperformed the overall market by a very strong 30 percentage points, driven by strong TWN record additions, penetration, pricing and new product revenue growth with the strong adoption of our new mortgage 36 solution that was rolled out late last year. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents almost 70% of Verifier revenue, delivered strong 23% growth in the quarter. We saw continued very strong 43% growth in the Government vertical, which is almost 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, driven by strong growth in our Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services volumes. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong new product portfolio, including our new insights data at the federal state and local level. We expect to continue this strong growth in our government vertical in 2023 in a big $2 billion TAM. Talent Solutions delivered strong 19% growth in the quarter despite the impact of the weakening overall hiring, which is estimated to be down about 8% in the quarter. We outgrew this market decline by over 25 percentage points and delivered 19% growth, a very strong performance, driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing. In the first quarter, we will launch new products in the talent space targeted at the staffing and hourly segments designed to meet specific needs of background screeners in these high-volume segments, which will drive Talent growth. Employer Services revenue of $110 million was up 4.5% in the quarter due to strong growth in our I-9 onboarding and healthy FX businesses, which were up 17%. Our I-9 and onboarding businesses remained strong at 20% growth but were also negatively impacted by the declines in US hiring late in 2022. Our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses were down 11%, driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program expires. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we have not seen a meaningful increase in UC transactions yet. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 46.8% were lower than our October guidance, principally due to lower revenue growth in talent and onboarding related to the slowdown in US hiring. We expect EWS margins to return to about 50% in the first quarter and will be above 50% for all of 2023. The strength of EWS and uniqueness in value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in 2022. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter, outperforming the mortgage originations by 30 points and delivering strong 17% non-mortgage revenue growth. EWS is expected to deliver a strong 2023 and continue above market growth in the future. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue of $406 million was down 6.5% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 46% and was in line with our expectations against an unprecedented 54% decline in credit inquiries compared to the 50-plus percent in our October guidance -- 50-plus percent decline that we had in our October guidance. Revenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 8%, driven by favorable new mortgage business penetration, new mortgage products and new mortgage pricing. Credit inquiry performance continues to be less negative than estimated originations, reflecting higher relative levels of mortgage shopping behavior that we talked about before. At $67 million, mortgage revenue is now about 15% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $280 million -- $288 million, which represents over 70% [ph] of total USIS revenue was up 10%, with organic revenue growth of about 6.5%. This was a significant sequential increase and much stronger than the levels we expected in October. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was very strong at up 19% total and up over 13% organically, reflecting pricing and product rollouts as well as stronger volumes in banking as lenders continue to drive new originations. During the quarter, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in commercial, identity and fraud and auto with banking at just under 10% growth. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $72 million that was down 9% and slightly above our expectations. As we discussed during the year, we expect FMS to return to growth in 2023 with revenue up low single digits in the first quarter. USIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $50 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% from penetration and new product introductions. In 2023, we expect low single-digit growth from our US consumer direct business. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 35.3% in the quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially due to very strong double-digit B2B online non-mortgage revenue growth. EBITDA margins were down 400 basis points compared to prior year to declines in high-margin mortgage revenue. International revenue, as shown on Slide 9, was $284 million, up a strong 9% in constant currency and 8% organically. We're seeing broad-based execution from our international businesses with particular strength in Latin America NPI rollouts. Europe local currency revenue was up 3%, principally driven by 9% growth in our debt management business. We continue to see strong debt placements from the UK government as we have over the past several quarters. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was about flat in the fourth quarter and below our expectations principally due to lower new business penetration. Asia Pacific, which is our Australia business, delivered local currency revenue of 6%, driven by growth in our commercial, consumer, identity and fraud and HR identification businesses. Latin America, local currency revenue was up a strong 31% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team. Canada local currency revenue was up 7% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer, commercial, analytical solutions and identity and fraud revenue were partially offset by mortgage volume declines and lower direct-to-consumer revenue. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.8% were down 100 basis points sequentially and below our expectations due to a greater mix of lower-margin debt services revenue and higher costs principally from purchase data. Turning to Slide 10. 2022 was an outstanding year for new product innovation, and as you know, NPIs are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. We delivered over 100 new products for the third year in a row and a record full year Vitality Index of over 13% and a fourth quarter Vitality Index of 14%. The 13% Vitality Index in 2022 was up over 400 basis points above our strong 2021 results and over 300 basis points higher than our 10% long-term growth framework goal for new products and our vitality. New product revenue in 2022 was $650 million, up over 50% from about $420 million in 2021. And in 2022, over 90% of new product revenue was from non-mortgage products. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2023 at levels similar to the 13% we delivered in 2022 which is well above our 10% long-term NPI Vitality Index goal. And this equates to over $700 million of revenue in 2023 from new products introduced in the past three years. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new EFX Cloud capabilities and Single-Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top line growth and margins. Turning to Slide 11. 2022 was also a strong year for bolt-on acquisitions as we continue to focus on our strategic M&A priorities and growing our non-mortgage revenue. Since 2021, we've completed 13 acquisitions that are delivering $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. Our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1 to 2 points of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A aligned around our three strategic priorities: number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, building out our identity and fraud capabilities; and number three, adding unique data assets. We expect these strategic acquisitions to deliver growth synergies in 2023 and 2024 as we complete their technology and product integrations. Last week, we announced the acquisition of the Food Industry Credit Bureau, leading provider of credit information for the Canadian food industry, with over 90% commercial data coverage. This acquisition expands our commercial product offerings in Canada. We also continue to work closely with the Board of Directors of Boa Vista Servicos, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil on the proposed acquisition we announced in December. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. To the extent we're able to finalize terms with the Boa Vista Board, we expect the transaction to close in mid-2023. Turning to 2023 guidance on Slide 12. We ended the year with significant momentum in the underlying growth of our businesses and in the execution of our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. However, we also entered 2023 with a continuing decline in the mortgage market and broader economic uncertainty impacting our underlying markets. Our assumption for US mortgage market originations is a further decline of 30% in 2023, which is more than 30% below the lowest level of originations in the past 10 years. For perspective, MBA is currently forecasting 2023 origination units down about 22% versus our 30% assumption -- minus 30% assumption. Fannie and Freddie do not forecast units but are forecasting origination dollar volumes down 30% and 25%, respectively. In our planning, we've assumed the bulk of the mortgage declines in the first half with first quarter originations down about 55%. Secondly, in 2022, we saw hiring freezes and headcount constraints impact our background screening volume in November and December, and we expect these conditions to continue in 2023 with hiring down over 10% impacting our Talent Solutions and I-9 employee onboarding businesses. Even with these market impacts or market declines, we expect both businesses to grow over 10%. Finally, in our planning, we're expecting to see weakening in our key markets in the US, Canada, UK and Canada in 2023. We're assuming slowing growth in the US as we move through the year, although at this point, we have not assumed the US recession. Similarly, we are expecting to see economic slowdowns in Australia and Canada with perhaps a more significant slowdown in the UK. The slow growth in these markets compares to the 2% to 2.5% underlying economic growth, we assume in our long-term growth model. As we enter 2023, we have strong underlying growth across our businesses with execution of our EFX 2025 growth strategies. Despite the significant decline in the US mortgage market and slower economic growth across our major markets, we expect to deliver revenue growth at the midpoint of 4% in 2023. Total mortgage revenue should decline about 8%, over 20 points better than the 30% reduction in mortgage originations, and non-mortgage revenue should grow over 8%, which is within our long-term growth framework despite the slower economic growth in our major markets. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of about 6% in 2023. This reflects a mortgage revenue decline of about 8% or over 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow about 13% overcoming the expected 10% plus decline in US hiring and about 15% decline in our ERC businesses as that COVID program winds down. TWN record growth, strong new product rollouts and continued strong growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive Workforce Solutions outperformance. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of about 2% this year. Mortgage revenue is expected to decline about 7%, more than 20% -- 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. In 2023, USIS will begin to benefit from their new mortgage credit file that was rolled out late last year that includes telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process and support loans with the secondary mortgage market. Equifax is the first and only in the industry to provide these insights, which will be available to Equifax customers in the first quarter and can help create greater home opportunities for consumers across the US. We're also seeing the impact of pricing increases from one of our largest mortgage vendors that we pass on to customers at levels to maintain consistent margins. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 5% despite the slowing growth. Non-mortgage revenue growth of about 5% will be driven by strong commercial, identity and fraud banking and auto growth. And Financial Marketing Services expect to return to growth in 2023 after a disappointing 2022. International had a very strong 2022 with revenue up 12% in constant dollars, but we saw some weakening end markets late in the year, particularly in debt services. We expect International growth of 5% in constant currency in 2023. This is below our long-term growth framework for International of 7% to 9%, principally due to the expected weakening economic conditions in our major markets of the UK, Canada and Australia and also a decline in debt services off a very strong 2022. As we discussed last year, debt services revenue in 2022 was somewhat of a catch-up year as the UK government collections were put on hold during the COVID pandemic. We continue to expect international to operate within their 7% to 9% growth framework over the mid and long-term. NPIs will again be very strong, which is -- and consistent with last year's 13% Vitality Index, well above our 10% long-term vitality goal, and this will be led by Workforce Solutions in Latin America. As USIS and Canada complete their cloud transformation, we expect their NPI rollouts to accelerate as we exit 2023. As we complete our North American cloud transformation 2023, we will pivot to leveraging our differentiated data assets and new cloud infrastructure to drive new product rollouts and top line growth. Workforce Solutions will accelerate its focus on leveraging their new cloud capabilities, and USIS and Canada will complete their consumer credit, alternative data and IFS transformation this year. These are big milestones in completing the cloud that we've been building towards for almost five years. We're on track to deliver the cost and capital spending reductions from the cloud transformation that are central to our long-term growth framework. As I referenced earlier and as shown on Slide 13, our accelerated cloud transformation cost reductions and broader cost restructuring will deliver $200 million of cost and CapEx savings in 2023 that will expand our margins and free cash flow in the future. During 2023, we plan to reduce our total workforce of about 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10%. As we complete our North American cloud transformation in 2023, we expect to close about 15 data centers, consolidate development centers and continue to reduce our software application footprint, and we'll closely manage discretionary spending, including professional services. We expect these actions to deliver $200 million in spending reductions in 2023, representing $120 million cost and expense reductions or about $0.75 per share and $80 million in capital spending reductions. The savings in the first quarter are limited and accelerate in the second quarter and through the second half of 2023. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce our spending by over $250 million. The lower cost and capital spending accelerates as we move through 2023 from cloud transformation cost benefits and other costs and restructuring actions planned throughout the year. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improved significantly as we moved through 2023. In the first quarter, revenue is expected to be down 6% due to the about 55% reduction in mortgage originations. EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS are at their lowest levels in 2023 in the first quarter, principally due to the higher incremental margins from the declining mortgage revenue and the timing of the recognition of the majority of our annual equity incentive plan expense in the quarter. Normalizing for this timing compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter EBITDA margins are slightly below fourth quarter margins of 31%. As revenue growth improve throughout 2023 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, EBITDA will be up 4% or $70 million, in line with revenue growth, with margins flat to the 33.6% we delivered last year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be about $7.20 per share, down about 5% from 2022, principally reflecting higher depreciation and amortization of about $50 million as North American cloud system implementations principally completes, also from higher interest and other expense of about $60 million and a higher tax rate. Capital spending will decline by $65 million to about $545 million in the year, or about 10% of revenue as we move closer to completing our cloud transportation. We expect CapEx to decline again in 2024. We have a clear line of sight to executing these proactive actions that will expand our margins and drive our free cash flow. In addition to cost benefits, completing our North American cloud transformation will enable significant commercial benefits to drive market share and revenue growth, including our always-on capabilities, better data quality, faster data delivery and faster new product innovation. And we're beginning to see meaningful commercial benefits from our new Equifax Cloud technology transformation. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2023 assumptions and guidance and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. Our 2023 guidance builds on our strong 2022 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth, pricing and acquisition synergies. John?\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on 4Q 2022. As Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in slightly lower than expected in the fourth quarter at 31%, principally driven by lower-than-expected margins in Workforce Solutions, as Mark discussed, and also in International. Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $156 million, as we maintained investments to accelerate completion of North American cloud transformation. Capital spending will decline in 1Q 2022 to 2023 about $150 million and then sequentially further in each quarter of 2023, as we complete significant US and Canadian customer migrations. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be about $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. Moving on to 2023 guidance. Mark provided an overview of our planning assumptions of a 30% reduction in mortgage originations in 2023. As shown on Slide 15, at these levels, and again, using credit inquiries as a proxy for the mortgage market, in 2023, the US mortgage market will be substantially below any level we have seen in the past 10 years. 1Q 2023 is expected to see the mortgage market down about 55% year-to-year. Sequentially, as we move through 2023, we're planning on a more normal pattern of mortgage activity with mortgage originations increasing sequentially on the order of 15% in 2Q 2023 from 1Q 2023, 3Q 2023 being about flat with the second quarter and normal sequential decline in the fourth quarter versus 3Q 2023. We expect with these sequential patterns, US mortgage originations would be up slightly in the second half of 2023 versus the first half of 2023, and the fourth quarter of 2023 would be up slightly year-to-year. And at least the first half of 2023, we are expecting USIS to benefit from mortgage shopping behavior with better performance than originations. Slide 16 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 4% revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance of $5.325 billion. The 30% decline in the US mortgage market is negatively impacting 2023 total revenue growth by about 7 percentage points. The mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the mortgage market is expected to offset about 5 points of the negative 7 percentage point impact of the mortgage market on overall revenue growth. As a result, the expected 8% decline in Equifax mortgage revenue has a negative about 2 percentage point impact on overall revenue growth. Non mortgage organic growth is expected to exceed 7% on a constant currency basis and is driving about 5% of the growth in overall Equifax revenue. As Mark referenced earlier, the growth is broad-based across all three BUs and is within our long-term framework of 7% to 10%, despite the economic uncertainty across our major markets in the US, Australia, Canada and the UK. The acquisitions completed in 2022 and year-to-date are expected to contribute about 1% of growth to 2023. For clarity, this does not include revenue from the potential acquisition of Boa Vista. Slide 17 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 5% decline to the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.20 per share. Revenue growth of 4% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.6% would deliver 5.5% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margins in 2023 are expected to be about flat from the 33.6% we delivered in 2022. In 2023, the cost actions we are taking are expected to deliver about $120 million of expense reductions. These cost benefits are being principally offset by several factors. First, in 2022, variable compensation, including incentive and sales comp were at very low levels due to the substantial impact of the weak mortgage market on our performance. In 2023, our planning assumes we return to targeted levels of performance, and therefore, these compensation drivers. Royalties and cost for data and third-party scores are increasing as we continue to add new partners and broaden data sources. Also in 2023, we are also still incurring a level of redundant system costs as we continue to operate legacy North American systems prior to their decommissioning later in 2023. As we look beyond 2023, the impact of variable compensation moving to target and the cost of redundant systems in North America are behind us, and therefore, the benefits of our cost actions as well as accelerating high variable profit revenue growth are expected to drive significant improvement in EBITDA margins. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by just over $50 million in 2023, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4%. D&A is increasing in 2023 as we accelerate putting cloud native systems in production. The combined increase in interest expense, net other expense and tax expense in 2023 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by just over six percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates and also the increased debt from our 2022 acquisitions. Our estimated tax rate of about 26% is up about 150 basis points from 2022 due to a higher mix of non-US revenue and lower tax benefits as we reduce capital and development spending. Slide 18 provides the specifics of our 2022 full year guidance that Mark discussed in detail. The slide includes additional detail on expected BU EBITDA margins as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. EWS EBITDA margins in 2023 of 52% are expected to be up from the 51.3% delivered in 2022, given the strong non-mortgage revenue growth from new products, penetration and pricing and the benefits of the cost actions Mark discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins at over 35% are expected to be down from the 36.8% delivered in 2022. USIS is also benefiting from cost actions. However, revenue growth at 2%, again, due to the impact of the US mortgage market decline, is resulting in the year-to-year margin decline. International EBITDA margins at 27% are expected to expand versus the 25.7% delivered in 2022, driven principally by pricing and the 2023 cost actions. Corporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization, is increasing in 2023 relative to 2022 due to the increases in incentive and equity compensation from the lower levels incurred in 2022 that I referenced earlier. Corporate functions such as finance, legal, HR and others are reducing costs in 2023, consistent with our cost actions. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Slide 19 provides our guidance for 1Q 2023. As Mark discussed earlier, 1Q 2023 is expected to have the largest year-to-year decline in the US mortgage market that we'll see in 2023 at down about 55% as we compare to the relatively strong mortgage market in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the strong expected non-mortgage constant currency growth of about 9%, we will see a decline in 1Q 2023 revenue about 6% at the midpoint of our guidance. 1Q 2023 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 29%, down about 200 basis points sequentially. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are up sequentially from 4Q 2022 driven by Workforce Solutions delivering about 50% EBITDA margins in the quarter, which offsets declines at USIS and International. The decline in EBITDA margins in 1Q 2023 sequentially from 4Q 2022 is driven by higher corporate expense, specifically the higher incentive and equity compensation costs referenced earlier. The bulk of the expense related to our equity plans occurs in the first quarter and is reflected in corporate. Excluding the impact from the sequential increase in equity compensation expense, EBITDA margins are approaching flat sequentially at just under 31%. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q 2023 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter. Revenue increases sequentially in 1Q 2023 relative to 4Q 2022. We're not seeing the expected increase in EBITDA margin sequentially in the first quarter, driven by the same factors impacting all of 2023 that I referenced earlier and the fact that there is limited first quarter benefit related to our 2023 cost actions. In the second quarter of 2023, we will see both the benefit of reduced corporate expense and increased benefits from our 2023 cost action supporting growth and EBITDA margins. Business unit performance in the first quarter are expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 8.5% year-to-year due to the about 55% decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue will continue to deliver double-digit growth. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 50%, up over 300 basis points sequentially, driven by sequential revenue growth from new product and pricing actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to be down about 5.5% year-to-year, again, driven by the about 55% decline in the US mortgage market. USIS credit inquiries are expected to somewhat outperform the overall mortgage market due to consumer shopping. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in non-mortgage expected to be up mid single digits. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32%, down sequentially due to negative mix from growth in core mortgage and higher overall mortgage royalties as well as the normalization of incentive costs that I referenced earlier. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to data fabric that are occurring principally in the first half of 2023. International revenue is expected to be up about 5% in constant currency. The weakness relative to the strong 4Q 2022 growth of about 9% is principally a decline in the UK debt management business as we are now comparing to the very strong 2022 revenue driven by catch-up in our UK government business in 2022 as the UK government suspended collections during the pandemic. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 22%, down sequentially due to seasonally lower revenue in Canada and UK CRA and normalization of incentive costs as well as higher data costs. We're expecting adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2023 to be about $1.30 to $1.40 per share. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion of revenue with 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than when we first discussed in November of 2021, our goal of achieving these results in 2025. The US mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down over 35% from the normal 2015 to 2019 average levels we had discussed is expected to deliver $7 billion of revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of 2021. However, recovery in the mortgage market around the order of two-thirds of the lost volume is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal in 2025. We're focused on driving above-market growth including -- through accretive acquisitions and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed as part of our data and technology cloud transformation and needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins. We'll continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion and 39% EBITDA margin goals as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 20. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with above-market growth in 2022, more than offsetting the significant 55% decline in the US mortgage market originations. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of strong above-market double-digit core revenue growth and strong double-digit 12% non-mortgage growth, reflecting the power of the EFX business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. At the business unit level, first, Workforce Solutions had another outstanding year, powering our results, delivering 14% revenue growth and strong organic non-mortgage growth of 24%. TWN current records reached $152 million, up 12%, and total records surpassed 600 million. Workforce also delivered a Vitality Index of over 20% from innovative new products and solutions, leveraging their cloud capabilities while further penetrating the high-growth Talent and Government verticals. USIS had a very strong finish to 2022 with fourth quarter non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 7% organic, driven by online non-mortgage growth of 19% total and 13% organic. The USIS team remains competitive and is winning in the marketplace. International delivered 12% local currency growth, their second consecutive year of double-digit growth. And our 2022 Vitality Index of 13% was a record as we delivered over 100 new products for the third consecutive year in a row. And since 2021, we completed 13 strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen Equifax and identity and fraud that we expect to deliver over $450 million of principally run rate revenue going forward. And sixth, we made significant progress in 2022, executing against our EFX cloud, data and technology transformation with about 70% of North American revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. And we're laser-focused on completing our North American migration in 2023 to become the only cloud-native data analytics company. We're in the early days of leveraging our new cloud capabilities but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities and accelerate our top line. Our strong progress on the cloud allowed us to accelerate cost savings and launch a proactive restructuring across Equifax that will deliver $200 million of cost savings in 2023 that will expand our margins to 36% as we exit 2023 and position us for an uncertain economic environment. As we look to 2023, we're committed to completing our North American data and technology transformation, while delivering continued above-market revenue growth and a substantial and consistent EBITDA margin growth and a reduction in capital intensity that is a key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. As mentioned earlier, the cost actions were taken in 2023 reducing our spending by $200 million this year and over $250 million in 2024 will expand our margins and position us for a more uncertain economic environment. I'm energized about our strong above-market performance in 2022, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new EFX cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets that are now in our single-data fabric and our market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that, operator, let me open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Mark, you said you assumed a weakening economy pretty much globally but not a recession. But I guess my question is more the weakness that you've assumed, the magnitude of what you're seeing already today versus what you're assuming gets worse, if that makes sense?\nMark Begor: Yes. So I think there's a couple of levels there, Manav. As you know, we've been living through a mortgage market recession here in the United States for the last nine months and that's going to continue. And it's really unprecedented. So I think you and our investors understand that pretty clearly. It's really a massive impact on our business. And what's positive is our non-mortgage businesses are performing exceptionally well. We talked about where we've seen the impact of hiring declines in late in the year. We expect that to continue being down about 10% in 2023, and that impacts our Talent business and also our onboarding and online businesses. So that's certainly in our outlook. And then we did factor in what we would characterize as an uncertain or slowing economic environment really more in the second half of 2023. It's hard to forecast where the economy is going to do, but it certainly feels like at these higher interest rates and higher inflation, and you've got the impact of mortgage and now in the hiring space that we're going to see slowdowns as we go through 2023.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Just to clarify on that. I guess, can you talk about what you assume more on the, call it, card and auto side because those things still find today that -- how much you're assuming? And then, John, just for you on free cash flow. Can you just walk us through what the working capital moves this year was and how we should think about what free cash flow will be in 2023?\nMark Begor: Yes. So on your first half of your question, John can take the second. You're correct, Manav. In a lot of verticals, we haven't seen that economic impact yet. We're expecting to see that as we go through 2023. So that's a part of our guide and a part of our outlook in verticals like cards, like P loans, like auto, we've seen some limited economic impacts there. But as you point out, cards, for example, are still operating quite well. But given where interest rates have been and where they're going and where the Fed is signaling they're going to take them and the challenge of taming inflation, we think it was prudent to include in our outlook for 2023 a softening of the economy as we go through the year.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: As you look around outside the US, right, we saw a weakening in the UK. That's already occurred, started to happen in the fourth quarter, and we saw relatively weaker performance in some of the other markets around the world as well. So to free cash flow -- so as we look through 2023, Manav, we're expecting to see expanding margins, as Mark talked about, and we're expecting to see, obviously, therefore, expanding EPS as well, and we're also expecting to bring down capital spending. So we expect to see very nice growth in free cash flow as we move through 2023 sequentially, as we go through the quarters. In terms of working capital, as we've discussed in prior calls, as we were going through a significant billing system migration, we did see some increase in our accounts receivable. The bulk of that is now completed. We've completed all of North America, and there's just -- there's a little bit more to go as we go through 2023 in some of our international operations. Our internal metrics are showing a nice improvement in terms of our operational performance in those systems in terms of what we're seeing in terms of collections activity. And so although we haven't really seen it yet in the numbers you would have seen in the fourth quarter, we're expecting to start to see some benefit as we move through 2023 in terms of AR, which would affect overall working capital. So net-net, I think free cash flow, we're expecting to see, obviously, expanding margins, improving profitability, lower CapEx and then improvements as we move through the year in working capital in general.\nQ \u2013 Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Steinerman: Hi. John, I just want to make sure I understand the $120 million of OpEx reduction on Slide 13. Is this $120 million for 2023 could be realized in year, or is that a run rate by the end of the year? And then I have a follow-up question.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: So that's realized in year.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: That's correct, yeah.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: As John pointed out, those will be executed principally the actions of the contractors and attrition in some Equifax FTEs will be executed in the first quarter, so the benefits will accelerate as we go through second, third and fourth. And then as we said, we get a benefit -- positive benefit in 2024 from the full year impact of that.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Steinerman: Okay. And then on the $120 million of expense savings, OpEx savings, is this really an acceleration of the original plan, or does this add to total target cost savings of the cloud transformation?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yeah. It's a combo of the two. We tried to be clear about that, Andrew, in our comments because of the extra efforts and additional work we did in 2022, it's allowed us to accelerate the cloud savings that we've talked to you about for multiple years. So a big piece of the $120 million is the cloud savings, but there's a meaningful increment to that of just a broader restructuring of the company to improve our efficiencies and how we operate the company. Some of that from the investments of the cloud that are outside of technology just allow us to operate more effectively. So it's a combo with the two.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your questions.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to dig into the Talent Solutions piece. It definitely seems like there was some softness there compared to what you guys were expecting. And I know you kind of mentioned that hiring was a headwind and became more challenging. But I guess, was the softer result in that sub-segment of EWS, was that purely a kind of quantity and kind of hiring volume headwind, or did you see any clients like trading down to kind of less expensive products or doing anything else in kind of that area that might have caused some pressure?\nMark Begor: No. Our analysis of it is it's all Q and when we talk to our customers, meaning there's just less background screens happening. I think we were watching this as we went through the fourth quarter. I think all of us saw companies as we went through the tail end of the year and they've accelerated in the first quarter here, announcing layoffs, announcing hiring freezes. That all is going to impact the hiring market. It's a bit bifurcated. I think we all know that the hiring at the, call it, the hourly wage area is still very strong. So that really wasn't impacted. This is more white collar impact, where companies are just tightening their belts and being more cautious around hiring. So we haven't seen any impact from our new product rollouts, the penetration that we have. And just as a reminder, this is a $2 billion TAM for us, is Talent. And we have a lot of penetration opportunities, meaning we're continuing to work in to bring new solutions and convert our customers from their manual work to digital, and that's what really allows us to outgrow a declining market, which we expect to continue to do in 2023. And then as we also mentioned, that same hiring impact where companies are tightening their belts around adding new resources impacted our onboarding or our I-9 business in the latter part of the year, we expect it to impact in 2022. As we said in the comments earlier, we expect both of those businesses to grow double-digit even with those market declines because of the new product capabilities, the new penetration opportunities that we have and, of course, our normal pricing that we rolled out on a 1/1, on January 1.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just my kind of follow-up was on pricing. I know kind of last quarter, you guys mentioned that pricing would be a tailwind in 2023 to margins. And I know like the 1Q guide kind of implies a couple of hundred basis points of pressure on EBITDA margins. I get some of that's seasonality. But is some of this that compared to what you guys saw in 4Q that just volumes in mortgage and some of the other areas are just facing pressure that's offsetting some of those price effects that went into place on 1/1, or did you got temper in any of those?\nMark Begor: Yes, I'll let John jump in. No change in what we told you we were going to do in October and price and what we actually did. Obviously, what's happened is the mortgage market -- first off, we have a very challenging comp in the first quarter and the second quarter versus last year. A year ago, the mortgage market was super strong. So you start with that, and that was as expected, although as we talked about, we've reduced our mortgage outlook for 2023 from what we thought in October. So that puts pressure on the quarter and on the year, from a margin standpoint. There's some small pressure from the lower growth in talent and onboarding in I-9 because of the tightening belts around hiring taking place, but the bulk of the first quarter impact is what John described of, really, from a cost standpoint in 2022, our incentive compensation was well below target because of the decline in the mortgage market. As John said, we expect 2023 to be paying at target. So that's a higher expense to us. That flows through the year. And then we typically have in the first quarter when we make our retention equity grants to our team, an equity expense that takes place. And there, I don't know, what else would you add, John?\nA \u2013 John Gamble: No. Just in terms of price and product, you can see the benefit of price and product in the fourth quarter, obviously, in USIS. Very strong performance in online. We saw volume in banking. But we had very strong performance in auto and in banking and lending and cards. So -- and some of that was product and some of that was price. And you're certainly seeing it in the first quarter in EWS, right? As Mark mentioned, pricing increases going in January, and we're seeing the benefit of both product and price and in EWS with their margins expanding in the first quarter. So no difference, and you're seeing it in the performance of the business.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: I think, John, you also said in your comments that if you look at first quarter versus fourth quarter and isolate around these expense items around incentive and equity, our margins are basically flat, which means we're absorbing a weaker mortgage market than the fourth quarter and still getting the benefits of operating leverage and price and everything else to kind of offset that ex the cost items that we had that we talked about.\nQ \u2013 Kyle Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks. Obviously, still a lot of volatility in the mortgage market. Is there any way to think about kind of purchase versus refinance? And as you get into 2024, I know 2023 is hard enough, but do you expect a little bit more recovery in refinance off of 2022, or just any way to think about kind of that base level of originations and how it trends over the course of the year?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: I'll let John jump in. As you might imagine, refi is virtually gone, right? Refi really disappeared from the mortgage market, I don't know, six months ago as rates started increasing. We don't anticipate refi coming back until there's a change in interest rates, meaning that there's some interest rate decline. What's really very unusual, and we've never seen before is the meaningful decline in purchase volume at this level. I think as John pointed out, our outlook for 2023 as mortgage inquiries 30% below the 10-year average. And that's really -- the 10-year average includes purchase and refi. So you've got purchase down dramatically. So at some point, purchase volume should improve. There's no question. If it's 30% below a 10-year average. Now we're assuming that doesn't happen in the second half. Should it improve in 2024, I think it's part of it's tied to what's happening in the economy. Are we stabilized around inflation and interest rates, if the interest rate increase has flattened out and consumers that are thinking about a home can have some confidence around where the economy is going. That should help purchase volume. But at some point, whether it's in 2024 or 2025, the mortgage market should move up on the purchase side as the economy stabilizes to get back to that, call it, 10-year average. It's never had this kind of an impact. Of course, we've never seen interest rate increases at this pace ever before. Add, John?\nJohn Gamble: I think you covered it quite well, yes.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. And then just real quick, as you think about kind of -- you mentioned the gig and pension workers a couple of times. Is that aggregation process similar to the traditional kind of record aggregation, or is it -- how does that process occur? And is it at the same price point, or is it kind of less profitable?\nMark Begor: Yes, no, they're very attractive records. We want them all. First, let me just make the point. We've got a long runway in traditional non-farm payroll. And I think as you saw a 12% growth last year in TWN records, was very, very strong. We signed, I think, 10 new partners that will come online in 2023. I think we said before that in our existing partners, think about payroll partners, there's meaningful records that we still haven't brought onboard with them. And there's a lot of incentives to do that. So that's kind of the base records. And over the last couple of years, we've scaled up resources that are going after pension records. I think it was in the third quarter last year, we signed our first pension partner to bring pension records into our data set. And we've got a pipeline of those. And process-wise, that's quite similar. If you think about pension records, they're probably in three different places, it's more than that, but three principal places. One is there are companies that are much like payroll processors that process defined benefit pensions for legacy companies that have those. So, going to those companies and developing those partnerships is strategy number one. Number two is large legacy companies process their own pension payroll, lots of them. So we're already collecting their employee payroll, so going in and collecting their pension payroll as a part of that strategy. So we know how to do that in just a matter of executing it. And then the third is in federal, state and local governments. Many of them have their own pension processing operations, so going to collect those records. So that's where we're going on the pension side. And then on the gig side, there's a lot of different strategies, individual companies, as you might imagine, going to get that and other entities that will have those gig records. And as we've talked before, it's the 114 million uniques that we have. There's about 220 million working Americans between non-farm payroll, gig and pension. So over the long-term, we've got the ability to double the scale of our records going forward. So that's a big lever for growth from workforce. I think as you know, the day we add a new record, we're able to monetize it instantly, because we're already getting inquiries for the record we don't have, right? With our 50-plus percent hit rates, as we add that 51st, 52nd set of data records, we're able to monetize instantly. So it's a very powerful part of the revenue engine and margin engine for Workforce Solutions, which is why we have such a dedicated team focusing on it. And if you think about the scale of our records, if you go back four years ago versus the 114 million uniques, we had something like 70 million and 300,000 companies. We ended last year with 2.6 million companies contributing their data to us. So the cloud has allowed us to really scale that, and there's a long runway for future growth.\nQ \u2013 Kevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 Kelsey Zhu: Hey, guys. On EWS margin, just kind of playing devil's advocate here. I want to understand a little bit better what's the biggest risk factors for margins to drop below your guide at 52%. Is this just mortgage market down more than 30%? Is it fields overachieving their targets again in maybe government the verticals? Just wanted to understand it a little better?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: John, this was on EWS margins. And the question was, we've said that we expect them to be 50-plus percent in 2023. What are the risks of that?\nA \u2013 John Gamble: Yeah. Let me talk about what's driving the margins to be at those levels, right? And it is heavily driven by what Mark talked about in terms of the record growth and therefore the outperformance relative to mortgage and the very, very strong non-mortgage growth. And then the cost actions that they're taking in order to not only maintain but enhance their margins as they go through the year, right? So EWS has been executing extremely well. Obviously, if the mortgage market was to be substantially weaker, that's very high revenue and high margin -- very high-margin revenue, that would be a risk. To the extent that there is risk to revenue in general, obviously, that can be risk to margins. But overall, we think we've taken a very reasonable view in terms of what 2023 looks like for EWS. Their execution has been very strong. The record growth has been very good. They've already executed their pricing actions. Their performance in new product has been outstanding, as Mark said, growing at twice the rate of our 10% goal for Vitality Index. So we feel like we've given a very balanced view of EWS as we look into 2022.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Maybe I just add to that, John. I think John mentioned, we rolled out our pricing actions late in the year in effective 1/1. So we know what those are. So that's kind of baked in. So that gives you a lot of confidence. As I mentioned earlier, and John did too, we already know some meaningful record additions that we've signed agreements for that will come in, in 2023. That's revenue and margin. We've got new products in workforce that were rolled out in 2022 that gets full year benefit in 2023. And we know our pipeline of new products we're expecting to roll out in the first quarter and second quarter from workforce going forward. So we think there's a -- we have a lot to give us confidence in our outlook there. And I think as John pointed out, to me, the factor would be if the economy is worse than we factored into this or if the mortgage market is significantly worse than we factored into this outlook, that would put pressure on that. And then we would take actions to respond to it.\nQ \u2013 Kelsey Zhu: Got it. Super helpful. And then just on Boa Vista, I think that would be a really nice addition to your LATAM portfolio. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on how you're thinking about their data assets and their strategy. On the merger -- on the acquisition call, you mentioned Boa Vista is very strong regionally. Is there a strategy to expand them kind of more towards nationally. Would appreciate any color you can share with us.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yeah, sure. So first, we're working to try to finish the acquisition. We've been negotiating since December with the Board of Boa Vista. We're pleased with the progress, and we're -- we want to conclude that. So that's kind of priority number one. But everything we talked about in December, we're still quite energized about. First and foremost, we would bring all of the Equifax capabilities to Boa Vista, whether it's our new cloud technology our products from around the globe, our big platforms like Ignite and InterConnect, we'd really bring their capabilities up substantially versus what they have today as a standalone number two credit bureau in the market. So that is a real positive. And the underlying business is performing exceptionally well. They've got strong double-digit growth. It's a big market in Brazil that's expanding. There's a lot of alternative data available there that we would want to focus on. We just see a bunch of potential. As we pointed out, they have some unique data outside of the normal banking data that's unique to Boa Vista, which is another element that we like about it. So we're focused on completing our negotiations, so we can try to move forward in closing it.\nKelsey Zhu: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question and all the details as usual guys. Mark, one of the things that happened, obviously, that drove your mortgage growth before the sort of collapse of the overall market was greater digital engagement. And I think you've talked to mortgage shopping a little bit today, too. Has -- given that mortgage volumes are down so much, purchase and refi, do you think there's anything that's structurally changed in the market such that your customers either want to engage more digitally with you or less digitally? So I guess what I'm asking is when mortgage recovers, is that lever, which was such a nice driver for you when volumes were booming, is that still there? Is it -- do you get more leverage, less leverage, about the same? Can we think about that structurally, if anything has changed?\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a great question, and we believe that it's more leverage or more opportunity to really drive our digital solutions. And if you think about a mortgage originator, that clearly is under significant financial pressure now because of the reduced -- the reductions in volumes. They're looking to improve their productivity, and the only way to improve your productivity is through instant decisioning. And the goal that they always have and the leading players in the space are working to really shorten the time frame between application and closing. As you know, it's a very long time frame and that time frame has cost involved in it. It also has risk involved in it around the consumer changing. It has risk involved in it, and the consumer deciding, I'm not going to buy the home, meaning you've spent a bunch of COGS on it. And you've heard us talk before, the average mortgage originators spending $5,000 of expense in a mortgage application if they can shorten the time and take labor out of it by using instant data. That's a positive. So we expect our conversations around using our Instant data, particularly around TWN, to accelerate in this environment, meaning we're going to become more embedded and more instant, which has been a trend, as you know, over the last couple three years, even in the stronger mortgage environment. Some of that over the -- in 2020 and 2021 was challenged by the -- just the pace of the volume they had. They didn't have time to really focus on changing their processes. Now they do. So it's clearly a focus of ours, and we think a positive going forward that Instant is going to drive speed and drive productivity. And that doesn't only apply to mortgage, that applies to really all our verticals. Think about government, think about talent. If we're able -- they're under cost pressure today. And those verticals, whether you're a background screener or a government agency, improving your productivity and improving the speed of the service you deliver is very, very valuable to them. And the way to do that is to use instant data from Equifax like our twin data, our income and employment data.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Jeffrey: That's very helpful. Thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first touch on a comment you made about a win for EWS and Verification Services within the U K, I believe. I wanted to ask, I think you said 40% of the private sector employee base, if I heard correctly, if you could clarify that. And then just curious, is that an exclusive relationship? And how important could that relationship be to getting a foothold or the pole position in the UK market, especially given a competitor of yours ambitions to build a similar business there?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yeah. I think we've been quite clear that over the last couple of years, as we completed the cloud, we were looking for new international markets to take Workforce Solutions into. As we talked on the call earlier, we've been building out businesses in Australia and Canada, and then most recently, a year ago, really in the first quarter, we launched our UK business using our new cloud capabilities and started to go into the market and talk to both individual contributors and payroll processors around adding data records. So we've made some positive traction over the last, I guess, four years in Australia and four years in Canada and over the last 12 months in the UK. We're looking to continue to grow and expand our capabilities there. We had -- I don't know the number, but we've had a handful of agreements signed in the UK, and we also signed an agreement with an entity that has tax data that is a proxy for income and employment. So that's been a positive addition in the UK. That gives us a lot of coverage so we can start rolling out solutions there. In Australia, we've got -- had an agreement with a pension administrator that brought that kind of data in, which is -- and also has the equivalent of W-2 type data in it that's quite accretive also. So it's clearly part of our strategy to continue to build out and invest into international footprint for workforce.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask a question on margins. It looks like you're expecting 30% plus type margins exiting the year. Is there any reason not to believe that's a good starting point for 2024? And I know you're not going to give guidance for that year, but mostly asking about if there are kind of cost-saving actions that you expect to still be underway that late in the year or if that fourth quarter number is a decent run rate to think about kind of a stable base for out years? Thank you.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: Yeah. So I think as we talked about in the presentation, we're expecting in the fourth quarter to get to 36% EBITDA margins, driven by some recovery in revenue but also really significantly by the acceleration of the cost actions. And the cost actions have a continuing benefit in 2024. So we're expecting additional benefit from the cost actions as we go into 2024. And we're also expecting to get additional cost benefits as we continue to complete the cloud transformation beyond North America, and we'll start to start to see some of those benefits occur in 2024. So we think we still have tailwinds on the cost side that will benefit our margins as we get into 2024. And then obviously, as we get closer to 2024, we can start talking about revenue. But there certainly are cost tailwinds that continue out of 2023 and into 2024.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Mark, I want to ask you a little bit about the main functional areas for headcount reduction. And what I'm trying to focus on is NPI has been a big driver and driving particularly non-mortgage growth? And how do you make sure that you're going to not harm kind of the goose that's laying the golden eggs in terms of the ramp of revenue that we should expect over the next several years by reducing your headcount by 10%. And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Begor: Yes. We're obviously quite thoughtful about that, as you might imagine, we want to make sure we're quite strategic about where we're doing it. Remember, the bulk of the actions are really related to the cloud transformation and accelerating those. So you've got a lot happening in technology. And the bulk of the actions are also in contractors. We hired a bunch of contractors to do the cloud work, and we're taking actions now when we complete that and decommission the legacy infrastructure to take those out. The rest of the actions, I would characterize as kind of normal focus and thoughtful focus around where do we have opportunities to be more efficient and more productive while protecting our focus on growth. And growth includes our new products.\nJohn Gamble: The only thing I'd add is as transformation completes the effort necessary to launch new products comes down substantially, right? It's one of the real benefits from cloud transformation that we've been talking about substantially. And as data is on fabric and everything is running through Ignite and InterConnect, then the level of investment necessary to launch those new products really starts to become something that we can do faster and cheaper. So as Mark said, we do a very good job of making sure we understand who is working on what. So as we reduce resource, we take it out of specifically transformation. But also as we go forward, we expect to get a lot of leverage in product launches in terms of being able to launch them faster and cheaper because they're on the transform cloud infrastructure.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you. And then\u2026\nJohn Gamble: And we've seen that in EWS by the way. It isn't something that we haven't seen. It's already happened in EWS.\nMark Begor: I think it's a great point, just to add on that. I think we mentioned on the call today that EWS new product rollouts, kind of 2x our long-term goal, north of 20% last year. And as you know, they were in the cloud a year ago, 18 months ago, and it's really shown what we envisioned happening, that the ability to bring more new solutions to market more quickly and more productively, as John pointed out, and efficiently would happen when you're cloud native. And that's part of what we expect to happen as we go through 2023, and we expect to continue in 2024, meaning we're going to have additional cloud benefits, as John pointed out in 2024, and then we get the full year run rate impact of our actions in 2023.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Got it, got it. And then just as a follow-up, I want to ask a little bit more about the competitive environment on The Work Number. You have a competitor in the market that's talking about signing more contracts with mortgage processors, and the vast majority of those are being -- putting them at the top of the waterfall. I'm just trying to square what they're talking about and some of the growth that they're trying -- they're communicating to the analyst community with kind of the market position and what you're seeing. I mean, are you seeing increased threats to your market position and the volumes that are coming through?\nMark Begor: We're not. I'd clarify with them if you want to try to understand better the top of waterfall comment. We don't know where that is or how that happens. We haven't seen them as a competitive threat in the marketplace. I think as you know, our record additions are quite substantial. We're -- we added in the quarter more records -- more unique records than they have. So we've clearly got an ability to attract new partnerships and individual relationships given the scale of the company. And then on the commercial side, our integrations are so deep and so substantial, we haven't seen an impact from a revenue standpoint. As you can see, the numbers are super strong in Workforce Solutions across all of our verticals, including mortgage. Their outperformance is exceptionally strong and hasn't slowed down.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: And just please remember, our historical record base is incredibly valuable to our customers, certainly in Talent, certainly in Government, increasingly in mortgage, we talked about mortgage 36 on in the conference call. And that's a place where we have tremendous strength in general and Verification Services and an even stronger position in historical records.\nQ \u2013 Shlomo Rosenbaum: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. First, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the bearishness within the mortgage forecast. The 30% inquiries decline I think would imply that originations are even lower than that. And I think just -- I know sometimes the third-party forecasts are a little bit optimistic. But I just felt like there was a pretty big delta there. And so if you could just go into maybe why your mortgage forecast is so bearish? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yeah. It's -- first off, it's very difficult to forecast. And I think we've shown over the last year that it's a hard thing to do. We've been pretty good about forecasting inside of a quarter, meaning out for a couple of months because the trends are pretty clear on what we're seeing on a daily and weekly basis. But as you get out a couple of quarters in this uncertain environment, it's much more challenging. And John, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe for the last year we've had our outlooks south of the other forecasts, like MBA and stuff consistently. So that's not a new approach for us. And Toni, as you know, we have real visibility to originations that are actually happening on a near-term basis, which is what we try to factor into our forecast. And you could call it bearish or conservative or, in our case, we tried to put it the most realistic outlook in place, that's what we put out there.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: Just a reminder, EWS, which is the bulk of the mortgage business, right, their transactions tend to look a lot more like originations, right? USIS does have that shopping behavior, which is better. But EWS now it's really much closer to originations. It's a much better proxy. And so also, as we talked about, I mean, what we did is we looked at run rates and then it just assumed kind of normal seasonality. I think what you're hearing from some of the third-party forecasters is an expectation of some type of substantial recovery in the mortgage market. That could occur, and if it does, we'll benefit, okay? But right now, what we're assuming is we're going to see a market that looks a little more normal in terms of its seasonality versus this year, and we're going to wait to see that recovery before we start saying it's going to happen.\nQ \u2013 Toni Kaplan: Terrific. And I wanted to ask a little bit more broadly on consumer spending. When you think about your -- what are you seeing, I guess, in year-to-date trends and how are you expecting that to play out throughout the course of the year? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. Toni, really not a lot of change from the consumer from October, meaning they're still strong. They're working -- like unemployment being so low, unemployment being so high and all the open jobs, that's a good thing for the consumer. They've clearly -- we've seen they spent down some of their COVID pandemic savings, but there's still positive savings from where they were in 2019. So that element is quite positive. Obviously, at the low end, inflation is still pressuring the subprime consumer, and we've seen some uptick in delinquencies there. But broadly, we would characterize the consumer as being quite strong. Now when we look out for 2023 here in February, that's where we talked about and we factored into our outlook a more uncertain economy, which should impact the consumer, call it, in the second half perhaps in the way we're thinking about it with these continued rising interest rates. And every day, you see another company announcing layoffs or hiring freezes. And that's going to have to have an impact at some point, and that's part of our outlook. On the B2B side, I think we talked at length about what we're seeing in the hiring space that we've already -- I just talked about. But that's impacting our businesses in background screening and talent and then an I-9 and onboarding. We still expect to grow over 10% in those two businesses because of pricing and product and penetration. But the actual volume, we expect to be down on a year-over-year basis. So that's going to have an impact.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Weber: Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe for John, is there any way to quantify what the delta is from -- on the compensation side where you're going from below plan last year to plan this year? Is there any way to just quantify what that represents as a year-over-year change?\nMark Begor: I think in the quarter, you talked about -- in the first quarter, if you exclude that in the equity impact, margins are basically flat.\nJohn Gamble: And just really the equity impact were pretty close to flat. So we didn't -- so we tend to try to list things in order of importance. So what you can take from the listing we gave is it's fairly substantial. No, we haven't quantified our -- the total incentive and sales incentive difference year-on-year. But we're saving -- the $120 million savings is obviously quite substantial. And the most substantial area we're offsetting is that change in overall sales compensation and incentive compensation as well as equity compensation. So it's the biggest factor. Also, we are seeing increases in royalty costs. It's both in mortgage. We talked about one of our mortgage vendors, increasing prices. We do get some benefit from that on the revenue side as a pass-through, but it also significantly increases our expenses. And then also as we continue to substantially grow in Workforce Solutions, our partners, which we had an outstanding year, growing 10 new exclusive partners for in the fourth quarter, we do see royalties go up. But EWS is able to outgrow that and drive their margins higher. So anyway, those are the biggest things that we're offsetting with the -- that are offsetting the $120 million in cost savings.\nSeth Weber: Got it. You actually anticipated my follow-up question. Just you mentioned this higher royalty and data costs to you. Is that kind of just a catch-up do you feel like, or is this more of the new normal going forward that these costs are going to be higher -- structurally higher going forward for you guys?\nA \u2013 John Gamble: So the specific comment around mortgage, I think that was probably -- there was a large increase from a vendor, and everyone knows that. So that was a onetime effect or we'll see what happens in the future. On EWS, we've seen an increase in their royalties over time as they continue to grow partner records, and that's just part of the business model. And we think they can deliver 50% plus margins even as that grows. So it's just -- it's a cost that we have to incur in the business, but it's an extremely beneficial cost because the variable margin on those -- on the revenue that those records generate continues to be high, but those costs are increasing. The other costs I didn't mention, right, that we're offsetting is we are continuing to see duplicate costs because we're continuing to run the major US systems in credit and the major Canadian systems in credit through the middle of this year or into the third quarter. And so that duplicate cost is something we're still incurring, and that's also something that's partially offsetting the cost savings we're generating.\nQ \u2013 Seth Weber: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 David Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Looking at Slide 13 with the $250 million total spending reduction for 2024, how much of that is a CapEx reduction versus OpEx? And then of those two numbers, particularly the OpEx reduction, how much will flow through to earnings versus being offset by additional expenses?\nA \u2013 John Gamble: So in terms of the split of capital and expense, we didn't give specifics, but it's probably reasonable just to use the same split that you have in 2023. And I think I'm going to have to ask you to wait until 2024 before we talk about -- we give -- we talk about 2024 guidance. But what we did talk about, right, is there's substantial expense savings that we expect to see not just from this but also from continuing to execute on our transformation. And we do expect our margins to grow, right? So we're going to get margin enhancement through revenue growth because it's obviously -- we have obviously a high -- very high variable margins as the mortgage market even just normalizes at these levels, our revenue growth starts to accelerate. And then also, we'll get cost savings. So how do you decide to decide what goes where? It's up to you. But we do expect to see margin enhancement with a better revenue growth environment and a more stable mortgage market.\nQ \u2013 David Togut: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, if you could quantify the EWS price increase at the beginning of this year?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yeah. I think you know, we don't -- for competitive reasons and commercial reasons, we don't talk about any price increases. I think we've been clear that we have more pricing leverage in EWS than our other businesses. We've also been clear that we generally do our price increases effective 1/1 and roll them out in the fall or fourth quarter to our customers. And so price for EWS, USIS, International, we got real clarity because it's in the marketplace and already negotiated with our customers. So that gives us a lot of confidence in that element of our margin and revenue levers for the year.\nQ \u2013 David Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 John Mazzoni: Hi. This is John Mazzoni fill up for Ashish. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just building more on this new Equifax theme and in terms of the kind of restructuring efforts, could these tech layoffs benefit the company in terms of hiring engineering talent? Your comments suggest that kind of the white collar layoffs are really concentrated in that type of kind of high-growth, high-tech area and maybe that had to go into investor session could actually help you in-source tech talent. Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you just clarify that? About -- tech is an important function for Equifax for sure. As you know, we're a data analytics technology company. It's actually our largest number of employees and, by far, the largest number of contractors. Most of the cost savings have always been planned, and that's what we're executing in 2023 come from completing the cloud and then exiting the plan -- the contractors that we're working on that are principally contractors and exiting those out. Go ahead.\nJohn Gamble: Were you asking if the tech layoffs by some other large tech companies may benefit us in hiring?\nJohn Mazzoni: Correct, yes. So if you could in-source those jobs that might have been done by contractors.\nMark Begor: Yes. We're always looking to improve our talent and upgrade it. I think we've got a very strong technology team today, but for sure. Maybe I'll answer the question a little bit differently. If you asked the question a year ago about what's it like to hire tech talent a year ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago, it was very hard. Today, when we're hiring tech talent, which we do all the time with -- in the environment as you described, where a lot of tech companies are pulling back, that is a positive for Equifax. We're able to get great talent and it's just shorter time frames between opening a job and finding great people to come onboard in this current environment. So for sure.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great. Very helpful. And then maybe just building a little bit on that question but in a different lens. Layoffs are broadening out across different industries that are non-tech in nature. Is any of that baked into the unemployment claims assumptions in 2023? And maybe due to the lag effect of severance, could there be a potential upside in the back half of the year as these unemployment claims could pick up?\nMark Begor: I think you've seen before at Equifax, if you follow it closely, that in a rising unemployment environment like in 2020, we get substantial upside from our unemployment claims business. Today, we don't have that really baked in, in 2023 because we just haven't seen that yet. But if it comes forward, that will certainly be a positive.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great color. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You provided assumptions for industry mortgage volumes for 2023. Can you discuss your expectations for card and auto origination volumes for this year as well?\nMark Begor: Yes. We haven't disclosed those in the past, George. As you know, we've -- in the past, we've been very transparent around mortgage just because of the volatility, if you will, in that space and the impact it's had in Equifax.\nJohn Gamble: I think what we have talked about is we were seeing -- we saw a nice growth in card in the fourth quarter in terms of volumes, not just -- our revenue was very good in banking, but also we saw a nice growth in banking and volumes in general. So that trend continues to be positive. Auto was kind of flattish, right? We think we performed well because of product, pricing and some penetration gains. So we think we did very well in online auto. We didn't see substantial market growth in auto in terms of transactions in the fourth quarter. So -- and as Mark said, as we go through next year, we've assumed a general weakening of the economy relative to where we are today.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And related to the trends that you're seeing on the card side, can you discuss growth trends you're seeing with credit card marketing and prequalification volumes?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yeah, that was fairly strong in 2022 and in the fourth quarter. And we would expect that to continue at a fairly strong level in certainly the first quarter, which we gave you guidance on. And I think in our broader guide for 2023, we expect kind of a broad softening in the economy in the second half, and that's factored into our outlook for the year.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: Just as a reminder, our Financial Marketing Services business was weak last year, right? And we talked about that throughout the year. And what we expect is we expect to see it kind of flatten out in 2023, part of it just because we're lapping a weak year and part of it because we think we're improving some of the product offerings we have. But -- so overall, for us, our Financial Marketing Services business was generally not strong in 2022, but we're expecting a little better performance and some growth in 2023.\nQ \u2013 George Tong: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 Surinder Thind: Thank you. Hi, Mark, just following up on the questions from the last analyst. Just big picture-wise, I mean, does the relative strength of kind of what you're seeing in like auto card, P loans, at this point in the economic cycle both from like a marketing spend perspective and as well as volumes, does that kind of surprise you at this point? And maybe how should we generally think about the cyclicality of the business? I mean, if the economy was to maybe fall into a recession late 2023, is that when we would maybe expect to see lenders pull back a bit more? Just trying to gauge if there's structurally anything different that we should be thinking about this time around?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: I think this is a different economic event than we've ever seen before, right? You've got interest rates increasing rapidly. You've got inflation at a level that it hasn't been in 40 years, but you also have people working. That usually doesn't tie together. Normally, you see unemployment increase as there's an economic event. And I think the real question is that -- I'm not an economist, but the real question is that -- is there going to be the so-called soft landing with interest rates and inflation? With the labor report from last Friday, it doesn't feel like that, meaning there's going to be continued interest rate increases to try to tame inflation. But the variable on all the verticals you described in financial services, where financial services companies, I ran a credit card company for a decade, where a credit card company or a financial service company will start tightening up is when people aren't working. And when they're not working, they can't pay their bills or they slow down their payment of their bills. So that's the dichotomy that we have in 2022 and I call it the early parts of 2023, is you've got an economy that clearly is seeing pressure. You've got companies that are tightening their belts, which is impacting some of our B2B volume. But you got a consumer that's still fairly healthy. Their consumer confidence is down, but they're working so they're still paying their bills. Our assumption for 2023 is that doesn't continue, meaning there's some weakening of that in the second half is kind of how we laid it out. And then, of course, on top of that, we're disproportionately impacted versus some of our peers by the massive mortgage market decline that we've had. We've been living in a mortgage recession for six-plus months, and we've got another six months until we get the first half strength of 2023 behind us. But last year, the mortgage market decline impacted us -- just the market impact of that was close to $0.5 billion, a little over $0.5 billion. So we've been living in a usual economic environment. And from our perspective, quite positively, Equifax has continued to grow through that.\nJohn Gamble: And just as a reminder, as you think about USIS, right, two of the areas that are performing extremely well that are driving a lot of our growth are commercial and identity and fraud, right? So segments that are not necessarily embedded within the consumer, but where we think we have differentiated capabilities and benefits that should allow us to grow nicely in markets that may even weaken.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. That was my question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'd love to ask about the -- on workforce, the non-mortgage verification side of things and how you're thinking about those businesses into the year, especially given sort of the macro backdrop that you're layering into your guidance and both on the Talent and Government side, how you see those businesses shaking out?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think we talked about that, and John can jump in. But we expect those businesses to still perform very well. Remember, the underlying levers that verification has, it starts with records. So our 12% increase in records last year benefits 2023. And then we've got 10 new processors that we're going to be adding records in 20 -- during this year in 2023. So records were positive in all the different verticals that we sell into, whether it's government, talent, auto, cards, P loans, the non-mortgage verticals in verification. We've got price increases in the marketplace. We're rolling out new products in every one of those verticals that really benefit growth going forward. So that's a positive. And then just underlying penetration. Remember in every one of those non-mortgage verticals for verification, we have fairly low penetration in cards, in auto, there's a lot of penetration opportunity. P loans is pretty high. Like mortgage, we do a lot -- we have -- we cover a lot of the ground in P loans. But then you go into talent and government, there's just a lot of market penetration opportunities. So then the flip side of that is the underlying market for those. What's happening to the economic impacts in there? And the one place that we've highlighted is talent and around verification where there is some reduction in hiring, but we said that we expect that business to still be up over 10% for 2023. Government is also a vertical that if there is an economic event, there's going to be more people going for social services, which will be a positive for that vertical. We expect that to grow positively through 2023.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. And just as a reminder, and Mark already mentioned that we're expecting total non-mortgage for EWS next year about 13%. So still very, very good and that even reflects weakness that we're going to see in ERC, right? ERC was very strong. And now with the end of that program, that pandemic-based program, you'll see a significant reduction there, which is non-mortgage, and we'll still grow 13% through that, so.\nHeather Balsky: Great. Thank you. And on -- in terms of your sort of overall non-mortgage business, so you talked about the fact that you're assuming a weakening economy in the back half. Can you just help us -- I know you don't necessarily guide the individual quarters, but how to think about the cadence from 1Q to 2Q and then into the back half? And just sort of what's baked into your outlook.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: It's tricky to do without getting into the quarter. I think we've given you an outlook for the year and an outlook for the first quarter and then -- which we don't typically do. We also gave you some visibility around what we expect margins to do because of the unusual -- the acceleration of the cloud cost savings and the broader restructuring of the company, that kind of 30% to 36% EBITDA margins gives you a lot of visibility around the profitability side. What else would you add, John?\nA \u2013 John Gamble: I think it's about all we can add, right? So I mean, we gave fairly good visibility on how we expect margins to substantially enhance through the year, going from about 30-ish, right, to 36% by the end of the year. And we said we'll start seeing those cost savings really kick in, in the second quarter. So beyond that, not much more to say.\nQ \u2013 Heather Balsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nQ \u2013 Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, thank you. First, I just wanted to follow up on the USIS B2B online growth that looks like it accelerated in 4Q. I'm curious how you expect that business to trend in 2023. Like was there something specific that drove the acceleration, or was it just a matter of comps? And maybe if you can comment on what type of pricing benefit you expect to see in that business in 2023?\nA \u2013 John Gamble: Yeah. So what we -- what Mark mentioned is that the way the planning was built is we assumed about a 5% non-mortgage growth. And overall, you were referring to acceleration in online, right? I'm referring to overall non-mortgage growth of about 5%, which is a little lower than it was in the fourth quarter but still very, very strong. And I think the decline from the fourth quarter is principally driven by the fact that we've assumed that we're going to see weakening economic conditions as we move through the year, right? And I think what we're doing is just reflecting that in the 2023 guidance we provided. So we think that 5% growth with a US economy that weakens through the year, we think is a very nice outcome, and it shows very good performance and continued good performance across banking across auto, across other verticals and then also a return to some level of growth -- not high, but some level of growth in our Financial Marketing Services business.\nQ \u2013 Faiza Alwy: Okay. I guess is the cycle price increase that you mentioned, is that primarily in mortgage, or is that you think going to positively impact the B2B online business, the nonmortgage business as well?\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: Yeah, we take price up generally in all our products every year, varying amounts dependent upon our market position and our commercial position, et cetera.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: Yeah. Mortgage has a very defined price change. On January 1, it's pretty much industry wide, right? So across other verticals, generally speaking, price increases do happen early in the year but that isn't always the case, right? So they tend to be more distributed throughout the year. So it isn't as unified an event outside of mortgage. But yes, we do expect to continue to get price. We certainly had a price benefit in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to have price benefits as we move through 2023.\nQ \u2013 Faiza Alwy: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andy Grobler with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndy Grobler: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Firstly, just one on the compensation. Just to clarify, you've noted that it's going to come back in 2023 relative to 2022. Where would that stand versus 2021? In other words, it was just 2022 kind of artificially are unusually low, and we're going back to a more normal level now?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think that's the right way to think about it. In 2022, we set out a plan for the year at this time last year, where we didn't anticipate a mortgage market change or interest rates going up or inflation where it was. And we missed that plan. And the way our compensation structures are aligned, as you might imagine, are tied to the performance against our plan for the year, and we underperformed that. So our compensation was substantially down in 2022. In 2023, we're assuming we get back to target levels, which would be more like 21%.\nJohn Gamble: 2021 was a very good year, right? So our comp was strong in 2021 because 2021 was a strong year overall.\nAndy Grobler: Yes. Yes. And just to kind of follow-up on the costs and so forth. You had cost savings plans from the cloud transformation baked into expectations anyway. And now you've talked about the $120 million of savings next year. What is the increment versus your previous expectations within the $120 million?\nMark Begor: Yes. You said the $120 million next year, it's actually this year, which I think you meant is 2023.\nAndy Grobler: Yes, this year, sorry.\nMark Begor: Yes. And we didn't break that out for you, but the $120 million is a combination of accelerating some of the cloud cost savings that we had planned. So the -- I think we said in the call earlier, no change in what we expected to deliver from the cloud savings. We're accelerating some of that into 2023. We also said we expect additional cloud cost savings in 2024 and likely some in 2025. And then on top of that, in 2023, inside the $120 million is at a broader restructuring and efficiencies across the company to deliver additional cost savings that are incremental our long-term cloud savings that we've talked about for the last couple of years.\nAndy Grobler: I suppose that's the question. In terms of your incremental savings on that longer-term plan. How much is baked into this year's guide?\nMark Begor: Yes. We haven't broken that out as a part of our conversation this morning. We really just highlighted that, obviously, it's a sizable number. It's going to have a very positive impact on the company, and its -- there's an incremental piece to the accelerated cloud savings.\nAndy Grobler: Okay. Thank you. And if I may, just one more. Just from the EWS perspective, when you're having discussions with clients and data providers, now that there is a fairly determined competitor in play, are those conversations changing at all?\nMark Begor: They're not. We still have a very effective ability to add new relationships. I think we talked about adding 10 that will come online this year during 2023. And we have the scale of workforce solutions, the scale of their technology, the scale of our security and capabilities and the longevity we've had in the business. So we've been in this business for over a decade, and then the ability to deliver a rev share immediately at scale for those records from a partner gives us a lot of power to continue to grow our record base. And there's a long runway in front of us of records that we'll be adding to the TWN data set.\nAndy Grobler: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Trevor Burns for any closing comments.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks for everybody's time today. And if you have any questions, you can reach out to me and Sam. We'll be around, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on 4Q 2022. As Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in slightly lower than expected in the fourth quarter at 31%, principally driven by lower-than-expected margins in Workforce Solutions, as Mark discussed, and also in International. Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $156 million, as we maintained investments to accelerate completion of North American cloud transformation. Capital spending will decline in 1Q 2022 to 2023 about $150 million and then sequentially further in each quarter of 2023, as we complete significant US and Canadian customer migrations. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be about $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. Moving on to 2023 guidance. Mark provided an overview of our planning assumptions of a 30% reduction in mortgage originations in 2023. As shown on Slide 15, at these levels, and again, using credit inquiries as a proxy for the mortgage market, in 2023, the US mortgage market will be substantially below any level we have seen in the past 10 years. 1Q 2023 is expected to see the mortgage market down about 55% year-to-year. Sequentially, as we move through 2023, we're planning on a more normal pattern of mortgage activity with mortgage originations increasing sequentially on the order of 15% in 2Q 2023 from 1Q 2023, 3Q 2023 being about flat with the second quarter and normal sequential decline in the fourth quarter versus 3Q 2023. We expect with these sequential patterns, US mortgage originations would be up slightly in the second half of 2023 versus the first half of 2023, and the fourth quarter of 2023 would be up slightly year-to-year. And at least the first half of 2023, we are expecting USIS to benefit from mortgage shopping behavior with better performance than originations. Slide 16 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 4% revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance of $5.325 billion. The 30% decline in the US mortgage market is negatively impacting 2023 total revenue growth by about 7 percentage points. The mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the mortgage market is expected to offset about 5 points of the negative 7 percentage point impact of the mortgage market on overall revenue growth. As a result, the expected 8% decline in Equifax mortgage revenue has a negative about 2 percentage point impact on overall revenue growth. Non mortgage organic growth is expected to exceed 7% on a constant currency basis and is driving about 5% of the growth in overall Equifax revenue. As Mark referenced earlier, the growth is broad-based across all three BUs and is within our long-term framework of 7% to 10%, despite the economic uncertainty across our major markets in the US, Australia, Canada and the UK. The acquisitions completed in 2022 and year-to-date are expected to contribute about 1% of growth to 2023. For clarity, this does not include revenue from the potential acquisition of Boa Vista. Slide 17 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 5% decline to the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.20 per share. Revenue growth of 4% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.6% would deliver 5.5% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margins in 2023 are expected to be about flat from the 33.6% we delivered in 2022. In 2023, the cost actions we are taking are expected to deliver about $120 million of expense reductions. These cost benefits are being principally offset by several factors. First, in 2022, variable compensation, including incentive and sales comp were at very low levels due to the substantial impact of the weak mortgage market on our performance. In 2023, our planning assumes we return to targeted levels of performance, and therefore, these compensation drivers. Royalties and cost for data and third-party scores are increasing as we continue to add new partners and broaden data sources. Also in 2023, we are also still incurring a level of redundant system costs as we continue to operate legacy North American systems prior to their decommissioning later in 2023. As we look beyond 2023, the impact of variable compensation moving to target and the cost of redundant systems in North America are behind us, and therefore, the benefits of our cost actions as well as accelerating high variable profit revenue growth are expected to drive significant improvement in EBITDA margins. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by just over $50 million in 2023, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4%. D&A is increasing in 2023 as we accelerate putting cloud native systems in production. The combined increase in interest expense, net other expense and tax expense in 2023 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by just over six percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates and also the increased debt from our 2022 acquisitions. Our estimated tax rate of about 26% is up about 150 basis points from 2022 due to a higher mix of non-US revenue and lower tax benefits as we reduce capital and development spending. Slide 18 provides the specifics of our 2022 full year guidance that Mark discussed in detail. The slide includes additional detail on expected BU EBITDA margins as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. EWS EBITDA margins in 2023 of 52% are expected to be up from the 51.3% delivered in 2022, given the strong non-mortgage revenue growth from new products, penetration and pricing and the benefits of the cost actions Mark discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins at over 35% are expected to be down from the 36.8% delivered in 2022. USIS is also benefiting from cost actions. However, revenue growth at 2%, again, due to the impact of the US mortgage market decline, is resulting in the year-to-year margin decline. International EBITDA margins at 27% are expected to expand versus the 25.7% delivered in 2022, driven principally by pricing and the 2023 cost actions. Corporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization, is increasing in 2023 relative to 2022 due to the increases in incentive and equity compensation from the lower levels incurred in 2022 that I referenced earlier. Corporate functions such as finance, legal, HR and others are reducing costs in 2023, consistent with our cost actions. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Slide 19 provides our guidance for 1Q 2023. As Mark discussed earlier, 1Q 2023 is expected to have the largest year-to-year decline in the US mortgage market that we'll see in 2023 at down about 55% as we compare to the relatively strong mortgage market in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the strong expected non-mortgage constant currency growth of about 9%, we will see a decline in 1Q 2023 revenue about 6% at the midpoint of our guidance. 1Q 2023 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 29%, down about 200 basis points sequentially. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are up sequentially from 4Q 2022 driven by Workforce Solutions delivering about 50% EBITDA margins in the quarter, which offsets declines at USIS and International. The decline in EBITDA margins in 1Q 2023 sequentially from 4Q 2022 is driven by higher corporate expense, specifically the higher incentive and equity compensation costs referenced earlier. The bulk of the expense related to our equity plans occurs in the first quarter and is reflected in corporate. Excluding the impact from the sequential increase in equity compensation expense, EBITDA margins are approaching flat sequentially at just under 31%. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q 2023 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter. Revenue increases sequentially in 1Q 2023 relative to 4Q 2022. We're not seeing the expected increase in EBITDA margin sequentially in the first quarter, driven by the same factors impacting all of 2023 that I referenced earlier and the fact that there is limited first quarter benefit related to our 2023 cost actions. In the second quarter of 2023, we will see both the benefit of reduced corporate expense and increased benefits from our 2023 cost action supporting growth and EBITDA margins. Business unit performance in the first quarter are expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 8.5% year-to-year due to the about 55% decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue will continue to deliver double-digit growth. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 50%, up over 300 basis points sequentially, driven by sequential revenue growth from new product and pricing actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to be down about 5.5% year-to-year, again, driven by the about 55% decline in the US mortgage market. USIS credit inquiries are expected to somewhat outperform the overall mortgage market due to consumer shopping. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in non-mortgage expected to be up mid single digits. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32%, down sequentially due to negative mix from growth in core mortgage and higher overall mortgage royalties as well as the normalization of incentive costs that I referenced earlier. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to data fabric that are occurring principally in the first half of 2023. International revenue is expected to be up about 5% in constant currency. The weakness relative to the strong 4Q 2022 growth of about 9% is principally a decline in the UK debt management business as we are now comparing to the very strong 2022 revenue driven by catch-up in our UK government business in 2022 as the UK government suspended collections during the pandemic. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 22%, down sequentially due to seasonally lower revenue in Canada and UK CRA and normalization of incentive costs as well as higher data costs. We're expecting adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2023 to be about $1.30 to $1.40 per share. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion of revenue with 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than when we first discussed in November of 2021, our goal of achieving these results in 2025. The US mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down over 35% from the normal 2015 to 2019 average levels we had discussed is expected to deliver $7 billion of revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of 2021. However, recovery in the mortgage market around the order of two-thirds of the lost volume is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal in 2025. We're focused on driving above-market growth including -- through accretive acquisitions and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed as part of our data and technology cloud transformation and needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins. We'll continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion and 39% EBITDA margin goals as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. I think you covered it quite well, yes. The only thing I'd add is as transformation completes the effort necessary to launch new products comes down substantially, right? It's one of the real benefits from cloud transformation that we've been talking about substantially. And as data is on fabric and everything is running through Ignite and InterConnect, then the level of investment necessary to launch those new products really starts to become something that we can do faster and cheaper. So as Mark said, we do a very good job of making sure we understand who is working on what. So as we reduce resource, we take it out of specifically transformation. But also as we go forward, we expect to get a lot of leverage in product launches in terms of being able to launch them faster and cheaper because they're on the transform cloud infrastructure. And we've seen that in EWS by the way. It isn't something that we haven't seen. It's already happened in EWS. And just really the equity impact were pretty close to flat. So we didn't -- so we tend to try to list things in order of importance. So what you can take from the listing we gave is it's fairly substantial. No, we haven't quantified our -- the total incentive and sales incentive difference year-on-year. But we're saving -- the $120 million savings is obviously quite substantial. And the most substantial area we're offsetting is that change in overall sales compensation and incentive compensation as well as equity compensation. So it's the biggest factor. Also, we are seeing increases in royalty costs. It's both in mortgage. We talked about one of our mortgage vendors, increasing prices. We do get some benefit from that on the revenue side as a pass-through, but it also significantly increases our expenses. And then also as we continue to substantially grow in Workforce Solutions, our partners, which we had an outstanding year, growing 10 new exclusive partners for in the fourth quarter, we do see royalties go up. But EWS is able to outgrow that and drive their margins higher. So anyway, those are the biggest things that we're offsetting with the -- that are offsetting the $120 million in cost savings. Were you asking if the tech layoffs by some other large tech companies may benefit us in hiring? I think what we have talked about is we were seeing -- we saw a nice growth in card in the fourth quarter in terms of volumes, not just -- our revenue was very good in banking, but also we saw a nice growth in banking and volumes in general. So that trend continues to be positive. Auto was kind of flattish, right? We think we performed well because of product, pricing and some penetration gains. So we think we did very well in online auto. We didn't see substantial market growth in auto in terms of transactions in the fourth quarter. So -- and as Mark said, as we go through next year, we've assumed a general weakening of the economy relative to where we are today. And just as a reminder, as you think about USIS, right, two of the areas that are performing extremely well that are driving a lot of our growth are commercial and identity and fraud, right? So segments that are not necessarily embedded within the consumer, but where we think we have differentiated capabilities and benefits that should allow us to grow nicely in markets that may even weaken. Yes. And just as a reminder, and Mark already mentioned that we're expecting total non-mortgage for EWS next year about 13%. So still very, very good and that even reflects weakness that we're going to see in ERC, right? ERC was very strong. And now with the end of that program, that pandemic-based program, you'll see a significant reduction there, which is non-mortgage, and we'll still grow 13% through that, so. 2021 was a very good year, right? So our comp was strong in 2021 because 2021 was a strong year overall."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another very strong quarter to close out 2022 with continuing execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. Fourth quarter reported revenue of $1.2 billion was down about 4.5% and down 4% on an organic constant currency basis, both as expected against an unprecedented mortgage market decline, but above the high end of our October guidance from broad-based strength across Equifax and stronger NPI rollouts. Fourth quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $371 million with an EBITDA margin of 31%. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 per share was at the upper end of our October guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and John will provide more detail in a few minutes. Equifax US mortgage revenue was down 41% in the quarter, but outperformed the overall market by 27 percentage points with estimated US mortgage originations down 68%. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 84% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, were very strong with 12% constant currency and 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in October and at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. This strong growth was driven again by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions with 17% non-mortgage revenue growth overall and 23% non-mortgage revenue growth in Verifier. As I'll discuss more later, Government continued very strong in Workforce Solutions with growth at over 40%, and Talent and I-9 boarding delivered over 20% growth but were impacted by slowing US hiring in November and December. Delivering 20% growth in that vertical against a slowing hiring market was a very strong performance. And second, USIS nonmortgage had an outstanding quarter, delivering very strong double-digit B2B non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 19% online, which was much better than our expectations. And last, International delivered another strong quarter with 9% constant dollar and 8% organic constant dollar growth, led by very strong performance in Latin America. We continue to make strong progress against the final chapter of our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in 2022. Currently, about 70% of North American revenue is delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. During 2022, we made the decision to increase capital spending by approximately $175 million to a total of $625 million to accelerate the completion of our North American cloud transformation. The progress made in 2022 will enable the substantial completion of North America transformation and customer migrations this year, including decommissioning of applications in our major North America data centers. Capital spending will decline significantly in 2023 due to the strong progress at completing the cloud last year. Our new EFX Cloud infrastructure is delivering always-on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise-level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. New product innovation is also executing at a very high level. Our new product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and a 500 basis point improvement from the 9% Vitality Index last year and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term new product vitality goal. Our focus on new solutions, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud is paying off. As a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of Equifax revenue from new products launched in the past three years. As our fourth quarter performance highlights, we continue to execute very well, driving strong non-mortgage growth across Equifax and record levels of new product revenue. In addition to accelerating long-term revenue growth, two critical goals of our EFX 2025 strategic framework are significant and consistent EBITDA margin expansion and the lowering of the capital intensity of our business to drive our free cash flow. In 2023, we are executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation and a broader focus on operational process improvements. We will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023 as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers as we complete the cloud and other broader spending controls. Total spending reductions from these actions in 2023 are expected to be about $200 million with about $120 million reduction in expenses and an $80 million reduction in CapEx. I'll cover our 2023 plan in more detail shortly, but first, we'll provide more detail on our strong performance in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage performance with revenue growth up 12% in constant currency, led by EWS Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which was up 23%, led by Talent, which was up 19% and Government up 43%; EWS, I-9 and onboarding, which was up over 40%; USIS B2B online mortgage was up almost 20%; and Latin America was up over 30%, all very strong performances. Fourth quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 12% was at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in the US hiring activity impacting our Workforce Solutions Talent vertical. Non-mortgage revenue growth continues to be very strong across Equifax. Turning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter. Mortgage revenue outperformed the overall mortgage market as measured by originations by about 30% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year. And verifier non-mortgage revenue was again very strong with organic growth of 23% in the quarter and 40% for the total year. During 2022, we signed 10 new agreements with US payroll processors, including four in the quarter that will be added to the TWN database during 2023. Recently, we also signed a substantial direct relationship that added over 2 million new TWN records. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in existing partner records and the new direct contributors through our Employer Services business, are delivering continuing strong growth in our TWN database with current records of 6 million record sequentially, reaching 142 million records -- 152 million records with 114 million unique and over 600 million total current historical records from over 2.6 million employers. Industry-leading data security and operational processes as well as our ability to provide substantial value to our direct contributors and revenue share to our payroll partners are delivering exceptional record growth for Workforce Solutions. 114 million unique individuals in TWN deliver high hit rates and represent almost 70% of the 165 million US non-farm payroll. Adding gig and pension records, we have the ability to almost double our TWN records in the future, which is a big driver of EWS revenue and margins. As a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers, with the remaining contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. Workforce Solutions also continues to lead Equifax and new products, delivering a Vitality Index at over 2x of our long-term 10% vitality goal, which is a great proof point for the power of the Equifax Cloud to drive innovation in new products. Workforce Solutions Vitality Index has expanded from low single digits a short four years ago to over 20% vitality in 2022. Workforce Solutions, as you know, was the first Equifax business to be substantially complete with their cloud transformation over a year ago, allowing the team to fully focus on innovation and NPIs, leveraging their new cloud capabilities. The Work Number is also seeing accelerated expansion outside the United States in the UK, Canada and Australia. In January, Workforce Solutions signed an agreement with a leading UK payroll technology partner, obtaining access to over 40% of UK private sector employees. Workforce Solutions now has access to over 20 million active and historical records in Australia, Canada and the UK in addition to over 40 million active and historical alternative income records, including pension data and tax returns. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions delivered revenue of $508 million, down 4% in the fourth quarter. Revenue was slightly weaker than expected driven by slower growth in talent and onboarding businesses from declines we saw in US hiring in November and December. Verification Services revenue of $399 million was down 7%, driven by the unprecedented 68% decline in US mortgage originations. As mentioned earlier, EWS mortgage revenue outperformed the overall market by a very strong 30 percentage points, driven by strong TWN record additions, penetration, pricing and new product revenue growth with the strong adoption of our new mortgage 36 solution that was rolled out late last year. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents almost 70% of Verifier revenue, delivered strong 23% growth in the quarter. We saw continued very strong 43% growth in the Government vertical, which is almost 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, driven by strong growth in our Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services volumes. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong new product portfolio, including our new insights data at the federal state and local level. We expect to continue this strong growth in our government vertical in 2023 in a big $2 billion TAM. Talent Solutions delivered strong 19% growth in the quarter despite the impact of the weakening overall hiring, which is estimated to be down about 8% in the quarter. We outgrew this market decline by over 25 percentage points and delivered 19% growth, a very strong performance, driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing. In the first quarter, we will launch new products in the talent space targeted at the staffing and hourly segments designed to meet specific needs of background screeners in these high-volume segments, which will drive Talent growth. Employer Services revenue of $110 million was up 4.5% in the quarter due to strong growth in our I-9 onboarding and healthy FX businesses, which were up 17%. Our I-9 and onboarding businesses remained strong at 20% growth but were also negatively impacted by the declines in US hiring late in 2022. Our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses were down 11%, driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program expires. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we have not seen a meaningful increase in UC transactions yet. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 46.8% were lower than our October guidance, principally due to lower revenue growth in talent and onboarding related to the slowdown in US hiring. We expect EWS margins to return to about 50% in the first quarter and will be above 50% for all of 2023. The strength of EWS and uniqueness in value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in 2022. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter, outperforming the mortgage originations by 30 points and delivering strong 17% non-mortgage revenue growth. EWS is expected to deliver a strong 2023 and continue above market growth in the future. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue of $406 million was down 6.5% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 46% and was in line with our expectations against an unprecedented 54% decline in credit inquiries compared to the 50-plus percent in our October guidance -- 50-plus percent decline that we had in our October guidance. Revenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 8%, driven by favorable new mortgage business penetration, new mortgage products and new mortgage pricing. Credit inquiry performance continues to be less negative than estimated originations, reflecting higher relative levels of mortgage shopping behavior that we talked about before. At $67 million, mortgage revenue is now about 15% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $280 million -- $288 million, which represents over 70% [ph] of total USIS revenue was up 10%, with organic revenue growth of about 6.5%. This was a significant sequential increase and much stronger than the levels we expected in October. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was very strong at up 19% total and up over 13% organically, reflecting pricing and product rollouts as well as stronger volumes in banking as lenders continue to drive new originations. During the quarter, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in commercial, identity and fraud and auto with banking at just under 10% growth. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $72 million that was down 9% and slightly above our expectations. As we discussed during the year, we expect FMS to return to growth in 2023 with revenue up low single digits in the first quarter. USIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $50 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% from penetration and new product introductions. In 2023, we expect low single-digit growth from our US consumer direct business. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 35.3% in the quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially due to very strong double-digit B2B online non-mortgage revenue growth. EBITDA margins were down 400 basis points compared to prior year to declines in high-margin mortgage revenue. International revenue, as shown on Slide 9, was $284 million, up a strong 9% in constant currency and 8% organically. We're seeing broad-based execution from our international businesses with particular strength in Latin America NPI rollouts. Europe local currency revenue was up 3%, principally driven by 9% growth in our debt management business. We continue to see strong debt placements from the UK government as we have over the past several quarters. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was about flat in the fourth quarter and below our expectations principally due to lower new business penetration. Asia Pacific, which is our Australia business, delivered local currency revenue of 6%, driven by growth in our commercial, consumer, identity and fraud and HR identification businesses. Latin America, local currency revenue was up a strong 31% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team. Canada local currency revenue was up 7% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer, commercial, analytical solutions and identity and fraud revenue were partially offset by mortgage volume declines and lower direct-to-consumer revenue. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.8% were down 100 basis points sequentially and below our expectations due to a greater mix of lower-margin debt services revenue and higher costs principally from purchase data. Turning to Slide 10. 2022 was an outstanding year for new product innovation, and as you know, NPIs are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. We delivered over 100 new products for the third year in a row and a record full year Vitality Index of over 13% and a fourth quarter Vitality Index of 14%. The 13% Vitality Index in 2022 was up over 400 basis points above our strong 2021 results and over 300 basis points higher than our 10% long-term growth framework goal for new products and our vitality. New product revenue in 2022 was $650 million, up over 50% from about $420 million in 2021. And in 2022, over 90% of new product revenue was from non-mortgage products. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2023 at levels similar to the 13% we delivered in 2022 which is well above our 10% long-term NPI Vitality Index goal. And this equates to over $700 million of revenue in 2023 from new products introduced in the past three years. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new EFX Cloud capabilities and Single-Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top line growth and margins. Turning to Slide 11. 2022 was also a strong year for bolt-on acquisitions as we continue to focus on our strategic M&A priorities and growing our non-mortgage revenue. Since 2021, we've completed 13 acquisitions that are delivering $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. Our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1 to 2 points of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A aligned around our three strategic priorities: number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, building out our identity and fraud capabilities; and number three, adding unique data assets. We expect these strategic acquisitions to deliver growth synergies in 2023 and 2024 as we complete their technology and product integrations. Last week, we announced the acquisition of the Food Industry Credit Bureau, leading provider of credit information for the Canadian food industry, with over 90% commercial data coverage. This acquisition expands our commercial product offerings in Canada. We also continue to work closely with the Board of Directors of Boa Vista Servicos, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil on the proposed acquisition we announced in December. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. To the extent we're able to finalize terms with the Boa Vista Board, we expect the transaction to close in mid-2023. Turning to 2023 guidance on Slide 12. We ended the year with significant momentum in the underlying growth of our businesses and in the execution of our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. However, we also entered 2023 with a continuing decline in the mortgage market and broader economic uncertainty impacting our underlying markets. Our assumption for US mortgage market originations is a further decline of 30% in 2023, which is more than 30% below the lowest level of originations in the past 10 years. For perspective, MBA is currently forecasting 2023 origination units down about 22% versus our 30% assumption -- minus 30% assumption. Fannie and Freddie do not forecast units but are forecasting origination dollar volumes down 30% and 25%, respectively. In our planning, we've assumed the bulk of the mortgage declines in the first half with first quarter originations down about 55%. Secondly, in 2022, we saw hiring freezes and headcount constraints impact our background screening volume in November and December, and we expect these conditions to continue in 2023 with hiring down over 10% impacting our Talent Solutions and I-9 employee onboarding businesses. Even with these market impacts or market declines, we expect both businesses to grow over 10%. Finally, in our planning, we're expecting to see weakening in our key markets in the US, Canada, UK and Canada in 2023. We're assuming slowing growth in the US as we move through the year, although at this point, we have not assumed the US recession. Similarly, we are expecting to see economic slowdowns in Australia and Canada with perhaps a more significant slowdown in the UK. The slow growth in these markets compares to the 2% to 2.5% underlying economic growth, we assume in our long-term growth model. As we enter 2023, we have strong underlying growth across our businesses with execution of our EFX 2025 growth strategies. Despite the significant decline in the US mortgage market and slower economic growth across our major markets, we expect to deliver revenue growth at the midpoint of 4% in 2023. Total mortgage revenue should decline about 8%, over 20 points better than the 30% reduction in mortgage originations, and non-mortgage revenue should grow over 8%, which is within our long-term growth framework despite the slower economic growth in our major markets. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of about 6% in 2023. This reflects a mortgage revenue decline of about 8% or over 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow about 13% overcoming the expected 10% plus decline in US hiring and about 15% decline in our ERC businesses as that COVID program winds down. TWN record growth, strong new product rollouts and continued strong growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive Workforce Solutions outperformance. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of about 2% this year. Mortgage revenue is expected to decline about 7%, more than 20% -- 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. In 2023, USIS will begin to benefit from their new mortgage credit file that was rolled out late last year that includes telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process and support loans with the secondary mortgage market. Equifax is the first and only in the industry to provide these insights, which will be available to Equifax customers in the first quarter and can help create greater home opportunities for consumers across the US. We're also seeing the impact of pricing increases from one of our largest mortgage vendors that we pass on to customers at levels to maintain consistent margins. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 5% despite the slowing growth. Non-mortgage revenue growth of about 5% will be driven by strong commercial, identity and fraud banking and auto growth. And Financial Marketing Services expect to return to growth in 2023 after a disappointing 2022. International had a very strong 2022 with revenue up 12% in constant dollars, but we saw some weakening end markets late in the year, particularly in debt services. We expect International growth of 5% in constant currency in 2023. This is below our long-term growth framework for International of 7% to 9%, principally due to the expected weakening economic conditions in our major markets of the UK, Canada and Australia and also a decline in debt services off a very strong 2022. As we discussed last year, debt services revenue in 2022 was somewhat of a catch-up year as the UK government collections were put on hold during the COVID pandemic. We continue to expect international to operate within their 7% to 9% growth framework over the mid and long-term. NPIs will again be very strong, which is -- and consistent with last year's 13% Vitality Index, well above our 10% long-term vitality goal, and this will be led by Workforce Solutions in Latin America. As USIS and Canada complete their cloud transformation, we expect their NPI rollouts to accelerate as we exit 2023. As we complete our North American cloud transformation 2023, we will pivot to leveraging our differentiated data assets and new cloud infrastructure to drive new product rollouts and top line growth. Workforce Solutions will accelerate its focus on leveraging their new cloud capabilities, and USIS and Canada will complete their consumer credit, alternative data and IFS transformation this year. These are big milestones in completing the cloud that we've been building towards for almost five years. We're on track to deliver the cost and capital spending reductions from the cloud transformation that are central to our long-term growth framework. As I referenced earlier and as shown on Slide 13, our accelerated cloud transformation cost reductions and broader cost restructuring will deliver $200 million of cost and CapEx savings in 2023 that will expand our margins and free cash flow in the future. During 2023, we plan to reduce our total workforce of about 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10%. As we complete our North American cloud transformation in 2023, we expect to close about 15 data centers, consolidate development centers and continue to reduce our software application footprint, and we'll closely manage discretionary spending, including professional services. We expect these actions to deliver $200 million in spending reductions in 2023, representing $120 million cost and expense reductions or about $0.75 per share and $80 million in capital spending reductions. The savings in the first quarter are limited and accelerate in the second quarter and through the second half of 2023. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce our spending by over $250 million. The lower cost and capital spending accelerates as we move through 2023 from cloud transformation cost benefits and other costs and restructuring actions planned throughout the year. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improved significantly as we moved through 2023. In the first quarter, revenue is expected to be down 6% due to the about 55% reduction in mortgage originations. EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS are at their lowest levels in 2023 in the first quarter, principally due to the higher incremental margins from the declining mortgage revenue and the timing of the recognition of the majority of our annual equity incentive plan expense in the quarter. Normalizing for this timing compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter EBITDA margins are slightly below fourth quarter margins of 31%. As revenue growth improve throughout 2023 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, EBITDA will be up 4% or $70 million, in line with revenue growth, with margins flat to the 33.6% we delivered last year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be about $7.20 per share, down about 5% from 2022, principally reflecting higher depreciation and amortization of about $50 million as North American cloud system implementations principally completes, also from higher interest and other expense of about $60 million and a higher tax rate. Capital spending will decline by $65 million to about $545 million in the year, or about 10% of revenue as we move closer to completing our cloud transportation. We expect CapEx to decline again in 2024. We have a clear line of sight to executing these proactive actions that will expand our margins and drive our free cash flow. In addition to cost benefits, completing our North American cloud transformation will enable significant commercial benefits to drive market share and revenue growth, including our always-on capabilities, better data quality, faster data delivery and faster new product innovation. And we're beginning to see meaningful commercial benefits from our new Equifax Cloud technology transformation. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2023 assumptions and guidance and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. Our 2023 guidance builds on our strong 2022 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth, pricing and acquisition synergies. John? Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 20. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with above-market growth in 2022, more than offsetting the significant 55% decline in the US mortgage market originations. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of strong above-market double-digit core revenue growth and strong double-digit 12% non-mortgage growth, reflecting the power of the EFX business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. At the business unit level, first, Workforce Solutions had another outstanding year, powering our results, delivering 14% revenue growth and strong organic non-mortgage growth of 24%. TWN current records reached $152 million, up 12%, and total records surpassed 600 million. Workforce also delivered a Vitality Index of over 20% from innovative new products and solutions, leveraging their cloud capabilities while further penetrating the high-growth Talent and Government verticals. USIS had a very strong finish to 2022 with fourth quarter non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 7% organic, driven by online non-mortgage growth of 19% total and 13% organic. The USIS team remains competitive and is winning in the marketplace. International delivered 12% local currency growth, their second consecutive year of double-digit growth. And our 2022 Vitality Index of 13% was a record as we delivered over 100 new products for the third consecutive year in a row. And since 2021, we completed 13 strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen Equifax and identity and fraud that we expect to deliver over $450 million of principally run rate revenue going forward. And sixth, we made significant progress in 2022, executing against our EFX cloud, data and technology transformation with about 70% of North American revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. And we're laser-focused on completing our North American migration in 2023 to become the only cloud-native data analytics company. We're in the early days of leveraging our new cloud capabilities but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities and accelerate our top line. Our strong progress on the cloud allowed us to accelerate cost savings and launch a proactive restructuring across Equifax that will deliver $200 million of cost savings in 2023 that will expand our margins to 36% as we exit 2023 and position us for an uncertain economic environment. As we look to 2023, we're committed to completing our North American data and technology transformation, while delivering continued above-market revenue growth and a substantial and consistent EBITDA margin growth and a reduction in capital intensity that is a key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. As mentioned earlier, the cost actions were taken in 2023 reducing our spending by $200 million this year and over $250 million in 2024 will expand our margins and position us for a more uncertain economic environment. I'm energized about our strong above-market performance in 2022, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new EFX cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets that are now in our single-data fabric and our market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that, operator, let me open it up to questions. Yes. So I think there's a couple of levels there, Manav. As you know, we've been living through a mortgage market recession here in the United States for the last nine months and that's going to continue. And it's really unprecedented. So I think you and our investors understand that pretty clearly. It's really a massive impact on our business. And what's positive is our non-mortgage businesses are performing exceptionally well. We talked about where we've seen the impact of hiring declines in late in the year. We expect that to continue being down about 10% in 2023, and that impacts our Talent business and also our onboarding and online businesses. So that's certainly in our outlook. And then we did factor in what we would characterize as an uncertain or slowing economic environment really more in the second half of 2023. It's hard to forecast where the economy is going to do, but it certainly feels like at these higher interest rates and higher inflation, and you've got the impact of mortgage and now in the hiring space that we're going to see slowdowns as we go through 2023. Yes. So on your first half of your question, John can take the second. You're correct, Manav. In a lot of verticals, we haven't seen that economic impact yet. We're expecting to see that as we go through 2023. So that's a part of our guide and a part of our outlook in verticals like cards, like P loans, like auto, we've seen some limited economic impacts there. But as you point out, cards, for example, are still operating quite well. But given where interest rates have been and where they're going and where the Fed is signaling they're going to take them and the challenge of taming inflation, we think it was prudent to include in our outlook for 2023 a softening of the economy as we go through the year.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: As you look around outside the US, right, we saw a weakening in the UK. That's already occurred, started to happen in the fourth quarter, and we saw relatively weaker performance in some of the other markets around the world as well. So to free cash flow -- so as we look through 2023, Manav, we're expecting to see expanding margins, as Mark talked about, and we're expecting to see, obviously, therefore, expanding EPS as well, and we're also expecting to bring down capital spending. So we expect to see very nice growth in free cash flow as we move through 2023 sequentially, as we go through the quarters. In terms of working capital, as we've discussed in prior calls, as we were going through a significant billing system migration, we did see some increase in our accounts receivable. The bulk of that is now completed. We've completed all of North America, and there's just -- there's a little bit more to go as we go through 2023 in some of our international operations. Our internal metrics are showing a nice improvement in terms of our operational performance in those systems in terms of what we're seeing in terms of collections activity. And so although we haven't really seen it yet in the numbers you would have seen in the fourth quarter, we're expecting to start to see some benefit as we move through 2023 in terms of AR, which would affect overall working capital. So net-net, I think free cash flow, we're expecting to see, obviously, expanding margins, improving profitability, lower CapEx and then improvements as we move through the year in working capital in general.\nQ \u2013 Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you. No. Our analysis of it is it's all Q and when we talk to our customers, meaning there's just less background screens happening. I think we were watching this as we went through the fourth quarter. I think all of us saw companies as we went through the tail end of the year and they've accelerated in the first quarter here, announcing layoffs, announcing hiring freezes. That all is going to impact the hiring market. It's a bit bifurcated. I think we all know that the hiring at the, call it, the hourly wage area is still very strong. So that really wasn't impacted. This is more white collar impact, where companies are just tightening their belts and being more cautious around hiring. So we haven't seen any impact from our new product rollouts, the penetration that we have. And just as a reminder, this is a $2 billion TAM for us, is Talent. And we have a lot of penetration opportunities, meaning we're continuing to work in to bring new solutions and convert our customers from their manual work to digital, and that's what really allows us to outgrow a declining market, which we expect to continue to do in 2023. And then as we also mentioned, that same hiring impact where companies are tightening their belts around adding new resources impacted our onboarding or our I-9 business in the latter part of the year, we expect it to impact in 2022. As we said in the comments earlier, we expect both of those businesses to grow double-digit even with those market declines because of the new product capabilities, the new penetration opportunities that we have and, of course, our normal pricing that we rolled out on a 1/1, on January 1. Yes, I'll let John jump in. No change in what we told you we were going to do in October and price and what we actually did. Obviously, what's happened is the mortgage market -- first off, we have a very challenging comp in the first quarter and the second quarter versus last year. A year ago, the mortgage market was super strong. So you start with that, and that was as expected, although as we talked about, we've reduced our mortgage outlook for 2023 from what we thought in October. So that puts pressure on the quarter and on the year, from a margin standpoint. There's some small pressure from the lower growth in talent and onboarding in I-9 because of the tightening belts around hiring taking place, but the bulk of the first quarter impact is what John described of, really, from a cost standpoint in 2022, our incentive compensation was well below target because of the decline in the mortgage market. As John said, we expect 2023 to be paying at target. So that's a higher expense to us. That flows through the year. And then we typically have in the first quarter when we make our retention equity grants to our team, an equity expense that takes place. And there, I don't know, what else would you add, John?\nA \u2013 John Gamble: No. Just in terms of price and product, you can see the benefit of price and product in the fourth quarter, obviously, in USIS. Very strong performance in online. We saw volume in banking. But we had very strong performance in auto and in banking and lending and cards. So -- and some of that was product and some of that was price. And you're certainly seeing it in the first quarter in EWS, right? As Mark mentioned, pricing increases going in January, and we're seeing the benefit of both product and price and in EWS with their margins expanding in the first quarter. So no difference, and you're seeing it in the performance of the business.\nA \u2013 Mark Begor: I think, John, you also said in your comments that if you look at first quarter versus fourth quarter and isolate around these expense items around incentive and equity, our margins are basically flat, which means we're absorbing a weaker mortgage market than the fourth quarter and still getting the benefits of operating leverage and price and everything else to kind of offset that ex the cost items that we had that we talked about.\nQ \u2013 Kyle Peterson: Thank you. Yes, no, they're very attractive records. We want them all. First, let me just make the point. We've got a long runway in traditional non-farm payroll. And I think as you saw a 12% growth last year in TWN records, was very, very strong. We signed, I think, 10 new partners that will come online in 2023. I think we said before that in our existing partners, think about payroll partners, there's meaningful records that we still haven't brought onboard with them. And there's a lot of incentives to do that. So that's kind of the base records. And over the last couple of years, we've scaled up resources that are going after pension records. I think it was in the third quarter last year, we signed our first pension partner to bring pension records into our data set. And we've got a pipeline of those. And process-wise, that's quite similar. If you think about pension records, they're probably in three different places, it's more than that, but three principal places. One is there are companies that are much like payroll processors that process defined benefit pensions for legacy companies that have those. So, going to those companies and developing those partnerships is strategy number one. Number two is large legacy companies process their own pension payroll, lots of them. So we're already collecting their employee payroll, so going in and collecting their pension payroll as a part of that strategy. So we know how to do that in just a matter of executing it. And then the third is in federal, state and local governments. Many of them have their own pension processing operations, so going to collect those records. So that's where we're going on the pension side. And then on the gig side, there's a lot of different strategies, individual companies, as you might imagine, going to get that and other entities that will have those gig records. And as we've talked before, it's the 114 million uniques that we have. There's about 220 million working Americans between non-farm payroll, gig and pension. So over the long-term, we've got the ability to double the scale of our records going forward. So that's a big lever for growth from workforce. I think as you know, the day we add a new record, we're able to monetize it instantly, because we're already getting inquiries for the record we don't have, right? With our 50-plus percent hit rates, as we add that 51st, 52nd set of data records, we're able to monetize instantly. So it's a very powerful part of the revenue engine and margin engine for Workforce Solutions, which is why we have such a dedicated team focusing on it. And if you think about the scale of our records, if you go back four years ago versus the 114 million uniques, we had something like 70 million and 300,000 companies. We ended last year with 2.6 million companies contributing their data to us. So the cloud has allowed us to really scale that, and there's a long runway for future growth.\nQ \u2013 Kevin McVeigh: Thank you. Yes, it's a great question, and we believe that it's more leverage or more opportunity to really drive our digital solutions. And if you think about a mortgage originator, that clearly is under significant financial pressure now because of the reduced -- the reductions in volumes. They're looking to improve their productivity, and the only way to improve your productivity is through instant decisioning. And the goal that they always have and the leading players in the space are working to really shorten the time frame between application and closing. As you know, it's a very long time frame and that time frame has cost involved in it. It also has risk involved in it around the consumer changing. It has risk involved in it, and the consumer deciding, I'm not going to buy the home, meaning you've spent a bunch of COGS on it. And you've heard us talk before, the average mortgage originators spending $5,000 of expense in a mortgage application if they can shorten the time and take labor out of it by using instant data. That's a positive. So we expect our conversations around using our Instant data, particularly around TWN, to accelerate in this environment, meaning we're going to become more embedded and more instant, which has been a trend, as you know, over the last couple three years, even in the stronger mortgage environment. Some of that over the -- in 2020 and 2021 was challenged by the -- just the pace of the volume they had. They didn't have time to really focus on changing their processes. Now they do. So it's clearly a focus of ours, and we think a positive going forward that Instant is going to drive speed and drive productivity. And that doesn't only apply to mortgage, that applies to really all our verticals. Think about government, think about talent. If we're able -- they're under cost pressure today. And those verticals, whether you're a background screener or a government agency, improving your productivity and improving the speed of the service you deliver is very, very valuable to them. And the way to do that is to use instant data from Equifax like our twin data, our income and employment data.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Jeffrey: That's very helpful. Thanks. I appreciate it. Yes. We're obviously quite thoughtful about that, as you might imagine, we want to make sure we're quite strategic about where we're doing it. Remember, the bulk of the actions are really related to the cloud transformation and accelerating those. So you've got a lot happening in technology. And the bulk of the actions are also in contractors. We hired a bunch of contractors to do the cloud work, and we're taking actions now when we complete that and decommission the legacy infrastructure to take those out. The rest of the actions, I would characterize as kind of normal focus and thoughtful focus around where do we have opportunities to be more efficient and more productive while protecting our focus on growth. And growth includes our new products. I think it's a great point, just to add on that. I think we mentioned on the call today that EWS new product rollouts, kind of 2x our long-term goal, north of 20% last year. And as you know, they were in the cloud a year ago, 18 months ago, and it's really shown what we envisioned happening, that the ability to bring more new solutions to market more quickly and more productively, as John pointed out, and efficiently would happen when you're cloud native. And that's part of what we expect to happen as we go through 2023, and we expect to continue in 2024, meaning we're going to have additional cloud benefits, as John pointed out in 2024, and then we get the full year run rate impact of our actions in 2023. We're not. I'd clarify with them if you want to try to understand better the top of waterfall comment. We don't know where that is or how that happens. We haven't seen them as a competitive threat in the marketplace. I think as you know, our record additions are quite substantial. We're -- we added in the quarter more records -- more unique records than they have. So we've clearly got an ability to attract new partnerships and individual relationships given the scale of the company. And then on the commercial side, our integrations are so deep and so substantial, we haven't seen an impact from a revenue standpoint. As you can see, the numbers are super strong in Workforce Solutions across all of our verticals, including mortgage. Their outperformance is exceptionally strong and hasn't slowed down.\nA \u2013 John Gamble: And just please remember, our historical record base is incredibly valuable to our customers, certainly in Talent, certainly in Government, increasingly in mortgage, we talked about mortgage 36 on in the conference call. And that's a place where we have tremendous strength in general and Verification Services and an even stronger position in historical records.\nQ \u2013 Shlomo Rosenbaum: Got it. Thank you. Yes. Toni, really not a lot of change from the consumer from October, meaning they're still strong. They're working -- like unemployment being so low, unemployment being so high and all the open jobs, that's a good thing for the consumer. They've clearly -- we've seen they spent down some of their COVID pandemic savings, but there's still positive savings from where they were in 2019. So that element is quite positive. Obviously, at the low end, inflation is still pressuring the subprime consumer, and we've seen some uptick in delinquencies there. But broadly, we would characterize the consumer as being quite strong. Now when we look out for 2023 here in February, that's where we talked about and we factored into our outlook a more uncertain economy, which should impact the consumer, call it, in the second half perhaps in the way we're thinking about it with these continued rising interest rates. And every day, you see another company announcing layoffs or hiring freezes. And that's going to have to have an impact at some point, and that's part of our outlook. On the B2B side, I think we talked at length about what we're seeing in the hiring space that we've already -- I just talked about. But that's impacting our businesses in background screening and talent and then an I-9 and onboarding. We still expect to grow over 10% in those two businesses because of pricing and product and penetration. But the actual volume, we expect to be down on a year-over-year basis. So that's going to have an impact. I think in the quarter, you talked about -- in the first quarter, if you exclude that in the equity impact, margins are basically flat. Yes, I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you just clarify that? About -- tech is an important function for Equifax for sure. As you know, we're a data analytics technology company. It's actually our largest number of employees and, by far, the largest number of contractors. Most of the cost savings have always been planned, and that's what we're executing in 2023 come from completing the cloud and then exiting the plan -- the contractors that we're working on that are principally contractors and exiting those out. Go ahead. Yes. We're always looking to improve our talent and upgrade it. I think we've got a very strong technology team today, but for sure. Maybe I'll answer the question a little bit differently. If you asked the question a year ago about what's it like to hire tech talent a year ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago, it was very hard. Today, when we're hiring tech talent, which we do all the time with -- in the environment as you described, where a lot of tech companies are pulling back, that is a positive for Equifax. We're able to get great talent and it's just shorter time frames between opening a job and finding great people to come onboard in this current environment. So for sure. I think you've seen before at Equifax, if you follow it closely, that in a rising unemployment environment like in 2020, we get substantial upside from our unemployment claims business. Today, we don't have that really baked in, in 2023 because we just haven't seen that yet. But if it comes forward, that will certainly be a positive. Yes. We haven't disclosed those in the past, George. As you know, we've -- in the past, we've been very transparent around mortgage just because of the volatility, if you will, in that space and the impact it's had in Equifax. Yes. I think we talked about that, and John can jump in. But we expect those businesses to still perform very well. Remember, the underlying levers that verification has, it starts with records. So our 12% increase in records last year benefits 2023. And then we've got 10 new processors that we're going to be adding records in 20 -- during this year in 2023. So records were positive in all the different verticals that we sell into, whether it's government, talent, auto, cards, P loans, the non-mortgage verticals in verification. We've got price increases in the marketplace. We're rolling out new products in every one of those verticals that really benefit growth going forward. So that's a positive. And then just underlying penetration. Remember in every one of those non-mortgage verticals for verification, we have fairly low penetration in cards, in auto, there's a lot of penetration opportunity. P loans is pretty high. Like mortgage, we do a lot -- we have -- we cover a lot of the ground in P loans. But then you go into talent and government, there's just a lot of market penetration opportunities. So then the flip side of that is the underlying market for those. What's happening to the economic impacts in there? And the one place that we've highlighted is talent and around verification where there is some reduction in hiring, but we said that we expect that business to still be up over 10% for 2023. Government is also a vertical that if there is an economic event, there's going to be more people going for social services, which will be a positive for that vertical. We expect that to grow positively through 2023. Yes. I think that's the right way to think about it. In 2022, we set out a plan for the year at this time last year, where we didn't anticipate a mortgage market change or interest rates going up or inflation where it was. And we missed that plan. And the way our compensation structures are aligned, as you might imagine, are tied to the performance against our plan for the year, and we underperformed that. So our compensation was substantially down in 2022. In 2023, we're assuming we get back to target levels, which would be more like 21%. Yes. You said the $120 million next year, it's actually this year, which I think you meant is 2023. Yes. And we didn't break that out for you, but the $120 million is a combination of accelerating some of the cloud cost savings that we had planned. So the -- I think we said in the call earlier, no change in what we expected to deliver from the cloud savings. We're accelerating some of that into 2023. We also said we expect additional cloud cost savings in 2024 and likely some in 2025. And then on top of that, in 2023, inside the $120 million is at a broader restructuring and efficiencies across the company to deliver additional cost savings that are incremental our long-term cloud savings that we've talked about for the last couple of years. Yes. We haven't broken that out as a part of our conversation this morning. We really just highlighted that, obviously, it's a sizable number. It's going to have a very positive impact on the company, and its -- there's an incremental piece to the accelerated cloud savings. They're not. We still have a very effective ability to add new relationships. I think we talked about adding 10 that will come online this year during 2023. And we have the scale of workforce solutions, the scale of their technology, the scale of our security and capabilities and the longevity we've had in the business. So we've been in this business for over a decade, and then the ability to deliver a rev share immediately at scale for those records from a partner gives us a lot of power to continue to grow our record base. And there's a long runway in front of us of records that we'll be adding to the TWN data set."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, beginning on Slide 4.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Trevor. Equifax delivered another solid quarter with continued execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities in a challenging economic environment. Third quarter revenue of $1.244 billion was up 2% or 4% in constant currency and was above the high end of our guidance driven by strong non-mortgage revenue growth in the quarter. This strong revenue performance was well above our July framework and delivered despite a more negative FX environment than we expected, which at 200 basis points or $29 million was a $5 million or about 50 basis point greater headwind for FX than we expected when we put out July guidance. Adjusted EPS of $1.73 per share was also stronger than our July guidance. We are continuing to significantly outperform our underlying markets as we navigate the challenging economic environment and mortgage market decline. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which now represent over 78% of total Equifax revenue, were very strong with 20% total and 13% organic non-mortgage, constant currency dollar revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in July and stronger than our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We're now tracking to 20% non-mortgage constant dollar growth in 2022, which is up about a 100 basis points from our July guidance. The outperformance was again led by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions that delivered 40% total and 20% organic non-mortgage revenue growth. USIS B2B non-mortgage grew 9% online and 5% total, which was about consistent with second quarter, but weaker than we expected. International delivered a record quarter up a very strong 17% constant dollar growth and 15% organic constant dollar growth well above our expectations. Equifax total mortgage revenue is down 30% about as expected and outperformed the underlying market decline by over 10 points from pricing, new TWN records, penetrations, system-to-system integrations and new products. The U.S. mortgage market as expected weakened substantially in the third quarter with originations estimated at down 50% in the quarter, which was about 9 points weaker than our July guidance. As a reminder, Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue is more closely tied to originations. USIS mortgage credit inquiries were down 41% in the quarter and better than our expectations from increased shopping activity despite the weaker than expected mortgage originations. We're continuing to see higher than normal levels of shopping, which continued throughout the quarter and tends to benefit USIS credit file pool. Combined, the negative mortgage market impact on Equifax was about as expected as the more negative market impact from originations on EWS was offset by the less negative impact on USIS from increased shopping activity. We saw continued weakening of the mortgage market as we moved through September into the first few weeks of October as mortgage rates continued to rise to their highest level since 2008. We now expect mortgage originations to decline over 60% in the fourth quarter versus our July framework of 48% and USIS credit inquiries to decline over 50% versus our July guidance of 46%. John will talk about our updated mortgage framework in a minute. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $405 million and was flat compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.5% were slightly below our expectations for the quarter, principally due to higher sales and marketing expenses driven by our outperformance in non-mortgage verticals. John will walk you through our margin performance in the third quarter and expectations for fourth quarter later in the presentation. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 70% of North America and 60% of total EFX revenue being delivered from the new EFX Cloud. Our focus for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 is accelerating full customer migrations in North America to enable decommissioning of our applications in data centers. Our new EFX Cloud infrastructure is delivering always on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and single data fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX Cloud infrastructure and single data fabric and are seeing acceleration of innovation in new product rollouts. Our new product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and over 500 basis points improvement from our 9% Vitality Index last year and well above our 10% long-term goal for Vitality. As a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of revenue derived from new products launched in the past three years. Our strong momentum on NPI rollouts leveraging the new EFX Cloud allowed us to raise our full year Vitality Index outlook for 2022 for the second time this year from 11% to 13%, which is up 300 basis points from our long-term framework and from the framework we started earlier this year. This strong NPI performance gives us momentum into 2023 as most new products reach commercial maturity in years two and three. In third quarter, we continue to execute our bolt-on acquisition strategy completing two acquisitions, LawLogix, which will further strengthen Workforce Solutions Onboarding and I-9 Solutions and Midigator, which will strengthen Kount and broaden our identity in fraud franchise. These are our 11th and 12th bolt-on acquisitions since January, 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen Workforce Solutions, our largest and fastest growing business, add unique and differentiated data and expand into fast growing identity and fraud market. Bolt-on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are strong levers for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add a 100 to 200 basis points annually to our revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A. Our guidance for 2022 revenue of just under $5.1 billion is essentially unchanged from the framework we provided in July. Third quarter revenue was stronger than our July guidance by about $25 million. Our current guidance reflects a decline in fourth quarter from our prior implied view by about $25 million from the weaker mortgage market and FX. The continued weakening in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting fourth quarter revenue by about $45 million and negative FX is impacting revenue in the fourth quarter by about $15 million. Partially offsetting this $60 million negative impact is stronger non-mortgage revenue and Workforce Solutions in international and the acquired revenue from LawLogix and Midigator. The strong 20% constant dollar non-mortgage growth in 2022 gives us great momentum as we look to 2023 and a bottoming of the mortgage market in the coming quarters. Our guidance for adjusted EPS of $7.54 a share is down about $0.13 from the midpoint of our July guidance. As our third quarter adjusted EPS was about $0.8 per share stronger than our July guidance, this results in a reduction in the fourth quarter from our implied EPS of about $0.21 a share or about $33 million in pre-tax income. The most significant drivers of this reduction in EPS are first the $45 million reduction in higher margin fourth quarter mortgage revenue due to the weakening mortgage market, which more than drives this level of reduction in pre-tax income and second higher interest expense. These negative impacts were partially offset by stronger non-mortgage growth and the addition of acquisition related non-mortgage revenue from LawLogix and Midigator and again John will provide details on fourth quarter and full year guidance shortly. We were very pleased with our continued very strong constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% organic, which is well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and our ability to outperform the underlying mortgage market as shown by our third quarter results. Turning to Slide 5 a critical de-lever of our strategic priorities is a continued expansion of our addressable market data sources and revenue. Equifax is much more than a credit bureau today and our addressable TAM has expanded 3x to over $45 billion. Over the past several years we've expanded into faster growing markets outside financial services and mortgage. These faster growing markets include identity and fraud, talent management, government and employer services verticals. This has accelerated our growth outside of financial services and mortgage and increased the resiliency and diversity of EFX by broadening our revenue streams, including markets that are expected to deliver future growth at levels above our traditional markets. As shown on this slide since 2019, we've grown our total non-mortgage business by over $1.1 billion with a combined CAGR since 2019 of 12%, which is at the high end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. In 2022 we expect non-mortgage revenue to represent over 75% of total Equifax revenue. In the fourth quarter, it will be well over 80%. Also, since 2019, we've grown our non-credit bureau based revenues by $1.5 billion or a very strong CAGR of about 30% to over half of Equifax total revenue. This is led by our $2.4 billion Workforce Solutions business, which is up $1.4 billion since 2019 at a very strong CAGR of about 35%, but also supported by strong double-digit growth in identity and fraud from Kount and Midigator as well as strong growth in debt services. We've also completed 12 acquisitions since 2021 that are all in the non-mortgage space and are delivering strong double-digit growth. Workforce Solutions strong above market growth and verticals like Employer Solutions, Talent and Government, our expansion into identity and fraud and our focus on new product investments, coupled with our bolt-on acquisitions focused on non-mortgage priorities will continue to accelerate the growth of these non-credit and non-mortgage revenue streams at Equifax. Turning to Slide 6 in the third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars grew a very strong 16% reported and 19% in constant currency, which was consistent with our July guidance. Constant dollar core revenue, organic revenue growth of 14% in the quarter was also substantially above the organic growth in our long-term financial framework of 7% to 10%. Non-mortgage constant dollar organic revenue growth of 13% drove three quarters of the organic constant dollar core growth in the quarter. Core mortgage outperformance predominantly in EWS drove the remainder of the core organic constant dollar revenue growth. We continue to expect strong core revenue growth of 17% total and 19% in constant currency in 2022, which again is well above our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and 300 basis points higher than the core growth for 2022 provided last November at our Investor Day. This strong constant currency growth is driven by stronger non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% in organic due to broad-based performance across Workforce Solutions and strength in International. As detailed on Slide 7, U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 30% in the quarter. This compares to third quarter mortgage originations of down 57% as estimated by mortgage industry, third parties and USIS credit inquiries that declined 41%. As a reminder in a rising rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate short more frequently, creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations that benefits USIS credit file pole from shopping. In the third quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform on the order of 16 points better than the change in the estimated mortgage originations. USIS revenue declined 35% in the quarter, about 6 points better than credit inquiries. However, TWN income and employment is typically pulled later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront shopping trend that occurs in a rising rate environment as TWN inquiries are more closely aligned with completed mortgage originations. TWN mortgage revenue declined 28% in the quarter. EWS core mortgage revenue growth that was up a strong 14% in the quarter and when adjusting for the 16 point negative spread between mortgage inquiries and originations was up a very strong 30% and consistent with prior quarters. Overall, Equifax mortgage revenue outperformed USIS credit inquiries by 11% or 11 points in the quarter and outperformed estimated mortgage originations by a strong 27 points in the quarter. This reflects the strength of our U.S. enterprise mortgage sales and operations team that bring the combined USIS and EWS products and solutions to market in this challenging mortgage macro. Turning to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter with 32% core revenue growth, driven by very strong non-mortgage, non-UC & ERC growth of 62%. As a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is now about 70% of Workforce Solutions and a big Workforce Solutions driver for future growth from their fast growing talent and government verticals. Workforce Solutions above market 32% core growth in the quarter continues to be driven by very strong performance on TWN record additions, new products and pricing, system-to-system integrations and greater penetration. Their market outperformance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes for mortgage. We expect to see continued very strong core growth in fourth quarter from Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team continue outstanding execution across their key growth drivers detailed on the right hand side of this slide. Over the past 12 months, we've signed 10 new agreements with payroll processors in the U.S., including three new agreements in the third quarter that will be added to the TWN database over the next several quarters. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in our direct contributors through our employers services business are delivering continued strong growth in the TWN database with current records up 16% reaching 146 million current records in the third quarter. Their 111 million unique individuals in TWN deliver very high hit rates and represent over two-thirds of the 165 million U.S. non-farm payroll. And as a reminder, about 50% of our TWN records are contributed directly from individual employers that we have long relationships with. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. In addition to traditional W2 wage earners we estimate there are approximately $30 million to $40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S. who will also bring valuable income and employment insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We've recently signed an agreement with a payroll processor to gain access to their pensioner records and we have an active pipeline with other companies to acquire new pension records to the TWN database. We're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million gig and pensioner records, but expect to make significant progress as we move through 2023 and beyond. TWN record additions will continue to drive Workforce Solutions revenue going forward from higher hit rates and we have the ability to double our records in the future to the roughly 220 million total W2, gig and pension recipients in the United States. This is an incredibly powerful lever for future growth at Workforce Solutions and a key driver of their 13% to 15% long-term growth outlook. Turning to Slide 9 with some more detail on Workforce Solutions, they really had an exceptional quarter delivering revenue of $559 million. Revenue was up a strong 9% with overall organic revenue growth of about flat overall despite the significant 28% decline in EWS mortgage revenue in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 40% and is now 70% of Workforce Solutions. Verification services revenue of $455 million was up 13% more than offsetting the 57% decline in estimated mortgage originations. Non-mortgage verticals now represent over 60% of Verifier revenue and delivered 72% total and 30% organic growth. The Insights business which we acquired late last year continues to perform very well driven by strong performance in their largest verticals, Risk Intelligence and Justice. Risk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze peoples risks via background checks and continuous monitoring. Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. Talent and Government Solutions, which now represent almost 40% of Verifier non-mortgage had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered a 110% total in over 50% organic growth in the quarter from record growth pricing and strong new product rollouts. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 90% total and 44% organic driven by strong penetration at the state level. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong product portfolio, including Insights data at the federal, state and local levels across the United States. The continued expansion of Workforce Solutions data hub through our new Total Verify Solution is driving very strong growth in the fast growing 5 billion Talent and 2 billion Government markets. Our total Verifier Solution is enabling our customers to access multi-data solutions derived from an unparalleled set of differentiated information assets spanning employment, income, education, incarceration, health credentialing and identity. As of the third quarter, EWS has over 580 million total records in the TWN database, both current and historic that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories. The non-mortgage EWS consumer lending business principally in card, auto and consumer finance and led by our U.S. Enterprise sales teams also showed good growth with revenue up 18% in the quarter. Employer services revenue of $104 million was down 7% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims in employer retention credit businesses. We expected total UC & ERC revenue to be down about 20% in 2022, driven by the lower jobless claims and ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer services revenue excluding UC & ERC was up a strong 29% in the quarter driven by broad based double-digit growth in our I-9 and Onboarding, healthy FX and our tax credit businesses. We are increasingly seeing the ability to deliver bundled packages of our differentiated Employer Services Solutions to customers. In the third quarter, we signed a large multiyear agreement to provide a broad suite of EWS solutions, including I-9, W4, Tax Services and other HR Solutions to a large multinational company with annual guaranteed Workforce Solutions revenues approaching $20 million with total annual revenue opportunities with the agreement of over $30 million. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.5% were lower than our July guidance and the over 50% margins we expect from EWS on an ongoing basis. The main drivers of the lower than expected margin was negative mix due to lower mortgage revenue, higher sales and marketing costs principally due to very strong non-mortgage revenue growth and costs to add the new TWN contributors I talked about earlier. The decline in EBITDA margins versus last year was driven by similar factors including negative product margin mix as higher margin mortgage declined as a percentage of revenue and was replaced with Verifier non-mortgage revenue and revenue from the most recent acquisitions, which at this point have lower margins than Verifier overall. And second, increased marketing and sales expense from both investments to drive NPI and driven by our extremely strong non-mortgage sales and record acquisition performance. And then last, as I mentioned, cost related to Onboarding new TWN contributors. We expect these same factors to impact EWS margins in fourth quarter as we see further declines in mortgage revenue with EWS EBITDA margins of about 48.5% in fourth quarter. As we look to 2023, we expect to see EWS margins return to above 50% as product and pricing initiatives expand profitability and we see additional savings from their cloud transformation. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in the third quarter. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another above market quarter with 9% revenue growth and 32% core growth and are well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue above market growth in the future. As shown on Slide 10, USIS revenue of about $397 million were down 9% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 35% and was also better than expected with a 41% decline in credit inquiries versus the 46% we had expected. At $97 million mortgage revenue is now about 25% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage revenue was $250 million, which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue and was up 5% with organic revenue growth of 3%. This was below the low end of the 67% growth we discussed in July. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth remained strong at 9% total and 6% organic, a sign that lenders continue to originate. During the quarter we saw double-digit growth in commercial and telco and solid single digit growth across financial services, auto and insurance offset by a decline in our direct-to-consumer business. Kount, which provides unique identity and fraud solutions continues to execute very well, developing joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data with 2022 global revenue expected to exceed 20%. The recent acquisition of Midigator will continue to strengthen our identity and fraud franchise and growth. The weakness relative to expectations in the quarter was again in financial marketing services, our B2B offline business that has revenue of $51 million, down 8% and lower than our expectations. As we discussed in previous quarters, the principle driver of decline in FMS Services was our fraud and data services vertical where we provide header data principally to providers of identity and fraud services and to a much lesser extent in our risk management and portfolio review business where we provide data and analytical services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or in some cases portfolios they're acquiring. As we discussed in prior quarters, we expect the declines in these businesses to continue through the fourth quarter with improvements in 2023 as we introduce new products, leveraging unique and differentiated data assets available through the new Equifax single data fabric. We also saw a decline in batch marketing services where we provide data and decisioning principally to financial institutions for pre-screeners as well as delivering our IXI data for marketing activities as some customers cut back on originations. We had seen high single digit growth in marketing services in the first half, so this is the first signs of any pullback in marketing. For fourth quarter B2B non-mortgage, we expect online to continue to be strong with growth rates above third quarter from commercial execution as well as progress in pricing and new product rollouts that overcome a somewhat slower growth in financial services. We expect financial marketing services to continue to be weak down over 10% with declines across header, risk and marketing continuing in the fourth quarter. Overall for B2B non-mortgage, we expect fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be about the levels we saw in the third quarter. USIS consumer solutions business had revenue of $50 million, down 1% in the quarter, but up 2% sequentially. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow again sequentially with positive growth rates in the fourth quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.1% in the quarter and slightly below our expectations principally due to continued investments in sales resources focused on non-mortgage growth. International revenue as shown on Slide 11 was up $288 million, up a very strong 17% on a local currency basis and 15% on a non-organic constant currency basis. We're seeing broad based execution from our international businesses. Europe local currency revenue was up 24%, principally driven by over 75% growth in our UK debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the UK Government over the past several quarters. Our European CRA revenue accelerated in the third quarter with revenue of 7% and above our expectations, driven by broad-based product execution across our B2B online products and identity and fraud, slightly offset by lower consumer revenue. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia-New Zealand business, delivered local currency revenue of 6% driven by strong growth in our commercial and identity and fraud businesses and to a lesser extent growth in consumer. Latin America local currency revenue was up a strong 34% driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador and Central America. The team's new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continued to drive strong growth across all product lines. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Latin America. Canada local currency revenue was up 12% and above our expectations. We saw growth in commercial, analytics solutions, decisioning and identity and fraud revenue, which was partially offset by some one-time revenue in the quarter from mortgage volume declines. Consumer revenue also returned to growth during the quarter. We expect mid-single digit revenue growth from Canada in the fourth quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 26.8% were down 200 basis point -- down 210 basis points sequentially and above our expectations given strong revenue growth. EBITDA margins were up slightly versus last year, but up about 150 basis points adjusting for the loss of equity income from the Russian joint venture that we sold. As shown on Slide 12, we had a very strong new product quarter with Vitality Index at 14%, which is our highest Vitality Index ever, and it was over 500 basis points above last year's results and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term growth framework for Vitality. We've delivered about 80 new products so far in 2022 leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities. We now expect to deliver Vitality Index of 13% in 2022, up 200 basis points from our previous guide of 11%, which equates to over $650 million of new product revenue in the year. The growth in our 2022 Vitality Index is principally coming from Workforce Solutions, which is encouraging as they are further along in completing their cloud transformation. It's positive to see the strong NPI results in the early innings of the Equifax Cloud. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax cloud capabilities and single data fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top line growth. This week at the Annual Mortgage Bankers Association Conference, we will showcase a new offering that delivers telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes alongside the traditional mortgage credit report to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process, delivering telco, pay TV and utilities attributes to mortgage lenders alongside the traditional credit reports will also help expand access to credit and help create greater home ownership opportunities for U.S. consumers. The use of these expanded data insights can also provide visibility to millions of credit invisible consumers, those without traditional credit files, and enhance the financial profiles of thin, young and unscorable consumers as they complete their first mortgage applications. This new offering leveraging the Equifax Cloud will provide powerful new insights that help to automate, save time and resources and streamline the first mortgage process for every applicant, creating more opportunities for consumers to secure a loan. And Equifax is the first and only in the industry to offer these unique insights to the mortgage industry. Turning the Slide 13, we outlined the 12 strategic bolt-on acquisitions we've completed since January 2021 we expect will deliver over $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. As you know, our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1% to 2% of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt on M&A aligned around our three strategic priorities. First, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest growing and most profitable business. Second, building out our identity fraud capabilities and third, adding unique data assets. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more details on the mortgage market, and our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on Slide 14, our guidance reflects and expectations the decline in the U.S. mortgage market will steepen in the fourth quarter with mortgage originations declining over 60% and mortgage credit inquiries declining over 50%. This is a significant reduction from our expectations in July and as Mark referenced earlier, this expectation of a further weakening of the mortgage market negatively impacts 4Q revenue by almost $45 million. 3Q mortgage revenue was 21.9% of total Equifax revenues compared to 29.5% and 24.7% in 1Q 2022, and 2Q 2022 respectively. In 4Q, we expect mortgage revenue to be about 16% of total Equifax revenues. The rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impacts on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business. EBITDA margins at 32.5% were slightly below the level of at or below 33% we discussed in our July guidance. Mark discussed the drivers in HBU [ph]. Partially offsetting these items were lower corporate and corporate technology expenses. Slide 15 provides our guidance 4Q 2022. We expect revenue in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.185 billion reflecting revenue down about 6.3% year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance or down about 3.7% on a constant currency basis. 4Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 31.5%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 4Q 2022 to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share compared to 4Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.84 per share. As Mark shared earlier, the decline in our 4Q 2022 guidance is as compared to implied levels we shared in July, is driven by the significant reduction in our expectations for the U.S. mortgage market in the fourth quarter. 4Q 2022 revenue and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $25 million. Mark covered this earlier as the $45 million decline from the weakening U.S. mortgage market and $15 million decline driven by FX or partially offset by revenue from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator and stronger non-mortgage revenue growth. 4Q 2022 adjusted EPS and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $0.21 per share or about $33 million in pre-tax income. This decline is driven by the impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market on revenue of $45 million, which given high variable margins drives a pre-tax income decline that exceeds the total variance level. Strong core revenue growth, both from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator as well as stronger organic growth are delivering improvements in pre-tax income. However, these improvements are being offset, by the higher marketing sales and G&A expense that we referenced earlier and higher interest in other expenses. Reflecting the above, our expectations for the BUs [ph] in the fourth quarter as follows. EWS revenue is expected to have an about 3% or greater decline. Continued strong non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to offset the bulk of the impact on EWS mortgage revenue of the expected over 60% decline in mortgage originations. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 48.5% in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to have an about 7.5% or greater decline reflecting the greater than 50% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage credit inquiries. B2B non-mortgage revenue growth is expected to improve from the levels we saw in the third quarter and B2B online continuing with high single digit growth. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 36%. International continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of up to 8.5% down from the third quarter as we lap growth from our UK debt management business. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up sequentially approaching 29%. The declines in both revenue and adjusted EPS and in 4Q 2022 year-to-year are also principally driven by the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market and the significant impact of FX. Looking at revenue at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.175 billion, revenue is down about $78 million. FX is negative about $35 million or 2.6% year-to-year. So on a constant currency basis, revenue is down about $43 million. The impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market using originations declines for EWS and credit inquiries declines for USIS is negative about $185 million or almost 15 points. Excluding these factors effectively, constant dollar revenue growth excluding the impact of the U.S. mortgage market revenues up over $140 million, reflecting predominantly the very strong non-mortgage growth principally in EWS and international and also in the U.S. B2B online, and strong outperformance in mortgage relative to the overall market predominantly in EWS. Looking at adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.50 adjusted EPS is down about $0.34 a share below operating income items, principally higher interest expense and the loss of equity income from our Russia JV, as well as the impact of FX explained just over half of the decline in adjusted EPS. The remainder of the decline is principally driven by the reduction in constant currency revenue of about $43 million. Slide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. We expect revenue of approximately $5.1 billion and adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.49 to $7.59 per share. For the full year of 2022 we expect capital expenditures to be over $550 million. Capital expenditures are above the levels we expected in July as we maintained capital spending at first half 20 22 levels in the third quarter to continue the pace of migration of major exchanges to our cloud infrastructure. We expect to bring down capital spending in 2023 consistent with the completion of the migration of the major North American exchanges. We believe both our fourth quarter and full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provide. As you consider the first quarter of 2023 we wanted to provide some general perspective on our current thinking on the U.S. mortgage market for the quarter. Using our current view of mortgage credit inquiries in the fourth quarter as a base, we currently expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 50% year-to-year in the first quarter of 2023. As we move through 2023, the year-to-year compares get substantially easier, particularly in the second half. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 17, we have some very unique macros in our industry and EFX growth levers driving our performance in 2023 and beyond. The acceleration of the digital macro across every industry is expanding the use of identity, data signals and solutions to drive better decisions across new and existing verticals. Equifax is well positioned to take advantage of the accelerating digital macro through our EFX Cloud investments and our recent acquisitions of Insights, Kount and Midigator. Although we've been impacted by the significant declines in U.S. mortgage market, we believe we have unique levers at Equifax to deliver strong future growth, including Workforce Solutions above market growth and margins, and our expanded focus on new data assets like Insights, USIS non-mortgage growth and Kount and Midigator identity and fraud growth, our new EFX Cloud driving competitive, NPIs top line, and of course cost savings in 2023 and beyond. NPI is leveraging the EFX Cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products and bolt-on M&A to broaden and strengthen Equifax. These attractive market macros along with the broad EFX growth levers and our strong core and non-mortgage outperformance in the past few years, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver above market growth in the future. In the event we do see further economic weakness driven by slowing consumer demand, we believe Equifax is well positioned for continued growth. As we shared with you in July, turning to Slide 18, the new Equifax is a much different and more diverse business than we were in the last recession. We are more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth in challenging economic environments. During the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency you would expect from data analytics businesses. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, EWS grew throughout the global financial crisis and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009. We believe that Equifax business mix today is much better positioned for a potential economic event than in 2009. First, strong EWS growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today with margins over 50% and over 15 percentage points higher than the Equifax average. EWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth, penetration in new and fast growing verticals like talent and government, system-to-system integrations, deploying new higher value products, as well as measured price actions taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database. Second, completion of the Equifax Cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond that we expect will drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from 2022 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven solely by our execution. And then last, we're leveraging the new Equifax cloud to accelerate new product rollouts with a goal of 13% Vitality in 2022, which is over $650 million of the annual incremental revenue from Equifax. As a reminder, NPIs rolled out in 2021 and 2022, will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. Today we believe about 54% of our global business is recession resilient or countercyclical and will grow in a recession. This is a big change and a strong position compared to Equifax and the 2008-2009 global financial crisis where only about 37% of our businesses were either recession resilient or countercyclical. The meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage and identity and fraud since 2009, as well as cloud transformation cost savings position Equifax very well if there's an economic event or recession in 2023 and beyond. Wrapping up on Slide 19, Equifax delivered another strong and broad based quarter driven by 13% organic and 20% total non-mortgage, constant dollar growth that more than offset the 41% decline in the mortgage market, reflecting the broad based strength of Equifax in this challenging economic environment. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-mortgage growth. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient and investing for future growth. Against the unprecedented 37% mortgage market decline in 2022, we expect to deliver constant currency revenue growth of over 5% due to the breadth and strength of our underlying businesses. More importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage constant currency growth of 20% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model. This strong momentum positions us well in 2023 and beyond. EWS continues to deliver above market growth and is our largest, fastest growing and highest margin business. Workforce Solutions above market revenue growth over the past three years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. And new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud are also driving growth. Our 13% Vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we're in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax Cloud to drive innovation new products and expect to deliver strong Vitality in the future. Our 12 bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong top line growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond. And then lastly, we're in the final chapters of completing our new Equifax Cloud data and technology transformation that will deliver top rank growth and cost benefits in 2023 and beyond as we complete the cloud and leverage our new cloud capabilities in single data fabric. Even in this uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax Cloud, new products, data and analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth. We continue to be confident in our long-term growth framework of 8% to 12% total revenue growth and 7% to 10% organic revenue growth with ongoing expansion of margins of 50 basis points per year. We also remain focused on delivering on our 2025 goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins that we set at our Investor Day a year ago. Our ability to deliver non-mortgage growth of 20% in 2022 that is well above our long-term growth framework gives us confidence in the future. We remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster growing higher margin cloud native data analytics company. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Mark, I was hoping just on Slide 17 where you gave us some of kind of the levers for 2023, I think, I was hoping you would touch on some of the macro trends you're seeing in the card and auto verticals. You know, just some perspective on where we are today in those categories relative to pre-COVID or history and some of the trends you're seeing there, whether they're decelerating or staying the same or any color around those would be helpful.\nMark Begor: Yes, we talked a bunch Manav, good morning, about mortgage. So we're happy to talk more questions on that. You know, maybe if you step back kind of where we are with the consumer and our customers, the consumer continues to be exceptionally strong. Their credit scores are still up from 2019. They're working. We haven't seen real changes in delinquencies except at the subprime level there's some small changes, but even there delinquencies are lower than they were in 2019. So you've got consumers that have had wage growth. Employment is low, you know, so it's a very good environment for the consumer, which really impacts the verticals you talked about. And then our customers are still very strong there's no question about that. You know, when you think about the last economic event we had in the global financial crisis, you had both traditional financial institutions, banks, and fintechs that really had balance sheet problems. So that's not the environment we have today. So, it's similar to our dialogue that we had in July and back in April. We see a strong consumer continuing, through the fourth quarter and into 2023 and the same thing with our customers. So with regards to kind of activity around originations in some of those verticals not a lot of change. There's still some challenges in auto around supply chain, availability. I think there's expectations that's going to get better in the coming quarters, but it's still hard to find a car, particularly and certain models that you want to get, which is resulting in auto being down some from a year ago. But again, kind of at our expectation, no real change in cards. I think we mentioned in our comments that we've seen a little bit of weakening in some marketing, but I wouldn't call that a trend. You know, broadly, our customers are still focused on originations, card volume is very, very strong, card originations is very, very strong. And again, you go back to, you've got consumers that are very strong. I think everyone, you know, is watching very closely, both us and our customers. When will there be a change in delinquencies.\nG Capital:\nManav Patnaik: Got it.\nJohn Gamble: If you just look at non-mortgage online organic growth rates in the third quarter, right? We saw telco was up double-digit, fi, insurance and auto were up mid-to-high single digits. So which is ______.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just on the Workforce Solutions two thirds of non-farm payroll data now in your database, it sounds like you've, I think been closing that gap maybe faster than we had expected. Just some thoughts if that, if it is the same case versus your internal expectations, but the question is, you know, how much of that is really, you know, locked in exclusive per se? Like, you know, just so that competition is in the one year.\nJohn Gamble: Yes, I think Manav a couple of points on that. You know, we're increasingly looking beyond non-farm payroll as you know. Adding in the gig economy as well as the pensioners, and when we think about our 146 million records and 111 million uniques or individuals in our data set, you know, there's about 200 plus million, 210 million, 220 million total working Americans and pensioners. So there's a long runway for us between w-2. Traditional employees, self-employed and remember self-employed we think about gig workers of being Uber drivers, DoorDash, et cetera. But think about self-employed doctors, self-employed lawyers, self-employed accountants self-employed contractors, it's a large population and then that pension base is quite large. And we mentioned in comments earlier that we've been starting to add pension records and gig records, and we signed an agreement with a company that does pension payroll, if you will, for various companies where we're going to do the income and employment verification for them. So, you know, we have the ability to double our data set, you know, over a lot of years going forward. And I think, as you know, we've talked to you before that, we've got a 13% to 15% long-term growth rate for Workforce Solutions that sits inside of Equifax's 8% to 12% growth rate. And we've got 3 to 4 points of that from record growth in the 13% to 15%. So, there's no question we've had above expectation record growth over the last, it's not new, it wasn't last quarter. You know, it's really been for three or four years. A lot of that has been from many of the payroll processors that you go back three or four years ago, we're not contributing our records and now they are. And as well as continued growth from our core records, which are from individual companies. So with regards to the competitive position we have, we feel very good about it. You know, the agreements that we've signed or on an exclusive basis since in 2022 and since I've been here, it's the right relationship between our partners and Equifax. They want it and we want it. And you know, when we think about half of our records coming from individual companies, those are from long-term relationships where we're providing those broad suite of services. Whether it's I-9, W2 management, unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit, HCA benefits, all those solutions, to companies. We also do income and employment verification for them as a part of that relationship for free. So that's a very sticky relationship from our perspective. And you probably heard in my comments earlier that Workforce Solutions is really doing a much better job going to market with the full suite of employer solutions we have and we signed a contract with a large multinational, that's going to -- once it's implemented, it will be $20 million a year of Equifax revenue where we're providing all those employer solutions services to that multinational. Of course, we're also doing their income and employment verification. So we're quite energized about our progress of adding new records to the data set. I think as you point out, it's certainly been above the long-term framework. And broadly it's been quite positive for us. And maybe a last point that you're well aware of, as you know, the day we add the records, we're already able to monetize them because we're getting inquiries from our customers either through system-to-system integrations or through their access to our website for all of their applicants. So the day we add another record, it's monetized either in a mortgage application, a credit card application, a personal loan, an auto loan in a background screen or in a government social services. So we've got various verticals that are looking for more records. And we already have them in our order book. We just can't fulfill them until we grow the data set. So it's a very powerful growth lever for Workforce Solutions.\nManav Patnaik: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my questions. One of the questions we are getting is more around if we use the fourth quarter EPS and analyze that it implies for next year a significant decline in earnings. I understand there are some puts and takes here. Obviously there was a discussion around cloud benefits coming in 2023, but I was wondering if you could help us parse what are some of the headwinds puts in the quarter, which may not exist going into 2023, and what are other tailwinds as we think about 2023? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, I'll start and then John can jump in. Obviously you want to start with revenue, you know you know, we, we expect to have you know, attractive non-mortgage growth next year. We're clearly going to have John talked about it, a grow over challenge in the first half of next year, meaning that the mortgage market will be down versus first quarter and second quarter of 2022 based on where current trends look. We don't have an outlook yet, but there was a strong mortgage market in the first quarter and it started declining in the second and more rapidly in the third. So, that's clearly going to be a part of our outlook going forward. You know, you also have our new product rollouts will be a positive for us. You know, that vitality index being above 10%, gives us momentum next year to drive the top line with those new solutions. And as I commented earlier, the new products we're rolling out this year, the 80 products we've rolled out so far, most of those aren't really in the revenue in a meaningful way in 2022. They really mature in 23 and in 2024. Last point I would make is that, we've made a number of acquisitions in the last 25 months or 20 months actually. And those acquisitions are obviously in our run rate revenue, but the synergies that we expect to get typically kick in years two and three, so meaning in 2022 and 2023. So meaning in 2023 we're going to get benefits from acquisition growth that we have going forward. John, maybe you add to that and maybe talk a little bit about some of the margin stuff?\nJohn Gamble: Absolutely. And so as Mark already really covered, right? So non-mortgage revenue growth, both from NPI but also from new product and also very importantly from pricing right, will absolutely benefit us as we go into next year. Generally speaking, I think most people know a lot of new products and mortgage and other verticals that we serve actually tend to get launched at year end and pricing actions tend to happen at year end. So we tend to get a nice benefit as you move from fourth quarter to first quarter every year, and it's done very consistently. We also expect to have, as Mark mentioned, improved cost position. As we move, move into next year, as we continue to migrate more and more of our major systems to the cloud, we start to be able to decommission more systems and we're starting to see savings as we move through 2023. That's certainly a benefit. Some of the marketing and sales incremental costs we talked about this quarter that would affect the next quarter are really driven by the fact that we're performing so very strongly this year, right? That we're paying compensation appropriately at very high levels into those organizations because they're substantially outperforming. Obviously, when you get into a new plan year, those things are all reset. So we think there's certainly cost opportunities that will help margin, but also for us with the fact that we're driving very strong non-mortgage growth with new product and pricing and obviously that flows through at extremely high margins is real benefit to us as we go into next year. So again, we're not providing guidance yet as we didn't in this call, but we have a lot of levers that can help strengthen 2023.\nMark Begor: Maybe the last one, maybe just a last one is that we commented that there's some unusuals or things that are going to work out in Workforce Solutions margins in the third and fourth quarter, from the mix of mortgage and some additional costs associated with our sales and marketing that we made the comment that we clearly expect Workforce to be back at 50% plus margins in 2023, which will be obviously a positive too.\nAshish Sabadra: Very helpful color. And maybe just a quick followup on EWS, the expectation for revenues to be down 3%, it's a significant moderation from 9% growth. Obviously mortgages ahead went there and maybe some of the acquisitions are anniversaring, but I was wondering if you could help parse what should -- how we should think about organic Verifier non-mortgage growth as we head into fourth quarter and next year? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Sure. So I think we talked about it. We talked about organic revenue growth for EWS, and we said it was about 20%. Negatively impacting that is almost 15 points from reductions in UC & ERC. So if you exclude UC & ERC we're seeing organic growth across Workforce Solutions of approaching 35%, which we think is very\u2026\nJohn Gamble: It's a very good number.\nMark Begor: Very strong in the third quarter, right? So\u2026\nJohn Gamble: Well above their 13% to 15% long-term growth rate.\nMark Begor: And so even, and as we look into next quarter when we compare the 20% that they delivered this quarter, we expect to have very strong performance again next quarter also in non-mortgage. So again, we think EWS non-mortgage revenue growth has been really outstanding and continues to grow.\nAshish Sabadra: Thank you. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, John. I just want to verify that we have some figures here, and just for these questions, if it's okay, let's put aside core, when I ask these mortgage questions. So I think we know mortgage as a percentage of total third quarter revenues, I think that's 22% the inverse of the 78% on the first quarter, just please verify that? And the second thing I want to make sure that we have non-mortgage organic revenue growth and I think that's 13%. I think that's what you gave on Slide 4. And if you could just make a comment about fourth quarter, what's implied in terms of non-mortgage organic revenue growth.\nJohn Gamble: Yes, so I believe both of the numbers you quoted were in the presentation, so yes, I think they're correct. And in terms of non-mortgage growth right, we are expecting non-mortgage growth to continue to be strong, right? Mark talked about the fact that for the full year, we're continuing to expect 20% and we're expecting a strong fourth quarter, not quite probably as strong as the third quarter, so slightly, so somewhat below the third quarter, but still a very strong number and we're expecting to see that the strength that you've been seeing all year continue.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay, thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line is Kyle Peterson with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your questions.\nKyle Peterson: Hey good morning guys. Just wanted to follow up on the margin a little bit, maybe if you guys could run us through some of the puts and takes in the 4Q step down is really most or all of that just mortgage and lower volumes kind of running through and the full quarters impact of that or there's no, like other cost inflation or anything that you guys are seeing material in your business?\nMark Begor: No cost, really inflationary impact. It's really the mix of the loss of that mortgage revenue is just such high margin. And then I think we also talked about some costs from sales and marketing and onboarding, some TWN contributors, but the majority of it is the margin mix from a mortgage.\nJohn Gamble: Absolutely. The step down in 4Q from 3Q is really driven by lower revenue in general because of, but it's driven by lower -- because mortgage is lower, and obviously mortgage has a very high variable margin. So that's the driver.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow up on international, obviously the constant currency trends have looked really good for you guys. I know FX is kind of a problem for you guys and a lot of companies, but a little surprising to us that, I guess with all the recessionary fears and such, are you guys seeing any slow down or caution especially in parts of Europe and such with your clients or has at least through October so far have those trends still held up and been pretty stable and healthy?\nMark Begor: Yes, as you know Europe for us is primarily UK but also Spain is where we participate. And while inflation is a challenge, they're still working, right? And so we really haven't seen any meaningful change in what's happening with our customers. Everyone is worried about inflation, but when you've got people working, they're generally going to pay their bills, they are also going to spend money and they operate. And as you saw from our comments, our UK business, which is most of Europe, had a very good quarter. I think it was up 7%. So no, we haven't seen it yet, even with all the inflation fears.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. It's helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Kelsey Zook [ph] with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, Mark. Hey John. For EWS for this quarter, when I look at non-mortgage Verifier revenue, it seems to be down a little bit sequentially. Can you just help us understand a little bit in terms of what's going on there? Is it the consumer lining keys? Is it talent or government or other verticals?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, so EWS non-mortgage in Verifier, but broadly right, was very strong, right? So again, the growth rates we're talking about are extremely high. We think government and talent continue to perform very, very well. What we -- if you're just looking at growth rates, obviously as you move through the year, comps get tougher because we grew very strongly in 2021. But overall, as we take a look at talent solutions, I think we grade the growth rates. Yes, they're slightly, they're slightly lower, but it also driven by comps, government very strong. I think we saw very good performance in kind of commercial in the non-mortgage finance segment, which again, was very strong. So we feel very good about the trajectory and the trend and continuing very strong non-mortgage growth rates there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And just a quick follow up on EWS margin with the current mortgage environment. I'm trying to figure out what's sort of like a new normal for EWS margins? Should we basically be thinking about that as in line with what we've seen this quarter or even Q4, so kind of in the 49% range?\nMark Begor: No, I said, we said in our comments, and hopefully you heard it, that we clearly expect margins at EWS to return to that 50% plus level in 2023. We view this mortgage mix as being a challenge in the third and fourth quarter. That will definitely impact their margins as well as some of the additional costs in sales and marketing and TWN contributor onboarding in the third and fourth quarter. I think we talked about 9 or is it 9 or 10 additions of new contributors, that 10 additions of new payroll processors that are adding records. There's generally some incremental costs, when those get added. And our non-mortgage growth is so high; we're having some additional sales and marketing costs in EWS. But to be clear we expect EWS margins over the long-term to be at that 50% plus rate versus where they are at this quarter and next quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi good morning. I appreciate all the detail and color as usual guys. John, just a question for you on overall consolidated EBITDA margin progress, I think you touched on some of the potential tailwinds next year, but given the challenges, especially early in the year with mortgage, and thinking about margins being flattish maybe up a little, and that's my number, not yours, and then a bit of an improvement in 2024, it just seems like a heavy lift to get to 39% by 2025. Is there a step function that we need to be thinking about? I'm just trying to understand that?\nMark Begor: John, you should jump in. But remember, a big piece of that path to 39 is the cloud transformation completion. And we get some meaningful impact on cost takeout, and we telegraph before and every quarter we talk about it that roughly half of that lift from our margins last year to the 39 is from cloud execution. And that's in our hands, so we know how to do it. It's not economic related. We're going to, whether the economy's up, down or sideways, we're going to complete the cloud and that plugs in. You've got Workforce Solutions growing faster than the rest of Equifax, at their 50% plus EBITDA margins, that equates in margin between now and 2025. You've also got our new product rollouts, our non-mortgage growth that we expect to deliver is also going to deliver margin expansion over that timeframe.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. But as we get to 2025 and the framework even we laid out last November, right? We indicated we expect the markets that we're in to be somewhat normal. So we were expecting kind of a normal non-mortgage market, and we're expecting the mortgage market itself to move back toward more normal levels, right? So a big part of in addition to the cost takeout related to tech transformation, which Mark already referenced, a big part of the mortgage increase is related to that revenue growth. And clearly we do need, in order to deliver those levels, we do need to see some recovery in the mortgage market and moving, having it move back toward more normal, and then obviously some normal non-mortgage markets. And given the fact that we're performing so well in non-mortgage growth, it gives us comfort that we have a path there to that $7 billion. But we do need to see some recovery in some of the markets we're serving, particularly mortgage.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. Now I get that. That's helpful, thank you. And then Mark, your comments in USIS about mortgage shopping being a tailwind, I appreciate that. I just wonder as rates really have blown out here in the 10 years yield is up again today, remarkably how long can that persist? Does there just come a point where rates and accordingly housing affordability reaches a level where you're just not going to see that kind of behavior? And is that something you're contemplating as you think about the ultimate 2023 guidance you offer us?\nMark Begor: It's not, it's just, our view is, and what we've seen and we continue to see it, is that at these higher rates consumers just spend more time shopping around and when they do that shopping USIS benefits from that credit poll that happens in the shopping process and we do not expect that to change. I think your question maybe is a little bit different around, at these high rates, are people going to still buy houses, and at these high rates are people still going to do some level of refis? Which there's some, it's obviously down a bunch, but it\u2019s more cash out refis to access, the multi-trillion dollars of untapped home equity in the U.S. And as the mortgage market doesn't disappear. It certainly declined further and more rapidly than, we've expected. As you know, we've been -- revised our mortgage guidance three times this year because we didn't, we couldn't forecast where the Fed was going to take these rates, and I don't think anybody can except higher from where they are now. We're actually getting better at forecasting out a couple of months, meaning inside the quarter. But as you get out, past a quarter looking out with what's happening with the volatility of where rates are going, it's more challenging. So we'll certainly take all of these factors in place when we put out our 2023 guide in February and you'll have a clearer view hopefully there on what the mortgage market is going to look like. But there's no question, the mortgage market is going to bottom at some point. And it doesn't go obviously to zero. There's going to be an area where people still move, and even at this interest rates and it's happened before in the U.S., people still buy homes. So and meaning they buy homes and get mortgages. So there's that level of floor, I think we're all struggling with where it is. And, we'll have a better view, in a few months of what that looks like for 2023. And as John talked earlier, first and second quarter we're going to have tougher comps against a very strong mortgage market in first quarter this year. But as we get to third and fourth, we'll start, comping more towards what should be a floor until we get past whatever economic event we're in here.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, obviously lot of uncertainty on mortgage, but with the inquiry guidance in Q1, is there any way to think about what percentage of revenue mortgage could be in the first quarter, and then any way to think about how you think that will progress over the course of 2023, just as a percentage of revenue more broadly?\nMark Begor: Yes, I think as Kevin, as we talked a few minutes ago with Andrew, we're in, that we're not doing any guidance on anything on 2023 right now. We're focused on the fourth quarter. And we'll certainly give that guidance as, when we get to likely our February fourth quarter earnings discussion.\nKevin McVeigh: Okay. And then Mark, you talked within EWS obviously kind of the relative outperformance is kind of record penetration system, the systems direct integration pricing. Is there any way to ring fence the contribution across each one of those? Like is it primarily the records growth that drives it, or just so we get a sense of across those five buckets, or is it kind of evenly distributed?\nMark Begor: Yes, I wouldn't say even, but they're all important. There's not one that's disproportionate. Look, record additions are very attractive and very unique for the Workforce Solutions business because it drives revenue day two, after you add the records and as you, 16% record growth in the quarter, and we've driven records up double-digit for the last number of years, that's a certainly a positive. We take prices up every year, so that's something we'll do in January with all the verticals in Workforce and across Equifax. New products, we talked about Workforce Solutions is indexing kind of north of our 14% in a quarter and our 13% guide for the year of new product introductions. That's very attractive for workforce and we've talked in prior meetings about continuing to drive system-to-system integrations, and penetration is a big opportunity in Workforce. If you think about the credit file, it's very highly penetrated in all financial services verticals. Workforce is not even in mortgage. There's still 40 odd percent of mortgages that we don't see that are still done with paper pay stubs. We only do roughly one in 10, roughly background screens. In government you've got a $2 billion TAM and we've got a $300 million roughly business there. So there's a lot of government penetration opportunity. So you can see each of them are attractive and very valuable, which is why we have a lot of confidence in Workforce Solutions 13% to 15% long-term growth rate.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Mark can you talk a little bit about the NPIs and whether there's been any kind of change strategically about how you approach that we're seeing is, much higher NPI like 14%, but we're seeing the numbers of new products, obviously much lower than we saw last year. Is there some kind of strategy that you have in terms of less shots on goal, but more higher percentage shots of goal? Or just, is that just very year-per-year and we really can't look that much into the numbers of NPI like we used to?\nMark Begor: No, numbers are important, obviously. I think just maybe spooling back to kind of two years ago when we really ramped up our new product resourcing. We brought in a cheap product to officer, we've got more of a cadence around it. We did that intentionally in advance of our single data fabric and in advance of our cloud capabilities because we were convinced that the cloud, which again, we still have to complete, we're well down the road and a single data fabric will allow us to bring things to market we couldn't do before. And use the example of the product we rolled out this week at the Mortgage Bankers Association of taking our telco utility cell phone data and embedding it in the credit file. That's a very sophisticated product. It's going to drive higher hit rates, higher approval rates, higher originations for our customers. And it's something that only Equifax can deliver. So that multi-data solution is a big part of our new product capabilities. The second area is really leaning more into our trended data, our historical data workforce solutions now gets what, 40% of revenue from historical records, almost 50 now. So you think about how they've changed that in the last couple of years through their new product capabilities. And think about a mortgage solution that shows historical income data on a consumer back a year, two years, three years, four years. That helps in the underwriting process. We sell that at a higher price point. Think about in the talent vertical, a history of job employment that's required. As, we have 500 million and I think 560 million total records now in the TWN database and that's, well over five and a half jobs on the average American, so that multi data as well as historical solution. I think the other thing that's quite encouraging, I mentioned in my comments earlier is that, workforce solutions that's further down in the, the road in the cloud is delivering well north of the 14% vitality. They're one of the big drivers of that guide up for the year on new products. And that's what we wanted to see. That's what we expected to see. And I think the good news is we're seeing it, meaning as we get further into the cloud, we're able to deliver those new solutions to our customers. And I think, as you know new products are also very high. Obviously they drive incremental revenue growth, but they're very high incremental margins. You're thinking 70%, 80% kind of incremental margins on new products. It's why we're driving the initiative, but it also makes us more valuable to our customers. We're bringing them solutions that helps them solve problems and either drive their top line, their bottom line or both in a very positive way. So it's a big focus of ours and, it's going to, it's one that's central to our long-term growth strategy. And you remember back in November in our Investor Day, we talked a bunch about that being one of the factors of increasing our long-term growth rate to the 8% to 12 was our expectation. And now you're seeing it of our ability to deliver that 10% Vitality in our long-term growth rate.\nJohn Gamble: And just to clarification, the almost 50% I quoted is a verifier revenue.\nMark Begor: Yes. From a historical\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Just to clarify then, I understand it's important. What I'm just trying to understand is the difference between the 14% and the amount of record of NPI that's coming in, that that's kind of the block -- I\u2019m used to get it.\nMark Begor: Sure. You use the term shots on goal, or do you want to have more shots that go in or more shots on goal and, we want both, right? So you have a bell curve with any new product portfolio you put in place, you're going to have, some products that are, screaming winners, that really hit the mark with our customers and some that are less successful. And then there's also maturity cycle to them, as I mentioned, we'll roll out products in the second half of this year that, won't deliver any revenue in 2022 but they'll start maturing in 2023, 2024, 2025 that's really what you have from a cycle standpoint. So to answer your specific question, we're looking to have more and obviously having more that deliver rajthat deliver larger revenue, and I think we're just getting better at that. Primarily because we're really being quite deliberate around collaborating with our customers. Instead of creating a product we think the market wants, we're creating a product that we know a customer wants because we're collaborating with them. And then once it works with one customer or two, then we productize it to take it out to the rest of our customer base.\nShlomo Rosenbaum:\nARDSO:\nJohn Gamble: No, so the conversion you're talking about, so part of, as part of transformation as you said removing financial systems to the cloud as well, and the major movement of financial systems, including billing systems, actually runs through October, right? Little bit in November. So some of the level of elevated DSOs we saw in the second quarter did continue into the third quarter. It's related to those transac to that system migration. And we expect to see substantial improvement as we move through the fourth quarter.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Huber: Yes. Hi, good morning. My first question, did your Appriss acquisition, can you maybe just tell us how the integration has been going here in the last year and I'd be curious what the pro forma organic year-over-year revenue growth was in the third quarter for the acquisition and what was it maybe for the 12-month period too? Do you have that?\nMark Begor: Yes, so the Appriss Insights acquisition, as is our incarceration data business. We're really pleased. We bought it really just a year ago, so it's 12 months in. And the integration's progressing very positively. We talked about, some of the joint solutions that we're already bringing to market, putting their data into our total verified data hub. And we've got new products, in the pipeline, both on enhancing their solutions with their data, but also combining their data with some of the other data that's used either in the talent or in the government verticals to deliver a single pole with either employment data plus the incarceration data or employment education and incarceration. So we've seen really positive opportunities there. And as far as growth rates, it was growing, kind of mid teams when we bought it, and it still is, we're very pleased with the growth of the business.\nCraig Huber: Okay, great. My other question is, you've talked on this call in prior ones at the health of the U.S. consumer being quite strong versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels. I'm curious, are you saying that you, with all the data you look at that it's not materially getting worse versus three and six months ago, the U.S. consumer?\nMark Begor: Absolutely not. No. There's still strong and there really hasn't been a change in 2022 about, around the consumer. As you know, employment has, unemployment has gone down and employment has gone up, you know, since the beginning of the year. So that's good for consumers. Wage growth is up, which is good for consumers, and that helps their balance sheet. Obviously, inflation's a bad guy, and it is hurting, lots of consumers. But even with inflation, consumers are still out there spending and traveling and doing all the things that they do in their lives. So the credit scores are up 15 points from 2019 that hasn't really changed. They're in good shape. You really have to watch employment and unemployment, that's where things generally change with a consumer. Obviously inflation is challenging particularly for, the kind of the lower income demographic, but the rest of the population is doing okay.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thanks. Good morning. In the international business, how much of the recent strength would you attribute to share gains versus end market strength at the country level? And to what extent would you say the cloud transformation is already paying dividends in terms of growth and Vitality Index there?\nMark Begor: Yes so this, I would add a couple things to the list. I wouldn't call it, obviously end market in 2022 is stronger than 2021 as they, the international markets came out of the pandemic earlier this year. But the end markets aren't -- like in Latin America the end markets are always strong just because the underlying growth there. But I wouldn't say there's been a change in the end markets. Our team is executing well. So there is some commercial strength there. New products are a big deal, as far as bringing new solutions, new products to market. For example, we're bringing our count identity and fraud solutions to a lot of our international markets, so we're starting to get some traction there, which is helping our international platforms. Cloud isn't really a benefit to them yet. They're further behind the North America intentionally in cloud, with the exception of Canada. So their cloud benefits are really going to be more in 2023 and actually more in 2024 as they complete the cloud. What would you add to international John?\nJohn Gamble: Just in debt management? I mean, they're growing very fast, right? I don't know if you would call that share or not, right? But what it is, we have certain large customers that we have very high positions with that are growing very fast, right? And principally the UK Government, so that's driving a nice piece of growth obviously in UK.\nAndrew Nicholas: That's helpful. Thank you. And then for my followup John, maybe a question for you, just a quick clean up item. Corporate expenses tick down pretty significantly on a sequential basis. Could you speak to the driver there and how sustainable kind of that, that new level is? It's obviously ticked down quite a bit here, a couple quarters in a row. Just want to make sure I understand the dynamics driving that. Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So if you're just doing sequential third versus second, right? The big drivers were corporate technology spend and also tech transformation spend. Some of that was just good cost management. Some of that is around tech transformation. And that can move between BUs in corporate and we saw some of that in the third quarter, as projects complete in corporate or teams move between Corp and the BUs, you can see expenses come down in corporate. We had a little bit of that in the third quarter. We also saw some good cost management and some sequential declines across corporate expenses in general. And we did see some lower expenses specifically related to compensation and variable compensation broadly because we took the year down. So I'd say those were the big drivers. I think we expect to be at lower levels of expense than last year substantially, right? And which you've seen all this year probably in the fourth quarter you're going to see some of those expenses tick back up again because we'd expect to see some more investment in technology and corporate technology. So some of the benefit we got in the third quarter we'll give back because we're spending up, we\u2019re spending more on transformation. So for example, Shlomo\u2019s question around financial system transformation, some of that's occurring in the fourth quarter. So hope that helps.\nAndrew Nicholas: It does. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Mark, any additional perspective you can provide on what you're hearing from customers on the pre-screen and marketing activities starting to pull back, just given the health of the consumer at this point and bank balance sheet health. So we just love to kind of like square those two points.\nMark Begor: Yes, as I said earlier, Jeff broadly the consumers unchanged from second quarter. And so our bank balance sheets are very strong. So there's no change there, so don't take, whatever you heard earlier is, some message around that. We're seeing big pullbacks. What I will tell you is every time I meet in the C-suite or with CROs we're all talking about, because we all watch CNBC, we all watch what's happening with inflation. We all see what's happening with interest rates of, when will it have an effect on consumers, and when will it have effect on ability to pay and delinquencies. And again, my view of someone who's been around financial services for, multi decades, it all starts with employment. And that's the indicator that we watch, I watch. And then after that is delinquencies. But we're seeing it still a strong job market. I think there's not quite two, but there is 1.7 jobs open for anyone who's out of a job now, something like that, so it's still very vibrant and, we don't see indications of what I would call pullback, but everyone's watching it. It's clearly a conversation in every meeting.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Appreciate the perspective. And then within TWN 16% records growth is great, as you said, way above the long term framework to drive a really good growth model. But growth accelerated year-over-year, the comp doesn't look tougher. Sequential growth seemed just okay, considering you're still onboarding partners and non-farm payrolls are growing. So any perspective on that figure and if you can confirm if there was any partner record attrition? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. There's some levels, it's very de-minimus of what I would call churn inside of the records, but they're obviously, they're generally growing when you're up 16%, so there's, it's not something that we see and there is, obviously a change, some changes in employment with some of our partners. As you go through the year, there's a seasonality as you might imagine, where there's hiring and some industries think about retail warehouse, related to the holiday season that we see in increased employment, which in results at increased records for us you know, call it in the second half of the year. And then a change in the first half of the year when some of that, comes some of that holiday hiring, comes out of the system. But broadly, we are seeing, obviously it's 16% strong record growth inside of the TWN set.\nJohn Gamble: I'd say it's generally true that we're seeing it's actually been a very good year, both in terms of signing new partners, but also direct contributors, right? So I think we, we feel like in terms of the execution of the team on building new contributors, it's really been an outstanding year.\nJeff Meuler: Yep, got it. Thank you.\nMark Begor: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Togut: Thank you and good morning. Just bridging to some of the earlier questions on revenue, but focusing specifically on EWS, if we take your fourth quarter 2022 revenue growth guide of down at least 3% and kind of think through your commentary on Q1 mortgage credit inquiries being down, 50% or so year-over-year, how should we think about the starting point for EWS revenue in 2023?\nMark Begor: Yes, again, we don't want to get into 2023 guidance. We gave you our fourth quarter guidance; it\u2019s too early to talk about 2023. And I think we talked about, obviously mortgage in for sure in the first half will be a challenge, because of the strong mortgage market in the first quarter last year. But we, in some of the previous questions, talked a bunch about, what are the positives if you will, having the non-mortgage total growth of 20 and organic growth of 13, that's momentum coming out of 2022 into 2023. That, is obviously going to be important to us. We talked about the fact we do pricing actions typically on 11 so that's going to be a positive, for us in 2023. The new products, we talked about the acquisition synergies and growth, going into 2023. What else would you add, John?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, we covered pretty good list in the earlier question. I think it's a pretty good list, right? So specific to EWS and specific to verifier, records growth was obviously outstanding so far this year.\nMark Begor: Well, 16% records growth carries through till.\nJohn Gamble: Absolutely.\nMark Begor: Next year and I think we talked about 10 new partners being signed up three in the quarter. Those won't go online in the fourth quarter. Those will be additions. That'll happen in 2023 that'll drive records. And of course we're out there, working to add more records that will help EWS.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Just as my follow up the 38% organic non-mortgage growth at Workforce Solutions and Q4 talent up 50% organic, government up 44% organic. How should we think about the runway for growth for both talent and government in 2023? Are these types of growth rates sustainable or have they peaked?\nMark Begor: Yes, we're not giving growth rate, outlook for 2023. That's not the intention of this meeting yet. But when you think about those two verticals, I talked about it earlier. You think about talent as a $5 billion Tam where we have a ton of penetration opportunity, right? because we're only doing one in 10 or two in 10 background screens. So that's a opportunity there. And then in the government, very similar government that's about a $2 billion TAM for that kind of verification of income and employment in some cases. And we've got $300 million business. So there's a lot of growth potential there. And add on top of it, kind of the core workforce solutions, growth levers outside of penetration, of adding more records is going to drive hit rates in both businesses. Whether it's for background screening or government social services, you add in our new products pricing changes that we're going to do early in the year system, system integrations drive revenue for us in both of those verticals. So those are the kind of growth levers the team's going to work on. And is in flight on as well as the momentum that we have coming out of the year, which is quite strong.\nJohn Gamble: Over the longer term we have a 13% to 15% long term growth rate. So obviously the growth rates we're delivering today in those specific verticals are well above that. So we would expect over time, we're going to have very good performance in those verticals, but growth rates over time, we would expect in general and non-mortgage, are going to converge more down toward our long term model.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line and Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. Just looking ahead, how should we be thinking about your ability to pass on price increases in EWS versus prior years if we do have an economic slowdown, like does that impact pricing? Do you temper, what you're trying to push through? And just maybe if you could ground us on how we should be thinking about like a normal pricing baseline for EWS for price increase?\nMark Begor: Yes, we don't see any real change in not only EWS, but across Equifax about what we're going to do in price in 2023. And like, it's already happening, so it's not going to, we're already in flight talking to customers about what our plans are around price for 2023, because most of the pricing goes into effect 11. Workforces, is a very unique solution that delivers, really unique value to our customers. So we have more pricing, power there or flexibility. But we're always balanced about, price, whether it's a, good or bad economic times. But I would say broadly, we don't think about pricing being different. If there's an economic event, and again, there's an economic event hasn't happened yet, the outside of the mortgage macro, the economy's quite good. Our non-mortgage business is very strong. Our customers are strong, the consumers are strong. So, we're kind of doing what we, I would characterize as kind of a normal process in January.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And then you've talked for some time now about getting the gig and pensioner records. Have you been having success in getting those and is there a different process for, getting gig records versus W2 records? Are they harder to get? Because it's more maybe fragmented outside of ride sharing just what, how is the update on the process and how your success is and how different it is? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, there's still a bunch of runway in W2, which you heard and we're penetrating that which is, most of our records today are W2. So that 16% growth is primarily in that set, and there's still, another 40 million, 50 million records to get there. And then if you go to gig, it is more dispersed and we've got a number of strategies underway to go after those records, which are equally valuable. And we've got some traction around pensioner records. As I mentioned, we've signed a big partner to bring some records in. We're also getting records directly from large kind of legacy companies that do their own pension or payroll processing or pension or payment processing. So we're working on all those avenues and we've got dedicated teams on them and we're, our expectation is to continue to add records from all three areas, as we move through the fourth quarter and into 2023 and beyond. And what's energizing for us is the opportunity to still double the data set, it 111 million uniques and call it 210 million or thereabouts total employed or pension payment recipients in the United States. We got a long runway to add new records to the TWN data set. And again I mentioned this a couple times, I know it's not lost on you Toni, that we're already getting inquiries on those, right? So we get inquiries on the half of the records we don't have. So it's just a matter of adding them to drive our revenue growth.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please proceed with your questions.\nSimon Clinch: Hi. I just wonder if I could just go back to the verification services revenue and something I've been sort of tracking has been some non-mortgage revenues on a sort of per average record basis. And since the pandemic that's just been moving up steadily pretty much every quarter since, and it's ticked down for the first time. And I was wondering, is there anything in particular about, in terms of that kind of structural opportunity or a revenue per record basis going forward, if we, you, should it be capped out at any particular time or is there anything we should read into that?\nMark Begor: Yes, no we've been growing revenue per record quite meaningfully again the way you should think about it and the way it's, the way we think about it is, as we get into new verticals, like talent and government, or even as I would characterize, cards and as a newer vertical autos under penetrated, all of those verticals as we add those new revenue sources, the records become more valuable, right? Because we're, monetizing that same record multiple times when someone applies for a mortgage and then a credit card and then an auto loan or a P loan, and then they apply for a new job, or then they have to get government social services. You've got multiple avenues to monetize that record. So it's part of the power of the business.\nJohn Gamble: The only thing I'd add, right, and the Simon right, is that the obviously the different verticals we have very different price points and very different product structures. So you can see mix changes in any give given period when you're taking a look at transactions and records and revenue. But, so just make sure you keep that in mind as you're running your analytics.\nSimon Clinch: I understood. Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow up we talked a lot about how the mortgage revenues declines are really impacting margins, very high incremental margin. I just wanted to just confirm again that should mortgages ever rebound, should we just assume that it carries that kind of 80% incremental margin on the way up as well? Is there any reason not to assume that? And then longer term is there any reason why the non-mortgage revenues shouldn't carry the same kind of incremental margins as the mortgage business does today?\nMark Begor: So are you specifically talking about verifier?\nSimon Clinch: Yes. Sorry in verifier.\nMark Begor: Okay. Yes, so variable margins with the contribution margins for mortgage obviously yes going in, coming out should be very similar. Whether or not we reinvest some of the incremental profit generated would be a different discussion, right? But they certainly should be similar in terms of the contribution margin of both. Generally speaking, the margins across Verifier are similar. They can be somewhat different depending on the relative price point and the volumes relative to the price point. So you can see some higher cost for different kind of to your earlier question. But broadly speaking yes, the margins for the products across verification services are relatively similar.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. It's just a question of reinvestment at 5G. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next questions come from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nSeth Weber: Hi, good morning guys. Just I just wanted to ask about this sequential improvement in USIS EBITDA margin that you guys are forecasting for the fourth quarter. It looks like revenue is a kind of flattish sequentially. Is that just some of the sales and marketing expenses are going out or it doesn't seem like mix is really changing a lot, so just if there's any color on the 200 basis points of uptick 3Q to 4Q?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, so sequentially generally we see a little bit of an uptick. Certainly, we definitely see an uptick in non-mortgage revenue generally in USIS from the fourth quarter. So we'd expect to see some of that and it tends to draw very high variable margins, so and given that we expect to see a little more leverage on some of the OpEx. That's all.\nSeth Weber: Okay. I mean, I'm just trying to understand, over the last prior to the second quarter, the business was sort of high 30% margin. So I'm just trying to think through if there was any reason why you wouldn't get back to that level, relatively quickly next year. It sounds like you're moving back in that direction?\nMark Begor: Relatively quickly, yes obviously the mortgage market decline is weighed on that.\nJohn Gamble: Very heavily. Right. So obviously as we get into 2023, we'll give you a better view as to what we expect 2023 USIS margins to do.\nSeth Weber: Right. Okay and then just quick clarification, you guys talked about a couple times, you referenced M&A synergies expected over the next couple years. Is that revenue synergies or expense synergies or both, or just how should we think about that?\nMark Begor: Both yes when we do these bolt-on acquisitions, part of our strategy is to bring in, unique data assets that we can combine with other Equifax data assets in order to drive, new solutions to market. And that generally takes time. We got to integrate the business, integrate their data set into our single data fabric, and that usually takes call a year and change. And then we can start bringing those to market and then those drive the top line and the bottom line.\nSeth Weber: Got it. Okay, thank you guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just, I wanted to talk about EWS margins again, and I'm curious, when you first gave the margins earlier this year, I think you talked about 54%. And just want to understand, is the deceleration from that to where we are today entirely mortgage related, or is there anything else in the underlying business that's \u2013 that has impacted that change?\nMark Begor: Yes, the biggest driver and margin degradation by far is the impact on revenue and the very high variable margins we get for mortgage. So that's the biggest driver, right. We have talked about some increased expenses. We talked about some marketing investments and things we're making this year to drive NPI, which have been very successful. But generally overall the biggest driver in the movement is, has been related to the reduction in revenue related to mortgage.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Got it. And then just as we think about those margins, I appreciate, I know you're not providing 2023 guidance, but I appreciate you giving us a EWS margin outlook of about 50%. I'm curious if you can give us just not numbers, but just holistic thoughts around how we should think about the, I guess the quarterly cadence. I mean, I'm thinking we should build through the course of the year. Is there anything you can say about 1Q margin, which is given that you did provide an outlook for mortgage inquiries for the first quarter?\nMark Begor: Yes. We're not ready to talk about 2023 guidance. We did want to make, clear that first quarter's going to have a tough comparison given the fourth quarter exit and the strength in the first quarter last year. And then at EWS you said about 50%, we actually said over 50%, just to be accurate. But yes, we'll be ready to give 2023 guidance, when we get into 2023.\nFaiza Alwy: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that non-mortgage growth in 4Q will be strong, but not as strong as 3Q. Can you discuss data points that you're seeing in the bank card and auto lending sectors that suggest an incremental moderation in strength in those categories?\nMark Begor: I don't know if you were listening, George, but we got that question from, earlier that we're not seeing any change the non-mortgage growth rates that we're talking about are very, very high. And we expect them to, still be very strong in the fourth quarter.\nJohn Gamble: And look, and we did give a view of international in the fourth quarter, international was outstanding in the third quarter, still going to be very strong in the fourth quarter, but its growth rate is somewhat lower and obviously international their revenue is virtually all non-mortgage.\nGeorge Tong: Okay, Got it. As you look at the mortgage category certainly there was a significant amount of refinancing activity that was pulled forward into 2020 and 2021. To what extent does this pull forward structurally lower the medium term mortgage revenue growth outlook for Equifax?\nJohn Gamble: Obviously we're seeing the impacts of that right now, since refinances has dried up predominantly, Right. So what's left is just cash out refis, and we're actually now starting to see substantial growth in HELOC\u2019s, right, replacing even some of the cash out refis. So I think we're living through the, obviously the impact of that dramatic reduction in refinance right now. We gave a view of first quarter mortgage, but again in terms of giving a view as we go forward, which is kind of for us, 2023 would be midterm. It's just a little bit earlier, unfortunately you're just going to have to wait until we get into the first quarter and be for us to give our 2023 guidance.\nGeorge Tong: Yes, well it really wasn't a 2023 question. More like a medium term, longer term questions since you've in the past, given longer term guidance targets before.\nMark Begor: I don't know what you mean by medium term, longer term, do we expect the mortgage market over the long term to return to a more normal level? Absolutely. No question about it. Is that what you mean?\nGeorge Tong: Well, medium term, so I guess over the next two to three years or two to four years\nMark Begor: What's going to happen with the economy in the first year or two of that cycle? And then at the tail end that you said two to four, you get out to four years, it would, my expectation is you'd get back to a more normal level. But I don't know what's going to happen with the economy. I don't think you do either, George.\nGeorge Tong: Got it, okay. Helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just clarify well, I want two questions. One, I wanted to clarify the benefit you see next year from the cloud transformation. You said half the 500 basis points, so is that a gross or net 250 basis point benefit flowing through? And also, does that include sort of rolling off some of the, the additional costs? Is that just savings or is that also rolling off the costs from the implementation? And then the other question totally separate, but just on the talent solution side, you talked about sort of the white space there, just sort of what can get you further penetrated in the background check industry? Thanks.\nJohn Gamble: So on transformation that would, the savings are related to all costs related to transformation, both the lower COGS as well as the lower investment levels. And then also they're going to be more backend loaded than front end loaded, right? Because the, you get the savings as all customers migrate, and you can actually decommission systems. So we'll start getting savings in 2023, as we said, and we feel good that's just going to happen. But the bigger savings happen is you get into 2024 and 2025. So you should think about that type of a cadence. What was your second question again, Heather? Sorry.\nHeather Balsky: Just on the cloud transformation the 250 basis points, is that the flow through this year or into next year?\nMark Begor: No, I think, as John said and we've said consistently, not only in this call and prior calls, the 250 is really between 2022 and 2025, and it's that path, the 39% EBITDA margins in 2025. That's our goal. That happens over 2023, 2024 and 2025, that's not a 2023 change.\nJohn Gamble: And I think, and more of that would be backend loaded, as I just said, right? Because it happens as systems actually decommission. So we'll see some in 2023 yes, but you're just going to see more of it in 2024 and 2025.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nSurinder Thind: Good morning. I'd like to start a question regarding your long term framework. Can you maybe talk about, is that intended to be like a rolling three year measurement period or like a five year period? And then maybe when we think about something like EWS non-mortgage, which continues to grow well above that framework, how often do you revisit the framework such as that and maybe some of the factors that underpin it? Like for example, at some point, whether its three years, five years out the W2 records within the TWN database will mature. So how do we think about some of those longer term drivers of the business?\nMark Begor: Yes, I think we put this in place a year ago and I believe that was the first change in Equifax's long term framework in like five or six years at least or maybe longer. The old framework was 7 to 10. We moved to 8 to 12, 100 basis points on the low end and 200 on the high end. It was intended to be a long term framework, and we could all talk about long term, but let's say five years plus, meaning we expect the company to grow, in that range, short of economic events. Those are, something you can't put in a long-term framework. But 8% to 12% growth for workforce in particular inside of the 8 to 12, and we talked about this already this morning. We have an expectation of them growing 13 to 15. That's their long term framework inside of our eight to 12, meaning they're going to be highly accretive and grow faster than the rest of Equifax. That's something that we expect as you point out, they've been outgrowing that 13 to 15, which sits inside of our eight to 12, which is good news in our eyes. That gives us confidence in the 13 to 15 over the long term. And of course, the 13 to 15 is made up of record editions. It's made up of new product rollouts. It's made up of penetration. And they've got uniquely a lot of penetration opportunities in all of their verticals because, our income and employment data is still a fairly new data asset. In the scheme of data assets, the credit file's been around for 70 years. Income and employment data has been around in a digitized way only for 15. So we've got a lot of confidence, in the 13 to 15 for workforce because of all of their growth levers, but also because they've been outgrowing that 13 to 15 for the last three or four years. And your question, I think you also asked the question about when will we revisit this? It's just, it's actually not even 12 months old. Our Investor Day was, I think on November 7th last year, so we're very confident and comfortable with what it is today after almost 12 months. And, at the right time if things change, we would look at it again. But we see no reason to change it and we still have a lot of confidence in it.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow on, when we think about the contribution of new products to revenues as measured by the vitality index, so is that intended to be all growth on top of the existing revenue base, or is there some cannibalization of revenues that we need to consider or the, maybe the play between the two? How should we think about the actual measurement of that and what it means from a modeling perspective?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think in the, in our long term framework John, we talked about new products in November last year, adding one to two points.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. You said vitality 10% so that\u2019s three year, right?\nMark Begor: And that translated into, that was one of the drivers of us bringing up our long term growth rate from seven to 10 to eight to 12 was the increased new product rollouts, is going to be a factor of that change in our long-term growth rate and then add to it workforce solutions growing faster than the rest of Equifax at, approaching 50% of Equifax that's accretive to that growth rate if they're growing 13 to 15. And then the average for our long term is eight to 12. That's accretive. And then we believe the cloud completion and cloud competitiveness also is a factor in that change from seven to 10 to eight to 12. I don\u2019t know if that's helpful.\nJohn Gamble: And our vitality index is supposed to represent truly new products, right? I mean, certainly even new products can cannibalize an existing product, but they're not supposed to be tweaks, right? We don't tweak a product and call it a new product. It needs to be a product that's substantially different or substantially new to Equifax.\nSurinder Thind: So this would be clients generally buying these on top of whatever existing products they're buying.\nMark Begor: Yes, there's clearly that it'll replace, some products, but they're generally, as John pointed out unique additions, and use the example I shared this morning of, the mortgage credit file that we've been delivering to the marketplace for 70 years in some fashion. We rolled out a new solution that's going to be our file plus this telco utility, cell phone data that's going to differentiate our mortgage credit file. That's a new product. Some customers will only buy the new product. Some will continue to buy just the credit file. That's really, so there is there some cannibalization could be, but there's also should be, we expect share gain, meaning our credit files more valuable than our competitor's credit file because the addition of that unique data to it.\nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Trevor Burns for any closing comments.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks everybody for your time today. If you have any follow-up questions feel free to reach out. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We appreciate your participations. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on Slide 14, our guidance reflects and expectations the decline in the U.S. mortgage market will steepen in the fourth quarter with mortgage originations declining over 60% and mortgage credit inquiries declining over 50%. This is a significant reduction from our expectations in July and as Mark referenced earlier, this expectation of a further weakening of the mortgage market negatively impacts 4Q revenue by almost $45 million. 3Q mortgage revenue was 21.9% of total Equifax revenues compared to 29.5% and 24.7% in 1Q 2022, and 2Q 2022 respectively. In 4Q, we expect mortgage revenue to be about 16% of total Equifax revenues. The rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impacts on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business. EBITDA margins at 32.5% were slightly below the level of at or below 33% we discussed in our July guidance. Mark discussed the drivers in HBU [ph]. Partially offsetting these items were lower corporate and corporate technology expenses. Slide 15 provides our guidance 4Q 2022. We expect revenue in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.185 billion reflecting revenue down about 6.3% year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance or down about 3.7% on a constant currency basis. 4Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 31.5%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 4Q 2022 to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share compared to 4Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.84 per share. As Mark shared earlier, the decline in our 4Q 2022 guidance is as compared to implied levels we shared in July, is driven by the significant reduction in our expectations for the U.S. mortgage market in the fourth quarter. 4Q 2022 revenue and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $25 million. Mark covered this earlier as the $45 million decline from the weakening U.S. mortgage market and $15 million decline driven by FX or partially offset by revenue from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator and stronger non-mortgage revenue growth. 4Q 2022 adjusted EPS and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $0.21 per share or about $33 million in pre-tax income. This decline is driven by the impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market on revenue of $45 million, which given high variable margins drives a pre-tax income decline that exceeds the total variance level. Strong core revenue growth, both from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator as well as stronger organic growth are delivering improvements in pre-tax income. However, these improvements are being offset, by the higher marketing sales and G&A expense that we referenced earlier and higher interest in other expenses. Reflecting the above, our expectations for the BUs [ph] in the fourth quarter as follows. EWS revenue is expected to have an about 3% or greater decline. Continued strong non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to offset the bulk of the impact on EWS mortgage revenue of the expected over 60% decline in mortgage originations. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 48.5% in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to have an about 7.5% or greater decline reflecting the greater than 50% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage credit inquiries. B2B non-mortgage revenue growth is expected to improve from the levels we saw in the third quarter and B2B online continuing with high single digit growth. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 36%. International continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of up to 8.5% down from the third quarter as we lap growth from our UK debt management business. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up sequentially approaching 29%. The declines in both revenue and adjusted EPS and in 4Q 2022 year-to-year are also principally driven by the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market and the significant impact of FX. Looking at revenue at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.175 billion, revenue is down about $78 million. FX is negative about $35 million or 2.6% year-to-year. So on a constant currency basis, revenue is down about $43 million. The impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market using originations declines for EWS and credit inquiries declines for USIS is negative about $185 million or almost 15 points. Excluding these factors effectively, constant dollar revenue growth excluding the impact of the U.S. mortgage market revenues up over $140 million, reflecting predominantly the very strong non-mortgage growth principally in EWS and international and also in the U.S. B2B online, and strong outperformance in mortgage relative to the overall market predominantly in EWS. Looking at adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.50 adjusted EPS is down about $0.34 a share below operating income items, principally higher interest expense and the loss of equity income from our Russia JV, as well as the impact of FX explained just over half of the decline in adjusted EPS. The remainder of the decline is principally driven by the reduction in constant currency revenue of about $43 million. Slide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. We expect revenue of approximately $5.1 billion and adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.49 to $7.59 per share. For the full year of 2022 we expect capital expenditures to be over $550 million. Capital expenditures are above the levels we expected in July as we maintained capital spending at first half 20 22 levels in the third quarter to continue the pace of migration of major exchanges to our cloud infrastructure. We expect to bring down capital spending in 2023 consistent with the completion of the migration of the major North American exchanges. We believe both our fourth quarter and full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provide. As you consider the first quarter of 2023 we wanted to provide some general perspective on our current thinking on the U.S. mortgage market for the quarter. Using our current view of mortgage credit inquiries in the fourth quarter as a base, we currently expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 50% year-to-year in the first quarter of 2023. As we move through 2023, the year-to-year compares get substantially easier, particularly in the second half. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. If you just look at non-mortgage online organic growth rates in the third quarter, right? We saw telco was up double-digit, fi, insurance and auto were up mid-to-high single digits. So which is ______. Yes, I think Manav a couple of points on that. You know, we're increasingly looking beyond non-farm payroll as you know. Adding in the gig economy as well as the pensioners, and when we think about our 146 million records and 111 million uniques or individuals in our data set, you know, there's about 200 plus million, 210 million, 220 million total working Americans and pensioners. So there's a long runway for us between w-2. Traditional employees, self-employed and remember self-employed we think about gig workers of being Uber drivers, DoorDash, et cetera. But think about self-employed doctors, self-employed lawyers, self-employed accountants self-employed contractors, it's a large population and then that pension base is quite large. And we mentioned in comments earlier that we've been starting to add pension records and gig records, and we signed an agreement with a company that does pension payroll, if you will, for various companies where we're going to do the income and employment verification for them. So, you know, we have the ability to double our data set, you know, over a lot of years going forward. And I think, as you know, we've talked to you before that, we've got a 13% to 15% long-term growth rate for Workforce Solutions that sits inside of Equifax's 8% to 12% growth rate. And we've got 3 to 4 points of that from record growth in the 13% to 15%. So, there's no question we've had above expectation record growth over the last, it's not new, it wasn't last quarter. You know, it's really been for three or four years. A lot of that has been from many of the payroll processors that you go back three or four years ago, we're not contributing our records and now they are. And as well as continued growth from our core records, which are from individual companies. So with regards to the competitive position we have, we feel very good about it. You know, the agreements that we've signed or on an exclusive basis since in 2022 and since I've been here, it's the right relationship between our partners and Equifax. They want it and we want it. And you know, when we think about half of our records coming from individual companies, those are from long-term relationships where we're providing those broad suite of services. Whether it's I-9, W2 management, unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit, HCA benefits, all those solutions, to companies. We also do income and employment verification for them as a part of that relationship for free. So that's a very sticky relationship from our perspective. And you probably heard in my comments earlier that Workforce Solutions is really doing a much better job going to market with the full suite of employer solutions we have and we signed a contract with a large multinational, that's going to -- once it's implemented, it will be $20 million a year of Equifax revenue where we're providing all those employer solutions services to that multinational. Of course, we're also doing their income and employment verification. So we're quite energized about our progress of adding new records to the data set. I think as you point out, it's certainly been above the long-term framework. And broadly it's been quite positive for us. And maybe a last point that you're well aware of, as you know, the day we add the records, we're already able to monetize them because we're getting inquiries from our customers either through system-to-system integrations or through their access to our website for all of their applicants. So the day we add another record, it's monetized either in a mortgage application, a credit card application, a personal loan, an auto loan in a background screen or in a government social services. So we've got various verticals that are looking for more records. And we already have them in our order book. We just can't fulfill them until we grow the data set. So it's a very powerful growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Absolutely. And so as Mark already really covered, right? So non-mortgage revenue growth, both from NPI but also from new product and also very importantly from pricing right, will absolutely benefit us as we go into next year. Generally speaking, I think most people know a lot of new products and mortgage and other verticals that we serve actually tend to get launched at year end and pricing actions tend to happen at year end. So we tend to get a nice benefit as you move from fourth quarter to first quarter every year, and it's done very consistently. We also expect to have, as Mark mentioned, improved cost position. As we move, move into next year, as we continue to migrate more and more of our major systems to the cloud, we start to be able to decommission more systems and we're starting to see savings as we move through 2023. That's certainly a benefit. Some of the marketing and sales incremental costs we talked about this quarter that would affect the next quarter are really driven by the fact that we're performing so very strongly this year, right? That we're paying compensation appropriately at very high levels into those organizations because they're substantially outperforming. Obviously, when you get into a new plan year, those things are all reset. So we think there's certainly cost opportunities that will help margin, but also for us with the fact that we're driving very strong non-mortgage growth with new product and pricing and obviously that flows through at extremely high margins is real benefit to us as we go into next year. So again, we're not providing guidance yet as we didn't in this call, but we have a lot of levers that can help strengthen 2023. It's a very good number. Well above their 13% to 15% long-term growth rate. Yes, so I believe both of the numbers you quoted were in the presentation, so yes, I think they're correct. And in terms of non-mortgage growth right, we are expecting non-mortgage growth to continue to be strong, right? Mark talked about the fact that for the full year, we're continuing to expect 20% and we're expecting a strong fourth quarter, not quite probably as strong as the third quarter, so slightly, so somewhat below the third quarter, but still a very strong number and we're expecting to see that the strength that you've been seeing all year continue. Absolutely. The step down in 4Q from 3Q is really driven by lower revenue in general because of, but it's driven by lower -- because mortgage is lower, and obviously mortgage has a very high variable margin. So that's the driver. Yes, so EWS non-mortgage in Verifier, but broadly right, was very strong, right? So again, the growth rates we're talking about are extremely high. We think government and talent continue to perform very, very well. What we -- if you're just looking at growth rates, obviously as you move through the year, comps get tougher because we grew very strongly in 2021. But overall, as we take a look at talent solutions, I think we grade the growth rates. Yes, they're slightly, they're slightly lower, but it also driven by comps, government very strong. I think we saw very good performance in kind of commercial in the non-mortgage finance segment, which again, was very strong. So we feel very good about the trajectory and the trend and continuing very strong non-mortgage growth rates there. Yes. But as we get to 2025 and the framework even we laid out last November, right? We indicated we expect the markets that we're in to be somewhat normal. So we were expecting kind of a normal non-mortgage market, and we're expecting the mortgage market itself to move back toward more normal levels, right? So a big part of in addition to the cost takeout related to tech transformation, which Mark already referenced, a big part of the mortgage increase is related to that revenue growth. And clearly we do need, in order to deliver those levels, we do need to see some recovery in the mortgage market and moving, having it move back toward more normal, and then obviously some normal non-mortgage markets. And given the fact that we're performing so well in non-mortgage growth, it gives us comfort that we have a path there to that $7 billion. But we do need to see some recovery in some of the markets we're serving, particularly mortgage. And just to clarification, the almost 50% I quoted is a verifier revenue. No, so the conversion you're talking about, so part of, as part of transformation as you said removing financial systems to the cloud as well, and the major movement of financial systems, including billing systems, actually runs through October, right? Little bit in November. So some of the level of elevated DSOs we saw in the second quarter did continue into the third quarter. It's related to those transac to that system migration. And we expect to see substantial improvement as we move through the fourth quarter. Just in debt management? I mean, they're growing very fast, right? I don't know if you would call that share or not, right? But what it is, we have certain large customers that we have very high positions with that are growing very fast, right? And principally the UK Government, so that's driving a nice piece of growth obviously in UK. Yes. So if you're just doing sequential third versus second, right? The big drivers were corporate technology spend and also tech transformation spend. Some of that was just good cost management. Some of that is around tech transformation. And that can move between BUs in corporate and we saw some of that in the third quarter, as projects complete in corporate or teams move between Corp and the BUs, you can see expenses come down in corporate. We had a little bit of that in the third quarter. We also saw some good cost management and some sequential declines across corporate expenses in general. And we did see some lower expenses specifically related to compensation and variable compensation broadly because we took the year down. So I'd say those were the big drivers. I think we expect to be at lower levels of expense than last year substantially, right? And which you've seen all this year probably in the fourth quarter you're going to see some of those expenses tick back up again because we'd expect to see some more investment in technology and corporate technology. So some of the benefit we got in the third quarter we'll give back because we're spending up, we're spending more on transformation. So for example, Shlomo's question around financial system transformation, some of that's occurring in the fourth quarter. So hope that helps. I'd say it's generally true that we're seeing it's actually been a very good year, both in terms of signing new partners, but also direct contributors, right? So I think we, we feel like in terms of the execution of the team on building new contributors, it's really been an outstanding year. Yes, we covered pretty good list in the earlier question. I think it's a pretty good list, right? So specific to EWS and specific to verifier, records growth was obviously outstanding so far this year. Absolutely. Over the longer term we have a 13% to 15% long term growth rate. So obviously the growth rates we're delivering today in those specific verticals are well above that. So we would expect over time, we're going to have very good performance in those verticals, but growth rates over time, we would expect in general and non-mortgage, are going to converge more down toward our long term model. The only thing I'd add, right, and the Simon right, is that the obviously the different verticals we have very different price points and very different product structures. So you can see mix changes in any give given period when you're taking a look at transactions and records and revenue. But, so just make sure you keep that in mind as you're running your analytics. Yes, so sequentially generally we see a little bit of an uptick. Certainly, we definitely see an uptick in non-mortgage revenue generally in USIS from the fourth quarter. So we'd expect to see some of that and it tends to draw very high variable margins, so and given that we expect to see a little more leverage on some of the OpEx. That's all. Very heavily. Right. So obviously as we get into 2023, we'll give you a better view as to what we expect 2023 USIS margins to do. And look, and we did give a view of international in the fourth quarter, international was outstanding in the third quarter, still going to be very strong in the fourth quarter, but its growth rate is somewhat lower and obviously international their revenue is virtually all non-mortgage. Obviously we're seeing the impacts of that right now, since refinances has dried up predominantly, Right. So what's left is just cash out refis, and we're actually now starting to see substantial growth in HELOC's, right, replacing even some of the cash out refis. So I think we're living through the, obviously the impact of that dramatic reduction in refinance right now. We gave a view of first quarter mortgage, but again in terms of giving a view as we go forward, which is kind of for us, 2023 would be midterm. It's just a little bit earlier, unfortunately you're just going to have to wait until we get into the first quarter and be for us to give our 2023 guidance. So on transformation that would, the savings are related to all costs related to transformation, both the lower COGS as well as the lower investment levels. And then also they're going to be more backend loaded than front end loaded, right? Because the, you get the savings as all customers migrate, and you can actually decommission systems. So we'll start getting savings in 2023, as we said, and we feel good that's just going to happen. But the bigger savings happen is you get into 2024 and 2025. So you should think about that type of a cadence. What was your second question again, Heather? Sorry. And I think, and more of that would be backend loaded, as I just said, right? Because it happens as systems actually decommission. So we'll see some in 2023 yes, but you're just going to see more of it in 2024 and 2025. Yes. You said vitality 10% so that's three year, right? And our vitality index is supposed to represent truly new products, right? I mean, certainly even new products can cannibalize an existing product, but they're not supposed to be tweaks, right? We don't tweak a product and call it a new product. It needs to be a product that's substantially different or substantially new to Equifax."

            "content": "Thanks, Trevor. Equifax delivered another solid quarter with continued execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities in a challenging economic environment. Third quarter revenue of $1.244 billion was up 2% or 4% in constant currency and was above the high end of our guidance driven by strong non-mortgage revenue growth in the quarter. This strong revenue performance was well above our July framework and delivered despite a more negative FX environment than we expected, which at 200 basis points or $29 million was a $5 million or about 50 basis point greater headwind for FX than we expected when we put out July guidance. Adjusted EPS of $1.73 per share was also stronger than our July guidance. We are continuing to significantly outperform our underlying markets as we navigate the challenging economic environment and mortgage market decline. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which now represent over 78% of total Equifax revenue, were very strong with 20% total and 13% organic non-mortgage, constant currency dollar revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in July and stronger than our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We're now tracking to 20% non-mortgage constant dollar growth in 2022, which is up about a 100 basis points from our July guidance. The outperformance was again led by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions that delivered 40% total and 20% organic non-mortgage revenue growth. USIS B2B non-mortgage grew 9% online and 5% total, which was about consistent with second quarter, but weaker than we expected. International delivered a record quarter up a very strong 17% constant dollar growth and 15% organic constant dollar growth well above our expectations. Equifax total mortgage revenue is down 30% about as expected and outperformed the underlying market decline by over 10 points from pricing, new TWN records, penetrations, system-to-system integrations and new products. The U.S. mortgage market as expected weakened substantially in the third quarter with originations estimated at down 50% in the quarter, which was about 9 points weaker than our July guidance. As a reminder, Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue is more closely tied to originations. USIS mortgage credit inquiries were down 41% in the quarter and better than our expectations from increased shopping activity despite the weaker than expected mortgage originations. We're continuing to see higher than normal levels of shopping, which continued throughout the quarter and tends to benefit USIS credit file pool. Combined, the negative mortgage market impact on Equifax was about as expected as the more negative market impact from originations on EWS was offset by the less negative impact on USIS from increased shopping activity. We saw continued weakening of the mortgage market as we moved through September into the first few weeks of October as mortgage rates continued to rise to their highest level since 2008. We now expect mortgage originations to decline over 60% in the fourth quarter versus our July framework of 48% and USIS credit inquiries to decline over 50% versus our July guidance of 46%. John will talk about our updated mortgage framework in a minute. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $405 million and was flat compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.5% were slightly below our expectations for the quarter, principally due to higher sales and marketing expenses driven by our outperformance in non-mortgage verticals. John will walk you through our margin performance in the third quarter and expectations for fourth quarter later in the presentation. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 70% of North America and 60% of total EFX revenue being delivered from the new EFX Cloud. Our focus for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 is accelerating full customer migrations in North America to enable decommissioning of our applications in data centers. Our new EFX Cloud infrastructure is delivering always on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and single data fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX Cloud infrastructure and single data fabric and are seeing acceleration of innovation in new product rollouts. Our new product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and over 500 basis points improvement from our 9% Vitality Index last year and well above our 10% long-term goal for Vitality. As a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of revenue derived from new products launched in the past three years. Our strong momentum on NPI rollouts leveraging the new EFX Cloud allowed us to raise our full year Vitality Index outlook for 2022 for the second time this year from 11% to 13%, which is up 300 basis points from our long-term framework and from the framework we started earlier this year. This strong NPI performance gives us momentum into 2023 as most new products reach commercial maturity in years two and three. In third quarter, we continue to execute our bolt-on acquisition strategy completing two acquisitions, LawLogix, which will further strengthen Workforce Solutions Onboarding and I-9 Solutions and Midigator, which will strengthen Kount and broaden our identity in fraud franchise. These are our 11th and 12th bolt-on acquisitions since January, 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen Workforce Solutions, our largest and fastest growing business, add unique and differentiated data and expand into fast growing identity and fraud market. Bolt-on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are strong levers for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add a 100 to 200 basis points annually to our revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A. Our guidance for 2022 revenue of just under $5.1 billion is essentially unchanged from the framework we provided in July. Third quarter revenue was stronger than our July guidance by about $25 million. Our current guidance reflects a decline in fourth quarter from our prior implied view by about $25 million from the weaker mortgage market and FX. The continued weakening in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting fourth quarter revenue by about $45 million and negative FX is impacting revenue in the fourth quarter by about $15 million. Partially offsetting this $60 million negative impact is stronger non-mortgage revenue and Workforce Solutions in international and the acquired revenue from LawLogix and Midigator. The strong 20% constant dollar non-mortgage growth in 2022 gives us great momentum as we look to 2023 and a bottoming of the mortgage market in the coming quarters. Our guidance for adjusted EPS of $7.54 a share is down about $0.13 from the midpoint of our July guidance. As our third quarter adjusted EPS was about $0.8 per share stronger than our July guidance, this results in a reduction in the fourth quarter from our implied EPS of about $0.21 a share or about $33 million in pre-tax income. The most significant drivers of this reduction in EPS are first the $45 million reduction in higher margin fourth quarter mortgage revenue due to the weakening mortgage market, which more than drives this level of reduction in pre-tax income and second higher interest expense. These negative impacts were partially offset by stronger non-mortgage growth and the addition of acquisition related non-mortgage revenue from LawLogix and Midigator and again John will provide details on fourth quarter and full year guidance shortly. We were very pleased with our continued very strong constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% organic, which is well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and our ability to outperform the underlying mortgage market as shown by our third quarter results. Turning to Slide 5 a critical de-lever of our strategic priorities is a continued expansion of our addressable market data sources and revenue. Equifax is much more than a credit bureau today and our addressable TAM has expanded 3x to over $45 billion. Over the past several years we've expanded into faster growing markets outside financial services and mortgage. These faster growing markets include identity and fraud, talent management, government and employer services verticals. This has accelerated our growth outside of financial services and mortgage and increased the resiliency and diversity of EFX by broadening our revenue streams, including markets that are expected to deliver future growth at levels above our traditional markets. As shown on this slide since 2019, we've grown our total non-mortgage business by over $1.1 billion with a combined CAGR since 2019 of 12%, which is at the high end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. In 2022 we expect non-mortgage revenue to represent over 75% of total Equifax revenue. In the fourth quarter, it will be well over 80%. Also, since 2019, we've grown our non-credit bureau based revenues by $1.5 billion or a very strong CAGR of about 30% to over half of Equifax total revenue. This is led by our $2.4 billion Workforce Solutions business, which is up $1.4 billion since 2019 at a very strong CAGR of about 35%, but also supported by strong double-digit growth in identity and fraud from Kount and Midigator as well as strong growth in debt services. We've also completed 12 acquisitions since 2021 that are all in the non-mortgage space and are delivering strong double-digit growth. Workforce Solutions strong above market growth and verticals like Employer Solutions, Talent and Government, our expansion into identity and fraud and our focus on new product investments, coupled with our bolt-on acquisitions focused on non-mortgage priorities will continue to accelerate the growth of these non-credit and non-mortgage revenue streams at Equifax. Turning to Slide 6 in the third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars grew a very strong 16% reported and 19% in constant currency, which was consistent with our July guidance. Constant dollar core revenue, organic revenue growth of 14% in the quarter was also substantially above the organic growth in our long-term financial framework of 7% to 10%. Non-mortgage constant dollar organic revenue growth of 13% drove three quarters of the organic constant dollar core growth in the quarter. Core mortgage outperformance predominantly in EWS drove the remainder of the core organic constant dollar revenue growth. We continue to expect strong core revenue growth of 17% total and 19% in constant currency in 2022, which again is well above our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and 300 basis points higher than the core growth for 2022 provided last November at our Investor Day. This strong constant currency growth is driven by stronger non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% in organic due to broad-based performance across Workforce Solutions and strength in International. As detailed on Slide 7, U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 30% in the quarter. This compares to third quarter mortgage originations of down 57% as estimated by mortgage industry, third parties and USIS credit inquiries that declined 41%. As a reminder in a rising rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate short more frequently, creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations that benefits USIS credit file pole from shopping. In the third quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform on the order of 16 points better than the change in the estimated mortgage originations. USIS revenue declined 35% in the quarter, about 6 points better than credit inquiries. However, TWN income and employment is typically pulled later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront shopping trend that occurs in a rising rate environment as TWN inquiries are more closely aligned with completed mortgage originations. TWN mortgage revenue declined 28% in the quarter. EWS core mortgage revenue growth that was up a strong 14% in the quarter and when adjusting for the 16 point negative spread between mortgage inquiries and originations was up a very strong 30% and consistent with prior quarters. Overall, Equifax mortgage revenue outperformed USIS credit inquiries by 11% or 11 points in the quarter and outperformed estimated mortgage originations by a strong 27 points in the quarter. This reflects the strength of our U.S. enterprise mortgage sales and operations team that bring the combined USIS and EWS products and solutions to market in this challenging mortgage macro. Turning to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter with 32% core revenue growth, driven by very strong non-mortgage, non-UC & ERC growth of 62%. As a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is now about 70% of Workforce Solutions and a big Workforce Solutions driver for future growth from their fast growing talent and government verticals. Workforce Solutions above market 32% core growth in the quarter continues to be driven by very strong performance on TWN record additions, new products and pricing, system-to-system integrations and greater penetration. Their market outperformance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes for mortgage. We expect to see continued very strong core growth in fourth quarter from Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team continue outstanding execution across their key growth drivers detailed on the right hand side of this slide. Over the past 12 months, we've signed 10 new agreements with payroll processors in the U.S., including three new agreements in the third quarter that will be added to the TWN database over the next several quarters. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in our direct contributors through our employers services business are delivering continued strong growth in the TWN database with current records up 16% reaching 146 million current records in the third quarter. Their 111 million unique individuals in TWN deliver very high hit rates and represent over two-thirds of the 165 million U.S. non-farm payroll. And as a reminder, about 50% of our TWN records are contributed directly from individual employers that we have long relationships with. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. In addition to traditional W2 wage earners we estimate there are approximately $30 million to $40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S. who will also bring valuable income and employment insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We've recently signed an agreement with a payroll processor to gain access to their pensioner records and we have an active pipeline with other companies to acquire new pension records to the TWN database. We're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million gig and pensioner records, but expect to make significant progress as we move through 2023 and beyond. TWN record additions will continue to drive Workforce Solutions revenue going forward from higher hit rates and we have the ability to double our records in the future to the roughly 220 million total W2, gig and pension recipients in the United States. This is an incredibly powerful lever for future growth at Workforce Solutions and a key driver of their 13% to 15% long-term growth outlook. Turning to Slide 9 with some more detail on Workforce Solutions, they really had an exceptional quarter delivering revenue of $559 million. Revenue was up a strong 9% with overall organic revenue growth of about flat overall despite the significant 28% decline in EWS mortgage revenue in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 40% and is now 70% of Workforce Solutions. Verification services revenue of $455 million was up 13% more than offsetting the 57% decline in estimated mortgage originations. Non-mortgage verticals now represent over 60% of Verifier revenue and delivered 72% total and 30% organic growth. The Insights business which we acquired late last year continues to perform very well driven by strong performance in their largest verticals, Risk Intelligence and Justice. Risk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze peoples risks via background checks and continuous monitoring. Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. Talent and Government Solutions, which now represent almost 40% of Verifier non-mortgage had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered a 110% total in over 50% organic growth in the quarter from record growth pricing and strong new product rollouts. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 90% total and 44% organic driven by strong penetration at the state level. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong product portfolio, including Insights data at the federal, state and local levels across the United States. The continued expansion of Workforce Solutions data hub through our new Total Verify Solution is driving very strong growth in the fast growing 5 billion Talent and 2 billion Government markets. Our total Verifier Solution is enabling our customers to access multi-data solutions derived from an unparalleled set of differentiated information assets spanning employment, income, education, incarceration, health credentialing and identity. As of the third quarter, EWS has over 580 million total records in the TWN database, both current and historic that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories. The non-mortgage EWS consumer lending business principally in card, auto and consumer finance and led by our U.S. Enterprise sales teams also showed good growth with revenue up 18% in the quarter. Employer services revenue of $104 million was down 7% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims in employer retention credit businesses. We expected total UC & ERC revenue to be down about 20% in 2022, driven by the lower jobless claims and ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer services revenue excluding UC & ERC was up a strong 29% in the quarter driven by broad based double-digit growth in our I-9 and Onboarding, healthy FX and our tax credit businesses. We are increasingly seeing the ability to deliver bundled packages of our differentiated Employer Services Solutions to customers. In the third quarter, we signed a large multiyear agreement to provide a broad suite of EWS solutions, including I-9, W4, Tax Services and other HR Solutions to a large multinational company with annual guaranteed Workforce Solutions revenues approaching $20 million with total annual revenue opportunities with the agreement of over $30 million. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.5% were lower than our July guidance and the over 50% margins we expect from EWS on an ongoing basis. The main drivers of the lower than expected margin was negative mix due to lower mortgage revenue, higher sales and marketing costs principally due to very strong non-mortgage revenue growth and costs to add the new TWN contributors I talked about earlier. The decline in EBITDA margins versus last year was driven by similar factors including negative product margin mix as higher margin mortgage declined as a percentage of revenue and was replaced with Verifier non-mortgage revenue and revenue from the most recent acquisitions, which at this point have lower margins than Verifier overall. And second, increased marketing and sales expense from both investments to drive NPI and driven by our extremely strong non-mortgage sales and record acquisition performance. And then last, as I mentioned, cost related to Onboarding new TWN contributors. We expect these same factors to impact EWS margins in fourth quarter as we see further declines in mortgage revenue with EWS EBITDA margins of about 48.5% in fourth quarter. As we look to 2023, we expect to see EWS margins return to above 50% as product and pricing initiatives expand profitability and we see additional savings from their cloud transformation. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in the third quarter. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another above market quarter with 9% revenue growth and 32% core growth and are well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue above market growth in the future. As shown on Slide 10, USIS revenue of about $397 million were down 9% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 35% and was also better than expected with a 41% decline in credit inquiries versus the 46% we had expected. At $97 million mortgage revenue is now about 25% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage revenue was $250 million, which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue and was up 5% with organic revenue growth of 3%. This was below the low end of the 67% growth we discussed in July. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth remained strong at 9% total and 6% organic, a sign that lenders continue to originate. During the quarter we saw double-digit growth in commercial and telco and solid single digit growth across financial services, auto and insurance offset by a decline in our direct-to-consumer business. Kount, which provides unique identity and fraud solutions continues to execute very well, developing joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data with 2022 global revenue expected to exceed 20%. The recent acquisition of Midigator will continue to strengthen our identity and fraud franchise and growth. The weakness relative to expectations in the quarter was again in financial marketing services, our B2B offline business that has revenue of $51 million, down 8% and lower than our expectations. As we discussed in previous quarters, the principle driver of decline in FMS Services was our fraud and data services vertical where we provide header data principally to providers of identity and fraud services and to a much lesser extent in our risk management and portfolio review business where we provide data and analytical services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or in some cases portfolios they're acquiring. As we discussed in prior quarters, we expect the declines in these businesses to continue through the fourth quarter with improvements in 2023 as we introduce new products, leveraging unique and differentiated data assets available through the new Equifax single data fabric. We also saw a decline in batch marketing services where we provide data and decisioning principally to financial institutions for pre-screeners as well as delivering our IXI data for marketing activities as some customers cut back on originations. We had seen high single digit growth in marketing services in the first half, so this is the first signs of any pullback in marketing. For fourth quarter B2B non-mortgage, we expect online to continue to be strong with growth rates above third quarter from commercial execution as well as progress in pricing and new product rollouts that overcome a somewhat slower growth in financial services. We expect financial marketing services to continue to be weak down over 10% with declines across header, risk and marketing continuing in the fourth quarter. Overall for B2B non-mortgage, we expect fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be about the levels we saw in the third quarter. USIS consumer solutions business had revenue of $50 million, down 1% in the quarter, but up 2% sequentially. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow again sequentially with positive growth rates in the fourth quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.1% in the quarter and slightly below our expectations principally due to continued investments in sales resources focused on non-mortgage growth. International revenue as shown on Slide 11 was up $288 million, up a very strong 17% on a local currency basis and 15% on a non-organic constant currency basis. We're seeing broad based execution from our international businesses. Europe local currency revenue was up 24%, principally driven by over 75% growth in our UK debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the UK Government over the past several quarters. Our European CRA revenue accelerated in the third quarter with revenue of 7% and above our expectations, driven by broad-based product execution across our B2B online products and identity and fraud, slightly offset by lower consumer revenue. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia-New Zealand business, delivered local currency revenue of 6% driven by strong growth in our commercial and identity and fraud businesses and to a lesser extent growth in consumer. Latin America local currency revenue was up a strong 34% driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador and Central America. The team's new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continued to drive strong growth across all product lines. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Latin America. Canada local currency revenue was up 12% and above our expectations. We saw growth in commercial, analytics solutions, decisioning and identity and fraud revenue, which was partially offset by some one-time revenue in the quarter from mortgage volume declines. Consumer revenue also returned to growth during the quarter. We expect mid-single digit revenue growth from Canada in the fourth quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 26.8% were down 200 basis point -- down 210 basis points sequentially and above our expectations given strong revenue growth. EBITDA margins were up slightly versus last year, but up about 150 basis points adjusting for the loss of equity income from the Russian joint venture that we sold. As shown on Slide 12, we had a very strong new product quarter with Vitality Index at 14%, which is our highest Vitality Index ever, and it was over 500 basis points above last year's results and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term growth framework for Vitality. We've delivered about 80 new products so far in 2022 leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities. We now expect to deliver Vitality Index of 13% in 2022, up 200 basis points from our previous guide of 11%, which equates to over $650 million of new product revenue in the year. The growth in our 2022 Vitality Index is principally coming from Workforce Solutions, which is encouraging as they are further along in completing their cloud transformation. It's positive to see the strong NPI results in the early innings of the Equifax Cloud. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax cloud capabilities and single data fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top line growth. This week at the Annual Mortgage Bankers Association Conference, we will showcase a new offering that delivers telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes alongside the traditional mortgage credit report to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process, delivering telco, pay TV and utilities attributes to mortgage lenders alongside the traditional credit reports will also help expand access to credit and help create greater home ownership opportunities for U.S. consumers. The use of these expanded data insights can also provide visibility to millions of credit invisible consumers, those without traditional credit files, and enhance the financial profiles of thin, young and unscorable consumers as they complete their first mortgage applications. This new offering leveraging the Equifax Cloud will provide powerful new insights that help to automate, save time and resources and streamline the first mortgage process for every applicant, creating more opportunities for consumers to secure a loan. And Equifax is the first and only in the industry to offer these unique insights to the mortgage industry. Turning the Slide 13, we outlined the 12 strategic bolt-on acquisitions we've completed since January 2021 we expect will deliver over $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. As you know, our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1% to 2% of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt on M&A aligned around our three strategic priorities. First, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest growing and most profitable business. Second, building out our identity fraud capabilities and third, adding unique data assets. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more details on the mortgage market, and our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance. Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 17, we have some very unique macros in our industry and EFX growth levers driving our performance in 2023 and beyond. The acceleration of the digital macro across every industry is expanding the use of identity, data signals and solutions to drive better decisions across new and existing verticals. Equifax is well positioned to take advantage of the accelerating digital macro through our EFX Cloud investments and our recent acquisitions of Insights, Kount and Midigator. Although we've been impacted by the significant declines in U.S. mortgage market, we believe we have unique levers at Equifax to deliver strong future growth, including Workforce Solutions above market growth and margins, and our expanded focus on new data assets like Insights, USIS non-mortgage growth and Kount and Midigator identity and fraud growth, our new EFX Cloud driving competitive, NPIs top line, and of course cost savings in 2023 and beyond. NPI is leveraging the EFX Cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products and bolt-on M&A to broaden and strengthen Equifax. These attractive market macros along with the broad EFX growth levers and our strong core and non-mortgage outperformance in the past few years, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver above market growth in the future. In the event we do see further economic weakness driven by slowing consumer demand, we believe Equifax is well positioned for continued growth. As we shared with you in July, turning to Slide 18, the new Equifax is a much different and more diverse business than we were in the last recession. We are more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth in challenging economic environments. During the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency you would expect from data analytics businesses. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, EWS grew throughout the global financial crisis and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009. We believe that Equifax business mix today is much better positioned for a potential economic event than in 2009. First, strong EWS growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today with margins over 50% and over 15 percentage points higher than the Equifax average. EWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth, penetration in new and fast growing verticals like talent and government, system-to-system integrations, deploying new higher value products, as well as measured price actions taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database. Second, completion of the Equifax Cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond that we expect will drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from 2022 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven solely by our execution. And then last, we're leveraging the new Equifax cloud to accelerate new product rollouts with a goal of 13% Vitality in 2022, which is over $650 million of the annual incremental revenue from Equifax. As a reminder, NPIs rolled out in 2021 and 2022, will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. Today we believe about 54% of our global business is recession resilient or countercyclical and will grow in a recession. This is a big change and a strong position compared to Equifax and the 2008-2009 global financial crisis where only about 37% of our businesses were either recession resilient or countercyclical. The meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage and identity and fraud since 2009, as well as cloud transformation cost savings position Equifax very well if there's an economic event or recession in 2023 and beyond. Wrapping up on Slide 19, Equifax delivered another strong and broad based quarter driven by 13% organic and 20% total non-mortgage, constant dollar growth that more than offset the 41% decline in the mortgage market, reflecting the broad based strength of Equifax in this challenging economic environment. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-mortgage growth. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient and investing for future growth. Against the unprecedented 37% mortgage market decline in 2022, we expect to deliver constant currency revenue growth of over 5% due to the breadth and strength of our underlying businesses. More importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage constant currency growth of 20% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model. This strong momentum positions us well in 2023 and beyond. EWS continues to deliver above market growth and is our largest, fastest growing and highest margin business. Workforce Solutions above market revenue growth over the past three years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. And new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud are also driving growth. Our 13% Vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we're in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax Cloud to drive innovation new products and expect to deliver strong Vitality in the future. Our 12 bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong top line growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond. And then lastly, we're in the final chapters of completing our new Equifax Cloud data and technology transformation that will deliver top rank growth and cost benefits in 2023 and beyond as we complete the cloud and leverage our new cloud capabilities in single data fabric. Even in this uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax Cloud, new products, data and analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth. We continue to be confident in our long-term growth framework of 8% to 12% total revenue growth and 7% to 10% organic revenue growth with ongoing expansion of margins of 50 basis points per year. We also remain focused on delivering on our 2025 goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins that we set at our Investor Day a year ago. Our ability to deliver non-mortgage growth of 20% in 2022 that is well above our long-term growth framework gives us confidence in the future. We remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster growing higher margin cloud native data analytics company. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes, we talked a bunch Manav, good morning, about mortgage. So we're happy to talk more questions on that. You know, maybe if you step back kind of where we are with the consumer and our customers, the consumer continues to be exceptionally strong. Their credit scores are still up from 2019. They're working. We haven't seen real changes in delinquencies except at the subprime level there's some small changes, but even there delinquencies are lower than they were in 2019. So you've got consumers that have had wage growth. Employment is low, you know, so it's a very good environment for the consumer, which really impacts the verticals you talked about. And then our customers are still very strong there's no question about that. You know, when you think about the last economic event we had in the global financial crisis, you had both traditional financial institutions, banks, and fintechs that really had balance sheet problems. So that's not the environment we have today. So, it's similar to our dialogue that we had in July and back in April. We see a strong consumer continuing, through the fourth quarter and into 2023 and the same thing with our customers. So with regards to kind of activity around originations in some of those verticals not a lot of change. There's still some challenges in auto around supply chain, availability. I think there's expectations that's going to get better in the coming quarters, but it's still hard to find a car, particularly and certain models that you want to get, which is resulting in auto being down some from a year ago. But again, kind of at our expectation, no real change in cards. I think we mentioned in our comments that we've seen a little bit of weakening in some marketing, but I wouldn't call that a trend. You know, broadly, our customers are still focused on originations, card volume is very, very strong, card originations is very, very strong. And again, you go back to, you've got consumers that are very strong. I think everyone, you know, is watching very closely, both us and our customers. When will there be a change in delinquencies. Yes, I'll start and then John can jump in. Obviously you want to start with revenue, you know you know, we, we expect to have you know, attractive non-mortgage growth next year. We're clearly going to have John talked about it, a grow over challenge in the first half of next year, meaning that the mortgage market will be down versus first quarter and second quarter of 2022 based on where current trends look. We don't have an outlook yet, but there was a strong mortgage market in the first quarter and it started declining in the second and more rapidly in the third. So, that's clearly going to be a part of our outlook going forward. You know, you also have our new product rollouts will be a positive for us. You know, that vitality index being above 10%, gives us momentum next year to drive the top line with those new solutions. And as I commented earlier, the new products we're rolling out this year, the 80 products we've rolled out so far, most of those aren't really in the revenue in a meaningful way in 2022. They really mature in 23 and in 2024. Last point I would make is that, we've made a number of acquisitions in the last 25 months or 20 months actually. And those acquisitions are obviously in our run rate revenue, but the synergies that we expect to get typically kick in years two and three, so meaning in 2022 and 2023. So meaning in 2023 we're going to get benefits from acquisition growth that we have going forward. John, maybe you add to that and maybe talk a little bit about some of the margin stuff? Maybe the last one, maybe just a last one is that we commented that there's some unusuals or things that are going to work out in Workforce Solutions margins in the third and fourth quarter, from the mix of mortgage and some additional costs associated with our sales and marketing that we made the comment that we clearly expect Workforce to be back at 50% plus margins in 2023, which will be obviously a positive too. Sure. So I think we talked about it. We talked about organic revenue growth for EWS, and we said it was about 20%. Negatively impacting that is almost 15 points from reductions in UC & ERC. So if you exclude UC & ERC we're seeing organic growth across Workforce Solutions of approaching 35%, which we think is very... Very strong in the third quarter, right? So... And so even, and as we look into next quarter when we compare the 20% that they delivered this quarter, we expect to have very strong performance again next quarter also in non-mortgage. So again, we think EWS non-mortgage revenue growth has been really outstanding and continues to grow. No cost, really inflationary impact. It's really the mix of the loss of that mortgage revenue is just such high margin. And then I think we also talked about some costs from sales and marketing and onboarding, some TWN contributors, but the majority of it is the margin mix from a mortgage. Yes, as you know Europe for us is primarily UK but also Spain is where we participate. And while inflation is a challenge, they're still working, right? And so we really haven't seen any meaningful change in what's happening with our customers. Everyone is worried about inflation, but when you've got people working, they're generally going to pay their bills, they are also going to spend money and they operate. And as you saw from our comments, our UK business, which is most of Europe, had a very good quarter. I think it was up 7%. So no, we haven't seen it yet, even with all the inflation fears. No, I said, we said in our comments, and hopefully you heard it, that we clearly expect margins at EWS to return to that 50% plus level in 2023. We view this mortgage mix as being a challenge in the third and fourth quarter. That will definitely impact their margins as well as some of the additional costs in sales and marketing and TWN contributor onboarding in the third and fourth quarter. I think we talked about 9 or is it 9 or 10 additions of new contributors, that 10 additions of new payroll processors that are adding records. There's generally some incremental costs, when those get added. And our non-mortgage growth is so high; we're having some additional sales and marketing costs in EWS. But to be clear we expect EWS margins over the long-term to be at that 50% plus rate versus where they are at this quarter and next quarter. John, you should jump in. But remember, a big piece of that path to 39 is the cloud transformation completion. And we get some meaningful impact on cost takeout, and we telegraph before and every quarter we talk about it that roughly half of that lift from our margins last year to the 39 is from cloud execution. And that's in our hands, so we know how to do it. It's not economic related. We're going to, whether the economy's up, down or sideways, we're going to complete the cloud and that plugs in. You've got Workforce Solutions growing faster than the rest of Equifax, at their 50% plus EBITDA margins, that equates in margin between now and 2025. You've also got our new product rollouts, our non-mortgage growth that we expect to deliver is also going to deliver margin expansion over that timeframe. It's not, it's just, our view is, and what we've seen and we continue to see it, is that at these higher rates consumers just spend more time shopping around and when they do that shopping USIS benefits from that credit poll that happens in the shopping process and we do not expect that to change. I think your question maybe is a little bit different around, at these high rates, are people going to still buy houses, and at these high rates are people still going to do some level of refis? Which there's some, it's obviously down a bunch, but it's more cash out refis to access, the multi-trillion dollars of untapped home equity in the U.S. And as the mortgage market doesn't disappear. It certainly declined further and more rapidly than, we've expected. As you know, we've been -- revised our mortgage guidance three times this year because we didn't, we couldn't forecast where the Fed was going to take these rates, and I don't think anybody can except higher from where they are now. We're actually getting better at forecasting out a couple of months, meaning inside the quarter. But as you get out, past a quarter looking out with what's happening with the volatility of where rates are going, it's more challenging. So we'll certainly take all of these factors in place when we put out our 2023 guide in February and you'll have a clearer view hopefully there on what the mortgage market is going to look like. But there's no question, the mortgage market is going to bottom at some point. And it doesn't go obviously to zero. There's going to be an area where people still move, and even at this interest rates and it's happened before in the U.S., people still buy homes. So and meaning they buy homes and get mortgages. So there's that level of floor, I think we're all struggling with where it is. And, we'll have a better view, in a few months of what that looks like for 2023. And as John talked earlier, first and second quarter we're going to have tougher comps against a very strong mortgage market in first quarter this year. But as we get to third and fourth, we'll start, comping more towards what should be a floor until we get past whatever economic event we're in here. Yes, I think as Kevin, as we talked a few minutes ago with Andrew, we're in, that we're not doing any guidance on anything on 2023 right now. We're focused on the fourth quarter. And we'll certainly give that guidance as, when we get to likely our February fourth quarter earnings discussion. Yes, I wouldn't say even, but they're all important. There's not one that's disproportionate. Look, record additions are very attractive and very unique for the Workforce Solutions business because it drives revenue day two, after you add the records and as you, 16% record growth in the quarter, and we've driven records up double-digit for the last number of years, that's a certainly a positive. We take prices up every year, so that's something we'll do in January with all the verticals in Workforce and across Equifax. New products, we talked about Workforce Solutions is indexing kind of north of our 14% in a quarter and our 13% guide for the year of new product introductions. That's very attractive for workforce and we've talked in prior meetings about continuing to drive system-to-system integrations, and penetration is a big opportunity in Workforce. If you think about the credit file, it's very highly penetrated in all financial services verticals. Workforce is not even in mortgage. There's still 40 odd percent of mortgages that we don't see that are still done with paper pay stubs. We only do roughly one in 10, roughly background screens. In government you've got a $2 billion TAM and we've got a $300 million roughly business there. So there's a lot of government penetration opportunity. So you can see each of them are attractive and very valuable, which is why we have a lot of confidence in Workforce Solutions 13% to 15% long-term growth rate. No, numbers are important, obviously. I think just maybe spooling back to kind of two years ago when we really ramped up our new product resourcing. We brought in a cheap product to officer, we've got more of a cadence around it. We did that intentionally in advance of our single data fabric and in advance of our cloud capabilities because we were convinced that the cloud, which again, we still have to complete, we're well down the road and a single data fabric will allow us to bring things to market we couldn't do before. And use the example of the product we rolled out this week at the Mortgage Bankers Association of taking our telco utility cell phone data and embedding it in the credit file. That's a very sophisticated product. It's going to drive higher hit rates, higher approval rates, higher originations for our customers. And it's something that only Equifax can deliver. So that multi-data solution is a big part of our new product capabilities. The second area is really leaning more into our trended data, our historical data workforce solutions now gets what, 40% of revenue from historical records, almost 50 now. So you think about how they've changed that in the last couple of years through their new product capabilities. And think about a mortgage solution that shows historical income data on a consumer back a year, two years, three years, four years. That helps in the underwriting process. We sell that at a higher price point. Think about in the talent vertical, a history of job employment that's required. As, we have 500 million and I think 560 million total records now in the TWN database and that's, well over five and a half jobs on the average American, so that multi data as well as historical solution. I think the other thing that's quite encouraging, I mentioned in my comments earlier is that, workforce solutions that's further down in the, the road in the cloud is delivering well north of the 14% vitality. They're one of the big drivers of that guide up for the year on new products. And that's what we wanted to see. That's what we expected to see. And I think the good news is we're seeing it, meaning as we get further into the cloud, we're able to deliver those new solutions to our customers. And I think, as you know new products are also very high. Obviously they drive incremental revenue growth, but they're very high incremental margins. You're thinking 70%, 80% kind of incremental margins on new products. It's why we're driving the initiative, but it also makes us more valuable to our customers. We're bringing them solutions that helps them solve problems and either drive their top line, their bottom line or both in a very positive way. So it's a big focus of ours and, it's going to, it's one that's central to our long-term growth strategy. And you remember back in November in our Investor Day, we talked a bunch about that being one of the factors of increasing our long-term growth rate to the 8% to 12 was our expectation. And now you're seeing it of our ability to deliver that 10% Vitality in our long-term growth rate. Yes. From a historical Sure. You use the term shots on goal, or do you want to have more shots that go in or more shots on goal and, we want both, right? So you have a bell curve with any new product portfolio you put in place, you're going to have, some products that are, screaming winners, that really hit the mark with our customers and some that are less successful. And then there's also maturity cycle to them, as I mentioned, we'll roll out products in the second half of this year that, won't deliver any revenue in 2022 but they'll start maturing in 2023, 2024, 2025 that's really what you have from a cycle standpoint. So to answer your specific question, we're looking to have more and obviously having more that deliver rajthat deliver larger revenue, and I think we're just getting better at that. Primarily because we're really being quite deliberate around collaborating with our customers. Instead of creating a product we think the market wants, we're creating a product that we know a customer wants because we're collaborating with them. And then once it works with one customer or two, then we productize it to take it out to the rest of our customer base. Yes, so the Appriss Insights acquisition, as is our incarceration data business. We're really pleased. We bought it really just a year ago, so it's 12 months in. And the integration's progressing very positively. We talked about, some of the joint solutions that we're already bringing to market, putting their data into our total verified data hub. And we've got new products, in the pipeline, both on enhancing their solutions with their data, but also combining their data with some of the other data that's used either in the talent or in the government verticals to deliver a single pole with either employment data plus the incarceration data or employment education and incarceration. So we've seen really positive opportunities there. And as far as growth rates, it was growing, kind of mid teams when we bought it, and it still is, we're very pleased with the growth of the business. Absolutely not. No. There's still strong and there really hasn't been a change in 2022 about, around the consumer. As you know, employment has, unemployment has gone down and employment has gone up, you know, since the beginning of the year. So that's good for consumers. Wage growth is up, which is good for consumers, and that helps their balance sheet. Obviously, inflation's a bad guy, and it is hurting, lots of consumers. But even with inflation, consumers are still out there spending and traveling and doing all the things that they do in their lives. So the credit scores are up 15 points from 2019 that hasn't really changed. They're in good shape. You really have to watch employment and unemployment, that's where things generally change with a consumer. Obviously inflation is challenging particularly for, the kind of the lower income demographic, but the rest of the population is doing okay. Yes so this, I would add a couple things to the list. I wouldn't call it, obviously end market in 2022 is stronger than 2021 as they, the international markets came out of the pandemic earlier this year. But the end markets aren't -- like in Latin America the end markets are always strong just because the underlying growth there. But I wouldn't say there's been a change in the end markets. Our team is executing well. So there is some commercial strength there. New products are a big deal, as far as bringing new solutions, new products to market. For example, we're bringing our count identity and fraud solutions to a lot of our international markets, so we're starting to get some traction there, which is helping our international platforms. Cloud isn't really a benefit to them yet. They're further behind the North America intentionally in cloud, with the exception of Canada. So their cloud benefits are really going to be more in 2023 and actually more in 2024 as they complete the cloud. What would you add to international John? Yes, as I said earlier, Jeff broadly the consumers unchanged from second quarter. And so our bank balance sheets are very strong. So there's no change there, so don't take, whatever you heard earlier is, some message around that. We're seeing big pullbacks. What I will tell you is every time I meet in the C-suite or with CROs we're all talking about, because we all watch CNBC, we all watch what's happening with inflation. We all see what's happening with interest rates of, when will it have an effect on consumers, and when will it have effect on ability to pay and delinquencies. And again, my view of someone who's been around financial services for, multi decades, it all starts with employment. And that's the indicator that we watch, I watch. And then after that is delinquencies. But we're seeing it still a strong job market. I think there's not quite two, but there is 1.7 jobs open for anyone who's out of a job now, something like that, so it's still very vibrant and, we don't see indications of what I would call pullback, but everyone's watching it. It's clearly a conversation in every meeting. Yes. There's some levels, it's very de-minimus of what I would call churn inside of the records, but they're obviously, they're generally growing when you're up 16%, so there's, it's not something that we see and there is, obviously a change, some changes in employment with some of our partners. As you go through the year, there's a seasonality as you might imagine, where there's hiring and some industries think about retail warehouse, related to the holiday season that we see in increased employment, which in results at increased records for us you know, call it in the second half of the year. And then a change in the first half of the year when some of that, comes some of that holiday hiring, comes out of the system. But broadly, we are seeing, obviously it's 16% strong record growth inside of the TWN set. Thanks. Yes, again, we don't want to get into 2023 guidance. We gave you our fourth quarter guidance; it's too early to talk about 2023. And I think we talked about, obviously mortgage in for sure in the first half will be a challenge, because of the strong mortgage market in the first quarter last year. But we, in some of the previous questions, talked a bunch about, what are the positives if you will, having the non-mortgage total growth of 20 and organic growth of 13, that's momentum coming out of 2022 into 2023. That, is obviously going to be important to us. We talked about the fact we do pricing actions typically on 11 so that's going to be a positive, for us in 2023. The new products, we talked about the acquisition synergies and growth, going into 2023. What else would you add, John? Well, 16% records growth carries through till. Next year and I think we talked about 10 new partners being signed up three in the quarter. Those won't go online in the fourth quarter. Those will be additions. That'll happen in 2023 that'll drive records. And of course we're out there, working to add more records that will help EWS. Yes, we're not giving growth rate, outlook for 2023. That's not the intention of this meeting yet. But when you think about those two verticals, I talked about it earlier. You think about talent as a $5 billion Tam where we have a ton of penetration opportunity, right? because we're only doing one in 10 or two in 10 background screens. So that's a opportunity there. And then in the government, very similar government that's about a $2 billion TAM for that kind of verification of income and employment in some cases. And we've got $300 million business. So there's a lot of growth potential there. And add on top of it, kind of the core workforce solutions, growth levers outside of penetration, of adding more records is going to drive hit rates in both businesses. Whether it's for background screening or government social services, you add in our new products pricing changes that we're going to do early in the year system, system integrations drive revenue for us in both of those verticals. So those are the kind of growth levers the team's going to work on. And is in flight on as well as the momentum that we have coming out of the year, which is quite strong. Yes, we don't see any real change in not only EWS, but across Equifax about what we're going to do in price in 2023. And like, it's already happening, so it's not going to, we're already in flight talking to customers about what our plans are around price for 2023, because most of the pricing goes into effect 11. Workforces, is a very unique solution that delivers, really unique value to our customers. So we have more pricing, power there or flexibility. But we're always balanced about, price, whether it's a, good or bad economic times. But I would say broadly, we don't think about pricing being different. If there's an economic event, and again, there's an economic event hasn't happened yet, the outside of the mortgage macro, the economy's quite good. Our non-mortgage business is very strong. Our customers are strong, the consumers are strong. So, we're kind of doing what we, I would characterize as kind of a normal process in January. Yes, there's still a bunch of runway in W2, which you heard and we're penetrating that which is, most of our records today are W2. So that 16% growth is primarily in that set, and there's still, another 40 million, 50 million records to get there. And then if you go to gig, it is more dispersed and we've got a number of strategies underway to go after those records, which are equally valuable. And we've got some traction around pensioner records. As I mentioned, we've signed a big partner to bring some records in. We're also getting records directly from large kind of legacy companies that do their own pension or payroll processing or pension or payment processing. So we're working on all those avenues and we've got dedicated teams on them and we're, our expectation is to continue to add records from all three areas, as we move through the fourth quarter and into 2023 and beyond. And what's energizing for us is the opportunity to still double the data set, it 111 million uniques and call it 210 million or thereabouts total employed or pension payment recipients in the United States. We got a long runway to add new records to the TWN data set. And again I mentioned this a couple times, I know it's not lost on you Toni, that we're already getting inquiries on those, right? So we get inquiries on the half of the records we don't have. So it's just a matter of adding them to drive our revenue growth. Yes, no we've been growing revenue per record quite meaningfully again the way you should think about it and the way it's, the way we think about it is, as we get into new verticals, like talent and government, or even as I would characterize, cards and as a newer vertical autos under penetrated, all of those verticals as we add those new revenue sources, the records become more valuable, right? Because we're, monetizing that same record multiple times when someone applies for a mortgage and then a credit card and then an auto loan or a P loan, and then they apply for a new job, or then they have to get government social services. You've got multiple avenues to monetize that record. So it's part of the power of the business. So are you specifically talking about verifier? Okay. Yes, so variable margins with the contribution margins for mortgage obviously yes going in, coming out should be very similar. Whether or not we reinvest some of the incremental profit generated would be a different discussion, right? But they certainly should be similar in terms of the contribution margin of both. Generally speaking, the margins across Verifier are similar. They can be somewhat different depending on the relative price point and the volumes relative to the price point. So you can see some higher cost for different kind of to your earlier question. But broadly speaking yes, the margins for the products across verification services are relatively similar. Relatively quickly, yes obviously the mortgage market decline is weighed on that. Both yes when we do these bolt-on acquisitions, part of our strategy is to bring in, unique data assets that we can combine with other Equifax data assets in order to drive, new solutions to market. And that generally takes time. We got to integrate the business, integrate their data set into our single data fabric, and that usually takes call a year and change. And then we can start bringing those to market and then those drive the top line and the bottom line. Yes, the biggest driver and margin degradation by far is the impact on revenue and the very high variable margins we get for mortgage. So that's the biggest driver, right. We have talked about some increased expenses. We talked about some marketing investments and things we're making this year to drive NPI, which have been very successful. But generally overall the biggest driver in the movement is, has been related to the reduction in revenue related to mortgage. Yes. We're not ready to talk about 2023 guidance. We did want to make, clear that first quarter's going to have a tough comparison given the fourth quarter exit and the strength in the first quarter last year. And then at EWS you said about 50%, we actually said over 50%, just to be accurate. But yes, we'll be ready to give 2023 guidance, when we get into 2023. I don't know if you were listening, George, but we got that question from, earlier that we're not seeing any change the non-mortgage growth rates that we're talking about are very, very high. And we expect them to, still be very strong in the fourth quarter. I don't know what you mean by medium term, longer term, do we expect the mortgage market over the long term to return to a more normal level? Absolutely. No question about it. Is that what you mean? What's going to happen with the economy in the first year or two of that cycle? And then at the tail end that you said two to four, you get out to four years, it would, my expectation is you'd get back to a more normal level. But I don't know what's going to happen with the economy. I don't think you do either, George. No, I think, as John said and we've said consistently, not only in this call and prior calls, the 250 is really between 2022 and 2025, and it's that path, the 39% EBITDA margins in 2025. That's our goal. That happens over 2023, 2024 and 2025, that's not a 2023 change. Yes, I think we put this in place a year ago and I believe that was the first change in Equifax's long term framework in like five or six years at least or maybe longer. The old framework was 7 to 10. We moved to 8 to 12, 100 basis points on the low end and 200 on the high end. It was intended to be a long term framework, and we could all talk about long term, but let's say five years plus, meaning we expect the company to grow, in that range, short of economic events. Those are, something you can't put in a long-term framework. But 8% to 12% growth for workforce in particular inside of the 8 to 12, and we talked about this already this morning. We have an expectation of them growing 13 to 15. That's their long term framework inside of our eight to 12, meaning they're going to be highly accretive and grow faster than the rest of Equifax. That's something that we expect as you point out, they've been outgrowing that 13 to 15, which sits inside of our eight to 12, which is good news in our eyes. That gives us confidence in the 13 to 15 over the long term. And of course, the 13 to 15 is made up of record editions. It's made up of new product rollouts. It's made up of penetration. And they've got uniquely a lot of penetration opportunities in all of their verticals because, our income and employment data is still a fairly new data asset. In the scheme of data assets, the credit file's been around for 70 years. Income and employment data has been around in a digitized way only for 15. So we've got a lot of confidence, in the 13 to 15 for workforce because of all of their growth levers, but also because they've been outgrowing that 13 to 15 for the last three or four years. And your question, I think you also asked the question about when will we revisit this? It's just, it's actually not even 12 months old. Our Investor Day was, I think on November 7th last year, so we're very confident and comfortable with what it is today after almost 12 months. And, at the right time if things change, we would look at it again. But we see no reason to change it and we still have a lot of confidence in it. Yes. I think in the, in our long term framework John, we talked about new products in November last year, adding one to two points. And that translated into, that was one of the drivers of us bringing up our long term growth rate from seven to 10 to eight to 12 was the increased new product rollouts, is going to be a factor of that change in our long-term growth rate and then add to it workforce solutions growing faster than the rest of Equifax at, approaching 50% of Equifax that's accretive to that growth rate if they're growing 13 to 15. And then the average for our long term is eight to 12. That's accretive. And then we believe the cloud completion and cloud competitiveness also is a factor in that change from seven to 10 to eight to 12. I don't know if that's helpful. Yes, there's clearly that it'll replace, some products, but they're generally, as John pointed out unique additions, and use the example I shared this morning of, the mortgage credit file that we've been delivering to the marketplace for 70 years in some fashion. We rolled out a new solution that's going to be our file plus this telco utility, cell phone data that's going to differentiate our mortgage credit file. That's a new product. Some customers will only buy the new product. Some will continue to buy just the credit file. That's really, so there is there some cannibalization could be, but there's also should be, we expect share gain, meaning our credit files more valuable than our competitor's credit file because the addition of that unique data to it."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making reference, certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, beginning on slide four.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another solid quarter with record second quarter revenue of $1.32 billion, which was up 7% and at the middle of our April guidance, including the negative impact of 190 basis points or $23 million of FX. Constant currency revenue growth was almost 9% at 8.5%. Adjusted EPS of $2.09 was above the top end of our April guidance range with U.S. mortgage market overall, about at the level of our April guidance with U.S. mortgage credit inquiries down 33% versus last year. As expected, the mortgage market decline increased as we moved through the quarter. In the first half of July, mortgage credit inquiries were down about 40% versus last year. Core revenue growth in the quarter of 19% and core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter were very strong. Consistent with our expectations, which allowed us to deliver the 8.5% constant currency growth against a 33% U.S. mortgage market decline. Importantly, non-mortgage constant currency growth of 22% was very strong in the quarter and well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and of course, this represents about 75% of Equifax revenue. Workforce Solutions core revenue growth of 41% was outstanding and above our expectations. International delivered 11.5%, constant currency growth, which was also above our expectations. And USIS B2B non-mortgage growth of 6% was up from first quarter, but lower than we expected. B2B non-mortgage online was strong at 9%. However, our B2B offline business was much weaker than expected, declining 5% in the quarter, and I'll cover this more fully shortly. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $461 million, up 7% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 35% were above in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to make strong progress during the quarter on our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. Year-to-date, we've migrated approximately 14,500 customers to the cloud in the U.S. And since the start of the transformation, we now have migrated about 70% of our U.S. customers. So far in 2022, we also migrated approximately 13,000 international customers and decommissioned four U.S. data centers. Leveraging our new EFX Cloud infrastructure, we continue to invest in new product resources and accelerate new product innovations. So far in 2022, we released 50 -- over 50 new products continuing momentum from 2021 where we launched a record 151 new products. In the quarter, our Vitality index, defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years was extremely strong and exceeded 13%. This is over a 400 basis point improvement from our 9% Vitality last year and the highest level in over 10 years at Equifax. For 2022, we expect Vitality of over 11% and which is 100 basis points above our 10% long-term Vitality goal and 100 basis points above the framework when we started the year. This strong NPI performance will benefit our growth in the second half and in 2023 and beyond. We continue to invest our strong free cash flow and strategic bolt-on acquisitions with the acquisition of LawLogix that we announced earlier this morning, which will further strengthen our EWS Employer Solutions I-9 integration regulatory service capabilities. This is our sixth acquisition in Workforce Solutions since January 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen workforce, our largest and fastest-growing business. Bolt-on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are a strong lever for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A. We are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, particularly our strong 22% non-mortgage constant currency growth. This is clearly an unprecedented economic environment with record inflation, strong set actions and the impact from higher interest rates on the mortgage market. Despite our strong first half performance we felt it was prudent to adjust our 2022 guidance to reflect expectations for further weakening of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half beyond the framework we provided in April as well as the significant negative impact of FX from the stronger dollar. Importantly, our expectations for 2022 core revenue growth remains a very strong 17%. Our expectation for constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth remains a very strong 19%, both unchanged from our April guidance. While our second quarter mortgage results were aligned with our April guidance, we thought there was enough uncertainty between future Fed actions, the impact on interest rates and mortgage activity to further adjust our second half mortgage outlook. Our updated expectations for mortgage are that credit inquiries will decline by over 46% in the second half, which is down about 600 basis points from our April framework with mortgage originations declining 200 to 300 basis points beyond these levels. This compares to the Mortgage Bankers Association forecast for the second half of 2022 mortgage origination units of down 43.5% that was released last night. As you know, USIS mortgage revenue is tied more closely to credit inquiries, while Workforce Solutions revenue is tied more closely to mortgage originations. And for the second half of 2022, FX is a headwind of over $40 million up from an impact of about $7 million in our April guidance from the stronger dollar. The change in the second half mortgage inquiries and FX impact results in our revised 2022 guidance for revenue at the midpoint of $5.1 billion down $100 million from our April framework, but still up almost 4% versus last year or 5% on a constant currency basis. This reduction in revenue is about two-thirds related to mortgage with the balance from FX. Our updated adjusted EPS guidance is to a midpoint of $7.68, down $0.47 from our April guidance and up about 1% from 2021. As I said earlier, there's no change in our core organic revenue growth framework, which remains a very strong 15% for 2022 and 13% in the second half of 2022, and our non-mortgage growth framework remains up a strong 16% for the year and 12% in the second half as we comp-off some strong double-digit results in the second half of 2021 and in the second half of 2021. In the second half of 2022, non-mortgage is about 80% of Equifax revenue consistent with 2019 and up from 68% last year. Turning to slide five, in the second quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars, grew a very strong 19%, which was in line with our expectations and substantially above our long-term financial framework of eight to 12. Core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework of 7% to 10% for organic growth. Non-mortgage organic growth in EWS International and USIS drove about 12 points of core organic revenue growth in the quarter. Core mortgage outperformance of 13%, predominantly in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining 4% of second quarter core organic revenue growth. Both were very strong performances. With a strong 19% core growth in the quarter and accelerating NPI rollouts, we continue to expect 2022 core revenue growth of 17%. This is driven by broad-based strong performance across Workforce Solutions as well as strength in USIS non-mortgage B2B online and international, which is supported by our accelerated new product introductions. As detailed on slide six, U.S. core mortgage revenue growth in the quarter was up a strong 13% driven by Workforce Solutions core mortgage revenue growth of 20% and 2% in USIS. Second quarter mortgage revenue was down only 19% despite the 33% decline in the overall U.S. mortgage market as measured by our credit inquiries and an MBA June estimated decline in mortgage originations of about 37%. Workforce Solutions core mortgage growth of 20% continues to be driven by very strong performance on TWN record additions, new products and pricing, system and system integrations and continued penetration. The 20 points of market outperformance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes. We expect to see continued very strong core mortgage growth from EWS approaching this level in the second half. As a reminder, we estimate the U.S. mortgage market as the change in USIS credit inquiries. In a rising interest rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate shop more frequently, thus creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations. This trend benefits USIS credit file poles. In the second quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform on the order of four points better than the estimated change in the mortgage origination units estimated by MBA. However, TWN income and employment is typically called later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront rate shopping trend that occurs in a rising interest rate environment as TWN inquiries are more closely correlated to mortgage originations. Turning to slide seven. In 2022, we expect non-mortgage revenues to be 77% of total Equifax revenues, which is up a very strong 900 basis points from the 68% of total Equifax revenues that we saw in 2021. Given the above-market growth in fast-growing Workforce Solutions verticals such as talent, government and card, further penetration identity and fraud accelerated by our 2021 acquisition account and accelerated NPIs with a vitality index expected to be 11% in 2022 and of course, growth in our international markets. We also expect non-mortgage revenue will benefit from being the only cloud-native credit bureau through always-on system stability, faster transaction processing and leveraging the Data Fabric to expand our NPIs. Turning now to slide eight. Workforce Solutions delivered outstanding 41% core revenue growth in the second quarter the fifth quarter over 40% revenue growth in the last six quarters and their 10th quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by outstanding non-mortgage growth of over 50%. As a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is over 65% of Workforce Solutions and a big EWS growth driver for the future. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team continued outstanding execution across their key growth drivers detailed on the right-hand side of this slide. As I referenced earlier, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire LawLogix last night, the next in a string of bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen Workforce Solutions Employer Services vertical and adds TWN records. Over the past two years, we've completed six bolt-on acquisitions supporting Workforce Solutions growth, including EFRA since last fall, and LawLogix this morning. Turning to slide nine, Workforce Solutions very strong performance is driven by the team's consistent execution across their key growth levers that will drive their long-term growth of 13% to 15%, including, first, growing the work number database. Since late last year, we signed four new exclusive agreements with large payroll processors that we started to board in the second quarter and expect to have all of them contributing records by the end of the third quarter. We ended the quarter with $144 million total current records, which is up a very strong 22% from last year and up 6% sequentially. These $144 million total records represent 110 million unique individuals, representing two-thirds of the over 160 million W-2 employees, included in U.S. Non-farm payroll. In addition to traditional W-2 wage earners, we estimate there are approximately 30 million to 40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S. who will also bring valuable insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million non-W-2 wage earners, but expect to make significant progress as we move through 2022 and 2023. We have the ability to double our TWN database with the total potential market for income and employment information on about 220 million individuals versus the $110 million we have today. As a reminder, over 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. The vast majority of our partnerships with payroll companies are exclusive, including all the relationships we've signed in the past four-plus years. Second, Workforce is increasing penetration in their key non-mortgage verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance, with all four verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by new products, leveraging our expanding TWN active and historical data assets. Our talent and government businesses have seen average organic growth of over 50% since last year and over 20% CAGR since 2017. Our strength in talent and government is driven by the depth and coverage of our TWN database with over 570 million total records, both current and historic that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories. The expanding depth of our TWN database and expansion of the Workforce Solutions talent data hub as well as the increasing ease of integrations as workforce leverages the API capabilities through our new Google Cloud is also providing the ability to continue to increase penetration in key verticals. We workforce is expanding their system and system integrations. Currently, more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system and system integrations as web access, which is up over two versus web access which is up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get about a 20% lift in mortgage pools when we convert our customers from web to system to system integrations. In Talent Solutions, system-to-system now represents more than 85% of transactions while in government, we have more opportunity with about 65% of transactions on a system-to-system basis. As a reminder, close to 100% of credit files are delivered system-to-system for originations. From our perspective, it's only a matter of time for TWN to approach these levels of system-to-system integrations with customers, which, of course, will drive our revenue. As workforce continues to deliver greater value to customers through deepening the database and extending real-time system-to-system integrations and accelerating its launch of higher-value, vertical-specific new products average revenue per transaction will continue to grow significantly, both through higher value and price new products and annual price increases. As I said earlier, Rudy and the EWS team have a long runway for growth, leveraging multiple levers in 2022 and beyond. We have a lot of confidence in workforce's ability to deliver on their 13% to 15% long-term framework. As a reminder, over the past three years, they've delivered 34% CAGR, which, of course, is well above our 13% to 15% long-term growth framework. Turning to slide 10, workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering $609 million of revenue, their second revenue quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 21% with organic revenue growth of 11%, despite the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue is now over 65% of Workforce Solutions with organic growth of 30%. Verification Services revenue of $505 million, up 28% and was over $500 million for the second quarter in a row, again, despite the decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage verticals now represent almost 60% of verifier revenue and delivered 90% and 53% -- 90% total and 53% organic growth, APRs Insights which we acquired late last year, delivered strong 15% growth in the quarter. Growth was strong in their key verticals of risk and justice intelligence. Risk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze people risks via background checks and continuous monitoring. And Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. Increased customer penetration, leg space expansion and strong hiring volumes are driving growth. And their NPI pipeline also remains strong. We are very positive about the future growth and potential of our Insights business. Talent and Government solution, which now represents 40% of Workforce Solutions and almost 80% of verifier non-mortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered 134% total and 73% organic growth in the quarter on record growth and strong new product revenue. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 100% total and 50% organic with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. The continued expansion of Workforce Solutions data hub and the fast-growing $5 billion talent and 2 billion government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions over $570 million current and historical records for new products. The integration of unique Appriss Insights National Student Clearinghouse and other talent-related data assets strengthens our ability to deliver to these new solutions, leveraging the EWS data hub and drive outsized growth in the future. Non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto also showed strong growth, up 18% in the quarter and debt management grew over 70% in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was down 3% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down over 25% during 2022 driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as well as the COVID federal tax credit program -- the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer Services revenue, excluding UC and ERC, was up a strong 42% in the quarter, driven by strong base double-digit growth in our I-9 and onboarding healthy FX and our tax credit businesses. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin remained strong at 53.4%. In the quarter, we increased spending relative to our April expectations on both technology and marketing, principally for new products. The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness and value of their in income and employment data in Employer Services businesses was clear again in the second quarter. Rudy and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 21% revenue growth and 41% core growth well above the 13% to 15% long-term framework, and we're well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continued above-market growth in the future. Turning on to slide 11. USIS revenue of $421 million was down 7.5% compared to last year and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which at $113 million is about 25% of total USIS revenue and was down 29% in the quarter, about 4 percentage points better than the overall mortgage market credit inquiries that declined 33%. Importantly, USIS delivered their sixth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B non-mortgage revenue of $259 million which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue and was up 6% with our organic revenue growth of 4%. This was at the low end of the 6% to 7% growth we discussed in April due to lower-than-expected FMS potential marketing services revenue. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was strong at 9% with 7% organic growth. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, financial services, commercial as well as Kount, our identity and fraud business. We also saw growth in direct-to-consumer with auto about flat in the quarter on favorable pricing offset by lower volumes given the continued auto supply chain issues. Kount which provides unique identity and fraud solution continues to perform very well. Our core new product growth continues to be strong, and the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data including combining Kount's market-leading Omniscore AI capabilities and digital identity data with Equifax' physical identity into a single score to enhance fraud protection. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $55 million, down 5% year-over-year and although better than the first quarter was lower than our expectations. FMS is principally comprised of three lines of business, including first fraud and data services in which we provide header data principally to providers of identity and fraud services which is the line of business is driving the weakness in our B2B off-line. Fraud and data services historically represents over 20% of our offline revenue, but has declined substantially in the first half. We saw this decline in the first quarter as customers either decreased frequency of refresh data or shifted to use of their own internal data. This decline continued in the second quarter. Revenue was about 10% of B2B offline in the first half. We expect revenue at this level to continue through 2022 as the team focuses on bringing new solutions to market later this year. Marketing Services, which represents over half of B2B offline revenue in the first half, performed very well growing but not consistent with our non-mortgage B2B online organic growth. This is a business in which we provide data in decisioning principally to financial institutions for prescreens as well as providing our IXI data for marketing activities. And third, risk management or portfolio review represents about a third of B2B offline revenue. This is a line of business in which we provide data and analytics services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or in some cases, portfolios they're acquiring. This business is often somewhat countercyclical as customers perform more risk analytics during weak economic periods. This business was down slightly in the first half and slightly weaker than expected, we expect this business to be down slightly for the remainder of the year. Overall, for our Financial Marketing Services and B2B offline for the remainder of 2022, we expect to see declines in line with the second quarter as the weakness in the Fraud and Data Services is partially offset by continued good growth in Marketing Services. As we look to 2023, the completion of the Equifax new cloud data fabric will enable enhanced product offerings in B2B offline combining U.S. credit file, DataX, Teletrack, TWN, IDN fraud and NCTUE data. We believe this will drive growth across all three of our B2B offline lines of business as we get to 2023. For B2B non-mortgage in total, we expect to see continued strong online growth consistent with the first half. However, declines in Financial Marketing Services are expected to result in second half total B2B non-mortgage growth at or slightly below the bottom end of our long-term framework of 6% to 8% revenue growth. USIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S. D2C business from GCS that we combined with USIS in the fourth quarter last year, had revenue of $49 million, up 3% in the quarter and about flat versus last year. We expect second half growth rates to improve as the team leverages the cloud to roll out NPIs. USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins resulting in a healthy win rate and their new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipe slightly higher than the first quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 38.2% in the quarter, 110 basis points lower than the first quarter but better than our expectations. The decline relative to the first quarter is principally driven by lower revenue from the decline in mortgage. Turning now to International, as shown on slide 12, the revenue was $286 million, up a strong 11.5% on a local currency basis. We're seeing broad-based execution from our International businesses. New York local currency revenue was up 16%, principally driven by strength in our U.K. debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K. government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue. Our European CRE businesses was about flat in the quarter and below our expectations, driven by declines in consumer direct and commercial, partially offset by strong growth in identity and fraud. Asia Pacific local currency revenue was 6%, driven by strong growth in our Australia consumer business, HR services and identity and fraud. Latin American local currency revenue was up 28%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico and Central America. The teams\u2019 strong new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continue to drive strong growth across the region. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America. Canada local currency revenue was up 2% below our expectations. We saw growth in Commercial and Analytics Solutions, which was partially offset by consumer services, mortgage-related products and online businesses due to interest rate increases. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 24.7% were down 200 basis points from last year due primarily to the elimination of equity income from our Russia joint venture. As shown on slide 13, we had another very strong new product quarter with our Vitality Index over 13%, which is up 400 basis points above our full year 2021 Vitality goal in 300 basis points above our 10% long-term framework goal and our highest vitality performance ever. Building on the record 151 new products last year, we delivered over 50 new products leveraging the new EFX cloud so far in 2022 with broad-based execution across all of our business units. We've detailed some of the more significant new products on this slide. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index of over 11% this year, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue in 2022. We believe our strong NPI revenue generation is an important early indicator of the benefits of the new Equifax cloud, new products leveraging our differentiated data and new EFX cloud capabilities are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top-line growth. A detail on slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX 2023 growth strategy and long-term framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A, including LawLogix that we announced this morning. We completed 11 acquisitions since the January 2021, aligned with our strategy to add bolt-on M&A around three strategic priorities; number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, adding unique data assets; and number three, building out and expanding our ID and fraud business. Slide 15 provides detail on our latest acquisition of LawLogix, which further strengthens our Workforce Solutions, employer solutions capabilities and provides I-9 management and immigration case management solutions focused on removing friction during the employee onboarding experience. LawLogix's suite of products supplements employer services capabilities by building upon investments made to help clients enable automation, deepen employee insights and increase efficiency. Our I-9 Anywhere product has seen very strong 45% growth over the past few years. The LawLogix's acquisition is aligned with our M&A priority of expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions. With that, I'll turn it over to John to provide some more details on the mortgage market and our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on slide 16, our guidance now reflects an expectation that the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries will decline over 46% in the second half of 2022, a continued decline from the down 40% level we're seeing in early July. Our assumptions reflect mortgage originations, 200 basis points to 300 basis points weaker than those levels with the work number inquiries more closely linked to mortgage originations. The reduction in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries of over 46% in the second half is off the second half 2021 reduction over 20%. This level of U.S. mortgage credit inquiries in the second half is over 30% lower than the second half average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period. 1Q mortgage revenue was 29.5% of total Equifax revenues and 2Q mortgage revenue was 24.7% of total Equifax revenues. In 3Q, we expect mortgage to make up just over 21% of total Equifax revenues and about 23.5% in the full year of 2022. As we have shared in prior quarters, slide 17 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. The left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages. The in-the-money population is about 1.9 million homes and below the $3.3 million we saw in April. At the current level, mortgage refi activity is heavily driven by cash of refis that are often executed with no rate benefit or rate increase. For perspective, for the most recent available Black Knight data for May 2022, about 95% of re-financings were cash out. As shown on the right side of slide 17, the pace of existing home purchases continues at high levels, but were down about 7% in May and 14% in June from the levels we saw in 2021. We -- we believe our assumptions for U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries over the last six months of 2022 reflect the trends just discussed. The 46.5% year-to-year decline in mortgage credit increase reflects a continued sequential weakening of the mortgage market with third quarter increase down over 25% in the second quarter and fourth quarter down a further over 15% from these much reduced third quarter levels. The rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impact on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business. Slide 18 provides a walk detailing the drivers of the 5.2% constant currency and 3.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.1 billion. Revenue decline from the midpoint of our April guidance of $5.2 billion is driven by about two-thirds by the decline in the mortgage revenue, reflecting the expectation of a weaker U.S. Mortgage market with the remainder due to a greater negative impact from FX. The over 37% decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 12%, about 150 basis points more negative than the levels we discussed in April. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims in the ERC businesses that we discussed with you in April, total headwinds into 2022 revenue growth are about 13 percentage points. As Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be 17% and organic revenue growth to be at almost 15%, consistent with our April guidance. Both well above our long-term growth framework and reflecting outstanding growth and execution on new products. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is driving 11% of the core organic revenue growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. International and USIS non-mortgage are also expected to drive core growth. Slide 19 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 0.4% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.68 per share. The growth in revenue and expansion in EBITDA margins by about 25 basis points drives growth and EPS of about 8%. Higher depreciation and interest expense and the negative impact of weaker FX are principally offsetting this growth in adjusted EPS. The reduction of $0.47 or about $75 million in pre-tax income from the midpoint of the guidance we provided in April is at a high level driven by the following: higher interest expense of about $13 million and weakening FX impacting income by over $8 million negatively impacted pre-tax income by over $21 million. The remaining about $54 million in lower pre-tax income is driven by the reduction in mortgage revenue with high variable margins. Some other factors impacting overall 2022 EBITDA margins in our July guidance relative to April guidance include an increased spending on product technology and related marketing to continue to drive NPI. International stronger-than-expected revenue growth includes strong growth in debt management, which has somewhat lower margins and, therefore, puts margin pressure on international and lower overall variable compensation benefits margins. As I just referenced, we are continuing our investments in new product development and related marketing and sales and our data and technology cloud transformation as these are the levers driving our over 10% new product Vitality index and improved cost structure in 2023 and beyond. We will continue to tightly manage spend outside these critical growth areas. Slide 20 provides the specifics on our 2022 full-year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S. mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS. EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of around 15% as strong non-mortgage growth expected to be over 40% is partially offset by the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 53%, slightly lower than 2021. USIS revenue is expected to be down 8.5%, reflecting the greater than 37% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. B2B non-mortgage revenue is expected to be slightly below or at the low end of our long-term framework for USIS of 6% to 8%, reflecting the decline in B2B offline discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 37%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. International continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of about 10%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be about 27%. International EBITDA margins are negatively impacted by product mix as our debt management business, which is growing strongly in 2022 as somewhat lower margins than our credit business. For the full year of 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in excess of $500 million. Slide 21 provides our guidance for 3Q 2022 and we expect revenue in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, reflecting revenue of about flat year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance, we're up just under 2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to full year 2022, in the third quarter, we are overcoming significant revenue growth headwinds of about 17% from both the decline in the U.S. mortgage market, which is impacting revenue growth by 15% and the normalization of the unemployment claims in the ERC businesses. Core organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis of 15% and above 4% revenue benefit from acquisitions are allowing us to overcome these headwinds and deliver constant currency growth in the quarter. 3Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to slightly down year-to-year. The flat EBITDA margins reflect the flat year-to-year revenue as well as execution of the planned cost reductions related to transformation, the benefit of which is being principally offset by year-to-year cost increases and the dilutive effect on near-term margins of the 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. This impact on margins will be eliminated with time as acquisition synergies drive these margins higher. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 of $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 3Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.85 per share. The decline in adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 year-to-year is driven by an over 15% per share negative impact on adjusted EPS of items below operating income, specifically interest expense, lost other income, principally from our Russia JV and a lower tax rate in 3Q 2021 related to specific discrete items. Adjusting for these items and the negative impact of FX as well as the increased depreciation we are incurring related to tech transformation, adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance would be about flat to 3Q 2021 and consistent with flat revenue. We believe both our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks John. Turning to slide 20 -- 22, the new Equifax is a much different business today than we were in the last recession. We're more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth. During the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency we expect from the data analytics business. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, Workforce Solutions revenue grew throughout the period and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009 from TWN record additions and their other growth levers, which drove higher verification rates and strong unemployment revenue growth from the growing unemployment levels in 2009. We believe that Equifax business mix is much better positioned for a potential economic event in the future than we were in 2009. Strong Workforce Solutions growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today with margins above 50%, about 20 percentage points higher than the Equifax average. EWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth, penetration into new fast-growing verticals like talent and government, system-to-system integrations, deploying new and higher-value products as well as the measured price actions, taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database. Second, completion of the Equifax Cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond, we expect we'll drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from 2022 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven by our execution. And third, we're leveraging the cloud to accelerate new product development with a goal of 11% vitality index in 2022, which is over $500 million of annual incremental revenue -- new product revenue for Equifax. As a reminder, new products rolled out in 2021 and 2022 will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. To estimate the impact of a recession that we have on Equifax, we've assigned our lines of businesses into three categories: first, recession growth or recession resistant. These businesses have drivers that are not directly aligned with economic activity and recession, and we expect them to grow during a recession. The best examples of this are Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage identity and fraud and our government lines of businesses that we expect will continue to grow during an economic event from the uniqueness of the data, including TWN or from low interest rate environments that impact our mortgage business. Second is our countercyclical businesses that typically perform better during recession and the best example is our unemployment claims management business where we expect significant growth in Workforce Solutions from growing unemployment in the U.S. or some of our account management solutions. And third, recession impacted. These are businesses that are directly impacted by economic activity and contract in a recession, and they include auto, cards, P loans where both consumer activity declines or lender activity is contracted for risk containment reasons. We expect these business lines to be flat to negative revenue growth in recession. Today, we believe almost 60% of our global business is recession-resilient or countercyclical. This is a big change in a strong position compared to Equifax in the 2008 global financial crisis, where only about 40% of our businesses were either recession-resistant or countercyclical. The meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage identity and fraud since 2009, as well as the cloud transformation cost savings, position Equifax very well if there is an economic event recession in 2023 or beyond. As highlighted on slide 23, we remain laser-focused on executing our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX cloud for innovation and new products. EFX2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 60% of total revenue being delivered from the new AFX Cloud. And we've completed over 139,000 B2B migrations and over 10 million consumer migrations. Our international transformation is also progressing, and we continue to expect to principally complete the transition by geographic region as we move through 2023 and into 2024. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities and are confident that it will differentiate us commercially expanding our NPI capabilities, accelerating our topline growth and expand our margins from the growth in cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics company. Wrapping up on slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 7% overall growth and 19% core growth and a 13% vitality index, more than offsetting a 33% decline in the mortgage market. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient, on offense and investing for future growth. Our updated 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance reflects the impact of the expected accelerated decline in the U.S. mortgage market to a decline of over 46% in the second half of 2022, resulting in a mortgage market decline of over 30% for the year -- 37% for the year. Against this unprecedented mortgage market decline, Equifax will deliver constant currency revenue over 5% and deliver growth in adjusted EPS. More importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage growth of 16% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model today and in the future. EWS continues to deliver above market growth and it was our largest, fastest-growing and highest-margin business. Workforce Solutions above market, 34% revenue CAGR over the last three years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. New products leveraging the new Equifax cloud are also driving growth. Our 11% vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we are in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax cloud to drive innovation in new products. Our 11 bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong topline growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond. And then last, we're in the final chapters of completing our four-year $1.5 billion transformation to the cloud that will deliver topline growth and cost benefits in 2023 and beyond. Even in these uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax cloud, new products, data analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth. We continue to be confident in our long-term framework of 8% to 12% revenue growth, our goal of $7 billion of revenue in 2020 -- or by 2025. Our ability to expand our margins 500 basis points between 2022 and 2025 and 50 basis points per year of margin expansion longer term. We remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage market macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster-growing, higher-margin cloud-native data Analytics Company. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on the strength of non-mortgage Workforce Solutions businesses and kind of the sustainability of that business? And maybe if you could just comment specifically on the Talent Solutions side, just given all the announcements you're starting to see on hiring freezes or layoffs, et cetera. Do you anticipate any slowdown there?\nMark Begor: Yes. So it's a great question, Manav. As you know, we're investing heavily in the non -- one of our priorities is to invest heavily in workforce broadly because it's our fastest growing business. And -- as you pointed out, the non-mortgage businesses and workforce are really outperforming the underlying market and delivering substantial growth. And I'll touch on talent first, as you pointed out, a big TAM of $5 billion and our play there is to help digitize the background screeners using our data as we continue to expand our historical data, we can deliver real solutions there. And we haven't seen any impact from the hiring market. As you know, unemployment is still very low. There's still more jobs open. And there are people looking for them. And even in -- if that starts to slow down in the future, there's just so much penetration opportunity for us to really work to help digitize the background screening environment, both with our core work history. As you know, we have $570 million total record. So we have a digital resume on the average American worker that totals five jobs for each individual. So there's just a lot of data and growth opportunity there. And then we're also, as you know, adding data assets to go beyond just that work history and talent, whether it's education, medical credentialing data that we acquired with APRs Insights, of course, the incarceration data that's used in virtually every background screen. And we have a stated strategy to look for more partnerships or M&A to really strengthen the Talent hub. So I don't expect them to grow at the rate they have been over the last couple of years, which is very, very strong. But certainly, there will be a big growth driver going forward with double-digit growth in the future. Government, as you know, is another big non-mortgage vertical for Workforce Solutions. That's around social services, the $2 billion -- or a few trillion dollar government TAM is a big one. We have a lot of penetration opportunities there. Social services are only expanding. And it's really the same thing. We're able to deliver an instant decision to that government agency, either the federal, state or local level. And we're just seeing a lot of traction. They have the same labor issues, meaning they're looking for productivity in the centers where people come in to apply for social services. And we can deliver productivity with the instant decisioning. And of course, it also delivers that social service to that individual very quickly. And same thing the ability now to not only have that income and employment information that's used in really every social service is needs or income-based. But also adding to the incarceration data that we have. It's used in virtually all social service processes. Beyond talent and government, just touching quickly on kind of non-mortgage financial services, those are newer verticals for workforce with the data, whether it's in the card space where we're starting to get penetration to have the income and employment data, supplement the credit data in a card origination. Of course, auto, we've seen nice growth in sub-prime and moving into near prime and of course, it's used in P loans. And then just jumping outside of verifications and new employer services, as you know, we've been making acquisitions. We've done five acquisitions in the employer services space in the last two years to really build out the capabilities in those regulatory compliance services, whether it's unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit, ACA or health care. And of course, in the work opportunity tax credit and I-9 benefits like LawLogix that we announced this morning, that's a space that has a big $5 billion, $6 billion TAM in a more challenging economic environment. We expect more outsourcing by HR managers of those activities that we can perform more efficiently. So we see growth opportunities for that business, which is why we're investing in technology and the bolt-on M&A like a LawLogix. And of course, as you know, as we expand our capabilities and reach there with individual companies, we get more records. And of course, underlying the growth of workforce and, of course, non-mortgage is record growth, which was up a strong 22% in the quarter, and we still have a long runway to essentially double the size of our database when you include gig and pension income recipients. So there's a lot of opportunity there. So, lots of levers for non-mortgage in Workforce Solutions.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then maybe just to follow-up, like in terms of the M&A pipeline, a lot of these tuck-ins, I guess, it makes sense, but just given -- and maybe just some comments around what valuations in the private market look like and your advertising capacity from maybe larger deals than these tuck-insurance?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think as you know, we've tried to be very disciplined about our approach to M&A. We're very -- I use the term bolt-on. You can describe how big bolt-on is. Obviously, Appriss was a larger acquisition, Kount was a larger acquisition last year. But we see a lot of opportunity to deliver very high return bolt-on M&A that are highly accretive to our cost of capital. So it's you start with our kind of capital allocation, we see big opportunities to invest in the core of Equifax and we're doing that. And that's really through our cloud transformation, which we're in the final innings of completing. That was a big project and a big focus of Equifax. That will start tailing off our investment in that over the coming year or so as we complete the cloud. New products, we get very high return on. And then when you get into inorganic, we see an opportunity to continue to do bolt-on M&A that adds very positively, and we are very disciplined financially and looking for businesses that are growing faster than Equifax on the top line that are accretive to our margins and obviously deliver high returns. So those are the kind of M&A that we're doing and we've got a pipeline going forward of deals that we continue to look at that will really add value in the three areas that I talked about during my prepared comments of strengthening workforce, adding differentiated data and strengthening identity and fraud. And as you know, as we go into 2023, 2024, 2025, with our margin expansion accelerating in that 500 basis points to 39% in 2025, our free cash flow accelerates dramatically in the coming 12, 24, 36 months. And we'll continue to run the play of bolt-on M&A where it's appropriate, we'll look for acquisitions that might be at the larger end of bolt-on like an Appriss. But we'll be at a point in the near future where we're going to want to return cash to shareholders. And we've been very clear that when that time comes, that will be a part of our capital allocation strategy as our free cash flow accelerates as we get into 2023, 2024, 2025\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, John, it's Andrew. I wanted to check if that 24.7% mortgage revenue figure you gave on the call was for total revenues in the second quarter. And then also, my second question is, again, on a total company basis, what was Equifax's second quarter organic constant currency, non-mortgage revenue growth year-over-year?\nJohn Gamble: So, 24.7% was on total Equifax revenue. And then I don't believe we gave an organic revenue growth for the entire company non-mortgage. So--\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. But you gave all the segments, can't you total it out for us?\nJohn Gamble: We can certainly follow up with you, Andrew. Trevor or Sam come back to you on that.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thanks. Next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nMark Begor: Hey, Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Hi, Mark. Hi, John. You know towards kind of project, but any sense of kind of the near-term outlook for mortgage 2022 to 2023. And the reason I ask is obviously, it seems like unprecedented declines, but we're in a much stronger macro environment than we were back in the GFC. Is there any way to frame, do you think you see continued refi kind of cash outs more near-term on the purchase side, just as you think about mortgage within kind of the context of formal recovery given kind of where we are from kind of -- it feels like we're bottoming here.\nMark Begor: Yes, I think bottoming is probably in the second half based on our forecast, Kevin, as you know. But it's very hard to really predict what's going to happen with the economy given the inflation rates that we haven't seen and really our lifetimes and what the Fed is going to do to respond to it. Yes, I would make a couple of comments on mortgage, which you know. Look, the mortgage market doesn't disappear, right? There's a core mortgage market that in any economic environment stays there, meaning people move and buy houses. People upgrade and buy houses on the purchase market. And as you know, there's more people still looking for houses in the United States today than there are houses. So there's still quite a bit of demand on the purchase side. So we expect there to be -- is there is any economic environment, a continued purchase market, and John gave some views about how we think about that in the second half. As you point out on the refi side, the interest rate refis are going to be lower or less of those in the second half given where interest rates are because there aren't many opportunities for homeowners to do an interest rate refi but there's a ton of untapped equity in homes in the United States. Over the past 24-plus months, home price appreciation is up almost 30%. And there's about $27 trillion of untapped home equity. And we've seen in economic environments in the past, that homeowners will tap into that equity. If you think about a 5.5% fixed rate mortgage in order to refi into that to access your home equity, which consumers are doing or homeowners are doing. We expect that to continue. And if you think about 5.5% interest rate on fixed rate mortgage, that's a heck of a lot less than an auto loan, a student loan or a credit card. And that's what you'll see consumers do. So it'll be a level cash-out refis going forward. And I know you get that. I think the challenging part is what's going to happen, how far is the Fed going to have to go to slow down inflation with it at 9.1%. So that's a harder part for us to forecast. We did talk about in our prepared comments that we remain confident in, obviously, the long-term future of Equifax. Our goal of $7 billion by 2025 hasn't changed our goal to expand our margins to 39% by 2025 hasn't changed. And we're still investing in the future of Equifax. As we speak, we're making investments that will benefit 2023, 2024, 2025 based on our strong performance, particularly in non-mortgage, which is exceptionally strong.\nKevin McVeigh: And actually, that's what I want to follow-up, because it seems like you're still comfortable with those 2025 targets. It's probably mortgage a little bit lighter. Where's been kind of the offset? Is it within EWS or other parts of the business that continue to give you the confidence to push towards those 2025 targets?\nMark Begor: Yes, it's certainly, I think, as you know, we raised our non-mortgage or core guidance twice this year, one in February and once in April, that gives us confidence. It should give you confidence. And if you look at our non-mortgage performance and our core growth performance, which includes how we're performing beyond the mortgage market, those are strong numbers. And those give us confidence in our ability. And then if you add to it, during that 2023 to 2024 time frame. In the next 12 months, we're going to be completing substantially the U.S. cloud migration, so we'll be cloud native, and we can take full advantage of that. We'll finish international as we get through 2023 and into 2024. That's another lift for Workforce Solutions. The other thing that should give you confidence and gives us confidence is the M&A that we've done over the last 18 months. We've done 11 acquisitions now with LawLogix. Those are in our run rate revenue or will be. And, of course, the synergies from those acquisitions that we had in our acquisition cases really kick in, in 2023, 2024, 2025, as they really get integrated into our businesses. And then the last point I'd make that gives us confidence is NPIs. The Vitality index that we're delivering, as you know, our long-term frame on Vitality is10, we were 13% in the quarter, we're expecting to be north of 11% for the year. Those are big numbers when you talk about having $550 million of revenue in 2022 from new products. And remember, new products we introduced in 2022 really benefit 2023, 2024, 2025. They mature as we get into those years. So there's a lot of levers that give us confidence around the future of Equifax.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. First, I wanted to ask about the mortgage performance. So last quarter, you talked about EWS outperforming the mortgage market by about 30 points in the year. And for the quarter, last quarter it was about $27 million points above the market. This quarter looks a little bit more like you outperformed by 20 points according to slide 10. So, are you still expecting the 30? Or has something changed to bring that down a little bit? And what are sort of the drivers that lead to that outperformance delta, like why would it jump around, I guess?\nJohn Gamble: Sure. And so I think last quarter, what we indicated, we were up 27% and we thought for the full year, we could deliver something south of 30%. But I think the 20 points is very strong, right? And what drives the outperformance in general is the new products, the price actions, the record additions, and all of those activities at Workforce Solutions is executing extremely well, actually executing faster than planned. The record additions, as Mark already covered, were well faster than planned as we're up to 144 million records. They're all volume dependent, right? So, when we get into hit into circumstances where we see the current year volumes decline substantially. It makes it more difficult to outperform the prior year market because of the lower volumes. So that's all it really is in terms of the drivers that will allow them to outperform the market over the long-term, they're actually outperforming the expectations we had when we started the year. So, we feel very good about how they're performing. We think given the much lower level of mortgage inquiries we're talking about, of mortgage originations we're talking about in the second half, if they're able to outperform at about 20 or I think we just said somewhat under 20% that, that will be very, very strong and consistent with the execution against product price records, system integrations that we've been talking about.\nToni Kaplan: Great. In the guidance, it seems like the main delta on the revenue side is really mortgage, you're expecting essentially the non-mortgage expectations outside of FX, largely on change versus your guidance last quarter. Just if we look forward, if there is a recession or a tougher environment that comes up, just maybe talk about some of the expense levers that you can pull and how you think about when to pull the trigger on that versus continued investment in the business, because obviously, you have a lot of really strong growth opportunities that you want to capitalize on. So, maybe just how are you thinking about downturn playbook and when you would pull the trigger?\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a great question, Tony. This is Mark. First off, we don't see that in the second half. You may have a different point of view, but we don't see that in the second half. But to be clear, we think about it a lot, obviously, and we do have levers. First off, we think we're going to outperform the way we did in the past, if there was an economic event. We had a page in how we talked about it in the investor deck, and we talked with you about it before. The difference in the business and levers like continuing to add records at Workforce Solutions and so many other levers in workforce, in particular, identity and fraud business. So, we think about that. But we clearly have the ability to throttle cost if we got into an economic event. In 2022, while we're seeing the pressure from the mortgage market macro and it's also FX revenue, we made the decision to continue to invest, which is I think you want us to do and our investors do, because our core business or non-mortgage business, which is a big part of Equifax is performing exceptionally well, and we want to keep driving that. So, investing in things like new products, investing in completing the cloud transformation, which, of course, that will take a lot of our cost out as we get into 2022 -- I'm sorry, 2023, 2024, 2025, we get significant margin expansion or cost reductions as we complete the cloud and decommission a lot of our data centers. That's kind of a natural recession hedge for us as we execute the cloud transformation. But we've got other cost levers that we could or would pull, and we'll be ready to do that if there is an economic event. But at the same time, we have a lot of confidence in how we would perform in an economic event, you know, because of the changing -- dramatically changing nature of Equifax. Would you add anything John?\nJohn Gamble: No, I just think outside of the investments Mark already talked about in NPI and transformation is kind of the product, technology and then marketing -- product marketing investments we're making. We certainly are looking at all the other expenses, and we're just going to manage those very tightly, right? So even though we don't expect a recession to come at this point in time, so not in the second half of this year, obviously, uncertain about 2023. What we are going to do is make sure we manage very tightly all of the expenses that don't drive that revenue growth.\nOperator: Thanks. Next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. So Mark, thanks for providing the details around the financial marketing services business. I was just wanted to drill down further on the fraud and identity piece, and see you talked about new product innovations there, which could reaccelerate growth maybe next year. So I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on that front or maybe also talk about the pipeline for new deals, particularly on the offline side? And how should we think about those momentum going into the back half but also in 2023 and beyond? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. So we've talked about -- we're obviously doing some work to get some new products positioned in the second half of this year to bring the FMS portfolio review business back into a different position. That's clearly a place that we're investing in. I think part of your question was also around broader identity and fraud, which is a different business for us. That's really under the account business, which we're very pleased with. That's a business that performed exceptionally well in the quarter and the half. We see big potential in just a massive TAM around the broader identity in fraud. And of course, as you know, we bought count 18 months ago, and we're still integrating that inside of Equifax and rolling out new solutions. And that's an area that we're investing in new products for both the e-commerce space, but also for our traditional financial customers, and also looking for inorganic or M&A to continue to expand. That's one of our three priorities around M&A is to grow in identity and fraud. And in B2B offline specifically kind of the fraud header business I think some of the real opportunities we have as we get into 2023 is heavily around data fabric, right? As we're able to more aggressively integrate different data assets. Again, it will differentiate our information or header information that we sell into those markets, and we think we have the opportunity to reaccelerate that growth again. But that will happen as Data Fabric completes for USIS.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And then going back to slide nine and drilling down further on the questions that were asked on the talent and government side. The penetration there is pretty low on talent, just 10% on the government, it's 20%. You talked about some new state wins there, but just can you talk about again, the pipeline, both on the talent and government side? And how do you drive better penetration in both of those markets? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. As you know, these are -- I still call the newer verticals for us in Workforce Solutions, both talent and government. They're big TAMs. Talent is a $5 billion data TAM for us. Government is about $2 billion. We've got big teams in Workforce Solutions focused on that. As we've made -- as you know, some M&A additions to strengthen our capabilities there. We want to do more. That's an area where we want to expand either M&A or partnerships, M&A being like Appriss Insights. Where we got the incarceration and medical credentialing data that's really helping us in both government and talent. The partnership we have with Nestor doing Clearinghouse, where we're bringing education data and we'd like you to do more partnerships or more M&A there. The other really lever for us in talent and government is new products is really bringing new solutions together, combining data elements we have in Workforce. And of course, at the heart of our growth in both of those verticals is our twin data set. Both our 144 million active records or 110 million active individuals in our data set, which is a huge coverage now. And as you know, when we add records, our hit rates go up because remember, in our system-to-system integrations whether it's talent or government or other verticals, they're hitting our database for every applicant or individual that they're trying to process, whether it's a mortgage or a background screen or a social service like rent support or unemployment claims, as we grow our records, that grows the business. And then leveraging our historical data, we just got so much historical data of the 570 million total records which equates to about five and a half jobs for the average American. That's a very valuable instant decisioning data set for the talent space. So, a combination of new products, continuing to grow out our twin record database and continuing to do M&A and having our dedicated teams of growing customers. There's still a lot of customers that don't use our data in government social services and in talent, so that's another opportunity. So, we're pretty energized about the growth potentials in those two verticals.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to touch on inflation. Obviously, it's the highest we've seen in quite some time. Where are you guys kind of seeing it in the cost side of your business? And how much have you guys been able to successfully pass along to clients?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So, I share your concern, when I think about the 9.1% inflation or 9.4% in the U.K. or pick your market, when I spend more of my time thinking about is what's the impact going to be on the consumer, on our customers. With regards to our cost structure, it hasn't had much of an impact. We haven't seen a big impact in labor. We're still able to attract the people we want inside of -- with some slight pressure on wage rates, but we're still managing that. A big part of our cost structure, as you know, is technology and we're really heading more towards cost savings there as we convert from our legacy infrastructure to the cloud, and we've got long-term contracts in our cloud infrastructure. And with regards to passing it on, price versus inflation were to net positive. We put pricing increases in place earlier this year that give us a net positive margin impact versus inflation is that even with inflation where it is today.\nKyle Peterson: Understood, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, particularly in the unemployment verification, claims part of the EWS business. How should we think about the puts and takes, I know you guys said you weren't currently expecting a recession, but if we do had a new recession, how much of a potential tailwind could that be in a more garden-variety recession, not with unemployment kind of where it was in 2020, but just a little more run of the mill would be helpful.\nMark Begor: Yes. It's obviously a positive for us. That business is a lot bigger today than it was in 2008, 2009, obviously, we've got a lot more scale. We're expanding the business with a lot of the investments in people and technology and capabilities as well as the M&A that we've done. So, it will clearly be a tailwind. Obviously, it's a headwind right now coming off 2020 and 2021 when there was a lot of furloughs and layoffs during the COVID environment. I know, John, would you size it in any way.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. Just to give you a perspective, this year, it's a $135 million business, right? So -- and I think during the COVID recession, it increased obviously dramatically. But -- and it basically scales directly with unemployment insurance activity. So it's about $135 million. So, whatever -- however -- as you look at the level of unemployment that could come in a recession, it will scale pretty directly with that.\nMark Begor: And that's just one of -- as you know, that's one of many kind of countercyclical businesses. Another -- if you're focused on countercyclical, the other one is inside of our credit business, while prescreens will go down, account management and portfolio management activity goes up in an economic event. Now, we're not seeing that today, because it's -- there isn\u2019t really an economic event yet, but that's a countercyclical element for our core credit businesses. And, of course, we got all kinds of levers in Workforce Solutions. We're going to keep adding records whether the economy is up down or sideways.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning, guys. Appreciate taking the time. Mark, I wanted to ask you a question about the twin database and sort of line of sight to getting to 2x current records. Do you think you can get there with your current payroll agreements? Do you need to add more? And I know you mentioned they're exclusive today. Can you talk about your comfort with those remaining exclusive sort of in the long run? And just any color in terms of trajectory there would be helpful.\nMark Begor: Yes. So, bunch of layers of questions in there. First, I think as you point out, it's a really attractive lever for growth and unique through this business, right? No other beta business that I know of has the ability to add records the way Workforce has been able to do. And, of course, it translates into revenue day one, quarter one, week one, the minute we add them, because remember, we're -- as we're integrated or even through web access, customers are coming to our data set, looking for all of their applicants. And as we grow our hit rates, it really drives the revenue. And revenue -- the records were up 22% in the quarter. We've had very strong double-digit growth for the last three years of growing the data set. And now have 144 million actives and 110 million uniques, which is really powerful in the scale of the data set. Not only is it driving revenue, but it also drives usage, meaning it's a data set that's more valuable. And remember, you think about it, our customers want 100% coverage, because the consumers that they can't identify in our data set, they got to go somewhere else to do a manual verification or do something else that slows down their process. So as we add records to our data set, we become more valuable to them. So, as you know, 50% of our records come from partnerships, 50% come from direct relationships that we have through our employer services business, and we want to grow both. On Employer Services, as you know, we've been making acquisitions. We've done five acquisitions in the last two years to strengthen our capabilities in Employer Services, whether it's in I-9, unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit. And that's a kind of a $6 billion TAM, and we've got a $400 million-plus business. And the power of that is, not only we're growing our -- the outsourcing there. But when we get the contracts for I-9 or unemployment claims or work opportunity tax credits, we also got records. So growing record there is a big lever. The other 50% come from partnerships, so payroll processors. And what I'm referring to is really mostly W-2 or non-farm payroll income, which is the 160 million individuals in the United States versus the 110 million we have today. The newer markets for us are gig, which is $30 million to $40 million and pensioners, which is another $20 million to $30 million. So, if you think about the $110 million, there's about 220 million Americans that have some form of income. That's what we want to grow the database to, and that's going to take time.  If you think about going from $110 million to $220 million, that may take a decade, but there's such a runway for growth. And we now have dedicated teams on the pension side. And we expect the onboarding records, obviously, from -- those aren't typically with payroll processors, there are other entities that are processing those, whether it's a benefits administrator or individual companies. And then the gig records, those are all records we want to add as we go forward.  I think your last question was around our partnership. The last part of your question was around your -- question was around our partnerships and exclusivity. As I said, the vast majority of our partnerships are exclusive. All the relationships we signed in the last four-plus years have been exclusive and all the relationships we intend to sign going forward as well as extend it's our intention for them to be exclusive. We think that's good for us and good for our partners going forward.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Super comprehensive answer. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thanks. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thank you. Good morning. I think different answers have touched on this already, but I want to ask a little bit more directly about kind of the health of the U.S. consumer and what you're hearing from customers on the core credit side? Are you seeing any signs of weakness across the USIS business as it relates to core credit? Guidance doesn't seem to imply any slowdown there. So, if you could just kind of talk about what gives you confidence in that part of the outlook and the overall state of the economy? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes. And to be clear, we're not. The U.S. consumer from our perspective is strong. I think you've heard it from the banks over the last week or so, as they talk about their performance. There's no sign. It really goes -- it starts with employment. People are working and there's two open jobs for every person looking for a job, which we've never seen in -- really our environment. You've seen strong wage growth, which is a positive, but it starts with people are working, that's a big deal. There's still a lot of stimulus around, meaning consumers are still spending some of the stimulus they saved over the COVID environment, but there's still access to a lot of stimulus or social services support in the United States, which is benefiting consumers. So, that's a positive. Obviously, inflation is having an impact on confidence having an impact on some spending and having an impact in some of the lower subprime or lower income consumers is having a bigger impact there. But kind of broadly, we don't see the consumer weakening in the second half. We haven't seen our customers thinking about it that way. There obviously -- everyone is watching, but you haven't really seen a change in delinquencies, like card delinquencies are lower than they were in 2019. There's a little uptick in subprime, auto delinquencies, but the consumer is strong and it starts with their working and then add to it, those that are homeowners have a bunch of equity in their home, plus 20%, 25%, 30% versus a couple of years ago, it's untapped. So, those are all equations that are quite positive around the consumer, which is going to make in my view, taming inflation quite challenging because consumers are still out there spending. You've seen the banks kind of credit card spends are up strong double-digits. Consumers are traveling. They're still spending, maybe not a big ticket transactions, but they're still pretty strong and we haven't seen any signs of a changing.\nJohn Gamble: Other thing which has happened since 2019 is that the percentage of consumers that are actually defined as subprime is just down materially, right? So it's down on the order of 20% of consumers and was much higher back in 2019, and that's just the strengthening of credit scores you've seen. So that's very material for people's access to credit.\nMark Begor: Well, credit scores were up 15 to 20 points since 2019 still. So a lot of factors supporting the consumer.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then switching gears a bit for my follow-up. Mark, I think you alluded to growing the work number internationally as part of the three-year 2025 outlook. I understand in the past, you've talked about your right to win there and your relationships with the global organization as being a differentiator. But just kind of curious, do you speak to kind of go-to-market strategy there? Is there any difference in these international markets than what you've developed here through payroll providers and outsourced kind of HR capabilities? Or are there differences in those markets that we should kind of keep in mind that make that go-to-market strategy a bit different abroad?\nMark Begor: No, it's very similar. And we could spend hours talking about all the things we're working on. And obviously, expanding workforce internationally is one of the initiatives that Rudy and his team has. As you know, we're in four markets now. We added U.K. in the first quarter. We paused during our cloud transformation to go in other markets we're in Australia, Canada U.K. and India. We paused a couple of years ago when we were doing the cloud transformation, but now that we have a tech stack that we've invested a couple of hundred million dollars in, it makes it easy to enter new markets from a technical standpoint. So that's an approach that we have and why we kind of made our first move into the U.K. following our cloud transformation at Workforce Solutions. The market dynamics are very similar. Mortgage is a place where you want to use it, and you think about the markets we're in, they have mortgage markets, consumer mortgage markets. So, that would be a priority for us when we think about future markets -- and then the talent side is another one, using the data for the hiring process is similar. And as you point out, we have some levers with our current multinationals in the U.S. where we're collecting their records from them directly or through partnerships. But the direct relationships, they want us to do income and employment verification for them in other markets. So that's a positive. And then as you also point out, the payroll processors we do business with today in the U.S., many of them are global, so they want to do this have the same relationship outside the United States. And then in individual markets, there's payroll processors or HR software companies that are unique to so many markets, and we're developing partnerships with them. So it's clearly a part of our strategy. We've got a lot of needle movers in Workforce Solutions between now and 2025. This will be one of the smaller ones, but it's one that we're investing in. I think you'll see more traction out of it, perhaps in 2024, 2025, 2026 than you will see in 2023, 2024, but as you would expect us to do, we're investing in it. And we think we've got a franchise that obviously is -- has a strong market position here in the states, and it's one that we want to take global and take advantage of it because there really aren't other players like workforce outside the United States.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can you dig in a little bit more on what's going on with FMS and the offline? And you said it's like the part where you're doing with fraud and header data, I'm just not clear as to what all of a sudden changed in that business? Is there something competitively that changed in where maybe one of the other bureaus are doing better over there? Or is there anything else happening? And typically, in a certain point in the cycle, you guys would see a pickup in some of the FMS business as well in terms of portfolio reviews. And I want to know, are they starting to pick up because banks are worried about that, but you're not getting them or they're just not happening?\nMark Begor: Yes. The portfolio reviews are a constant part of the business. But as you point out, in times of economic challenges, that typically, we see some real pick up there. That hasn't happened yet. The financial institutions really don't view the second half of being economically challenged. It's more in the newspaper than it is in the consumer or their results. I don't know if you want to touch on the header business again?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. I think Mark covered, Shlomo, really what what's going on with the fraud or header business within FMS, right? We're just -- we are seeing lower volumes, and we're seeing lower levels of activity. And for transactions that are occurring, we're looking for seeing smaller volume transactions. So -- what we're doing is what we talked about, which is working to try to enrich our data sets so that we can, again, make it more valuable to drive greater differentiation in that market. But we're just seeing -- we're seeing that market slow currently. And given that it has, we've just made the assumption that's going to stay slow for the rest of the year. And as we launch new products, we'll talk to you about them as we do with anything with NPI, and we can give you a perspective on how we think that product area may grow.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thanks. Just for the follow-up. The other part of the business that you would start to see slowing down would be the background screening area. And you seeing anything that's indicating that given the layoffs and stuff that you're hearing from some of the bigger technology companies that the polls are really starting to slow or significantly changing?\nMark Begor: No, we're not. And remember, when you think about our business, is obviously different than the background screening industry because we're so new in kind of dealing with the industry. We have so much penetration opportunity. It's our view that even if the market slows, our ability to digitize and help background screeners digitize their businesses will mitigate if you will, or offset some of that is an add to new products that we'll be rolling out for the background screeners that include other data elements. So when an economic event happens, and there is some slowdown there, we think we'll be able to offset that with some of the new products as well as penetration because we're fairly new. Remember the TAM for that the talent and background screeners is about 4 billion.  And our business is a couple of $100 million. So we've got the opportunity to continue to grow into the data elements of that even in an economic event.\nOperator: Thanks. Your next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit further about how you think your verification service business will do if we go into an elongated recession here? You guys adding more and more records here, a significant part of your business, how do you think it will do in longer recession?\nMark Begor: Yes, I think we've been pretty clear. We think it will do pretty well. As we pointed out in the comments and in prior calls, you go back to 2008, 2009, which was a pretty brutal economic event, the toughest, I think we've seen in our lifetimes. It grew through that whole period. I think in 2008, it grew 17% or something like that. And now it's got more levers. Remember, back then, it was mostly a mortgage business. And now it's highly diversified in other verticals, government, talent, it's employer services business and then non-mortgage verticals inside of financial services. And the ability to add records is one of many levers that the business has that we think is what makes Equifax so different today versus our last economic event, if you want to call, 2008, 2009. Our ability to grow is significantly enhanced by workforce being such a big part of Equifax and having so many different levers that are either unaffected by a recession or allow them to actually benefit from a recession like the unemployment claims business.\nCraig Huber: And then also the 50% or so of records you get from outside the partnerships, you talk about the pitch there that you used to get those records of companies, et cetera. And then also if could you just also touch on the historical records that you've built up in your database, which I believe in total is like 25%, 30% of your revenues that you get is for a historical records, not the current person's employment?\nMark Begor: Yes. So, first on the direct records that we have. Remember, it's the core of Workforce Solutions is what we call our Employer Services or Employer Solutions business. And that's where we deliver regulatory and compliance services to companies through their HR managers, and that's where they outsource these activities to Equifax. And that's about a $6 billion TAM. We have about a $400 million business there. And where we deliver those services like unemployment claims management for a company, we do the processing for them. I-9 verification in the onboarding side, work opportunity tax credit, employee retention tax credit. We do W-2 management for employees, meaning if someone needs a W-2, we will deliver it for them. So all those services that are outsourced by an HR manager is what we do as a business. And as you know, as I pointed out earlier, we've invested heavily in our cloud transformation to make those services and capabilities more efficient, more effective and just a better service for the HR manager. So the play there is to continue through our commercial coverage is to drive more outsourcing of those activities to Equifax. And for example, like in unemployment claims, we process either one in four or one in five unemployment claims in the United States that are done by third parties, meaning not individual companies. Most companies still do it today. So we have real scale in these businesses. And then as a part of that commercial relationship where we're delivering these regulatory services to the HR manager in a company, we also do income and employment verification for free. And they will deliver their payroll records to us. But then of course, we monetize. In return, we'll do income and employment verification securely. We'll do it with a high degree of privacy. And it allows the HR manager to outsource that activity to us, because if we're not doing it for them, they have a call center inside of their HR shop where they're doing it. And they are fielding calls from mortgage originators, auto lenders, background screeners, government agencies to verify income and employment on their employees. So we do that all for free. So, a very powerful value prop that we have for the HR manager, which is why we've developed a bunch of relationships. And that's why we're also expanding through M&A. And like LawLogix, a company that we announced this morning that we're acquiring strengthens us in the I-9 verification space and delivers records. So, those are the five or six acquisitions we've done in the last 24 months to strengthen our employer services business. It's really at the at the core of who Workforce Solutions is. So we want to continue to invest in technology and capabilities and bolt-on M&A to strengthen that because not only do we have a very attractive business growing in that $6 billion TAM, it also delivers records we can monetize very effectively. The second half of your question was around our historical records you're right on. It's a very big part of our business model. A lot of our verifications are around where does Mark work today, how much do you make today. But a lot of the verifications that one that needed and want to have historical data in order to complete the process and as you point out, we keep every record every week, every pay period. And we're now up to $570 million records, which as I mentioned earlier, equates to about 5.5 jobs from a job history status on the average American. In my case, it would be my Equifax records by Warbringers records and my GE records. So we have those historical records, and they are incredibly valuable. And it's a big part of the competitive position or moat, we have around the business is those historical records are a big part of that because the only way you can develop those is over time. And of course, we've been at this for a decade of building out the data set and maintaining all those records.\nJohn Gamble: And importantly, in nonmortgage verification services businesses, about 50% of the revenue is generated from transactions that involve a historical record, either historical records only or historical records and current record. So it's 50% penetration of historical records in the transaction. So very, very high and huge differentiation.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live.\nMark Begor: Hey Simon.\nSimon Clinch: Hi. How are everyone? Thanks for taking my call -- my question here. I just wanted to cycle back to the comments you made about the outgrowth of the mortgage in EWS. And I was just wondering, in terms of how to think about the core growth generally that you outlined for Equifax overall. Historically, my understanding was that we should think of that as effectively a static opportunity versus the market that each of those segments play in. But it sounds like, we comments around EWS here that actually, they should be considered to be some level of beta, I guess, to the macro to the six [indiscernible] markets. Is that how we should think about things going forward?\nMark Begor: Well, as John pointed out, we can hit it again, is that in the mortgage application process, there's a difference in this market than there is in a normal market. John pointed out that there's more consumers or homeowners that are -- when they're doing a home purchase that are doing shopping for rates. And generally, when a consumer does rate shopping, a credit file will be pulled by the mortgage originator and make sure that consumer can qualify for the mortgage that they're re-shopping on, and then they'll deliver some kind of a response around what rate they can deliver. And the consumer will hit a bunch of mortgage companies in this higher rate environment in order to check rates. And that results in credit holes, which is good for USIS and part of their outperformance, if you will, of the number of poles that they have. Conversely in workforce when you're rate shopping, they don't pull income and employment until further into the application process. It might be when an application is actually filed versus rate shopping. And of course, it's always pulled during the closing of the application. I think John was pointing out a change from a more normal mortgage environment because of rate shopping benefits the credit file and somewhat doesn't benefit the income and employment data. Now of course, Workforce Solutions has all the levers to perform the mortgage market, it starts with as we add more records, we have higher hit rates. So they get more revenue as they add records and records are up 22%. So that's a benefit for them. In any mortgage environment that's still benefiting them today. New products are benefiting them, fuel prices. We did a price increase in January. So that's benefiting their business penetration is still a benefit. Remember, they're only seeing what now, 65% of mortgages, a little over 60% a little over 60% of mortgages. So as they get out there and remember the credit file is used in virtually every mortgage, because it's been around for 50, 60, 70 years, so the ability to drive commercially into those mortgage originators that are not using in our income and employment data from Workforce Solutions. And then as we point out, system-to-system integrations, which have grown dramatically, but there's still a lot of web access. And we know that with web access, we don't get every application from mortgage originators. They're doing manual verification. So you've got multiple levers for workforce to continue to outperform the mortgage market, be it at a bit lower level than in a normal environment.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. Yes. I understand that. And then just when I'm thinking about the entries to the up and the down here. Is it -- would it be fair for me to take the how you've reduced your guidance for revenues and the subsequent flow through to EBITDA. Like if there was mortgage upside, should I expect that same high-level of incremental margin drop through.\nMark Begor: Yes. Any change in revenue is high incremental margin up or down? And I think as we pointed out earlier, we've opted to continue to invest in the second half for the future of Equifax. So meaning, as our mortgage revenue came down, we're not taking costs out. We're focusing on redeploying some costs or still continuing to invest going forward. I don't know, John, would you add to that? We see very high variable margins on the upside and the downside. They aren't necessarily always exactly the same for the reasons that Mark indicated, but the variable margins on our revenues are certainly quite high.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now live.\nSeth Weber: Everybody good morning and thanks for taking my question. I actually had a similar question on the margin side. I heard the comments about some increased spending as for the second quarter and through the back half of the year. I was just wondering if you could give us any additional color on what this increased spending is, if that's opportunistic or -- is this kind of the new normal sort of framework that we should be thinking about from a margin perspective? Thanks.\nMark Begor: A couple of layers in there. So we still are confident in our plan to increase our margins, so no change in our outlook for 2025 or 39%. No change in the cost benefits that we're going to deliver this year, next year, 2023 from the cloud transformation, no change in the broader margin expansion. In the near-term, we are continuing to invest in new products. Obviously, we're still investing in completing the cloud transformation. We have some additional investments on onboarding. Some of the new partnerships we have for records and Workforce Solutions. So we're continuing to do opportunistic or may be targeted as a better term investments that we think will benefit 2023, 2024, 2025 in 2022. And so there's no question we're doing that. Would you add to that, John?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, just current margins, and we talked about it on the call, right, are being significantly impacted by the large reduction in mortgage, right, and our very high variable margins. So if the question was, has this been the new level of your margins? No, as Mark just said, we expect our margins to reaccelerate as the market recovers. But in terms of the exact pace of that reacceleration, we'll give you guidance on that as we get into each individual year.\nSeth Weber: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, the guidance for international margin for the year implies a pretty big step-up in the second half versus the first half. Is there something there? Is it just seasonality? Is there something from lower tech transformation spending or something like that, that's happening in the second half versus the first in international? Thanks.\nJohn Gamble: So, historically, you've seen international margins are generally higher in the second half than the first. So we've seen some of that. But we try to be clear on the call that in terms of the level of acceleration in the margins in international. There is some pressure on that because of the fact we're seeing great growth in our debt management business, but that does have lower margins. So we do expect to see the improvement we talked about, but there is a little bit of pressure on those margins because of debt management.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nMark Begor: Hey Heather.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up on Toni's question earlier regarding outperformance on the mortgage side for EWS. I'm curious where the softer mortgage market, and it sounds like it's a little bit of a lighter outperformance outlook. Where that lightness is coming from, sort of what is the toggle, sort of, we grow mortgage market that flows through to that outperformance? Thanks.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So in terms of the drivers of outperformance, it's actually -- the Workforce is actually performing better than our expectations. They've added records faster than we thought. And so that's actually a greater benefit to our performance than we would have expected when we started the year, and they've executed very well on both new products, and then the pricing programs they put in place at the beginning of the year, which tend to go in, in January. So we know about all those, right? The issue -- the reason why the outperformance looks lower than what we saw last quarter is two-fold. One is because all of those factors I just described are all variable with volume. So since volume is declining, like that level of outperformance in absolute dollar shrinks. So that's why you see a smaller outperformance relative to the market because -- and it's just the math and the measurement. The other thing is what Mark talked about, right? We measure the mortgage market. We define it right, as USIS credit inquiries. While since USIS credit inquiries are benefited by shopping and Workforce Solutions isn't benefited by shopping to the same degree, then what we end up having is USIS gets somewhat of a benefit. And so, therefore, the market itself is measured as stronger and that provides a little bit of a greater headwind to outperformance to EWS. We don't think that's -- that in any way indicates they're not performing as well. They're performing extremely well. And as I said, the actual drivers they can control. They're actually outperforming our expectations in terms of record additions products and then obviously, good execution on price. And as Mark mentioned, they're also doing very, very well on system-to-system integration. So we feel very good about the execution that's occurring during the year.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. And as a follow-up, just given the strong price performance in the market and your expectation next year for a much stronger free cash flow and returning cash to investors, what are your thoughts regarding using your balance sheet today to potentially return cash versus waiting for next year? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a great question. We certainly think about it, Heather, but we think the timing is not right for us to do that. As you know, we announced this morning another bolt-on acquisition, which we think will benefit Equifax quite strongly going forward. And we're still digesting some of the M&A we did in 2021. So, it's certainly on our mind when the time is right to return cash to shareholders, both through restarting our dividend and doing a buyback, we don't think the time is right today. But it's coming. As we look to 2023, 2024, 2025 with our margins expanding and our free cash flow expanding, we clearly believe we have ample resources to invest in that bolt-on M&A, but also have excess cash in the future to return to shareholders, and we'll do that at the right time.\nHeather Balsky: Great. Thank you for the -- thanks.\nOperator: Thanks. Your next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Begor: Hey, George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the mortgage space, new purchase originations have been declining relatively sharply in recent months. What assumptions around new purchase oil. Are you inventing in your 46% plus mortgage volume decline forecast for the second half of this year? And how would you frame the downside risk to your forecast?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So in terms of the way we structure the forecast, we obviously look very closely at the current trends we're seeing. We obviously looked very closely at the last 14 days, right, when we're seeing in early July, and we saw we were down 40%. And we also look very closely at the trends we're seeing and the movements in increase between April, May and June. We think that the forecast that we put together or the estimate we used in our financial guidance is very consistent with what we're seeing in terms of movements in the mortgage market itself. We think it's very consistent with the information we shared on new home purchases and the fact that they're certainly weakening as we go through the year relative to what we've seen earlier in the year, we think it's consistent with that. We think it's also consistent with the very low levels of refinance that are currently occurring and really that refinances at this point, almost completely driven by cash out refi. Also, I think you saw last night that all three of the major parties that forecast mortgage originations refreshed their forecast yesterday evening, Freddie, Fannie and MBA. MBA came out and said they expect originations to be down in the neighborhood of 43.5% and I think all three indicated those origination units, sorry. And I think all three indicated that origination dollars will be down in the order of 46% in the second half. So, we feel like with us indicating you're going to see over 46% reduction in inquiries, which would imply a 200 to 300 basis points, so I think 48% to 50% decline in origination units. We think we've given a very reasonable forecast, we think it's consistent with other third party forecasters. And so, we feel like we've done a fairly good job at encompassing the information we have today. But obviously, to be fair, very hard to forecast the mortgage market and what we'll do is we'll just keep letting you know what we're seeing. And then any changes that we're seeing that that might drive in our output. But, right now, we feel like we've done a nice job of including all the information available, and we feel relatively good about the fact that the other parties have come out and look to be at or slightly stronger than us.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. Gross margins in the quarter fell 210 bps year-over-year. How much additional gross margin pressure do you expect with input cost inflation trends and changes in revenue mix?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, I think the big driver, obviously, for us, what's occurring right now is the impact of mortgage market overall, right? And our -- there really is any inflation impact, George, from our perspective in that margin. It's really the loss of that mortgage revenue is just a big impact on us. That's all.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. So I understand the argument that Equifax on a consolidated basis, including the recession resistance and countercyclical businesses is relatively resilient. I guess, I was surprised that you said that even in your recession-impacted businesses. Do you think they could potentially be flat at the high end of the range in a recession. So -- could you flesh out the argument behind that for us? I'm guessing the short answer is NPI and the other structural growth drivers in verifier. But help us understand how you could potentially be flat in those businesses in a recession?\nMark Begor: Yes, I'm not sure when I said that or John said that, Jeff, that we didn't intend to say that. So when we think about our view of Equifax today versus the last recession, we think we're much better positioned. It starts with Workforce being so much larger than it was before. And kind of broadly in Workforce as we point out in 2008, 2009, it grew 17% when Equifax was down 6% and it was a very small business in the scheme of Equifax, and it's got more levers today. So we think workforce is positioned to grow in a recession because of all those levers. So we're very clear on that. And with that being approaching 50% of Equifax, that's a big factor. We talked about identity and fraud being kind of a business that we expect to grow through a recession just because of the digital macro is benefiting there. There's a couple of businesses that are quite uniquely positive in a recession like our unemployment claims business, which is part of workforce. So those are kind of 60% of Equifax. And then the 40% as kind of the rest, which is our credit business is primarily international and USIS. And those are generally impacted negatively by a recession. Inside of that negative impact, I think I tried to say that the negative of prescreens and volume coming down and originations coming down is dampened somewhat not offset, but dampened somewhat by account management increasing by credit line actions and line management actions increasing. So there's more volume there. But we would expect those to have some pressure. Now you also got to think about the timing of the recession, as you point out, which is different in Equifax today than 2008, 2009, if you think a recession is going to be in 2023, for example, we've got unique levers we didn't have in 2008, 2009. We're in the throes of completing our cloud transformation. And the cost savings that come from that are not impacted by the recession. We're going to execute the cloud transformation, the benefits that 250 basis points is going to flow through. As you also point out, new products is a different game at Equifax today than it was in 2008 and 2009. The kind of focus, the resources and the vitality we're delivering, that's going to benefit us in a recession, having more solutions in market and being cloud native. So those are benefits. And then the fourth point I hit earlier in our comments was around M&A. The acquisitions we've made in the last 24 months, which, as you know, is well above historical trends, meaning we've done a bunch of M&A of 11 acquisitions, over $3 billion of TEV. Those are in our run rate revenue, but the synergies are kicking in the latter part of 2022, 2023, 2024. So that's going to be a positive for us as we think about the recession. So those are all the factors we put together. We haven't done a revenue, EBITDA, EPS forecast on a recession, but we've tried to share with you some of the factors we think about that are positive and negative, and there's a whole bunch more positives at Equifax certainly today than there was in the last economic event.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you.\nMark Begor: Those recession impact the businesses would decline, right? So, yes.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My first question, I just wanted to clarify on the margin impact of mortgages and product development costs. Are you able to size the incremental product development costs? Because it seems like your overall EPS guidance is a lot lower than I would have thought, just given the implied revenue decline from mortgages? So I'm curious on how big of an impact their incremental impact there is from product development costs? And are these new products something that you had planned to invest in, in 2023? And is that something that you're maybe pulling forward this year?\nJohn Gamble: So by far, the largest impact in the reduction in our adjusted EPS, we tried to walk through the drivers, right? But in terms of the margin piece, right, outside of interest and outside of the impact of FX, right? By far, the largest driver is obviously the reduction in mortgage and mortgage has very high variable profit, right? So, that's what's really driving the reduction in our margin dollars and, therefore, driving the reduction in our adjusted EPS. And yes, there is some incremental cost that we're investing going forward in as we invest going forward in new products, but that's not the driver. The driver is really the movement in mortgage, right? What we were trying to do is to give you a perspective on there's a substantial driver, and there are some other things that are impacting margins as well. We talked about investments in the development costs. We talked about some mix issues in international as we grow the debt management business. And we also talked about the fact that we had a little bit of a benefit because our variable compensation goes down. We're just trying to give you a perspective on the different side levers that are playing within a larger impact of the decline in the mortgage market.\nFaiza Alwy: Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then just as a follow-up, I'm curious if Experian talked about how their now Fannie Mae have certified them for day one certainty. And I'm curious how you think about that? Like is that relevant or important? Like, are there any consideration for your business at all?\nMark Begor: Sure. It's Mark here. We're aware that Experian is doing some work and investing around the income and employment space. We don't see them commercially yet, meaning that we haven't seen any impacts from their work that they've done. They've got a -- our understanding is a very small data set compared to our 144 million records or 110 million actives. And so we just haven't seen an impact. That said, it hasn't slowed us down in our investments in technology and products. And of course, in our M&A focus we're one of our priorities, one of our top priorities around M&A is to strengthen Workforce Solutions to ensure that we continue to build the moat and the competitive position around the business. And including the acquisition we announced this morning of LawLogix making that business stronger. So we're clearly focused on continuing to build out Workforce, which is our largest and fastest-growing business.\nJohn Gamble: In addition to Equifax, there have been multiple companies that have had day one certainty for several years.\nMark Begor: Yes, for one.\nJohn Gamble: So, this is not anything new.\nOperator: Thank you We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor for any further or closing remarks.\nTrevor Burns: No, I just want to say thanks for everybody for joining the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out and have a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on slide 16, our guidance now reflects an expectation that the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries will decline over 46% in the second half of 2022, a continued decline from the down 40% level we're seeing in early July. Our assumptions reflect mortgage originations, 200 basis points to 300 basis points weaker than those levels with the work number inquiries more closely linked to mortgage originations. The reduction in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries of over 46% in the second half is off the second half 2021 reduction over 20%. This level of U.S. mortgage credit inquiries in the second half is over 30% lower than the second half average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period. 1Q mortgage revenue was 29.5% of total Equifax revenues and 2Q mortgage revenue was 24.7% of total Equifax revenues. In 3Q, we expect mortgage to make up just over 21% of total Equifax revenues and about 23.5% in the full year of 2022. As we have shared in prior quarters, slide 17 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. The left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages. The in-the-money population is about 1.9 million homes and below the $3.3 million we saw in April. At the current level, mortgage refi activity is heavily driven by cash of refis that are often executed with no rate benefit or rate increase. For perspective, for the most recent available Black Knight data for May 2022, about 95% of re-financings were cash out. As shown on the right side of slide 17, the pace of existing home purchases continues at high levels, but were down about 7% in May and 14% in June from the levels we saw in 2021. We -- we believe our assumptions for U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries over the last six months of 2022 reflect the trends just discussed. The 46.5% year-to-year decline in mortgage credit increase reflects a continued sequential weakening of the mortgage market with third quarter increase down over 25% in the second quarter and fourth quarter down a further over 15% from these much reduced third quarter levels. The rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impact on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business. Slide 18 provides a walk detailing the drivers of the 5.2% constant currency and 3.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.1 billion. Revenue decline from the midpoint of our April guidance of $5.2 billion is driven by about two-thirds by the decline in the mortgage revenue, reflecting the expectation of a weaker U.S. Mortgage market with the remainder due to a greater negative impact from FX. The over 37% decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 12%, about 150 basis points more negative than the levels we discussed in April. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims in the ERC businesses that we discussed with you in April, total headwinds into 2022 revenue growth are about 13 percentage points. As Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be 17% and organic revenue growth to be at almost 15%, consistent with our April guidance. Both well above our long-term growth framework and reflecting outstanding growth and execution on new products. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is driving 11% of the core organic revenue growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. International and USIS non-mortgage are also expected to drive core growth. Slide 19 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 0.4% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.68 per share. The growth in revenue and expansion in EBITDA margins by about 25 basis points drives growth and EPS of about 8%. Higher depreciation and interest expense and the negative impact of weaker FX are principally offsetting this growth in adjusted EPS. The reduction of $0.47 or about $75 million in pre-tax income from the midpoint of the guidance we provided in April is at a high level driven by the following: higher interest expense of about $13 million and weakening FX impacting income by over $8 million negatively impacted pre-tax income by over $21 million. The remaining about $54 million in lower pre-tax income is driven by the reduction in mortgage revenue with high variable margins. Some other factors impacting overall 2022 EBITDA margins in our July guidance relative to April guidance include an increased spending on product technology and related marketing to continue to drive NPI. International stronger-than-expected revenue growth includes strong growth in debt management, which has somewhat lower margins and, therefore, puts margin pressure on international and lower overall variable compensation benefits margins. As I just referenced, we are continuing our investments in new product development and related marketing and sales and our data and technology cloud transformation as these are the levers driving our over 10% new product Vitality index and improved cost structure in 2023 and beyond. We will continue to tightly manage spend outside these critical growth areas. Slide 20 provides the specifics on our 2022 full-year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S. mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS. EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of around 15% as strong non-mortgage growth expected to be over 40% is partially offset by the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 53%, slightly lower than 2021. USIS revenue is expected to be down 8.5%, reflecting the greater than 37% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. B2B non-mortgage revenue is expected to be slightly below or at the low end of our long-term framework for USIS of 6% to 8%, reflecting the decline in B2B offline discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 37%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. International continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of about 10%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be about 27%. International EBITDA margins are negatively impacted by product mix as our debt management business, which is growing strongly in 2022 as somewhat lower margins than our credit business. For the full year of 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in excess of $500 million. Slide 21 provides our guidance for 3Q 2022 and we expect revenue in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, reflecting revenue of about flat year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance, we're up just under 2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to full year 2022, in the third quarter, we are overcoming significant revenue growth headwinds of about 17% from both the decline in the U.S. mortgage market, which is impacting revenue growth by 15% and the normalization of the unemployment claims in the ERC businesses. Core organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis of 15% and above 4% revenue benefit from acquisitions are allowing us to overcome these headwinds and deliver constant currency growth in the quarter. 3Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to slightly down year-to-year. The flat EBITDA margins reflect the flat year-to-year revenue as well as execution of the planned cost reductions related to transformation, the benefit of which is being principally offset by year-to-year cost increases and the dilutive effect on near-term margins of the 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. This impact on margins will be eliminated with time as acquisition synergies drive these margins higher. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 of $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 3Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.85 per share. The decline in adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 year-to-year is driven by an over 15% per share negative impact on adjusted EPS of items below operating income, specifically interest expense, lost other income, principally from our Russia JV and a lower tax rate in 3Q 2021 related to specific discrete items. Adjusting for these items and the negative impact of FX as well as the increased depreciation we are incurring related to tech transformation, adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance would be about flat to 3Q 2021 and consistent with flat revenue. We believe both our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. So, 24.7% was on total Equifax revenue. And then I don't believe we gave an organic revenue growth for the entire company non-mortgage. So-- We can certainly follow up with you, Andrew. Trevor or Sam come back to you on that. Sure. And so I think last quarter, what we indicated, we were up 27% and we thought for the full year, we could deliver something south of 30%. But I think the 20 points is very strong, right? And what drives the outperformance in general is the new products, the price actions, the record additions, and all of those activities at Workforce Solutions is executing extremely well, actually executing faster than planned. The record additions, as Mark already covered, were well faster than planned as we're up to 144 million records. They're all volume dependent, right? So, when we get into hit into circumstances where we see the current year volumes decline substantially. It makes it more difficult to outperform the prior year market because of the lower volumes. So that's all it really is in terms of the drivers that will allow them to outperform the market over the long-term, they're actually outperforming the expectations we had when we started the year. So, we feel very good about how they're performing. We think given the much lower level of mortgage inquiries we're talking about, of mortgage originations we're talking about in the second half, if they're able to outperform at about 20 or I think we just said somewhat under 20% that, that will be very, very strong and consistent with the execution against product price records, system integrations that we've been talking about. No, I just think outside of the investments Mark already talked about in NPI and transformation is kind of the product, technology and then marketing -- product marketing investments we're making. We certainly are looking at all the other expenses, and we're just going to manage those very tightly, right? So even though we don't expect a recession to come at this point in time, so not in the second half of this year, obviously, uncertain about 2023. What we are going to do is make sure we manage very tightly all of the expenses that don't drive that revenue growth. Yes. So, I share your concern, when I think about the 9.1% inflation or 9.4% in the U.K. or pick your market, when I spend more of my time thinking about is what's the impact going to be on the consumer, on our customers. With regards to our cost structure, it hasn't had much of an impact. We haven't seen a big impact in labor. We're still able to attract the people we want inside of -- with some slight pressure on wage rates, but we're still managing that. A big part of our cost structure, as you know, is technology and we're really heading more towards cost savings there as we convert from our legacy infrastructure to the cloud, and we've got long-term contracts in our cloud infrastructure. And with regards to passing it on, price versus inflation were to net positive. We put pricing increases in place earlier this year that give us a net positive margin impact versus inflation is that even with inflation where it is today. Yes. Just to give you a perspective, this year, it's a $135 million business, right? So -- and I think during the COVID recession, it increased obviously dramatically. But -- and it basically scales directly with unemployment insurance activity. So it's about $135 million. So, whatever -- however -- as you look at the level of unemployment that could come in a recession, it will scale pretty directly with that. Other thing which has happened since 2019 is that the percentage of consumers that are actually defined as subprime is just down materially, right? So it's down on the order of 20% of consumers and was much higher back in 2019, and that's just the strengthening of credit scores you've seen. So that's very material for people's access to credit. Yes. I think Mark covered, Shlomo, really what what's going on with the fraud or header business within FMS, right? We're just -- we are seeing lower volumes, and we're seeing lower levels of activity. And for transactions that are occurring, we're looking for seeing smaller volume transactions. So -- what we're doing is what we talked about, which is working to try to enrich our data sets so that we can, again, make it more valuable to drive greater differentiation in that market. But we're just seeing -- we're seeing that market slow currently. And given that it has, we've just made the assumption that's going to stay slow for the rest of the year. And as we launch new products, we'll talk to you about them as we do with anything with NPI, and we can give you a perspective on how we think that product area may grow. And importantly, in nonmortgage verification services businesses, about 50% of the revenue is generated from transactions that involve a historical record, either historical records only or historical records and current record. So it's 50% penetration of historical records in the transaction. So very, very high and huge differentiation. Yes, just current margins, and we talked about it on the call, right, are being significantly impacted by the large reduction in mortgage, right, and our very high variable margins. So if the question was, has this been the new level of your margins? No, as Mark just said, we expect our margins to reaccelerate as the market recovers. But in terms of the exact pace of that reacceleration, we'll give you guidance on that as we get into each individual year. So, historically, you've seen international margins are generally higher in the second half than the first. So we've seen some of that. But we try to be clear on the call that in terms of the level of acceleration in the margins in international. There is some pressure on that because of the fact we're seeing great growth in our debt management business, but that does have lower margins. So we do expect to see the improvement we talked about, but there is a little bit of pressure on those margins because of debt management. Yes. So in terms of the drivers of outperformance, it's actually -- the Workforce is actually performing better than our expectations. They've added records faster than we thought. And so that's actually a greater benefit to our performance than we would have expected when we started the year, and they've executed very well on both new products, and then the pricing programs they put in place at the beginning of the year, which tend to go in, in January. So we know about all those, right? The issue -- the reason why the outperformance looks lower than what we saw last quarter is two-fold. One is because all of those factors I just described are all variable with volume. So since volume is declining, like that level of outperformance in absolute dollar shrinks. So that's why you see a smaller outperformance relative to the market because -- and it's just the math and the measurement. The other thing is what Mark talked about, right? We measure the mortgage market. We define it right, as USIS credit inquiries. While since USIS credit inquiries are benefited by shopping and Workforce Solutions isn't benefited by shopping to the same degree, then what we end up having is USIS gets somewhat of a benefit. And so, therefore, the market itself is measured as stronger and that provides a little bit of a greater headwind to outperformance to EWS. We don't think that's -- that in any way indicates they're not performing as well. They're performing extremely well. And as I said, the actual drivers they can control. They're actually outperforming our expectations in terms of record additions products and then obviously, good execution on price. And as Mark mentioned, they're also doing very, very well on system-to-system integration. So we feel very good about the execution that's occurring during the year. Yes. So in terms of the way we structure the forecast, we obviously look very closely at the current trends we're seeing. We obviously looked very closely at the last 14 days, right, when we're seeing in early July, and we saw we were down 40%. And we also look very closely at the trends we're seeing and the movements in increase between April, May and June. We think that the forecast that we put together or the estimate we used in our financial guidance is very consistent with what we're seeing in terms of movements in the mortgage market itself. We think it's very consistent with the information we shared on new home purchases and the fact that they're certainly weakening as we go through the year relative to what we've seen earlier in the year, we think it's consistent with that. We think it's also consistent with the very low levels of refinance that are currently occurring and really that refinances at this point, almost completely driven by cash out refi. Also, I think you saw last night that all three of the major parties that forecast mortgage originations refreshed their forecast yesterday evening, Freddie, Fannie and MBA. MBA came out and said they expect originations to be down in the neighborhood of 43.5% and I think all three indicated those origination units, sorry. And I think all three indicated that origination dollars will be down in the order of 46% in the second half. So, we feel like with us indicating you're going to see over 46% reduction in inquiries, which would imply a 200 to 300 basis points, so I think 48% to 50% decline in origination units. We think we've given a very reasonable forecast, we think it's consistent with other third party forecasters. And so, we feel like we've done a fairly good job at encompassing the information we have today. But obviously, to be fair, very hard to forecast the mortgage market and what we'll do is we'll just keep letting you know what we're seeing. And then any changes that we're seeing that that might drive in our output. But, right now, we feel like we've done a nice job of including all the information available, and we feel relatively good about the fact that the other parties have come out and look to be at or slightly stronger than us. Yes, I think the big driver, obviously, for us, what's occurring right now is the impact of mortgage market overall, right? And our -- there really is any inflation impact, George, from our perspective in that margin. It's really the loss of that mortgage revenue is just a big impact on us. That's all. So by far, the largest impact in the reduction in our adjusted EPS, we tried to walk through the drivers, right? But in terms of the margin piece, right, outside of interest and outside of the impact of FX, right? By far, the largest driver is obviously the reduction in mortgage and mortgage has very high variable profit, right? So, that's what's really driving the reduction in our margin dollars and, therefore, driving the reduction in our adjusted EPS. And yes, there is some incremental cost that we're investing going forward in as we invest going forward in new products, but that's not the driver. The driver is really the movement in mortgage, right? What we were trying to do is to give you a perspective on there's a substantial driver, and there are some other things that are impacting margins as well. We talked about investments in the development costs. We talked about some mix issues in international as we grow the debt management business. And we also talked about the fact that we had a little bit of a benefit because our variable compensation goes down. We're just trying to give you a perspective on the different side levers that are playing within a larger impact of the decline in the mortgage market. In addition to Equifax, there have been multiple companies that have had day one certainty for several years. So, this is not anything new."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another solid quarter with record second quarter revenue of $1.32 billion, which was up 7% and at the middle of our April guidance, including the negative impact of 190 basis points or $23 million of FX. Constant currency revenue growth was almost 9% at 8.5%. Adjusted EPS of $2.09 was above the top end of our April guidance range with U.S. mortgage market overall, about at the level of our April guidance with U.S. mortgage credit inquiries down 33% versus last year. As expected, the mortgage market decline increased as we moved through the quarter. In the first half of July, mortgage credit inquiries were down about 40% versus last year. Core revenue growth in the quarter of 19% and core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter were very strong. Consistent with our expectations, which allowed us to deliver the 8.5% constant currency growth against a 33% U.S. mortgage market decline. Importantly, non-mortgage constant currency growth of 22% was very strong in the quarter and well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and of course, this represents about 75% of Equifax revenue. Workforce Solutions core revenue growth of 41% was outstanding and above our expectations. International delivered 11.5%, constant currency growth, which was also above our expectations. And USIS B2B non-mortgage growth of 6% was up from first quarter, but lower than we expected. B2B non-mortgage online was strong at 9%. However, our B2B offline business was much weaker than expected, declining 5% in the quarter, and I'll cover this more fully shortly. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $461 million, up 7% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 35% were above in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to make strong progress during the quarter on our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. Year-to-date, we've migrated approximately 14,500 customers to the cloud in the U.S. And since the start of the transformation, we now have migrated about 70% of our U.S. customers. So far in 2022, we also migrated approximately 13,000 international customers and decommissioned four U.S. data centers. Leveraging our new EFX Cloud infrastructure, we continue to invest in new product resources and accelerate new product innovations. So far in 2022, we released 50 -- over 50 new products continuing momentum from 2021 where we launched a record 151 new products. In the quarter, our Vitality index, defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years was extremely strong and exceeded 13%. This is over a 400 basis point improvement from our 9% Vitality last year and the highest level in over 10 years at Equifax. For 2022, we expect Vitality of over 11% and which is 100 basis points above our 10% long-term Vitality goal and 100 basis points above the framework when we started the year. This strong NPI performance will benefit our growth in the second half and in 2023 and beyond. We continue to invest our strong free cash flow and strategic bolt-on acquisitions with the acquisition of LawLogix that we announced earlier this morning, which will further strengthen our EWS Employer Solutions I-9 integration regulatory service capabilities. This is our sixth acquisition in Workforce Solutions since January 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen workforce, our largest and fastest-growing business. Bolt-on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are a strong lever for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A. We are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, particularly our strong 22% non-mortgage constant currency growth. This is clearly an unprecedented economic environment with record inflation, strong set actions and the impact from higher interest rates on the mortgage market. Despite our strong first half performance we felt it was prudent to adjust our 2022 guidance to reflect expectations for further weakening of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half beyond the framework we provided in April as well as the significant negative impact of FX from the stronger dollar. Importantly, our expectations for 2022 core revenue growth remains a very strong 17%. Our expectation for constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth remains a very strong 19%, both unchanged from our April guidance. While our second quarter mortgage results were aligned with our April guidance, we thought there was enough uncertainty between future Fed actions, the impact on interest rates and mortgage activity to further adjust our second half mortgage outlook. Our updated expectations for mortgage are that credit inquiries will decline by over 46% in the second half, which is down about 600 basis points from our April framework with mortgage originations declining 200 to 300 basis points beyond these levels. This compares to the Mortgage Bankers Association forecast for the second half of 2022 mortgage origination units of down 43.5% that was released last night. As you know, USIS mortgage revenue is tied more closely to credit inquiries, while Workforce Solutions revenue is tied more closely to mortgage originations. And for the second half of 2022, FX is a headwind of over $40 million up from an impact of about $7 million in our April guidance from the stronger dollar. The change in the second half mortgage inquiries and FX impact results in our revised 2022 guidance for revenue at the midpoint of $5.1 billion down $100 million from our April framework, but still up almost 4% versus last year or 5% on a constant currency basis. This reduction in revenue is about two-thirds related to mortgage with the balance from FX. Our updated adjusted EPS guidance is to a midpoint of $7.68, down $0.47 from our April guidance and up about 1% from 2021. As I said earlier, there's no change in our core organic revenue growth framework, which remains a very strong 15% for 2022 and 13% in the second half of 2022, and our non-mortgage growth framework remains up a strong 16% for the year and 12% in the second half as we comp-off some strong double-digit results in the second half of 2021 and in the second half of 2021. In the second half of 2022, non-mortgage is about 80% of Equifax revenue consistent with 2019 and up from 68% last year. Turning to slide five, in the second quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars, grew a very strong 19%, which was in line with our expectations and substantially above our long-term financial framework of eight to 12. Core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework of 7% to 10% for organic growth. Non-mortgage organic growth in EWS International and USIS drove about 12 points of core organic revenue growth in the quarter. Core mortgage outperformance of 13%, predominantly in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining 4% of second quarter core organic revenue growth. Both were very strong performances. With a strong 19% core growth in the quarter and accelerating NPI rollouts, we continue to expect 2022 core revenue growth of 17%. This is driven by broad-based strong performance across Workforce Solutions as well as strength in USIS non-mortgage B2B online and international, which is supported by our accelerated new product introductions. As detailed on slide six, U.S. core mortgage revenue growth in the quarter was up a strong 13% driven by Workforce Solutions core mortgage revenue growth of 20% and 2% in USIS. Second quarter mortgage revenue was down only 19% despite the 33% decline in the overall U.S. mortgage market as measured by our credit inquiries and an MBA June estimated decline in mortgage originations of about 37%. Workforce Solutions core mortgage growth of 20% continues to be driven by very strong performance on TWN record additions, new products and pricing, system and system integrations and continued penetration. The 20 points of market outperformance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes. We expect to see continued very strong core mortgage growth from EWS approaching this level in the second half. As a reminder, we estimate the U.S. mortgage market as the change in USIS credit inquiries. In a rising interest rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate shop more frequently, thus creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations. This trend benefits USIS credit file poles. In the second quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform on the order of four points better than the estimated change in the mortgage origination units estimated by MBA. However, TWN income and employment is typically called later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront rate shopping trend that occurs in a rising interest rate environment as TWN inquiries are more closely correlated to mortgage originations. Turning to slide seven. In 2022, we expect non-mortgage revenues to be 77% of total Equifax revenues, which is up a very strong 900 basis points from the 68% of total Equifax revenues that we saw in 2021. Given the above-market growth in fast-growing Workforce Solutions verticals such as talent, government and card, further penetration identity and fraud accelerated by our 2021 acquisition account and accelerated NPIs with a vitality index expected to be 11% in 2022 and of course, growth in our international markets. We also expect non-mortgage revenue will benefit from being the only cloud-native credit bureau through always-on system stability, faster transaction processing and leveraging the Data Fabric to expand our NPIs. Turning now to slide eight. Workforce Solutions delivered outstanding 41% core revenue growth in the second quarter the fifth quarter over 40% revenue growth in the last six quarters and their 10th quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by outstanding non-mortgage growth of over 50%. As a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is over 65% of Workforce Solutions and a big EWS growth driver for the future. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team continued outstanding execution across their key growth drivers detailed on the right-hand side of this slide. As I referenced earlier, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire LawLogix last night, the next in a string of bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen Workforce Solutions Employer Services vertical and adds TWN records. Over the past two years, we've completed six bolt-on acquisitions supporting Workforce Solutions growth, including EFRA since last fall, and LawLogix this morning. Turning to slide nine, Workforce Solutions very strong performance is driven by the team's consistent execution across their key growth levers that will drive their long-term growth of 13% to 15%, including, first, growing the work number database. Since late last year, we signed four new exclusive agreements with large payroll processors that we started to board in the second quarter and expect to have all of them contributing records by the end of the third quarter. We ended the quarter with $144 million total current records, which is up a very strong 22% from last year and up 6% sequentially. These $144 million total records represent 110 million unique individuals, representing two-thirds of the over 160 million W-2 employees, included in U.S. Non-farm payroll. In addition to traditional W-2 wage earners, we estimate there are approximately 30 million to 40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S. who will also bring valuable insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million non-W-2 wage earners, but expect to make significant progress as we move through 2022 and 2023. We have the ability to double our TWN database with the total potential market for income and employment information on about 220 million individuals versus the $110 million we have today. As a reminder, over 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. The vast majority of our partnerships with payroll companies are exclusive, including all the relationships we've signed in the past four-plus years. Second, Workforce is increasing penetration in their key non-mortgage verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance, with all four verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by new products, leveraging our expanding TWN active and historical data assets. Our talent and government businesses have seen average organic growth of over 50% since last year and over 20% CAGR since 2017. Our strength in talent and government is driven by the depth and coverage of our TWN database with over 570 million total records, both current and historic that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories. The expanding depth of our TWN database and expansion of the Workforce Solutions talent data hub as well as the increasing ease of integrations as workforce leverages the API capabilities through our new Google Cloud is also providing the ability to continue to increase penetration in key verticals. We workforce is expanding their system and system integrations. Currently, more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system and system integrations as web access, which is up over two versus web access which is up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get about a 20% lift in mortgage pools when we convert our customers from web to system to system integrations. In Talent Solutions, system-to-system now represents more than 85% of transactions while in government, we have more opportunity with about 65% of transactions on a system-to-system basis. As a reminder, close to 100% of credit files are delivered system-to-system for originations. From our perspective, it's only a matter of time for TWN to approach these levels of system-to-system integrations with customers, which, of course, will drive our revenue. As workforce continues to deliver greater value to customers through deepening the database and extending real-time system-to-system integrations and accelerating its launch of higher-value, vertical-specific new products average revenue per transaction will continue to grow significantly, both through higher value and price new products and annual price increases. As I said earlier, Rudy and the EWS team have a long runway for growth, leveraging multiple levers in 2022 and beyond. We have a lot of confidence in workforce's ability to deliver on their 13% to 15% long-term framework. As a reminder, over the past three years, they've delivered 34% CAGR, which, of course, is well above our 13% to 15% long-term growth framework. Turning to slide 10, workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering $609 million of revenue, their second revenue quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 21% with organic revenue growth of 11%, despite the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue is now over 65% of Workforce Solutions with organic growth of 30%. Verification Services revenue of $505 million, up 28% and was over $500 million for the second quarter in a row, again, despite the decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage verticals now represent almost 60% of verifier revenue and delivered 90% and 53% -- 90% total and 53% organic growth, APRs Insights which we acquired late last year, delivered strong 15% growth in the quarter. Growth was strong in their key verticals of risk and justice intelligence. Risk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze people risks via background checks and continuous monitoring. And Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. Increased customer penetration, leg space expansion and strong hiring volumes are driving growth. And their NPI pipeline also remains strong. We are very positive about the future growth and potential of our Insights business. Talent and Government solution, which now represents 40% of Workforce Solutions and almost 80% of verifier non-mortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered 134% total and 73% organic growth in the quarter on record growth and strong new product revenue. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 100% total and 50% organic with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. The continued expansion of Workforce Solutions data hub and the fast-growing $5 billion talent and 2 billion government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions over $570 million current and historical records for new products. The integration of unique Appriss Insights National Student Clearinghouse and other talent-related data assets strengthens our ability to deliver to these new solutions, leveraging the EWS data hub and drive outsized growth in the future. Non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto also showed strong growth, up 18% in the quarter and debt management grew over 70% in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was down 3% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down over 25% during 2022 driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as well as the COVID federal tax credit program -- the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer Services revenue, excluding UC and ERC, was up a strong 42% in the quarter, driven by strong base double-digit growth in our I-9 and onboarding healthy FX and our tax credit businesses. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin remained strong at 53.4%. In the quarter, we increased spending relative to our April expectations on both technology and marketing, principally for new products. The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness and value of their in income and employment data in Employer Services businesses was clear again in the second quarter. Rudy and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 21% revenue growth and 41% core growth well above the 13% to 15% long-term framework, and we're well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continued above-market growth in the future. Turning on to slide 11. USIS revenue of $421 million was down 7.5% compared to last year and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which at $113 million is about 25% of total USIS revenue and was down 29% in the quarter, about 4 percentage points better than the overall mortgage market credit inquiries that declined 33%. Importantly, USIS delivered their sixth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B non-mortgage revenue of $259 million which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue and was up 6% with our organic revenue growth of 4%. This was at the low end of the 6% to 7% growth we discussed in April due to lower-than-expected FMS potential marketing services revenue. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was strong at 9% with 7% organic growth. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, financial services, commercial as well as Kount, our identity and fraud business. We also saw growth in direct-to-consumer with auto about flat in the quarter on favorable pricing offset by lower volumes given the continued auto supply chain issues. Kount which provides unique identity and fraud solution continues to perform very well. Our core new product growth continues to be strong, and the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data including combining Kount's market-leading Omniscore AI capabilities and digital identity data with Equifax' physical identity into a single score to enhance fraud protection. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $55 million, down 5% year-over-year and although better than the first quarter was lower than our expectations. FMS is principally comprised of three lines of business, including first fraud and data services in which we provide header data principally to providers of identity and fraud services which is the line of business is driving the weakness in our B2B off-line. Fraud and data services historically represents over 20% of our offline revenue, but has declined substantially in the first half. We saw this decline in the first quarter as customers either decreased frequency of refresh data or shifted to use of their own internal data. This decline continued in the second quarter. Revenue was about 10% of B2B offline in the first half. We expect revenue at this level to continue through 2022 as the team focuses on bringing new solutions to market later this year. Marketing Services, which represents over half of B2B offline revenue in the first half, performed very well growing but not consistent with our non-mortgage B2B online organic growth. This is a business in which we provide data in decisioning principally to financial institutions for prescreens as well as providing our IXI data for marketing activities. And third, risk management or portfolio review represents about a third of B2B offline revenue. This is a line of business in which we provide data and analytics services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or in some cases, portfolios they're acquiring. This business is often somewhat countercyclical as customers perform more risk analytics during weak economic periods. This business was down slightly in the first half and slightly weaker than expected, we expect this business to be down slightly for the remainder of the year. Overall, for our Financial Marketing Services and B2B offline for the remainder of 2022, we expect to see declines in line with the second quarter as the weakness in the Fraud and Data Services is partially offset by continued good growth in Marketing Services. As we look to 2023, the completion of the Equifax new cloud data fabric will enable enhanced product offerings in B2B offline combining U.S. credit file, DataX, Teletrack, TWN, IDN fraud and NCTUE data. We believe this will drive growth across all three of our B2B offline lines of business as we get to 2023. For B2B non-mortgage in total, we expect to see continued strong online growth consistent with the first half. However, declines in Financial Marketing Services are expected to result in second half total B2B non-mortgage growth at or slightly below the bottom end of our long-term framework of 6% to 8% revenue growth. USIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S. D2C business from GCS that we combined with USIS in the fourth quarter last year, had revenue of $49 million, up 3% in the quarter and about flat versus last year. We expect second half growth rates to improve as the team leverages the cloud to roll out NPIs. USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins resulting in a healthy win rate and their new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipe slightly higher than the first quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 38.2% in the quarter, 110 basis points lower than the first quarter but better than our expectations. The decline relative to the first quarter is principally driven by lower revenue from the decline in mortgage. Turning now to International, as shown on slide 12, the revenue was $286 million, up a strong 11.5% on a local currency basis. We're seeing broad-based execution from our International businesses. New York local currency revenue was up 16%, principally driven by strength in our U.K. debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K. government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue. Our European CRE businesses was about flat in the quarter and below our expectations, driven by declines in consumer direct and commercial, partially offset by strong growth in identity and fraud. Asia Pacific local currency revenue was 6%, driven by strong growth in our Australia consumer business, HR services and identity and fraud. Latin American local currency revenue was up 28%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico and Central America. The teams' strong new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continue to drive strong growth across the region. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America. Canada local currency revenue was up 2% below our expectations. We saw growth in Commercial and Analytics Solutions, which was partially offset by consumer services, mortgage-related products and online businesses due to interest rate increases. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 24.7% were down 200 basis points from last year due primarily to the elimination of equity income from our Russia joint venture. As shown on slide 13, we had another very strong new product quarter with our Vitality Index over 13%, which is up 400 basis points above our full year 2021 Vitality goal in 300 basis points above our 10% long-term framework goal and our highest vitality performance ever. Building on the record 151 new products last year, we delivered over 50 new products leveraging the new EFX cloud so far in 2022 with broad-based execution across all of our business units. We've detailed some of the more significant new products on this slide. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index of over 11% this year, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue in 2022. We believe our strong NPI revenue generation is an important early indicator of the benefits of the new Equifax cloud, new products leveraging our differentiated data and new EFX cloud capabilities are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top-line growth. A detail on slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX 2023 growth strategy and long-term framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A, including LawLogix that we announced this morning. We completed 11 acquisitions since the January 2021, aligned with our strategy to add bolt-on M&A around three strategic priorities; number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, adding unique data assets; and number three, building out and expanding our ID and fraud business. Slide 15 provides detail on our latest acquisition of LawLogix, which further strengthens our Workforce Solutions, employer solutions capabilities and provides I-9 management and immigration case management solutions focused on removing friction during the employee onboarding experience. LawLogix's suite of products supplements employer services capabilities by building upon investments made to help clients enable automation, deepen employee insights and increase efficiency. Our I-9 Anywhere product has seen very strong 45% growth over the past few years. The LawLogix's acquisition is aligned with our M&A priority of expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions. With that, I'll turn it over to John to provide some more details on the mortgage market and our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance. Thanks John. Turning to slide 20 -- 22, the new Equifax is a much different business today than we were in the last recession. We're more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth. During the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency we expect from the data analytics business. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, Workforce Solutions revenue grew throughout the period and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009 from TWN record additions and their other growth levers, which drove higher verification rates and strong unemployment revenue growth from the growing unemployment levels in 2009. We believe that Equifax business mix is much better positioned for a potential economic event in the future than we were in 2009. Strong Workforce Solutions growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today with margins above 50%, about 20 percentage points higher than the Equifax average. EWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth, penetration into new fast-growing verticals like talent and government, system-to-system integrations, deploying new and higher-value products as well as the measured price actions, taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database. Second, completion of the Equifax Cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond, we expect we'll drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from 2022 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven by our execution. And third, we're leveraging the cloud to accelerate new product development with a goal of 11% vitality index in 2022, which is over $500 million of annual incremental revenue -- new product revenue for Equifax. As a reminder, new products rolled out in 2021 and 2022 will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. To estimate the impact of a recession that we have on Equifax, we've assigned our lines of businesses into three categories: first, recession growth or recession resistant. These businesses have drivers that are not directly aligned with economic activity and recession, and we expect them to grow during a recession. The best examples of this are Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage identity and fraud and our government lines of businesses that we expect will continue to grow during an economic event from the uniqueness of the data, including TWN or from low interest rate environments that impact our mortgage business. Second is our countercyclical businesses that typically perform better during recession and the best example is our unemployment claims management business where we expect significant growth in Workforce Solutions from growing unemployment in the U.S. or some of our account management solutions. And third, recession impacted. These are businesses that are directly impacted by economic activity and contract in a recession, and they include auto, cards, P loans where both consumer activity declines or lender activity is contracted for risk containment reasons. We expect these business lines to be flat to negative revenue growth in recession. Today, we believe almost 60% of our global business is recession-resilient or countercyclical. This is a big change in a strong position compared to Equifax in the 2008 global financial crisis, where only about 40% of our businesses were either recession-resistant or countercyclical. The meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage identity and fraud since 2009, as well as the cloud transformation cost savings, position Equifax very well if there is an economic event recession in 2023 or beyond. As highlighted on slide 23, we remain laser-focused on executing our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX cloud for innovation and new products. EFX2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 60% of total revenue being delivered from the new AFX Cloud. And we've completed over 139,000 B2B migrations and over 10 million consumer migrations. Our international transformation is also progressing, and we continue to expect to principally complete the transition by geographic region as we move through 2023 and into 2024. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities and are confident that it will differentiate us commercially expanding our NPI capabilities, accelerating our topline growth and expand our margins from the growth in cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics company. Wrapping up on slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 7% overall growth and 19% core growth and a 13% vitality index, more than offsetting a 33% decline in the mortgage market. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient, on offense and investing for future growth. Our updated 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance reflects the impact of the expected accelerated decline in the U.S. mortgage market to a decline of over 46% in the second half of 2022, resulting in a mortgage market decline of over 30% for the year -- 37% for the year. Against this unprecedented mortgage market decline, Equifax will deliver constant currency revenue over 5% and deliver growth in adjusted EPS. More importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage growth of 16% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model today and in the future. EWS continues to deliver above market growth and it was our largest, fastest-growing and highest-margin business. Workforce Solutions above market, 34% revenue CAGR over the last three years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. New products leveraging the new Equifax cloud are also driving growth. Our 11% vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we are in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax cloud to drive innovation in new products. Our 11 bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong topline growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond. And then last, we're in the final chapters of completing our four-year $1.5 billion transformation to the cloud that will deliver topline growth and cost benefits in 2023 and beyond. Even in these uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax cloud, new products, data analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth. We continue to be confident in our long-term framework of 8% to 12% revenue growth, our goal of $7 billion of revenue in 2020 -- or by 2025. Our ability to expand our margins 500 basis points between 2022 and 2025 and 50 basis points per year of margin expansion longer term. We remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage market macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster-growing, higher-margin cloud-native data Analytics Company. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes. So it's a great question, Manav. As you know, we're investing heavily in the non -- one of our priorities is to invest heavily in workforce broadly because it's our fastest growing business. And -- as you pointed out, the non-mortgage businesses and workforce are really outperforming the underlying market and delivering substantial growth. And I'll touch on talent first, as you pointed out, a big TAM of $5 billion and our play there is to help digitize the background screeners using our data as we continue to expand our historical data, we can deliver real solutions there. And we haven't seen any impact from the hiring market. As you know, unemployment is still very low. There's still more jobs open. And there are people looking for them. And even in -- if that starts to slow down in the future, there's just so much penetration opportunity for us to really work to help digitize the background screening environment, both with our core work history. As you know, we have $570 million total record. So we have a digital resume on the average American worker that totals five jobs for each individual. So there's just a lot of data and growth opportunity there. And then we're also, as you know, adding data assets to go beyond just that work history and talent, whether it's education, medical credentialing data that we acquired with APRs Insights, of course, the incarceration data that's used in virtually every background screen. And we have a stated strategy to look for more partnerships or M&A to really strengthen the Talent hub. So I don't expect them to grow at the rate they have been over the last couple of years, which is very, very strong. But certainly, there will be a big growth driver going forward with double-digit growth in the future. Government, as you know, is another big non-mortgage vertical for Workforce Solutions. That's around social services, the $2 billion -- or a few trillion dollar government TAM is a big one. We have a lot of penetration opportunities there. Social services are only expanding. And it's really the same thing. We're able to deliver an instant decision to that government agency, either the federal, state or local level. And we're just seeing a lot of traction. They have the same labor issues, meaning they're looking for productivity in the centers where people come in to apply for social services. And we can deliver productivity with the instant decisioning. And of course, it also delivers that social service to that individual very quickly. And same thing the ability now to not only have that income and employment information that's used in really every social service is needs or income-based. But also adding to the incarceration data that we have. It's used in virtually all social service processes. Beyond talent and government, just touching quickly on kind of non-mortgage financial services, those are newer verticals for workforce with the data, whether it's in the card space where we're starting to get penetration to have the income and employment data, supplement the credit data in a card origination. Of course, auto, we've seen nice growth in sub-prime and moving into near prime and of course, it's used in P loans. And then just jumping outside of verifications and new employer services, as you know, we've been making acquisitions. We've done five acquisitions in the employer services space in the last two years to really build out the capabilities in those regulatory compliance services, whether it's unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit, ACA or health care. And of course, in the work opportunity tax credit and I-9 benefits like LawLogix that we announced this morning, that's a space that has a big $5 billion, $6 billion TAM in a more challenging economic environment. We expect more outsourcing by HR managers of those activities that we can perform more efficiently. So we see growth opportunities for that business, which is why we're investing in technology and the bolt-on M&A like a LawLogix. And of course, as you know, as we expand our capabilities and reach there with individual companies, we get more records. And of course, underlying the growth of workforce and, of course, non-mortgage is record growth, which was up a strong 22% in the quarter, and we still have a long runway to essentially double the size of our database when you include gig and pension income recipients. So there's a lot of opportunity there. So, lots of levers for non-mortgage in Workforce Solutions. Yes. I think as you know, we've tried to be very disciplined about our approach to M&A. We're very -- I use the term bolt-on. You can describe how big bolt-on is. Obviously, Appriss was a larger acquisition, Kount was a larger acquisition last year. But we see a lot of opportunity to deliver very high return bolt-on M&A that are highly accretive to our cost of capital. So it's you start with our kind of capital allocation, we see big opportunities to invest in the core of Equifax and we're doing that. And that's really through our cloud transformation, which we're in the final innings of completing. That was a big project and a big focus of Equifax. That will start tailing off our investment in that over the coming year or so as we complete the cloud. New products, we get very high return on. And then when you get into inorganic, we see an opportunity to continue to do bolt-on M&A that adds very positively, and we are very disciplined financially and looking for businesses that are growing faster than Equifax on the top line that are accretive to our margins and obviously deliver high returns. So those are the kind of M&A that we're doing and we've got a pipeline going forward of deals that we continue to look at that will really add value in the three areas that I talked about during my prepared comments of strengthening workforce, adding differentiated data and strengthening identity and fraud. And as you know, as we go into 2023, 2024, 2025, with our margin expansion accelerating in that 500 basis points to 39% in 2025, our free cash flow accelerates dramatically in the coming 12, 24, 36 months. And we'll continue to run the play of bolt-on M&A where it's appropriate, we'll look for acquisitions that might be at the larger end of bolt-on like an Appriss. But we'll be at a point in the near future where we're going to want to return cash to shareholders. And we've been very clear that when that time comes, that will be a part of our capital allocation strategy as our free cash flow accelerates as we get into 2023, 2024, 2025 Hey, Kevin. Yes, I think bottoming is probably in the second half based on our forecast, Kevin, as you know. But it's very hard to really predict what's going to happen with the economy given the inflation rates that we haven't seen and really our lifetimes and what the Fed is going to do to respond to it. Yes, I would make a couple of comments on mortgage, which you know. Look, the mortgage market doesn't disappear, right? There's a core mortgage market that in any economic environment stays there, meaning people move and buy houses. People upgrade and buy houses on the purchase market. And as you know, there's more people still looking for houses in the United States today than there are houses. So there's still quite a bit of demand on the purchase side. So we expect there to be -- is there is any economic environment, a continued purchase market, and John gave some views about how we think about that in the second half. As you point out on the refi side, the interest rate refis are going to be lower or less of those in the second half given where interest rates are because there aren't many opportunities for homeowners to do an interest rate refi but there's a ton of untapped equity in homes in the United States. Over the past 24-plus months, home price appreciation is up almost 30%. And there's about $27 trillion of untapped home equity. And we've seen in economic environments in the past, that homeowners will tap into that equity. If you think about a 5.5% fixed rate mortgage in order to refi into that to access your home equity, which consumers are doing or homeowners are doing. We expect that to continue. And if you think about 5.5% interest rate on fixed rate mortgage, that's a heck of a lot less than an auto loan, a student loan or a credit card. And that's what you'll see consumers do. So it'll be a level cash-out refis going forward. And I know you get that. I think the challenging part is what's going to happen, how far is the Fed going to have to go to slow down inflation with it at 9.1%. So that's a harder part for us to forecast. We did talk about in our prepared comments that we remain confident in, obviously, the long-term future of Equifax. Our goal of $7 billion by 2025 hasn't changed our goal to expand our margins to 39% by 2025 hasn't changed. And we're still investing in the future of Equifax. As we speak, we're making investments that will benefit 2023, 2024, 2025 based on our strong performance, particularly in non-mortgage, which is exceptionally strong. Yes, it's certainly, I think, as you know, we raised our non-mortgage or core guidance twice this year, one in February and once in April, that gives us confidence. It should give you confidence. And if you look at our non-mortgage performance and our core growth performance, which includes how we're performing beyond the mortgage market, those are strong numbers. And those give us confidence in our ability. And then if you add to it, during that 2023 to 2024 time frame. In the next 12 months, we're going to be completing substantially the U.S. cloud migration, so we'll be cloud native, and we can take full advantage of that. We'll finish international as we get through 2023 and into 2024. That's another lift for Workforce Solutions. The other thing that should give you confidence and gives us confidence is the M&A that we've done over the last 18 months. We've done 11 acquisitions now with LawLogix. Those are in our run rate revenue or will be. And, of course, the synergies from those acquisitions that we had in our acquisition cases really kick in, in 2023, 2024, 2025, as they really get integrated into our businesses. And then the last point I'd make that gives us confidence is NPIs. The Vitality index that we're delivering, as you know, our long-term frame on Vitality is10, we were 13% in the quarter, we're expecting to be north of 11% for the year. Those are big numbers when you talk about having $550 million of revenue in 2022 from new products. And remember, new products we introduced in 2022 really benefit 2023, 2024, 2025. They mature as we get into those years. So there's a lot of levers that give us confidence around the future of Equifax. Yes, it's a great question, Tony. This is Mark. First off, we don't see that in the second half. You may have a different point of view, but we don't see that in the second half. But to be clear, we think about it a lot, obviously, and we do have levers. First off, we think we're going to outperform the way we did in the past, if there was an economic event. We had a page in how we talked about it in the investor deck, and we talked with you about it before. The difference in the business and levers like continuing to add records at Workforce Solutions and so many other levers in workforce, in particular, identity and fraud business. So, we think about that. But we clearly have the ability to throttle cost if we got into an economic event. In 2022, while we're seeing the pressure from the mortgage market macro and it's also FX revenue, we made the decision to continue to invest, which is I think you want us to do and our investors do, because our core business or non-mortgage business, which is a big part of Equifax is performing exceptionally well, and we want to keep driving that. So, investing in things like new products, investing in completing the cloud transformation, which, of course, that will take a lot of our cost out as we get into 2022 -- I'm sorry, 2023, 2024, 2025, we get significant margin expansion or cost reductions as we complete the cloud and decommission a lot of our data centers. That's kind of a natural recession hedge for us as we execute the cloud transformation. But we've got other cost levers that we could or would pull, and we'll be ready to do that if there is an economic event. But at the same time, we have a lot of confidence in how we would perform in an economic event, you know, because of the changing -- dramatically changing nature of Equifax. Would you add anything John? Yes. So we've talked about -- we're obviously doing some work to get some new products positioned in the second half of this year to bring the FMS portfolio review business back into a different position. That's clearly a place that we're investing in. I think part of your question was also around broader identity and fraud, which is a different business for us. That's really under the account business, which we're very pleased with. That's a business that performed exceptionally well in the quarter and the half. We see big potential in just a massive TAM around the broader identity in fraud. And of course, as you know, we bought count 18 months ago, and we're still integrating that inside of Equifax and rolling out new solutions. And that's an area that we're investing in new products for both the e-commerce space, but also for our traditional financial customers, and also looking for inorganic or M&A to continue to expand. That's one of our three priorities around M&A is to grow in identity and fraud. And in B2B offline specifically kind of the fraud header business I think some of the real opportunities we have as we get into 2023 is heavily around data fabric, right? As we're able to more aggressively integrate different data assets. Again, it will differentiate our information or header information that we sell into those markets, and we think we have the opportunity to reaccelerate that growth again. But that will happen as Data Fabric completes for USIS. Yes. As you know, these are -- I still call the newer verticals for us in Workforce Solutions, both talent and government. They're big TAMs. Talent is a $5 billion data TAM for us. Government is about $2 billion. We've got big teams in Workforce Solutions focused on that. As we've made -- as you know, some M&A additions to strengthen our capabilities there. We want to do more. That's an area where we want to expand either M&A or partnerships, M&A being like Appriss Insights. Where we got the incarceration and medical credentialing data that's really helping us in both government and talent. The partnership we have with Nestor doing Clearinghouse, where we're bringing education data and we'd like you to do more partnerships or more M&A there. The other really lever for us in talent and government is new products is really bringing new solutions together, combining data elements we have in Workforce. And of course, at the heart of our growth in both of those verticals is our twin data set. Both our 144 million active records or 110 million active individuals in our data set, which is a huge coverage now. And as you know, when we add records, our hit rates go up because remember, in our system-to-system integrations whether it's talent or government or other verticals, they're hitting our database for every applicant or individual that they're trying to process, whether it's a mortgage or a background screen or a social service like rent support or unemployment claims, as we grow our records, that grows the business. And then leveraging our historical data, we just got so much historical data of the 570 million total records which equates to about five and a half jobs for the average American. That's a very valuable instant decisioning data set for the talent space. So, a combination of new products, continuing to grow out our twin record database and continuing to do M&A and having our dedicated teams of growing customers. There's still a lot of customers that don't use our data in government social services and in talent, so that's another opportunity. So, we're pretty energized about the growth potentials in those two verticals. Yes. It's obviously a positive for us. That business is a lot bigger today than it was in 2008, 2009, obviously, we've got a lot more scale. We're expanding the business with a lot of the investments in people and technology and capabilities as well as the M&A that we've done. So, it will clearly be a tailwind. Obviously, it's a headwind right now coming off 2020 and 2021 when there was a lot of furloughs and layoffs during the COVID environment. I know, John, would you size it in any way. And that's just one of -- as you know, that's one of many kind of countercyclical businesses. Another -- if you're focused on countercyclical, the other one is inside of our credit business, while prescreens will go down, account management and portfolio management activity goes up in an economic event. Now, we're not seeing that today, because it's -- there isn't really an economic event yet, but that's a countercyclical element for our core credit businesses. And, of course, we got all kinds of levers in Workforce Solutions. We're going to keep adding records whether the economy is up down or sideways. Yes. So, bunch of layers of questions in there. First, I think as you point out, it's a really attractive lever for growth and unique through this business, right? No other beta business that I know of has the ability to add records the way Workforce has been able to do. And, of course, it translates into revenue day one, quarter one, week one, the minute we add them, because remember, we're -- as we're integrated or even through web access, customers are coming to our data set, looking for all of their applicants. And as we grow our hit rates, it really drives the revenue. And revenue -- the records were up 22% in the quarter. We've had very strong double-digit growth for the last three years of growing the data set. And now have 144 million actives and 110 million uniques, which is really powerful in the scale of the data set. Not only is it driving revenue, but it also drives usage, meaning it's a data set that's more valuable. And remember, you think about it, our customers want 100% coverage, because the consumers that they can't identify in our data set, they got to go somewhere else to do a manual verification or do something else that slows down their process. So as we add records to our data set, we become more valuable to them. So, as you know, 50% of our records come from partnerships, 50% come from direct relationships that we have through our employer services business, and we want to grow both. On Employer Services, as you know, we've been making acquisitions. We've done five acquisitions in the last two years to strengthen our capabilities in Employer Services, whether it's in I-9, unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit. And that's a kind of a $6 billion TAM, and we've got a $400 million-plus business. And the power of that is, not only we're growing our -- the outsourcing there. But when we get the contracts for I-9 or unemployment claims or work opportunity tax credits, we also got records. So growing record there is a big lever. The other 50% come from partnerships, so payroll processors. And what I'm referring to is really mostly W-2 or non-farm payroll income, which is the 160 million individuals in the United States versus the 110 million we have today. The newer markets for us are gig, which is $30 million to $40 million and pensioners, which is another $20 million to $30 million. So, if you think about the $110 million, there's about 220 million Americans that have some form of income. That's what we want to grow the database to, and that's going to take time.  If you think about going from $110 million to $220 million, that may take a decade, but there's such a runway for growth. And we now have dedicated teams on the pension side. And we expect the onboarding records, obviously, from -- those aren't typically with payroll processors, there are other entities that are processing those, whether it's a benefits administrator or individual companies. And then the gig records, those are all records we want to add as we go forward.  I think your last question was around our partnership. The last part of your question was around your -- question was around our partnerships and exclusivity. As I said, the vast majority of our partnerships are exclusive. All the relationships we signed in the last four-plus years have been exclusive and all the relationships we intend to sign going forward as well as extend it's our intention for them to be exclusive. We think that's good for us and good for our partners going forward. Yes. And to be clear, we're not. The U.S. consumer from our perspective is strong. I think you've heard it from the banks over the last week or so, as they talk about their performance. There's no sign. It really goes -- it starts with employment. People are working and there's two open jobs for every person looking for a job, which we've never seen in -- really our environment. You've seen strong wage growth, which is a positive, but it starts with people are working, that's a big deal. There's still a lot of stimulus around, meaning consumers are still spending some of the stimulus they saved over the COVID environment, but there's still access to a lot of stimulus or social services support in the United States, which is benefiting consumers. So, that's a positive. Obviously, inflation is having an impact on confidence having an impact on some spending and having an impact in some of the lower subprime or lower income consumers is having a bigger impact there. But kind of broadly, we don't see the consumer weakening in the second half. We haven't seen our customers thinking about it that way. There obviously -- everyone is watching, but you haven't really seen a change in delinquencies, like card delinquencies are lower than they were in 2019. There's a little uptick in subprime, auto delinquencies, but the consumer is strong and it starts with their working and then add to it, those that are homeowners have a bunch of equity in their home, plus 20%, 25%, 30% versus a couple of years ago, it's untapped. So, those are all equations that are quite positive around the consumer, which is going to make in my view, taming inflation quite challenging because consumers are still out there spending. You've seen the banks kind of credit card spends are up strong double-digits. Consumers are traveling. They're still spending, maybe not a big ticket transactions, but they're still pretty strong and we haven't seen any signs of a changing. Well, credit scores were up 15 to 20 points since 2019 still. So a lot of factors supporting the consumer. No, it's very similar. And we could spend hours talking about all the things we're working on. And obviously, expanding workforce internationally is one of the initiatives that Rudy and his team has. As you know, we're in four markets now. We added U.K. in the first quarter. We paused during our cloud transformation to go in other markets we're in Australia, Canada U.K. and India. We paused a couple of years ago when we were doing the cloud transformation, but now that we have a tech stack that we've invested a couple of hundred million dollars in, it makes it easy to enter new markets from a technical standpoint. So that's an approach that we have and why we kind of made our first move into the U.K. following our cloud transformation at Workforce Solutions. The market dynamics are very similar. Mortgage is a place where you want to use it, and you think about the markets we're in, they have mortgage markets, consumer mortgage markets. So, that would be a priority for us when we think about future markets -- and then the talent side is another one, using the data for the hiring process is similar. And as you point out, we have some levers with our current multinationals in the U.S. where we're collecting their records from them directly or through partnerships. But the direct relationships, they want us to do income and employment verification for them in other markets. So that's a positive. And then as you also point out, the payroll processors we do business with today in the U.S., many of them are global, so they want to do this have the same relationship outside the United States. And then in individual markets, there's payroll processors or HR software companies that are unique to so many markets, and we're developing partnerships with them. So it's clearly a part of our strategy. We've got a lot of needle movers in Workforce Solutions between now and 2025. This will be one of the smaller ones, but it's one that we're investing in. I think you'll see more traction out of it, perhaps in 2024, 2025, 2026 than you will see in 2023, 2024, but as you would expect us to do, we're investing in it. And we think we've got a franchise that obviously is -- has a strong market position here in the states, and it's one that we want to take global and take advantage of it because there really aren't other players like workforce outside the United States. Yes. The portfolio reviews are a constant part of the business. But as you point out, in times of economic challenges, that typically, we see some real pick up there. That hasn't happened yet. The financial institutions really don't view the second half of being economically challenged. It's more in the newspaper than it is in the consumer or their results. I don't know if you want to touch on the header business again? No, we're not. And remember, when you think about our business, is obviously different than the background screening industry because we're so new in kind of dealing with the industry. We have so much penetration opportunity. It's our view that even if the market slows, our ability to digitize and help background screeners digitize their businesses will mitigate if you will, or offset some of that is an add to new products that we'll be rolling out for the background screeners that include other data elements. So when an economic event happens, and there is some slowdown there, we think we'll be able to offset that with some of the new products as well as penetration because we're fairly new. Remember the TAM for that the talent and background screeners is about 4 billion.  And our business is a couple of $100 million. So we've got the opportunity to continue to grow into the data elements of that even in an economic event. Yes, I think we've been pretty clear. We think it will do pretty well. As we pointed out in the comments and in prior calls, you go back to 2008, 2009, which was a pretty brutal economic event, the toughest, I think we've seen in our lifetimes. It grew through that whole period. I think in 2008, it grew 17% or something like that. And now it's got more levers. Remember, back then, it was mostly a mortgage business. And now it's highly diversified in other verticals, government, talent, it's employer services business and then non-mortgage verticals inside of financial services. And the ability to add records is one of many levers that the business has that we think is what makes Equifax so different today versus our last economic event, if you want to call, 2008, 2009. Our ability to grow is significantly enhanced by workforce being such a big part of Equifax and having so many different levers that are either unaffected by a recession or allow them to actually benefit from a recession like the unemployment claims business. Yes. So, first on the direct records that we have. Remember, it's the core of Workforce Solutions is what we call our Employer Services or Employer Solutions business. And that's where we deliver regulatory and compliance services to companies through their HR managers, and that's where they outsource these activities to Equifax. And that's about a $6 billion TAM. We have about a $400 million business there. And where we deliver those services like unemployment claims management for a company, we do the processing for them. I-9 verification in the onboarding side, work opportunity tax credit, employee retention tax credit. We do W-2 management for employees, meaning if someone needs a W-2, we will deliver it for them. So all those services that are outsourced by an HR manager is what we do as a business. And as you know, as I pointed out earlier, we've invested heavily in our cloud transformation to make those services and capabilities more efficient, more effective and just a better service for the HR manager. So the play there is to continue through our commercial coverage is to drive more outsourcing of those activities to Equifax. And for example, like in unemployment claims, we process either one in four or one in five unemployment claims in the United States that are done by third parties, meaning not individual companies. Most companies still do it today. So we have real scale in these businesses. And then as a part of that commercial relationship where we're delivering these regulatory services to the HR manager in a company, we also do income and employment verification for free. And they will deliver their payroll records to us. But then of course, we monetize. In return, we'll do income and employment verification securely. We'll do it with a high degree of privacy. And it allows the HR manager to outsource that activity to us, because if we're not doing it for them, they have a call center inside of their HR shop where they're doing it. And they are fielding calls from mortgage originators, auto lenders, background screeners, government agencies to verify income and employment on their employees. So we do that all for free. So, a very powerful value prop that we have for the HR manager, which is why we've developed a bunch of relationships. And that's why we're also expanding through M&A. And like LawLogix, a company that we announced this morning that we're acquiring strengthens us in the I-9 verification space and delivers records. So, those are the five or six acquisitions we've done in the last 24 months to strengthen our employer services business. It's really at the at the core of who Workforce Solutions is. So we want to continue to invest in technology and capabilities and bolt-on M&A to strengthen that because not only do we have a very attractive business growing in that $6 billion TAM, it also delivers records we can monetize very effectively. The second half of your question was around our historical records you're right on. It's a very big part of our business model. A lot of our verifications are around where does Mark work today, how much do you make today. But a lot of the verifications that one that needed and want to have historical data in order to complete the process and as you point out, we keep every record every week, every pay period. And we're now up to $570 million records, which as I mentioned earlier, equates to about 5.5 jobs from a job history status on the average American. In my case, it would be my Equifax records by Warbringers records and my GE records. So we have those historical records, and they are incredibly valuable. And it's a big part of the competitive position or moat, we have around the business is those historical records are a big part of that because the only way you can develop those is over time. And of course, we've been at this for a decade of building out the data set and maintaining all those records. Hey Simon. Well, as John pointed out, we can hit it again, is that in the mortgage application process, there's a difference in this market than there is in a normal market. John pointed out that there's more consumers or homeowners that are -- when they're doing a home purchase that are doing shopping for rates. And generally, when a consumer does rate shopping, a credit file will be pulled by the mortgage originator and make sure that consumer can qualify for the mortgage that they're re-shopping on, and then they'll deliver some kind of a response around what rate they can deliver. And the consumer will hit a bunch of mortgage companies in this higher rate environment in order to check rates. And that results in credit holes, which is good for USIS and part of their outperformance, if you will, of the number of poles that they have. Conversely in workforce when you're rate shopping, they don't pull income and employment until further into the application process. It might be when an application is actually filed versus rate shopping. And of course, it's always pulled during the closing of the application. I think John was pointing out a change from a more normal mortgage environment because of rate shopping benefits the credit file and somewhat doesn't benefit the income and employment data. Now of course, Workforce Solutions has all the levers to perform the mortgage market, it starts with as we add more records, we have higher hit rates. So they get more revenue as they add records and records are up 22%. So that's a benefit for them. In any mortgage environment that's still benefiting them today. New products are benefiting them, fuel prices. We did a price increase in January. So that's benefiting their business penetration is still a benefit. Remember, they're only seeing what now, 65% of mortgages, a little over 60% a little over 60% of mortgages. So as they get out there and remember the credit file is used in virtually every mortgage, because it's been around for 50, 60, 70 years, so the ability to drive commercially into those mortgage originators that are not using in our income and employment data from Workforce Solutions. And then as we point out, system-to-system integrations, which have grown dramatically, but there's still a lot of web access. And we know that with web access, we don't get every application from mortgage originators. They're doing manual verification. So you've got multiple levers for workforce to continue to outperform the mortgage market, be it at a bit lower level than in a normal environment. Yes. Any change in revenue is high incremental margin up or down? And I think as we pointed out earlier, we've opted to continue to invest in the second half for the future of Equifax. So meaning, as our mortgage revenue came down, we're not taking costs out. We're focusing on redeploying some costs or still continuing to invest going forward. I don't know, John, would you add to that? We see very high variable margins on the upside and the downside. They aren't necessarily always exactly the same for the reasons that Mark indicated, but the variable margins on our revenues are certainly quite high. A couple of layers in there. So we still are confident in our plan to increase our margins, so no change in our outlook for 2025 or 39%. No change in the cost benefits that we're going to deliver this year, next year, 2023 from the cloud transformation, no change in the broader margin expansion. In the near-term, we are continuing to invest in new products. Obviously, we're still investing in completing the cloud transformation. We have some additional investments on onboarding. Some of the new partnerships we have for records and Workforce Solutions. So we're continuing to do opportunistic or may be targeted as a better term investments that we think will benefit 2023, 2024, 2025 in 2022. And so there's no question we're doing that. Would you add to that, John? Hey Heather. Yes, it's a great question. We certainly think about it, Heather, but we think the timing is not right for us to do that. As you know, we announced this morning another bolt-on acquisition, which we think will benefit Equifax quite strongly going forward. And we're still digesting some of the M&A we did in 2021. So, it's certainly on our mind when the time is right to return cash to shareholders, both through restarting our dividend and doing a buyback, we don't think the time is right today. But it's coming. As we look to 2023, 2024, 2025 with our margins expanding and our free cash flow expanding, we clearly believe we have ample resources to invest in that bolt-on M&A, but also have excess cash in the future to return to shareholders, and we'll do that at the right time. Hey, George. Yes, I'm not sure when I said that or John said that, Jeff, that we didn't intend to say that. So when we think about our view of Equifax today versus the last recession, we think we're much better positioned. It starts with Workforce being so much larger than it was before. And kind of broadly in Workforce as we point out in 2008, 2009, it grew 17% when Equifax was down 6% and it was a very small business in the scheme of Equifax, and it's got more levers today. So we think workforce is positioned to grow in a recession because of all those levers. So we're very clear on that. And with that being approaching 50% of Equifax, that's a big factor. We talked about identity and fraud being kind of a business that we expect to grow through a recession just because of the digital macro is benefiting there. There's a couple of businesses that are quite uniquely positive in a recession like our unemployment claims business, which is part of workforce. So those are kind of 60% of Equifax. And then the 40% as kind of the rest, which is our credit business is primarily international and USIS. And those are generally impacted negatively by a recession. Inside of that negative impact, I think I tried to say that the negative of prescreens and volume coming down and originations coming down is dampened somewhat not offset, but dampened somewhat by account management increasing by credit line actions and line management actions increasing. So there's more volume there. But we would expect those to have some pressure. Now you also got to think about the timing of the recession, as you point out, which is different in Equifax today than 2008, 2009, if you think a recession is going to be in 2023, for example, we've got unique levers we didn't have in 2008, 2009. We're in the throes of completing our cloud transformation. And the cost savings that come from that are not impacted by the recession. We're going to execute the cloud transformation, the benefits that 250 basis points is going to flow through. As you also point out, new products is a different game at Equifax today than it was in 2008 and 2009. The kind of focus, the resources and the vitality we're delivering, that's going to benefit us in a recession, having more solutions in market and being cloud native. So those are benefits. And then the fourth point I hit earlier in our comments was around M&A. The acquisitions we've made in the last 24 months, which, as you know, is well above historical trends, meaning we've done a bunch of M&A of 11 acquisitions, over $3 billion of TEV. Those are in our run rate revenue, but the synergies are kicking in the latter part of 2022, 2023, 2024. So that's going to be a positive for us as we think about the recession. So those are all the factors we put together. We haven't done a revenue, EBITDA, EPS forecast on a recession, but we've tried to share with you some of the factors we think about that are positive and negative, and there's a whole bunch more positives at Equifax certainly today than there was in the last economic event. Those recession impact the businesses would decline, right? So, yes. Thanks, Jeff. Sure. It's Mark here. We're aware that Experian is doing some work and investing around the income and employment space. We don't see them commercially yet, meaning that we haven't seen any impacts from their work that they've done. They've got a -- our understanding is a very small data set compared to our 144 million records or 110 million actives. And so we just haven't seen an impact. That said, it hasn't slowed us down in our investments in technology and products. And of course, in our M&A focus we're one of our priorities, one of our top priorities around M&A is to strengthen Workforce Solutions to ensure that we continue to build the moat and the competitive position around the business. And including the acquisition we announced this morning of LawLogix making that business stronger. So we're clearly focused on continuing to build out Workforce, which is our largest and fastest-growing business. Yes, for one."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and Trevor Burns, Head of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we eliminated our GCS operating segment and moved its lines of business into Workforce Solutions, USIS, and international in Canada and Europe. As a result, Equifax now has three operating segments. You can find reconciliations of our 2020 and 2021 prior business unit operating segment results to this new structure in the 4Q '21 earnings release Q&A. Equifax has a non-controlling ownership interest in a Credit Bureau in Russia. We are providing no operational or financial support to the company. In the first quarter, we wrote off our investment and reflected a $19.5 million one-time charge. And beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we are no longer reflecting income from the venture. Also in the first quarter, Equifax deposited the remaining balance of $345 million into the restitution fund for the U.S consumer class action settlement. Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Equifax is off to a very strong start in 2022 and delivered a record $1.36 billion of revenue which was up 12% and well above the levels we discussed with you in February. We continue to execute very well under delivering strong core revenue growth while delivering on our key EFX 2023 strategic initiatives. However, as we look to the remainder of 2022, we are reducing our full year financial guidance reflecting the likelihood of a much more substantial decline in the U.S mortgage market than we expected in February. Over the past several months, mortgage rates have increased more rapidly and expected with the 30-year mortgage rate reaching over 5% last week, a 10-year high. And there's increased expectation for further increases in U.S interest rates as we move through 2022 as the Fed manages record levels of inflation. As a result, our guidance now reflects the likelihood of a much more rapid and significant decline in mortgage originations than we expected a few months ago. With U.S mortgage credit inquiries for the -- over the last 9 months of '22, declining on the order of 37.5% or 38%. Over the last half of 2022, we expect U.S mortgage credit inquiries to be down 40%, which we believe is equivalent to mortgage originations being down more than 40% and is in line with most market forecasts including NBA and Fannie Mae. This level of mortgage market credit inquiries over the last half of 2022 is approaching 25%, below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 and also pulls forward the mortgage market declines we had expected in 2023 into 2022. U.S mortgage credit inquiries in early April are beginning to show some of this weakening and are at levels somewhat weaker than we saw in the first quarter, but are not anywhere near the levels of decline we've included in our guidance. However, given the recent substantial increase in mortgage rates and expectation for further rate increases, high inflation and the war in Ukraine, our guidance reflects the much higher likelihood of a more significant decline in U.S mortgage market as we move through the second quarter, and continued significant sequential declines as we move through the balance of the year. We thought it was prudent to de-risk our guidance for the mortgage market and pull forward from 2023 the normalization of the mortgage market into '22. For the full year, this results in U.S mortgage credit inquiries being down about 33.5% for the year, which is almost 10% below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic and 2020 and about 12 percentage points below the 21.5% decline in our February guidance. For the balance of the year, this equates to a 37.5% reduction versus the same period in 2021. And as I mentioned earlier, a run rate of 40 -- minus 40%, which is 25% below the 5-year pre-pandemic levels in the latter parts of 2022. The impact on our revenue guidance of this additional 12% reduction in the mortgage market is over 350 basis points or over $175 million. We expect to offset just under half of the mortgage revenue declined with stronger core revenue growth that will now exceed 17% from stronger workforce solutions performance and NPI rollouts, which is an increase of about 150 basis points or $175 million for the year. Broadly, Equifax is operating very well with our first quarter core growth of 21%. Together this results in a reduction in our full year revenue guidance by $100 million to a midpoint of $5.2 billion, which is still up a solid 6% after absorbing an over $500 million decline from the mortgage market. The $100 million reduction in revenue and the elimination of income from our non-controlling interest in our Russian joint venture of $0.12 a share, drives our guidance for EBITDA margin expansion in '22 to about 125 basis points increase, but a reduction of 50 basis points from our prior framework. This also results in guidance for our adjusted EPS to a midpoint of $8.15 a share or reduction of $0.50 per share. As I mentioned, at these levels, we still deliver solid '22 revenue growth of 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 7% despite a significant mortgage market decline impacting our revenue by almost 10.5 points, or over $500 million. Our ability to deliver 17% core revenue growth reflects the underlying breadth, depth and strength of the Equifax business model, and is well above our new long-term growth framework of 8% to 12%. John will provide more details on our view of the mortgage market and our guidance shortly. Turning to Slide 4, the first -- in the first quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance range. Revenue at $1.36 billion was up 12% with our organic constant currency growth of 8%, and was the highest quarterly revenue in our history, and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. This was delivered despite a U.S mortgage market or credit inquiries were down 24.5% in the in the quarter about as expected. Core revenue growth of 21% and core organic revenue growth at 17% were both very strong and well above our new long-term financial framework. Our growth was again powered by our U.S businesses Workforce Solutions and USIS. In total, Workforce Solutions and USIS generated $1.08 billion in revenue, almost 80% of Equifax total revenue, with 14% total and 7.5% organic revenue growth, again, despite the 24.5% decline in the U.S mortgage market inquiries. Non-mortgage U.S revenue represented over 60% of total U.S revenue and delivered growth of over 32% total, with organic growth of just over 18%. International also delivered strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency, above the high end of their long-term framework of 7% to 9%. First quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $484 million, up 12% and EBITDA margins of 35.5% were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted EPS at $2.22 a share was up a strong 13% from last year and above the guidance of $2.08 to $2.18 we provided in February, driven by strong revenue growth and progress in realizing the benefits of our cloud technology transformation. We continue to accelerate our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter, including migrating approximately an additional 10,700 customers to the cloud in the U.S and approximately 1,500 customers internationally, as well as decommissioning two significant data centers this month. As you may have also seen, we recently issued our second annual security report, which is another important illustration of our ESG commitment and the power of our EFX cloud transformation and cloud technology and data transformation. In 2018, we committed that Equifax will become an industry leader in security. Our latest report highlights our investments in market leading cybersecurity capabilities and talent that enable us to detect and respond to threats with more speed and precision. We view our leading security capabilities as another competitive advantage for Equifax. Leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure, we continue to accelerate new product innovations. In the first quarter, we released about 30 new products continuing momentum from 2021 where we launched a record 151 new products. We're seeing increasing commercial traction and revenue generation from these new products leveraging the new Equifax cloud. In the quarter, our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last 3 years exceeded 12%. This is over a 300 basis point improvement from our 900 -- 9% vitality index last year, and the highest level for Equifax in the last decade. For 2022, we now expect a vitality index of over 11%, up 100 basis points from the 10% guidance we provide in February -- we provided in February, which will fuel our growth in 2022, 2023 and beyond. In the first quarter, we invested our strong free cash flow in two strategic bolt on acquisitions, with a focus on accelerating growth in Workforce Solutions with the acquisition of Efficient Hire and expanding our geographic footprint with the acquisition of Data-Credito, the largest Credit Bureau in the Dominican Republic. Bolt on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are strong leverage to accelerate our growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth from strategic bolt on acquisitions. Even facing the macro mortgage market headwinds, we are energized by our strong start to 2022 and are clearly seeing the momentum from our EFX 2022 growth strategy leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities. Turning now to Slide 5. In the first quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars, grew very strong 21% which was above our expectations and substantially above our long-term framework -- financial framework of 8% to 12%. Core organic revenue growth of 17% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework. Non-mortgage growth in EWS and international as well as the U.S drove about two-thirds of our core organic revenue growth in the quarter. Strong 27% core mortgage outperformance in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining third of first quarter core organic revenue growth. With our strong 21% core growth in the first quarter, and accelerating NPI rollouts, we now expect 2022 core revenue growth of over 17%, which is up about 150 basis points from our February guidance and 250 basis points from our original 2022 framework. This is driven by broad base strong performance across Workforce Solutions, as well as strength in international, Kount Identity and Fraud, Appriss Insights and accelerating NPIs. As detailed on Slide 6, core mortgage revenue growth in first quarter was up a very strong 17%, driven by Workforce Solutions with their core mortgage revenue growth of 27% and 2% of USIS. Due to the strong core revenue growth, our first quarter mortgage revenue was down only 7% despite the 24.5% decline in overall U.S mortgage market. Core mortgage growth of 27% at Workforce Solutions was consistent with our guidance in February and driven by twin record additions, new products, increased system-to-system integrations and increased penetration. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding core revenue growth, delivering over 40% growth for the fourth time in the last five quarters. This is very strong performance is driven -- this very strong performance is driven by Workforce Solutions, consistent execution across their key growth levers. First, growing the work number database. As we mentioned in February, we signed three new exclusive arrangements with large payroll processors late last year that we expect to implement starting in the second quarter. And we signed another new exclusive payroll processor agreement last month that we expect to also bring on board in 2022. We ended the quarter with 135 million total current records, which was up 19% from last year. There are 104 million unique individuals deliver high hit rates and represent about 65% of U.S nonfarm payroll. The flat sequential performance from year-end was also very strong as we offset reductions of approximately 3 million records from the normal seasoning hire declines from the fourth quarter with new record additions. As of today, we're already back to over 136 million records as we have begun boarding records from one of the new exclusive payroll processor agreements we signed late last year. And as a reminder, almost 50% -- 55% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers. Second, EWS's increasing penetration in their key verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance, with all four verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by leveraging our expanded data hub strategy for the fast-growing talent and government markets driving over 80% core growth in these verticals. Third, EWS is delivering increased average revenue per transaction through both higher value new product rollouts and increasing the value or pricing of existing products by expanding the depth and breadth of our data coverage. And finally, Workforce Solutions expanding their system-to-system integrations. Currently more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system-to-system, up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get a 20% plus lift in mortgage polls when we convert our customers from the web to system integrations. In talent solutions, system-to-system now represents more than 80% of our transactions. And last, Workforce Solutions continues to add capabilities in records through strategic bolt on acquisitions. Over the past 2 years, we've completed five bolt on acquisitions supporting EWS growth, including Appriss Insights last fall and Efficient Hire a few weeks ago. The strength of Workforce Solutions and unique system value of their twin income and employment data was clear again in the first quarter. Rudy Ploder and EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 33% revenue growth, well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework and are positioned to deliver a very strong '22 and continue above market growth in the future. Turning to more details and Workforce Solutions on Slide 5, another exceptional quarter delivering record revenue of $649 million, their first quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 33% with organic revenue growth of 20% despite the significant decline in the U.S mortgage market. Core revenue growth was a very strong 45% in the quarter with core organic revenue growth of 34%. Non-mortgage is now 60% of Workforce Solutions revenue, delivering organic growth of over 30%. Verification Services revenue was over $500 million for the first time, with strong growth driven by non-mortgage verticals that represent almost 50% of Verifier revenue and delivered 90% total and 50% organic growth. The inorganic growth was driven by the acquisition of Appriss Insights that performed very well during the quarter, driven by higher volumes, product penetration and new customer wins. Talent and Government Solutions, which now represent 30% and almost 40% of Verifier non-mortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters and combined were up a very strong 100% total and over 55% organic growth. The continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub and the fast growing $5 billion Talent and $2 billion Government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions over 540 million historical records for new products. The introduction of the unique Appriss Insights National Student Clearinghouse data and other talent related data assets, strengthens our ability to deliver new solutions leveraging the EWS data hub. The non-mortgage consumer lending business principally in banking and auto showed strong growth as well, up 40% in the quarter. Increasing records penetration, system-to-system integrations are driving growth in auto, card and consumer finance and debt management grew over 25% in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, mortgage revenue for Workforce Solutions was up 3% versus last year, 27 points stronger than the overall U.S mortgage market decline and consistent with our expectations that EWS would outperform the mortgage market by approaching 30 points in 2022. Employer Services revenue of $136 million was up a strong 33% in the quarter. Combined our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of $50 million, up 6% last year, but down 7% sequentially as expected. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down about 25% for all of 2022 driven by lower jobless claims and ERC as the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of $86 million, up over 55% versus last year with strong organic growth of over 15%. Our I9 business driven by our new I9 anywhere product continue to show very strong growth, up over 55%. In the first quarter, our I9 and onboarding business made up over -- made up almost 25% of Employer Services, non-UC and ERC revenue. Our combined Health e(fx) business, which is the combination of Equifax workforce analytics and our Health e(fx) acquisition that we acquired in the third quarter last year represented about 45% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter and delivered total growth of just under 70% with organic growth of about 1% as expected. As we discussed, the seasonality of ACA revenue was concentrated in the first half of the year. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6%, consistent with the guidance we provided February and very strong. The decline in margins versus last year was principally driven by the addition of Appriss Insights and Health e(fx). And as expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. As shown on Slide 9, continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub is a key strategic focus for Workforce Solutions and the engine driving future growth in the fast-growing Talent and Government Solution markets. Talent Solutions delivered 145% total and 80% organic growth in the quarter. And we began introducing new multi data talent products in the quarter with new product introductions expected to accelerate as we move through 2022 leveraging the Equifax cloud. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 89% total and 39% organic with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. As I mentioned earlier, Appriss Insights performed very well, delivering 20% growth in the quarter from increased volumes, new customers and success with existing products. More broadly, we expect revenues from NPIs to increase as the integration of Appriss Insights continues in the back half of 2022. Shifting now to Slide 10 and USIS, their revenue of $433 million was down 6% compared to first quarter last year, and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which were $140 million, and is about 30% of total USIS revenue when it was down 21% for the quarter. Positively, this was about 300 basis points stronger than the overall mortgage market decline of 24.5%. Importantly, USIS delivered their fifth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B non-mortgage revenue at $242 million, which represents over 55% of total USIS revenue, and was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2%. This was somewhat lower than the mid-single-digit organic growth we discussed in February due to the timing of deal closures in their financial marketing services business. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth, which excludes FMS was strong, at up 10% with 6% organic growth. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, commercial and identity and fraud, and auto and direct-to-consumer both showed high single-digit growth. In telco and banking and lending grew in the mid-single digits. Kount had an outstanding quarter with organic revenue growth approaching 50%. The Kount teams now delivered two consecutive quarters of very strong new deal bookings and along with the monetization of synergies between the Kount and Equifax customer and product base and continued vertical expansion. Our core new product growth continues to be very strong in Kount and the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data that we believe will drive strong growth in '22 and beyond. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $46 million, down 14% from last year's 12% growth. Importantly, we continue to see growth in marketing related projects, but our batch business was below our expectations. As we discussed in the batch -- in the past, our batch or portfolio review project business can be choppy as the revenue is often driven by larger one-time offline data licensing projects. We expect to return to growth in second quarter driven by growth in marketing pre-screen and in the portfolio review solutions inside of FMS. USIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S D2C business from GCS, it was combined with USIS in the fourth quarter had revenue of $51 million, up 2% year-over-year, which was below our expectations. With their cloud transformation complete, the team is now focused on delivering best-in-class consumer experiences, leveraging the cloud to roll out new products, and leveraging B2B relationships in traditional financial services credit unions and new fintech players to return the business to growth. The USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins resulting in a healthy win rate. The new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipeline slightly higher than the fourth quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.3% in the quarter, about flat with fourth quarter and slightly better than our expectations. Turning to Slide 11, our investments and acquisitions of Unique data assets are positioning U.S for sustainable long-term non-mortgage growth. Our Unique data goes far beyond traditional credit data and contains alternative data covering telco payment history, specialty finance transactions, cash flow and bank transaction, wealth data, e-commerce transactions and unique commercial business data. These Unique and only Equifax datasets provide scores analytics and insights that allow lenders to increase approval rates, expand credit lines and reduce losses, particularly with underbanked consumers. These differentiated alternative data assets are important growth lever for USIS to deliver new solutions that will help expand access to credit and the over 60 million on and underbanked population in the United States. Earlier this week, Equifax announced the new data partnership with Fiserv, a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions to leverage their unique data assets in combinations with -- in combination with Equifax data to deliver new solutions to the market. We intend to co-innovate with Fiserv to develop solutions that will help financial institutions and other businesses embrace the power of expanded data and real-time data insights to drive speed, the Kount acquisition mitigate risk and improve overall customer experience with an initial focus on small business commercial solutions. We're very energized about our new partnership with Fiserv. Shifting now to international on Slide 12. Their revenue of $281 million was up a very strong 10% on a local currency basis. Europe revenue was up 6% -- 16%, driven principally by our U.K debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue. As you recall, in December, Equifax was awarded a 4-year extension with the U.K on their government debt resolution contract with an estimated value of $136 million, with an incremental $90 million of potential incremental sales from analytics and other CRA related solutions. Our European CRA business was up 2% in the quarter driven by growth in identity and fraud insurance and telco and partially offset by the U.K direct-to-consumer business which was below our expectations. Asia Pacific revenue was up 6% driven by strong growth in our Australia commercial business, verification services, and identity and fraud. Latin America was up a strong 23% driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Central America. The team's strong new product introductions over the past 3 years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across the region. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America. Canada was up 2% and below our expectations driven by lower volumes in consumer direct and mortgage market declines from higher interest rates. And auto was flat for the quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.4% were down 150 basis points, primarily due to the elimination of equity income from our Russian joint venture that John discussed. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margins would have been about flat with last year and slightly -- and up slightly from our expectations. As shown on Slide 13, we're off to a very strong start with our new product vitality index over 12% in the first quarter, which is above our 10% goal for the year and the highest vitality index since we began tracking this measure over 10 years ago. Building on the record 151 new product introductions last year, we delivered about 30 new products so far in 2022, which is on a similar strong pace to the fourth quarter. Some of the more significant new product launches are detailed on the slide. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver vitality index in 2022 of over 11%, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue this year. The 11% vitality is up 100 basis points from our February guidance and up 200 basis points from our strong 2021 results. NPIs are central to our long-term growth framework in driving EFX top line growth. As detailed on Slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow in accretive and strategic bolt on M&A is central to our EFX 2023 growth strategy and our new long-term growth framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth each year from strategic bolt on M&A. And we're starting '22 strong with two strategic and accretive bolt on acquisitions, Efficient Hire and Data-Credito. Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded Employer Services to hospitality building services and senior living markets. The acquisition also allows Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market, and of course provides us with incremental twin records. Data-Credito is the largest consumer credit reporting agency in the Dominican Republic that adds to our strong market presence across Latin America. Since the beginning of 2021, we've completed 10 strategic bolt on acquisitions that strengthen and broaden EFX and that fit our M&A priorities. Number one to expand and strengthen our strongest and fastest growing business Workforce Solutions. Number two to add unique data assets. Number three to expand in a fast growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four to work to expand our global credit bureau footprint. We're well down the path of integrating the acquisitions in the EFX cloud and driving synergies to accelerate our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter and our full year 2022 guidance.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed earlier, we have updated our view of the U.S mortgage market reflecting the significant changes in current and expected future levels of U.S interest rates. As shown on Slide 15, in 2022, we are now expecting declines in U.S mortgage credit, increase of 33% in the second quarter and 40% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, which we believe is consistent with mortgage originations being down over 40% and is consistent with market forecasts. As we saw in the first quarter, the decline in mortgage inquiries was less than the expected mortgage originations, we believe driven by increased shopping by consumers as rates began to rapidly rise. We expect to see some of the same behavior, but at lower levels as we move through the remainder of the year. As we have shared in prior quarters, Slide 16 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left, and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. Our updated assumptions for U.S mortgage market credit inquiries, we believe are consistent with the trends these charts reflect. The left side of this -- the left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages. The in-the-money population as of mid-April when the 30-year fixed rate was about 5% is about 3.3 million homes, down about 80% from the levels we saw in January when rates were 3.6%. As the in-the-money population declines, mortgage refi is increasingly driven by cash out refis, that are often executed with no rate benefit or rate increase. For prospective, for Black Knight data from February 2022, about 25% of refinancings were by borrowers that had an increase in our borrowing rate. As shown on the right side of Slide 16, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically high levels about consistent with the levels we saw in 2021. Our assumptions for the U.S mortgage market over the last 9 months of 2022 are consistent with the trends just discussed. We have assumed that U.S mortgage purchase market volume stays strong, but declines in the second half by 5% to 10% from the levels we saw in 2021. We're assuming that the U.S refinance market volume declined substantially with volume increasingly driven by cash out refis. We expect refi volume to be down over 50% in 2Q and over 60% by 4Q with significant sequential declines in each quarter. Refinance will be about one-third of total mortgage volume in the second half at the lowest levels we have seen over the last 10 years. Slide 17 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 6.2% constant currency and 5.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.2 billion. The 33.5% decline in the U.S mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 10.4%. Over 350 basis points and $175 million more negative than the levels we discussed in February. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business that we have discussed with you in February, total headwinds in 2022 revenue growth were about 11.5 percentage points. As Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be over 17% and up 150 basis points from the levels discussed in February. Core organic revenue growth is up 120 basis points with the remainder coming from the acquisition of Data-Credito. This stronger core revenue growth drives about $75 million in revenue benefit, offsetting just under half of the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Non-mortgage organic growth is driving almost 60% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth and talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions including I9. International and USIS non-mortgage are also expected to drive core growth. Slide 18 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 7% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.15 per share. Revenue growth of 5.6% at our 2021 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% will deliver 8% growth and adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of about 125 basis points is expected to drive about 6% growth and adjusted EPS. The reduction in EBITDA margin expansion by over 50 basis points from our prior guidance is driven by both the elimination of equity income from our Russian JV, which was reducing margins by over 30 basis points, as well as from the negative margin impact of the net loss of $100 million of high margin online revenue. We are on track to deliver the reductions in tech transformation expenses and savings from migration to our cloud systems that we discussed with you in February. Consistent with our guidance from February, depreciation and amortization is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022, as we accelerate putting cloud native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4 percentage points. Interest expense is higher in 2022 by about $26 million and higher than our expectation in February by about $6 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.7% does not assume any changes in the U.S federal tax rate. Slide 19 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS. EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of about 15%, as stronger non-mortgage growth is expected to be over 35% partially offsets the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 54%. USIS revenue is expected to be down 6% to 7%, reflecting the greater 33.5% assumed decline in the U.S mortgage market. Consistent with February, non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Consistent with our February guidance, combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to outperform the overall market by almost 20 percentage points. And international revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 79%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up over 50 basis points. The decline from our February guidance is due to the impact of the loss of income from our Russian JV. Absent this item, our guidance for international EBITDA margins is unchanged. Slide 20 provides our guidance for 2Q '22. We expect revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 4.4%. 2Q '22 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to down sequentially. Looking at business units in the second quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up almost 20% year-to-year with mortgage down mid-single digits and very strong non-mortgage growth continuing. EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat sequentially. USIS revenue is expected to be down about 6%. Non-mortgage is expected to be up 6% to 7%, partially offsetting mortgage revenue down just over 30%. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting lower mortgage revenue. International revenues expected to be up about 10% year-to-year in constant currency and EBITDA margins are expected to be up slightly sequentially. Corporate expenses expected to be about flat sequentially. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q '22 to be $1.98 to $2.08 per share, compared to 2Q '21 adjusted EPS of $1.98. We believe both our second quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 21, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage new EFX Cloud for innovation new products. EFX2023 is the foundation for our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX data cloud and technology transformation. And we now have over half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North American cloud migrations. We completed over 120,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations.  In North America, our principal consumer exchanges are in production on our new cloud-based single data fabric and delivering to our customers. Our International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some migrations being completed in 2024. And we're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities, and remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud native data analytics technology company. As shown on the next slide, Equifax is increasingly much more than a Credit Bureau and focused on faster growing identity and fraud, talent, employer and government verticals. The consistent execution of our strategy over the past 4 years and the strategic bolt on acquisitions we completed in '21, and so far in 2022, are all aligned with our strategy and in faster growing markets. In 2022, over 50% of Equifax revenue is expected to be outside our traditional consumer and commercial Credit Bureau Market segments, principally in Workforce Solutions and our identity and fraud businesses. These businesses represent about two-thirds of our 45 billion addressable markets in identity and fraud, talent, government, and HR services as well as the employment and income portions of our credit businesses, with growth rates twice as fast as our traditional credit markets. As we move forward, these businesses will increasingly become larger portions of Equifax and drive our top line growth. As shown on Slide 23, very strong 17% core revenue growth in '22 and 22% growth -- core growth last year is driven by our outperformance in higher growth vertical markets. We are a different company today with over 40% of Equifax revenue, delivering over 10% growth. And even more powerful are the businesses delivering over 20% growth in fast growing markets, including Workforce Solutions, which is up 30% -- 33% in the first quarter, with their talent businesses approaching 150%; their government business up about 90%; their consumer lending business up 40%; and I9 anywhere over 50%. Our Kount business and the identity and fraud space delivered almost 50% growth in the fast-growing market. Our Appriss Insights business was up over 20% and our 11% NPI vitality index is fueling our growth. These faster growing verticals in new markets like talent, government and identity and fraud are driving our top line and allow us to outgrow underlying market macros. Wrapping up on Slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad base quarter with 12% overall growth and 21% core growth, more than offsetting the 25% decline in the mortgage market with broad based performance which was above your and our expectations. We are operating very well with strong momentum and now have delivered nine consecutive quarters of strong above market double-digit growth reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is resilient and on offense. We have strong momentum and are delivering the strongest results since the 2017 Cyber Event and arguably the strongest results in the past 10 years at Equifax. At our Investor Day last November, we discussed how the execution of our EFX2023 strategic priorities including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, would lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth. And as you know, we introduced the new long-term financial framework with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt on acquisitions. We also expect to deliver margin expansion of 50 basis points per year over the long-term that will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth at 12% to 16%, which combined with our 1% dividend yield target will allow us to deliver a total return to shareholders of 13% to 18%. The rapidly changing and unprecedent environment makes forecasting the impacts of the U.S market -- mortgage market incredibly challenging. We do not take guidance changes lightly. But we thought it was prudent to de-risk the year by reducing our U.S mortgage market credit inquiry outlook to down 37.5% for the balance of the year, resulting in a full year decline of 33.5% in our mortgage market. This includes a decline in the mortgage market of 40% in the back half of '22, which is approaching 25% below the 5-year run rate levels from prior to 2020 and pull-forward the market declines we'd expected in 2023 into 2022. We also believe this equates to mortgage originations being down more than 40% in the back half of 2022, which is aligned with most market estimates. We feel this is a prudent and balanced framework given the unprecedented macro environment. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient and continues to deliver strong results. Our updated outlook deliver 6% growth offsetting more than $500 million over 10% of mortgage market decline, with strong core revenue growth of 17% in 2022, which is up 150 basis points from our February guide, and over 250 basis points from the framework we shared with you at our Investor Day in November. Our ability to offset the 33.5% decline in the mortgage market and deliver 6% total growth, driven by 17% core growth is powerful. Looking back at the '08, '09 global financial crisis, which is the last time we saw a macro event like this impacting the mortgage market, Equifax revenue was down 6% versus the 6% growth we will deliver in our 2022 framework. We're different company today. A more diverse, resilient, faster growing higher margin, higher free cash flow company, a new Equifax with stronger growth levers. Workforce Solutions is our strongest and fastest growing business and will be north of 45% of our revenue in 2022 with a run rate -- runway to move past 50% of Equifax revenue in the near future. A 33% growth in the first quarter is over 4x the growth rate of the rest of Equifax and the 55% EBITDA margins are over 15 points above our average and highly accretive to Equifax. Workforce Solutions has multiple levers to deliver their 13% to 15% long-term growth rate, which is highly accretive to Equifax. Our core non-mortgage market growth is very strong at 21% in the first quarter and 17% in our new 2022 guidance and above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. We think about core revenue growth as a strong indicator of the breadth, depth and strength of the underlying Equifax business model. We expect our mortgage teams will continue to outperform the market decline by almost 20 percentage points in 2022, consistent with our February guide, with Workforce Solutions outperforming by approximately 30 points from pricing NPIs new twin records, new customers and system-to-system integrations. And as you know, we're in the early days of leveraging the 50% of Equifax that's now in the Equifax cloud environment and we're just starting to realize the top and bottom-line benefits from the cloud. As we move over the coming months and quarters to be fully cloud native, the top and bottom-line benefits will really kick in over the next 2 to 3 years and drive our top line while enabling us to achieve our 2025 margin goal of 39%. And as we talked on the call this morning, we're ramping our new product capabilities, leveraging our differentiated data assets in the Equifax cloud. Our vitality index in 2022 will now be 11% or over $500 million, which is up 9% last year and 100 basis points from our start in 2021. NPIs are fueling our growth. And last, our 10 bolt on acquisitions in the last 15 months are adding $375 million to our run rate revenue. But more importantly, the M&A synergies will be kicking in during 2022 and 2023 as we complete our integrations and drive our NPI rollouts. To be clear, we believe Equifax continues to operate at a very high level. There's no change in our long-term outlook for Equifax. The change in our mortgage market framework simply pulls forward the market normalization into 2022. We remain confident in our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and 50 basis points a year of long-term margin expansion that we rolled out at our Investor Day in November. And there's no change to our 2025 goal of $7 billion of revenue and 500 basis points of margin expansion to reach EBITDA margins of 39%. We are a new Equifax. A more resilient, more diverse higher growth and higher margin company. I'm energized by our strong first quarter performance, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. I'd like to close by welcoming Trevor Burns back to the Equifax leadership -- senior leadership team. We announced earlier this week that Dorian Hare has taken another position outside of Equifax and we wish him well. We'd like to thank Dorian for his service, leading Investor Relations for the past 2 years. Trevor will now reassume the lead responsibilities for Investor Relations effective immediately. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate and I applaud the de-risking of the mortgage. I just had a question around the incremental or decremental margins there. John maybe of the $0.50 EPS reduction, it sounds like $0.12 is from the Russia write-down. So is the remaining all on the mortgage side, I was just hoping you would help us understand that a bit.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So, the remaining revenue decline of $100 million, right is the revenue decline offset by $75 million of non-mortgage growth, but it's all online, revenue decline. And Manav, as you know that we have very high mortgage \u2026\nMark Begor: In mortgage.\nJohn Gamble: \u2026 in mortgage, yes. But as you know, we have very high variable margins across online, online mortgage as well. So, it flows through and you can just do the math, right, it flows through it's something on the order of 60% is the -- what we brought forward.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Mark, maybe just on the talent side, some -- pretty impressive growth there. Can you just help us appreciate the volume or cyclicality to that business? Obviously, the labor market is hot. And so, the touches on that kind of data is good. Do you anticipate that slowing down? Or how should we think about the sensitivity there?\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a great question, Manav. I think as you know, 75 million people a year change jobs, every year. It's a -- it's one that has some cyclicality, but there's an underlying base, it's very, very high. The growth that we're getting, though, is really from our penetration in the market, the new products we're rolling out, leveraging the work history we have in the 540 million records, where we have a resume for Manav of all the jobs you've had, so that work history is very valuable. And the kind of the macro change in talent is around speed, which we don't think is going to change, meaning hiring managers want to get that individual on the floor more quickly. That\u2019s always the case, even pre-pandemic and instant data that you can get from Equifax, work history data and now with incarceration data, we have medical credentialing data, we have the education data, and we're adding more datasets there allows the background screeners, which are our customers and other hiring businesses to really speed up their decisioning for the hiring manager. So, the bulk of the growth that we have there, and it's obviously, very, very strong, and we expect to continue is really putting these solutions together. And we've got more new products in the pipeline that we plan to bring out. We've talked with you before and others that, last year, we rolled out solutions that had more work history versus where does Mark work today with Equifax, where he work over the last 10 years. So those solutions we rolled out last year, and we're bringing those to the market. Those are really driving a lot of the top line growth. And then in 2022, we'll start combining some of the solutions like incarceration data with the work history, with education data to have a one click solution, and then we'll customize those around job categories. Because as you know, in each hiring process, the data that's used is different depend upon who you hire, a white-collar worker versus a banking employee versus a warehouse worker versus a truck driver or a dentist or a doctor. Those are all different data requirements, which is where we want to work towards productizing around families of jobs, which again, will make it easier for our customers to pull the data and then also results in higher revenue for Equifax because we're bringing more value to the space. The other point I would make out is we're increasingly driving system-to-system integrations here. You go back a couple years ago, like mortgage, the talent space was accessing a lot of our data through the web, through a manual web interface, meaning keying into the web and putting Mark's name in there and pulling down the data, moving the system-to-system, we get the same lift going forward. So, there's a lot of runway still with that going forward. So, it's a space that we like, it's a big space and one that we see a lot of potential going forward.\nMark Begor: Just one thing to add, we can see the power of the historical records, because if you look at twin revenue excluding mortgage, take mortgage out of the mix, we're now seeing over 50% of the revenue include historical records.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, I know you've talked about this a lot, but clearly you're outperforming the mortgage market pretty dramatically. Mark or John, can you bracket because it looks like the USIS will be down about 6% to 7% versus mortgage down 33%. Is there any way to think about just a couple of buckets of what's driving that relative outperformance just trying to frame it on a percentage basis, just to contextualize that a little bit more?\nMark Begor: And Kevin, your question is around USIS in particular versus EWS?\nKevin McVeigh: Yes, USIS if you want to open it up to EWS as well, it's fine.\nMark Begor: Yes, maybe I'll start John. But there's a number of levers that we have to outperform all our underlying markets and you can use mortgage in particular, obviously, that gets more challenging when you talk about a mortgage market in the second half, that's going to be down 40%. But we've had strong outperformance for a long history. Workforce has more levers than USIS, but both businesses and I'll talk about USIS. One of their levers outperform underlying markets is price, increasing the price of the solution or the credit file and both Workforce Solutions and USIS have regular price increases that help them offset or increase their revenue depend upon where the markets going. The other is new products. Both businesses rollout new solutions. And Workforce Solutions has a lot more product opportunities than USIS, but USIS has had some new product rollouts to help them outgrow the underlying or in this case, in 2022, declining market. Third is going to be new customers. In USIS's case, that's really in their tri-merge business, growing some share there will grow their revenue. In Workforce Solutions, as you know, we only see 60% plus of mortgages still. 40% are done with manual paper pay stubs, we've been growing that. So, adding customers is a lever, or usage, if you will, is a lever. The other one both businesses have is the number of polls that happen in a transaction, and that's been growing in both USIS and in Workforce Solutions. Particularly as you see more digital interactions with consumers, which we would characterize as shopping, meaning consumers are shopping for mortgages and deciding which mortgage originator to work with in that shopping process, which is fairly new and more utilized in the last couple of years. And it's here to stay in our view, there's some data polled to qualify the customer. So, in the shopping process that mortgage originator can respond with some framework about the offer. So that's a place where number of polls, is another opportunity for the business. System-to-system integrations in USIS, it's virtually 100%, fully system-to-system. And Workforce Solutions, we've talked many times that of the 60% of mortgages, we see about 70% plus are system-to-system. We've been growing that, that's up, I think, 50% from where it was 3, 4 years ago. So, there's still opportunities versus web access. And in system-to-system we get a 20% lift in the number of polls. And then the last one that I touch on, it's really unique to Workforce Solutions is growing records. As you grow records, we have higher hit rates. Remember, in a system-to-system integration, or even a web access, our customers are coming to us for all of their mortgage applications or in their process. And when they do that, when we grow our records, which are up 19%, year-over-year in the first quarter for Workforce Solutions, that becomes revenue. We're able to monetize those additional records, which is why we're so focused on records.\nJohn Gamble: Hey, Kevin, if you're specifically just talking about USIS being down 6% to 7%, relative to the market being down 33.5% again, 6% to 7% are total revenue, right and the order of two-thirds of their revenue is non-mortgage. So, and we're seeing 6% to 8% growth in their B2B revenue, which is over half of their revenue, which is consistent with the long-term framework for USIS. And we're also expecting to see growth at a somewhat lower level, but growth in the consumer business that came over from GCS. So, it's those two -- the two-thirds of the business that's showing nice growth, that's offsetting the weaker mortgage market. And as Mark said, USIS is also outperforming the mortgage market.\nKevin McVeigh: That helps. And then just real quick, John. What percentage of total Equifax is mortgage in kind of Q1 and then where do we think it'll end 2022?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, the Q1 was about 29.5%. And then as we move through the year, I think we'll get down to the point where we're just -- we're in the neighborhood of 21% to 22% as we get into the fourth quarter.\nKevin McVeigh: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, John. On the mortgage percentages you just gave was that the U.S mortgage revenue or total mortgage revenues? I heard you mentioned mortgage in Canada today. My second question is, I know you like to look at core growth rates. I'm going to ask a question that's total. Could you tell us what the first quarter organic non-mortgage growth rate was?\nJohn Gamble: Okay. So the first question, the 29.6 is total, right. But Canada is very small.\nMark Begor: It's really U.S.\nJohn Gamble: It's really driven by very, very small and we'll validate that to make sure, but I believe that's correct. And then in terms of core organic \u2026\nAndrew Steinerman: No, no. I don't want to work core. I just want first quarter organic non-mortgage, total company.\nJohn Gamble: First quarter organic. So, I don't think that's a number we've disclosed, right, we give core organic, right. We gave organic for the business units.\nMark Begor: And we give total.\nJohn Gamble: And we give total.\nMark Begor: But certainly, one that -- we probably don't have in front of us here, Andrew, and we can look at getting that for you.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Mark, I was hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in Europe. It seemed like this was a good quarter, in the first quarter, but was that more front end weighted? And just trying to think about how you're viewing it for the rest of the year?\nMark Begor: Yes, we haven't seen any different. In Europe, for us, as you know, as U.K and Spain, which is really where we participate there. We're seeing a positive as the government and companies in the U.K., following the pandemic start to focus on some of the collections that were suspended during the pandemic timeframe. So that's kind of a positive for the business, which we expect to continue through 2022. And the underlying kind of credit businesses, we don't have kind of a mortgage issue. If you want the mortgage market macro in Europe, in our two countries, because we really don't participate in mortgage there. And it's really operating what you'd see in the non-mortgage business, here in the States, where it's pretty, pretty steady. And we see elements of kind of post-pandemic recovery, card issuers wanting to do marketing, wanting to rebuild their balance sheets, similar discussion around consumers, being fairly strong meaning employment is high, unemployment is low, which is kind of a good macro in those markets, same in Canada, Australia, and frankly, in Latin America, around the globe, people are working. So, outside of the interest rate environment, and then you can, as a result the inflation environment, the higher interest rates are going to attempt to offset. You see consumers that are working low unemployment, that have better balance sheets than they had coming into the COVID pandemic, because they got some stimulus spending, and of course, they're working. So, we're pretty optimistic for kind of the core portions of the business, and we're delivering that when you see the results.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific, very helpful. And just thinking about mortgage in 2023, you talked about some of the decline that you were expecting in '23, you're pulling it forward into your '22 guidance. Are you thinking that 2023 sort of returns to what a normal level like we've been seeing -- that we saw on like 2015 to 2019? Or is there sort of more to go even beyond this year, just given the match of outperformance from prior -- the prior 2 years?\nMark Begor: I think as John and I both mentioned, we tried to really stress kind of the mortgage market outlook. And let me be -- obviously transparent. This is a hard thing to forecast. We don't know where interest rates are going to go. It's pretty clear, they're going to go higher. We've never seen a Fed navigate an 8.5% inflation environment with full employment. That's a very tricky thing to do. So, it's probably hard to forecast. But what gave us comfort in de-risking, the outlook for 2022, which as you point out, and I did to that pulls forward what we thought would have been a more gradual return to normalization, until inflation heated up. We think that that's a pretty strong stress scenario from the way we looked at it. And as John pointed out, when you go back the past 5 to 10 years, pre-COVID, meaning -- and pre-COVID meaning is pre the refi run up when interest rates were slashed because of the COVID environment and refis really exploded. We're 25% below kind of a normal market when we exit the year. And really in the second half, that we think is kind of as low as it can go because when you think about the mortgage market, there's a steady purchase volume even in a recession. And this -- I don't know how to talk about what environment this is. It's certainly not a recession. But even in a recession people move. 40 million people a year move, they're buying houses, so there's a steady level of purchase volume. And then even in a rising interest rate environment, consumers do refis, particularly when they have some level of equity in their homes. And that's another calculus and looking at the way we tried to stress the mortgage environment and came up with our kind of down 40 in the second half is -- there's still a lot of home equity out there that's untapped. And doing cash out refi is even at higher interest rates is something you could see consumers do, and we've seen them do before. So, a bit long winded. But what we tried to do was really stress this in this uncertain environment to kind of is a darker mortgage environment as we could see.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham. Your company -- your line is now live.\nKyle Peterson: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to touch on kind of the performance in the non-mortgage business. Really impressive, especially given the mortgage headwinds. What do you guys think is the biggest driver behind that? Is it other credit products kind of performing better than expected? Or is it a share gain story? Or kind of what do you think is driving the upside on the non-mortgage side?\nMark Begor: Yes, how much time do we have? We went through a lot of factors. I would start first with Workforce Solutions. Workforce Solutions, and we went through in real detail in our comments, non-mortgage businesses are very strong. And then, yes, I know you asked about non-mortgage, but even their ability start with growing records. Records up 19%, and the ability to continue to grow records, and their history of growing records, that puts a -- an element in the business, both mortgage and non-mortgage. Your question was around non-mortgage. So, as we grow records and what's unique about workforce is, we don\u2019t have all the records. And up 19% in the first quarter we've got three, now four larger kind of chunkier additions. Of course, we're doing M&A to add records through our Employer Services, business. So I would say that one unique element at Workforce. Certainly, our pricing power in Workforce and to a lesser degree in USIS allows us to outperform and drive non-mortgage growth. But then, as I talked about in the back half of my comments, some of the new verticals we're in where we're making acquisitions, or leveraging the cloud to roll out new products, like the talent space, or the government space, really strong growth rates they were delivering there. And then more broadly, Workforce, I think, is one which I talked about a bunch. The second is new products. Our new products are primarily a non-mortgage, because that's where most of our businesses, and that\u2019s where we're rolling them out. And a lot of our new products, as you know, are really leveraging our historical or multi data solutions. Whether it's in the talent space, instead of having a solution, that's where it is Mark worked today, which is what historically we had. Now we have, where did Mark work over the last 24 months, where at the last 36 months, in the last 48 months, the last 60 months. And we're going to add more different solutions there. Those are at higher price points. So that's driving the business. And we have commercial activity where we're out there winning share in USIS and of course, in EWS where we're just placing paper pay stubs that drives it. We talked about system-to-system integrations. I think the power of Equifax is we go through 2022 and into '23 and '24, is our differentiated data assets. It's the fact that we're really ramping NPIs, but we haven't finished the cloud. So, we're only in the early innings of really leveraging the cloud. That's going to come in the latter parts of '22 and '23. That's where we're really going to be able to drive that going forward. And I think you got a sense that taking up our guidance, really for the second time this year, around core growth, with most of that being driven by non-mortgage core growth, shows our confidence in the underlying strength of the company, which is our ability to bring new solutions to market, executing on our cloud transformation and really driving into some of these new markets, like identity and fraud, like talent, like government that have higher underlying growth rates than traditional FI credit bureau kind of markets.\nKyle Peterson: That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on kind of your updated thoughts on capital allocation. You guys have given some pretty detailed thoughts at the Analyst Day in November. But I guess just given the higher rate environment of any -- the priorities in the near-term change between debt reduction or potential M&A or new product launches that will kind of help you diversify away from mortgage faster. Just want to see how you guys are thinking about it in this current environment?\nMark Begor: Yes, so there's a couple of different questions there. First on our capital allocation, we were pretty clear at our Investor Day. We talked about it really in every earnings call, no change in that. First, we believe our free cash flow will continue to accelerate meaningfully through '22, and '23 and '24. And there's no change in what our free cash generation will be in 2022. We're still confident in that. And that free cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility, certainly around M&A. And as you know, we've done well over $3 billion of M&A in the last 15 months, all of that M&A has been oriented in kind of non-mortgage, if you want to use that term. But really in kind of core areas of Workforce Solutions, differentiated data that that's really been clearly our focus is to broaden Equifax. And you saw the slide that we put in the deck, again, that we had at Investor Day about our broader focus into faster growing markets. There -- we don't have competitors that talk about growing in the $2 billion government TAM. We don't have competitors that really talk about growing in the $4 billion talent TAM. I think they have focused on the identity and fraud, TAM that we're playing in, but really a clear focus there. And as our cash flow continues to accelerate, our priorities are certainly investing in Equifax, which we're doing through the cloud transformation. As you know, we're going to complete that, then that'll free up cash for us to invest more in new products going forward, which should drive our top line. But outside of investing in CapEx, we still view M&A as an important way to do bolt on acquisitions to strengthen the core of Equifax, really discipline around where we want to do it to strengthen the core of workforce, differentiated data, or identity and fraud. But then there's going to be excess free cash flow from Equifax. And as our EBITDA continues to grow, as we go through '23 and '24, we're going to delever the company. And at the right time, we'll certainly look at returning some of that cash to shareholders through buyback, or through increasing our dividend. We're not ready to do that today, but we are clear in our Investor Day that that's a -- kind of that balance of how we think about a capital allocation framework going forward against the backdrop of a significant increase in both our free cash flow going forward and our leverage available -- cash flow available from leverage as we grow our EBITDA.\nKyle Peterson: That's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I just wanted to go back to the comments that you made about the health of the consumer balance sheet being really healthy, which makes sense. But one of the concerns is that the higher fuel prices inflation, there may be some cracks in the low to mid income consumers, which could potentially weigh on consumer lending. Maybe in the back half of the year. I was just wondering, based on your conversations with the banks, have they indicated any slowdown there, or any color on that front around the state of the consumer itself?\nMark Begor: Yes, we haven't seen it. And our looks are we don't expect to see it based on what we see 2022 unfolding. Certainly, inflation is a real challenge, fuel prices, food prices, et cetera. 8.5% is very, very high inflation. Some states in the U.S are above 10%. But at the same time, people are working, wages are up meaningfully for a lot of wage categories. So that's a positive. And when I talk about their balance sheet, it's really over the last 2 years, they couldn't spend much because we were in the COVID pandemic lockdown. And there was a lot of stimulus, which is still out there. There's still a lot of stimulus coming from -- and again, I'm talking about the U.S government. While they're not individual payments, a lot of the social services payments, some of the requirements have been suspended. You've seen the administration talking about pausing on student debt collections that helps balance sheets for a lot of consumers that are working out there, and they're very low unemployment. And then when we talk to the banks, and you've seen some of their numbers in the last couple of weeks, like use credit card originations, up 10% -- I'm sorry, credit card usage up 10% and the bank's balance sheets declined during COVID. So, you've got very strong customers, meaning in our financial institutions that need to grow their balance sheets, and you've got what I would still argue is a fairly strong consumer, because of the wage inflation and the fact they're working and you add to stimulus, is balancing out the inflation, but it's certainly something you will continue to watch going forward.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color, Mark. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe just on the USIS non-mortgage B2B business. The improvement that is expected from the first quarter to second quarter obviously you provided a lot of good color. I was just wondering how much of it is coming from just volume growth at your existing customers, but also from customers going -- sorry, accessing alternate data sets as well as potential new events? So, I was wondering if you could comment on those two, the new wins, the pipeline there as well as the demand? Obviously, we've continued to see greater demand for alternate data. But are you seeing more of that in the near-term? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, for sure. Just again on USIS, we were quite pleased with their core online business. It was up really -- slightly above or at our expectations on the online piece, which is comes from either market share gains, or new solutions that we're delivering that deliver the online. The piece that USIS didn't deliver on within their batch, or account management, review business, there was really just some timing in March, and some of those deals closed in April. And so we expect USIS to continue moving their growth going forward in the second quarter through the rest of the year in non-mortgage. And we are seeing some good wins in the marketplace, both with the market share gains we expect from being cloud native, providing stronger stability, those are going to continue to be a positive for the USIS commercial team going forward. And as you point out, our increasing focus on alternative data in our single data cloud fabric is another positive and we're seeing definite traction around the use of alternative data. All of our customers are looking for new data solutions to help them drive originations. And when you add some of the unique data assets that we have, which we believe we have at scale, more -- much more than our competitors, those are the kinds of solutions that the USIS team are bringing to market through our new products that we're rolling out.\nJohn Gamble: And just some color on just USIS online in the first quarter non-mortgage, our FI business was up over 10%. So that was good growth. We saw auto and insurance up high single digits, again, very good growth. And as Mark mentioned in the script, Kount was up almost 50%, which is identity and fraud. So we feel good about the way the online business was trending [multiple speakers] covered, yes.\nAshish Sabadra: Sorry about that. Yes, thanks.\nMark Begor: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on Workforce Solutions. Maybe if you could update us or just walk us through the ability to take some of the products we have in the U.S and bring them to international markets? Is every international market sort of available to you to penetrate around Workforce Solutions? Or sort of just walk us through which markets are more penetrated versus others? Is it an early innings today?\nMark Begor: Yes, it definitely early innings. We see kind of global market opportunity. As you may recall, pre our cloud transformation, we launched Workforce Solutions businesses in Australia, Canada and in India. We paused on doing any more international rollouts until we got our cloud stack in place for Workforce. And then about a few months ago -- actually a month and a half ago, we announced our entry into the U.K., where we have our cloud stack in there. And we're starting to onboard records from companies and partners in the U.K. So those are the four markets we're in today. We're definitely intending and looking to grow in other markets in the future. And even in markets where we don't do business, meaning we don't have Credit Bureau businesses. As you know, we're in 25 countries outside the United States, but we see the opportunity. And you think about some of the leverage points we have. Number one is our cloud stack, meaning our infrastructure. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars building this and now we can just move it very easily into a new market. Second is our existing customer or contributor relationships if you're a big multinational company, like a GE and IBM, pick a big industrial company, a bank that's doing global business, and there's a bunch of those in the United States. If we're doing the income and employment verification for them here, they liked the idea of us doing it for them in all their global markets. So that's a kind of an opportunity to load records and add in those different markets. And then last is payroll partners that we have. As you know, we've got a substantial number of them on an exclusive basis, most of them are exclusive. And same thing, a handful of those in the U.S are global. And we already have the connections, the pipes, the relationships with them here in the States. So, the ability to do the same thing globally is a leverage point for us. So, you should look for us to do more. In the scheme of Equifax, or Workforce, what's going to move the needle is more of the U.S levers that Workforce has over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years, but you would expect us to, and we are, investing in some of these longer-term opportunities outside the United States, like the U.K expansion that we did a few weeks ago.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question is just around the cloud transformation. I think you said half of your revenue is on the cloud. Maybe if you could talk about, and maybe you mentioned this already, but just timing of when the other 50% of revenue comes on the cloud and just related to the cloud, the cost savings are baked into your 2022 guide. What is that number again, that's baked in around cost savings? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Sure. I'll start and let, John, jump in. So, at year-end, we had about 50% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax cloud. We talked about that in our February call. By the end of this year, 2022, we expect to have substantially completed North America, which is U.S and Canada, all of that in the cloud. So that'll be a big jump for us. And as you know, the United States for us revenue wise is approaching 80% of Equifax. And then International, some of the international markets, we won't complete until '23 and there might be some migrations that will complete in 2024. So that's really our runway around -- completing the cloud. And I'll let John jump on the actual cost savings. But as you know, we had some cost savings last year, a bigger number this year, they continue in '23 and they're likely be some in 2024. But they're all embedded in our 500 basis point margin expansion between now and 2025. I think on Investor Day, we talked about half of those roughly being from the cloud. So, if there's any change in that, and John can talk a little bit about the actual numbers.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So, what we talked about in the past, right, is that we -- in terms of transformation investments, as you went from '21 to '22, that you would see savings and investments, net of new product development reinvestment [indiscernible] the order of $40 million to $50 million. That's still correct, we're still moving forward with that. We also indicated that we would see net cloud savings as we move through 2022. And as Mark said, those were embedded in the margin guidance we gave. We didn't give specific dollar values. But the net cloud savings will be delivering this year as more and more moves on to the cloud. A cloud native infrastructure is embedded in the guidance that we gave, the updated guidance today is for up 125 basis points in 2022 relative to 2021.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live.\nCraig Huber: Yes, good morning. Thank you. My first question, maybe give us a flavor of the new products that you've rolled out that you're excited about here in the U.S? Let's start there, please.\nMark Begor: Oh, my gosh, how much time do we have? We talk about it in every call we have. There's a bunch. And I would really focus them in a couple of buckets. First is Workforce Solutions. We talked about this before. If you go back a couple of years, Workforce Solutions products they deliver to market were generally around a snapshot of where does someone work today and how much did they make, and a bunch of attributes, but they were really time based and current. And so, one of the big changes we've been able to do as a result of the cloud is really leverage those historical records. And whether it's looking at someone's income and employment over a long timeframe in a mortgage application, or looking at their work history, in the hiring or talent space that trended or time-based data, historical data is incredibly valuable and was very difficult to do pre the cloud transformation. So that's been a big change. And those products are really solving a lot of our customers problems. Our customers needed more than just where does Mark work today for certain consumers, that -- if they have a -- if you're a sales commissioned employee, my income today might not reflect my annual income because I get my bonus in February. So having that 12 months data is incredibly valuable, and we can sell it at a higher price point, using the example of a Workforce Solutions that we would sell at $30, $40, $50 per pole for kind of where does Mark work today, that historical data we're able to bring to the marketplace because of its value to our customers at $150, $135, $200. So, I would say that's a very powerful element of the cloud transformation that allows us to bring new solutions to market. And more broadly, Workforce Solutions, because they're further down the path in the cloud. They're really taking advantage of that, rolling new products out. And I think we talked like in the talent space, we added the 24 -- the 12 month, 24, 48-month work history for some jobs, the hiring manager wants to see more history, those were at higher price points. But we're now going to move to productizing around job category. Meaning if you're a warehouse worker, you're going to need certain types of data, we're going to we're going to develop a one click solution to deliver all that data for that kind of job and that employee. And then someone who's a white-collar worker, is going to have more education data that has to be a part of that poll and other data elements. So that's kind of where we're going product wise. The other bucket, I would say that we're excited about is multi data solutions. And that's really driven by our single data fabric, which is very unique to Equifax. WE had siloed datasets, our competitors have siloed datasets, we're going to a single data fabric, and the ability to combine data, think about the credit file, combined with our cell phone utility payment data, our wealth data, different data elements, the cloud allows us to do that. And that's something that our customers want that alternative data because it drives higher predictability, but it's difficult for them to absorb in pieces. And that's why we're going to serve it up in a single data fabric and then in product solutions, where we combine it together. So, I'd say that's the other bucket of solutions. And then the last is just we're in just different verticals today. You go back a couple, 3 years ago, we were primarily in financial services, bringing new solutions, like I9 anywhere to our Employer Services business, where we're delivering solutions, compliance solutions to HR managers, or as we talked about in talent or government, those are just faster growing markets. And very different than our core FI or Credit Bureau space that you're really energizing. And, of course, the focus we have on it. We've added a bunch of resources in, really '19, '20 and '21. I have a direct report to my leadership team. My leadership team, it's our Chief Product Officer. And then the cloud really gives us a lot of leverage to bring those new products to market.\nCraig Huber: That's great. My other question is in -- what is embedded in your outlook for the rest of the year for the U.S for autos, credit cards and personal loans? I mean, you gave us some good data there, how it did in the first quarter. Are you expecting that this significantly slow the rest of the year, given the higher interest rate environment? How are you sort of think about those three categories for the rest of the year? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes, we don't see any change in those categories in 2022, already had some comments around the consumer. And we don't think the higher interest rates will impact that in cards or -- autos impacted today by supply shortages. We're dealing with that and the market is, I'm not sure when that's going to be resolved. That's more of an inventory issue, but the underlying consumer and the underlying customer of ours that's trying to grow their financing businesses. We don't see any change from where we were a few months ago.\nCraig Huber: That's it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live.\nSimon Clinch: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's kind of -- maybe a difficult one to answer. But I was thinking about the pace of outperformance that we've seen from the mortgage revenues in EWS over the last several years, can we learn anything from that and use that as a guide to how we should think about the outperformance or the growth? Has the non-mortgage verification services business really started to take off? As in, should we expect a much faster pace of growth initially at the outset, maybe even faster, because you've got even more records now. And then perhaps a faster normalization, as -- I guess a more compressed cycle, before you get to a more normal sort of level of outgrowth there.\nMark Begor: Yes, that's a complex question, Simon. Let me talk about a couple of things. The one thing that I always start with, and I know you do too, it's very unique about Workforce Solutions is the ability to grow their assets, their data assets, meaning their twin records and drive revenue growth. And we talked before, when you think about 19% revenue growth in the first quarter, that was -- they were up roughly 19% for the year, last year. We've already got a pipeline of additional records, those records translate into revenue, just because we have the system-to-system integrations, and it just takes our hit rates up. So, that's kind of a base element of their ability to outperform their underlying markets, because you're adding records. And then you add on top of that, the ability to roll out new products, drive system-to-system integrations, all of those that we've talked about drive penetration, drive usage, those are all become levers for them to drive their top line growth. And on top of that, when you talk about non-mortgage, as you know, they're operating in some underlying macro markets, whether it's talent, or the government space, that are just growing strongly. These are kind of 20% type, high double-digit growth type markets that help fuel their non-mortgage growth of Workforce Solutions. And I think, an Investor Day we talked about a 13% to 15%, long-term revenue growth rate for the business. Obviously, they outgrew that in the first quarter, they're going to outgrow that in 2022. They outgrew that in '20 and 2021. So, we see a lot of momentum in the business going forward, a lot of levers for growth going forward.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I mean, when we're just going back to mortgages. Just kind of curious to the comments made that you're now bringing your inquiry guide -- inquiry guidance, kind of in line with the outlooks provided by the NBA and Fannie Mae. Whereas previously, I can assume that you weren't doing that. And I was just kind of curious as to the reasons why you weren't using those sort of more public forecasts, what you saw on your numbers that made you more, more positive in those outlooks and why now it's time to go to the more extreme outlooks. When you said yourself that you're nowhere near those trends at this point.\nMark Begor: Yet, so just two things. First, I think what you would have seen over the past several months is obviously NBA, Fannie, Freddie have also substantially changed their outlooks, given the main ticket taking them down, given the significant increase in interest rates. And what we've been doing over the past several years, I think, which we've been very open about as we've been taking a look at the markets based on the run rate trends that we have in our own business, because we can see inquiries. And what we started to see and the reason we made the change we did is because we're starting to see that the inquiry trends that we were, that we can measure, were starting to decline more rapidly. So, as we took a look at the information we had, and the analysis we could do, we believe we're headed toward the type of the down 40% that we talked about, which as we do, the analysis, we now see is consistent with where NBA and Fannie are, but we think the analysis we've done and the analysis they've done are just more consistent to those point in time.\nJohn Gamble: I would add to point that, we talked about it a couple times this morning. But that kind of second half, fourth quarter run rate for the mortgage market that's underlying our new guide, its 25% below the kind of normal markets pre the COVID pandemic. And that's a pretty strong stress, and that was our -- intent was to put something that is it's very uncertain, how far interest rates going to go, how's the Fed really going to tame inflation, which they've never done before at this level with employment at this level. And that's why we decided to do a really strong de-risk of the underlying mortgage market, but then also have a lot of transparency about how the rest of Equifax is operating. Our strong core growth and actually stronger for this -- we took our guidance up for the rest of Equifax for the second time this year.\nSimon Clinch: Okay, excellent. Well, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Thank you and good morning. I wanted to spend my two questions on some updates in terms of recent M&A. Maybe I'll start with Kount. I think twice now you mentioned the 50% Plus or 50%-ish growth in that business seems pretty, pretty meaningfully higher than I think the 20% growth that was originally expected when you knocked the deal early last year. So, if you could spend some time kind of talking about what's going right in that business where the momentum is, and the extent to which that growth is, is based on synergies from the Equifax relationships or the Equifax business, or if it's just continued momentum in that area, broadly, both of those would be interesting topics, I think, to cover.\nMark Begor: Yes, so we are very bullish about the space first, identity and fraud and we're really energized about the team, the leader that we brought in, it's driving that business, and it's in a space that's growing rapidly. It's a digital macro is very, very strong. Their underlying growth is a big part of that. There's some elements of synergies, but I would say that those are more on the com, meaning some of the product solutions of combining Kount and Equifax data, we are more second half oriented, it's just a really strong execution, and they have a great product. We've added more resources in the business, I think the headcount in the business is up something like 20% or 30%, maybe it's more like that 30%, since we acquired the business. So, we're putting more feet on the street, we've got a new commercial leader, that's really partnering with the CEO that was the founder of the business that we really like a lot. We've also given the CEO responsibility for our full identity and for our business, so he was running Kount, during the 2021, early this year. He's now got responsibility for the whole business, and we think it will have a big impact there and really drive the synergies going forward. So, we're quite bullish about their market position, their pipeline, but it really starts with a space that's very good. And we bought a very attractive business that we're making stronger.\nAndrew Nicholas: That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a similar question on afterwards. I think, Mark, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned, new customer wins as being part of the growth driver in the first quarter. Same sort of question is, is that from Equifax relationships, or just the momentum of the business? And then maybe relatedly, are there any kind of big picture learnings from kind of having integrated that business, we're beginning to integrate that business over the past couple of months that you're already applying within the talent solutions market? Or Sure, the sectors in which it exists? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes, so great questions. First, on the Appriss business, another great business. I was there last week in Louisville, where they're headquartered with the team. We got a great leader there, and a great team, and the growth they're delivering is primarily from their own momentum. We only acquired them in October, so they're only a few months in. We're in the throes of integrating and bringing them into our technology and a cloud data fabric and the other elements on it. It's another space. So, they're winning new state contracts, they didn't have that were in their pipeline, when we acquired them, and just executing and the synergies that we're counting on, will really start kicking in the second half and '23, and probably likely into 2024. And we really liked the unique data. The criminal justice data that they have is very, very unique. And the instant decisioning from the talent space, plays in their world. And then, of course, in social services, it's also used. As part with regards to lessons learned, I sure wouldn't want to be doing these number of acquisitions if we weren't the cloud. It's -- it would be very hard to integrate these with the pace that we're going to be doing it. If we were still in our legacy environment, and that gives us a lot of confidence around doing acquisitions. And we're always learning about how we can do the integrations, more effectively, and -- but we've got some pretty good muscle around that, because it's not new for us. We've been doing acquisitions for a long time. Long before I joined 4 years ago, at Equifax, but we're getting better at it, I think and always looking to improve it. But the cloud gives us a lot of confidence, when doing M&A and I hope you agree that we're being very disciplined around the kind of businesses we want to buy. Our criteria and M&A is very clear. We want to grow, we want to buy businesses that are growing faster than Equifax. So, they're accretive to our growth rates.\nMark Begor: We want to buy businesses that are going to deliver margin accretion with Equifax. And most importantly, we want to buy businesses that strengthen the core of Equifax, whether it's around differentiated data, or around the Employer Services business as you point out. If you look at all of our acquisitions, they're checking those boxes. And then of course, identity and fraud, around Kount is just a space we'd like to get larger in and if you look at our acquisition so far this year, efficient higher, it makes us stronger in that. Employers Solutions space that, we want to be bigger in but also delivers more records to the Workforce Solutions businesses, they add new customers.\nAndrew Nicholas: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Mihalos: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Two quick ones. And I'll ask them upfront. Just first, a point of clarification, Mark and John on FMS. It sounds again, like it was just sort of a timing issue. You've got good visibility now in the second quarter. Your outlook has not changed at all for the year within that segment. And you maybe just kind of remind us how you're thinking about growth for FMS on a full year basis. And then secondarily, the $75 million of outperformance, if you will, from the core that's offsetting some of these mortgage headwinds, is that essentially all EWS and as you talked about some NPI benefits as well coming in, but is there any part of that outperformance that ties into USIS? And if so, what verticals or areas are performing ahead of your expectation? Thanks, guys.\nMark Begor: I'll do the second one, John and you could take the first one on FMS, which is an easy one, but under $75 million, the bulk of that for sure is Workforce Solutions. But International is also a piece of that. Internationals performing exceptional. USIS I think, is kind of aligned with where we started the year, we don't see any change. They're performing very, very well. The outperformance is a piece of that is from international, but the bulk is Workforce and it's all the levers we talked about on the call this morning.\nJohn Gamble: And in terms of non-mortgage really in USIS and we still expect them to perform in 6% to 8%, right. So, we believe in total non-mortgage which is both the online and the FMS portions, should still deliver in that 6% to 8% range, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'm just curious [indiscernible] EWS is easy taught you. You maintained your outlook for 30% outperformance versus the mortgage market. I'd love to get your thoughts in a sort of, I guess worse than expected mortgage market environment sort of your confidence in sort of that outperformance kind of why it's not one for one or and also your ability to take price and sell premium products in this type of environment. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, there's a number of levers there on the drives the Workforce Solutions outperformance broadly in all their markets, but we'll focus your question on mortgage. So, start with records. We have pretty good visibility around our record growth in we talked about the fact that we were up 19 in the first quarter. We talked about -- we've got three now four larger payroll processors coming online in 2022. So, as you know, that record growth translates into higher hit rates and revenue. So, that's kind of a big piece of that. Second is price. We did our -- we do our pricing actions late in the year, they go into effect in January and their effect through the year. So, we know what our prices on a year-over-year basis. That's pretty well nailed down. The new product rollouts, you saw our momentum in Workforce Solutions with our mortgage products that we rolled out in 2021. Those were rolled out during the year. We get the full year benefit of those, many of them are rolled out in the third and fourth quarter. So, we have kind of visibility on the take rate and the usage of those because they're solving specific solutions. So, we have pretty good visibility around that. There's visibility around customer wins that we're bringing online. Remember, 60% of mortgages are still done in paper pay stubs. We have visibility around system-to-system integrations that we're working with customers that are not system-to-system, they're web based. There's another element of visibility, around that element. And then, we have trended data around how often the twin datasets being pulled? As you know that's increased in recent years to two polls. We don't see any change in that. So, that's kind of in the [indiscernible]. What did I miss John, as far as our visibility?\nJohn Gamble: I think you've covered it right. Plus, the fact is we were down, market was down 25% in the first quarter. And they outperformed by approaching 30% or 27%, right. So, we feel like even in a down market, we've already seen similar to the down markets we saw late last year, they perform very, very well. We know it's much deeper as we go forward. But as Mark said, the big driver is records and penetration, which they continue to deliver on.\nHeather Balsky: Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up on the integration, you mentioned how much of your revenue is coming from system-to-system integrations? I'm curious, sort of on a penetration basis in the mortgage business. Kind of where you are in a customer bases and where you think it can go.\nMark Begor: And that's -- your questions around what portion of our mortgage customers are in the cloud environment? I'm not sure I heard it, right.\nHeather Balsky: Sorry, the system-to-system integrations that you talked.\nMark Begor: Yes, yes, sorry. Hey, Heather, I think actually what we're going to post the deck here in about an hour or two, and on that there'll be an update to that number. So great. Thank you. 11 o'clock. Sorry about that. Yes.\nHeather Balsky: Thanks. Great.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Just one for me. Want to see if you're willing to share any data around NPI uptake for clients that have completed their migration to your data cloud? It sounds like you have enough of the client base migrated at this point that we would start to have some data if that's seeing an explicit acceleration at NPI uptake or not. So, we'd love any data points on it. Thank you.\nMark Begor: That's a great question, Jeff. One that I don't have and John shaking his head also that he doesn't have, but it's one that I'm going to run down. I definitely want understand it. I think intuitively we find it there's some list there, but let us run it down.\nJohn Gamble: And given that the percentage of products that we're delivering are substantially above half as we talked about that are running on the new cloud infrastructure. I would expect it's probably a pretty good number.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in over here. Mark, you mentioned when there was a question about some of the levers in USIS to offset mortgage, one of the things you mentioned was price. I don't usually hear that too much in USIS. I hear that much more about, the work number and things like that. Is there -- is there a consistent pricing uplift every year, like you get in other parts of the market of your business? Or is there pushback from clients over there, maybe you can just kind of touch on that a little bit.\nMark Begor: I would say there's always pushback from clients when it comes to price. But we've been very clear, and we probably more often talk about price at Workforce Solutions, because they just have more pricing power. They're just more unique data asset than our -- than the credit file. But USIS, pretty regularly does price increases, meaning on an annual basis. And there's some element of price there, but it's not at the same scale, or leverages our workforce.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. So, there's consistent price lift, even though -- even on the basic credit file type stuff is what you're saying.\nMark Begor: In particularly a mortgage. Yes, that's a place where we have historically done kind of consistent price increases in USIS. In some of the other verticals, we may take price up, but then have concessions that happen. So, the pricing power is not as strong, in some of the other verticals.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Got it. And then one of the things that this is kind of a competitive type question, but one of the things I have heard out in the market is that there's competitors trying to get in terms of building their own databases, excuse me for income information, but you are incenting clients to keep Equifax at the top of the waterfall. And I'm wondering, like, how do you go about doing that if someone else was coming in with a lower price point?\nMark Begor: Yes. Your question is more around customers versus obtaining records or is it both?\nShlomo Rosenbaum: No, it's really like -- if you have a customer that can potentially use a much less effective database, but at a much lower price point, right. So, the strategy from the competitor is to go ahead and say use us first and then if you can't get it at the lower price, then move on to Equifax. So, I've heard from some customers that Equifax is aware of that obviously has some kind of strategy where you can incent the customer to keep Equifax at the top of the waterfall and I was just wondering how that works.\nMark Begor: Yes, I guess, our view of the marketplace is that our solution in the verticals we participate in for income and employment data is, price competitively meaning there, there aren\u2019t what we see in posted market prices, we don't see prices that are lower than Equifax. So, I don't think there's a price advantage there. What we do with some customers, when we tap top of waterfall, it's really to have them hit our database in a system-to-system basis versus doing manual efforts. So we've had some commercial incentives to move customers from doing manual searches around income and employment data to hit Equifax first. And part of that is, is that we've really had a very significant increase in our coverage over the last couple, 3 years. You go back, 3-years ago, we were below 50%. Now we're at 65%, approaching 70%. So, it was really more -- some commercial incentives to get customers to understand that they can get a hit very quickly from Equifax, but we haven't seen, what you described as, us having to commercially get in front of someone else who has a different solution to Equifax.\nOperator: Okay.\nJohn Gamble: Because there really aren't any other solutions at scale.\nJohn Gamble: Right now, I mean, pre-realistic [multiple speakers]. I know they're small, but I mean, some of those, that's what I was talking about -- some of them being out there. And they are very small, but that's how they're trying to get tested into the marketplace. And so, I was wondering about that.\nMark Begor: And again, we haven't seen any commercial pressure from that. They're very, very small. And it would surprise us that a customer would want to change a waterfall, [indiscernible] the system effort involved in the very low hit rates, and again, there's not a pricing advantage or cost advantage for [indiscernible].\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you and good morning. I just, I know we've covered a lot of ground. But I just wanted to ask about EWS EBITDA margins, because just given the strong growth that you're seeing on the top line, I would have expected a little bit more flow through on the margin side. And I know you've talked about acquisitions, but I was hoping for a bit more color, maybe you can give us what organic margins were in that business, or if there's like a mix impact as it relates to various verticals, like are the new products at a lower margin. Just a little bit more color around how we should think about the drivers of margins there.\nJohn Gamble: Yes, so we had really nice margin improvement, right, from fourth to first. And we are and we are certainly incurring some of the impact from the recent acquisitions, which the acquired businesses generally just want to have margins that are as accretive as ours. So, you are seeing that in the first quarter. We don't really disclose an inorganic and organic EBITDA margin, but we feel very good about almost 55% margins that we're seeing. And we think it's really an outstanding performance, we indicated. I think we expect them to be 54% for the full year. So, we feel very good about the trend in EWS margins, and obviously they are investing in new products to drive faster growth. So, we certainly encourage that. But we think operating at this range of 54% to 55% margins is outstanding.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. So, there's no mix impacts that we should think about by vertical or product?\nJohn Gamble: We certainly have different margin levels for different products. Generally speaking, most of the Verifier products have relatively similar margins. There are different margin profiles between Verifier and Employer. But again -- I think generally speaking, 54% to 55% margins very, very strong. We feel very good about them.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nMark Begor: We just wanted to thank everyone for participating. If you have more questions, please reach out to Investor Relations.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and Trevor Burns, Head of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we eliminated our GCS operating segment and moved its lines of business into Workforce Solutions, USIS, and international in Canada and Europe. As a result, Equifax now has three operating segments. You can find reconciliations of our 2020 and 2021 prior business unit operating segment results to this new structure in the 4Q '21 earnings release Q&A. Equifax has a non-controlling ownership interest in a Credit Bureau in Russia. We are providing no operational or financial support to the company. In the first quarter, we wrote off our investment and reflected a $19.5 million one-time charge. And beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we are no longer reflecting income from the venture. Also in the first quarter, Equifax deposited the remaining balance of $345 million into the restitution fund for the U.S consumer class action settlement. Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark. Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed earlier, we have updated our view of the U.S mortgage market reflecting the significant changes in current and expected future levels of U.S interest rates. As shown on Slide 15, in 2022, we are now expecting declines in U.S mortgage credit, increase of 33% in the second quarter and 40% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, which we believe is consistent with mortgage originations being down over 40% and is consistent with market forecasts. As we saw in the first quarter, the decline in mortgage inquiries was less than the expected mortgage originations, we believe driven by increased shopping by consumers as rates began to rapidly rise. We expect to see some of the same behavior, but at lower levels as we move through the remainder of the year. As we have shared in prior quarters, Slide 16 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left, and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. Our updated assumptions for U.S mortgage market credit inquiries, we believe are consistent with the trends these charts reflect. The left side of this -- the left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages. The in-the-money population as of mid-April when the 30-year fixed rate was about 5% is about 3.3 million homes, down about 80% from the levels we saw in January when rates were 3.6%. As the in-the-money population declines, mortgage refi is increasingly driven by cash out refis, that are often executed with no rate benefit or rate increase. For prospective, for Black Knight data from February 2022, about 25% of refinancings were by borrowers that had an increase in our borrowing rate. As shown on the right side of Slide 16, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically high levels about consistent with the levels we saw in 2021. Our assumptions for the U.S mortgage market over the last 9 months of 2022 are consistent with the trends just discussed. We have assumed that U.S mortgage purchase market volume stays strong, but declines in the second half by 5% to 10% from the levels we saw in 2021. We're assuming that the U.S refinance market volume declined substantially with volume increasingly driven by cash out refis. We expect refi volume to be down over 50% in 2Q and over 60% by 4Q with significant sequential declines in each quarter. Refinance will be about one-third of total mortgage volume in the second half at the lowest levels we have seen over the last 10 years. Slide 17 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 6.2% constant currency and 5.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.2 billion. The 33.5% decline in the U.S mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 10.4%. Over 350 basis points and $175 million more negative than the levels we discussed in February. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business that we have discussed with you in February, total headwinds in 2022 revenue growth were about 11.5 percentage points. As Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be over 17% and up 150 basis points from the levels discussed in February. Core organic revenue growth is up 120 basis points with the remainder coming from the acquisition of Data-Credito. This stronger core revenue growth drives about $75 million in revenue benefit, offsetting just under half of the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Non-mortgage organic growth is driving almost 60% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth and talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions including I9. International and USIS non-mortgage are also expected to drive core growth. Slide 18 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 7% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.15 per share. Revenue growth of 5.6% at our 2021 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% will deliver 8% growth and adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of about 125 basis points is expected to drive about 6% growth and adjusted EPS. The reduction in EBITDA margin expansion by over 50 basis points from our prior guidance is driven by both the elimination of equity income from our Russian JV, which was reducing margins by over 30 basis points, as well as from the negative margin impact of the net loss of $100 million of high margin online revenue. We are on track to deliver the reductions in tech transformation expenses and savings from migration to our cloud systems that we discussed with you in February. Consistent with our guidance from February, depreciation and amortization is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022, as we accelerate putting cloud native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4 percentage points. Interest expense is higher in 2022 by about $26 million and higher than our expectation in February by about $6 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.7% does not assume any changes in the U.S federal tax rate. Slide 19 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS. EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of about 15%, as stronger non-mortgage growth is expected to be over 35% partially offsets the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 54%. USIS revenue is expected to be down 6% to 7%, reflecting the greater 33.5% assumed decline in the U.S mortgage market. Consistent with February, non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Consistent with our February guidance, combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to outperform the overall market by almost 20 percentage points. And international revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 79%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up over 50 basis points. The decline from our February guidance is due to the impact of the loss of income from our Russian JV. Absent this item, our guidance for international EBITDA margins is unchanged. Slide 20 provides our guidance for 2Q '22. We expect revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 4.4%. 2Q '22 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to down sequentially. Looking at business units in the second quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up almost 20% year-to-year with mortgage down mid-single digits and very strong non-mortgage growth continuing. EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat sequentially. USIS revenue is expected to be down about 6%. Non-mortgage is expected to be up 6% to 7%, partially offsetting mortgage revenue down just over 30%. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting lower mortgage revenue. International revenues expected to be up about 10% year-to-year in constant currency and EBITDA margins are expected to be up slightly sequentially. Corporate expenses expected to be about flat sequentially. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q '22 to be $1.98 to $2.08 per share, compared to 2Q '21 adjusted EPS of $1.98. We believe both our second quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Yes. So, the remaining revenue decline of $100 million, right is the revenue decline offset by $75 million of non-mortgage growth, but it's all online, revenue decline. And Manav, as you know that we have very high mortgage ... ... in mortgage, yes. But as you know, we have very high variable margins across online, online mortgage as well. So, it flows through and you can just do the math, right, it flows through it's something on the order of 60% is the -- what we brought forward. Hey, Kevin, if you're specifically just talking about USIS being down 6% to 7%, relative to the market being down 33.5% again, 6% to 7% are total revenue, right and the order of two-thirds of their revenue is non-mortgage. So, and we're seeing 6% to 8% growth in their B2B revenue, which is over half of their revenue, which is consistent with the long-term framework for USIS. And we're also expecting to see growth at a somewhat lower level, but growth in the consumer business that came over from GCS. So, it's those two -- the two-thirds of the business that's showing nice growth, that's offsetting the weaker mortgage market. And as Mark said, USIS is also outperforming the mortgage market. Yes, the Q1 was about 29.5%. And then as we move through the year, I think we'll get down to the point where we're just -- we're in the neighborhood of 21% to 22% as we get into the fourth quarter. Okay. So the first question, the 29.6 is total, right. But Canada is very small. It's really driven by very, very small and we'll validate that to make sure, but I believe that's correct. And then in terms of core organic ... First quarter organic. So, I don't think that's a number we've disclosed, right, we give core organic, right. We gave organic for the business units. And we give total. And just some color on just USIS online in the first quarter non-mortgage, our FI business was up over 10%. So that was good growth. We saw auto and insurance up high single digits, again, very good growth. And as Mark mentioned in the script, Kount was up almost 50%, which is identity and fraud. So we feel good about the way the online business was trending [multiple speakers] covered, yes. Yes. So, what we talked about in the past, right, is that we -- in terms of transformation investments, as you went from '21 to '22, that you would see savings and investments, net of new product development reinvestment [indiscernible] the order of $40 million to $50 million. That's still correct, we're still moving forward with that. We also indicated that we would see net cloud savings as we move through 2022. And as Mark said, those were embedded in the margin guidance we gave. We didn't give specific dollar values. But the net cloud savings will be delivering this year as more and more moves on to the cloud. A cloud native infrastructure is embedded in the guidance that we gave, the updated guidance today is for up 125 basis points in 2022 relative to 2021. I would add to point that, we talked about it a couple times this morning. But that kind of second half, fourth quarter run rate for the mortgage market that's underlying our new guide, its 25% below the kind of normal markets pre the COVID pandemic. And that's a pretty strong stress, and that was our -- intent was to put something that is it's very uncertain, how far interest rates going to go, how's the Fed really going to tame inflation, which they've never done before at this level with employment at this level. And that's why we decided to do a really strong de-risk of the underlying mortgage market, but then also have a lot of transparency about how the rest of Equifax is operating. Our strong core growth and actually stronger for this -- we took our guidance up for the rest of Equifax for the second time this year. And in terms of non-mortgage really in USIS and we still expect them to perform in 6% to 8%, right. So, we believe in total non-mortgage which is both the online and the FMS portions, should still deliver in that 6% to 8% range, George. I think you've covered it right. Plus, the fact is we were down, market was down 25% in the first quarter. And they outperformed by approaching 30% or 27%, right. So, we feel like even in a down market, we've already seen similar to the down markets we saw late last year, they perform very, very well. We know it's much deeper as we go forward. But as Mark said, the big driver is records and penetration, which they continue to deliver on. And given that the percentage of products that we're delivering are substantially above half as we talked about that are running on the new cloud infrastructure. I would expect it's probably a pretty good number. Because there really aren't any other solutions at scale. Right now, I mean, pre-realistic [multiple speakers]. I know they're small, but I mean, some of those, that's what I was talking about -- some of them being out there. And they are very small, but that's how they're trying to get tested into the marketplace. And so, I was wondering about that. Yes, so we had really nice margin improvement, right, from fourth to first. And we are and we are certainly incurring some of the impact from the recent acquisitions, which the acquired businesses generally just want to have margins that are as accretive as ours. So, you are seeing that in the first quarter. We don't really disclose an inorganic and organic EBITDA margin, but we feel very good about almost 55% margins that we're seeing. And we think it's really an outstanding performance, we indicated. I think we expect them to be 54% for the full year. So, we feel very good about the trend in EWS margins, and obviously they are investing in new products to drive faster growth. So, we certainly encourage that. But we think operating at this range of 54% to 55% margins is outstanding. We certainly have different margin levels for different products. Generally speaking, most of the Verifier products have relatively similar margins. There are different margin profiles between Verifier and Employer. But again -- I think generally speaking, 54% to 55% margins very, very strong. We feel very good about them. Thanks very much."

            "content": "Thanks, John. Equifax is off to a very strong start in 2022 and delivered a record $1.36 billion of revenue which was up 12% and well above the levels we discussed with you in February. We continue to execute very well under delivering strong core revenue growth while delivering on our key EFX 2023 strategic initiatives. However, as we look to the remainder of 2022, we are reducing our full year financial guidance reflecting the likelihood of a much more substantial decline in the U.S mortgage market than we expected in February. Over the past several months, mortgage rates have increased more rapidly and expected with the 30-year mortgage rate reaching over 5% last week, a 10-year high. And there's increased expectation for further increases in U.S interest rates as we move through 2022 as the Fed manages record levels of inflation. As a result, our guidance now reflects the likelihood of a much more rapid and significant decline in mortgage originations than we expected a few months ago. With U.S mortgage credit inquiries for the -- over the last 9 months of '22, declining on the order of 37.5% or 38%. Over the last half of 2022, we expect U.S mortgage credit inquiries to be down 40%, which we believe is equivalent to mortgage originations being down more than 40% and is in line with most market forecasts including NBA and Fannie Mae. This level of mortgage market credit inquiries over the last half of 2022 is approaching 25%, below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 and also pulls forward the mortgage market declines we had expected in 2023 into 2022. U.S mortgage credit inquiries in early April are beginning to show some of this weakening and are at levels somewhat weaker than we saw in the first quarter, but are not anywhere near the levels of decline we've included in our guidance. However, given the recent substantial increase in mortgage rates and expectation for further rate increases, high inflation and the war in Ukraine, our guidance reflects the much higher likelihood of a more significant decline in U.S mortgage market as we move through the second quarter, and continued significant sequential declines as we move through the balance of the year. We thought it was prudent to de-risk our guidance for the mortgage market and pull forward from 2023 the normalization of the mortgage market into '22. For the full year, this results in U.S mortgage credit inquiries being down about 33.5% for the year, which is almost 10% below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic and 2020 and about 12 percentage points below the 21.5% decline in our February guidance. For the balance of the year, this equates to a 37.5% reduction versus the same period in 2021. And as I mentioned earlier, a run rate of 40 -- minus 40%, which is 25% below the 5-year pre-pandemic levels in the latter parts of 2022. The impact on our revenue guidance of this additional 12% reduction in the mortgage market is over 350 basis points or over $175 million. We expect to offset just under half of the mortgage revenue declined with stronger core revenue growth that will now exceed 17% from stronger workforce solutions performance and NPI rollouts, which is an increase of about 150 basis points or $175 million for the year. Broadly, Equifax is operating very well with our first quarter core growth of 21%. Together this results in a reduction in our full year revenue guidance by $100 million to a midpoint of $5.2 billion, which is still up a solid 6% after absorbing an over $500 million decline from the mortgage market. The $100 million reduction in revenue and the elimination of income from our non-controlling interest in our Russian joint venture of $0.12 a share, drives our guidance for EBITDA margin expansion in '22 to about 125 basis points increase, but a reduction of 50 basis points from our prior framework. This also results in guidance for our adjusted EPS to a midpoint of $8.15 a share or reduction of $0.50 per share. As I mentioned, at these levels, we still deliver solid '22 revenue growth of 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 7% despite a significant mortgage market decline impacting our revenue by almost 10.5 points, or over $500 million. Our ability to deliver 17% core revenue growth reflects the underlying breadth, depth and strength of the Equifax business model, and is well above our new long-term growth framework of 8% to 12%. John will provide more details on our view of the mortgage market and our guidance shortly. Turning to Slide 4, the first -- in the first quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance range. Revenue at $1.36 billion was up 12% with our organic constant currency growth of 8%, and was the highest quarterly revenue in our history, and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. This was delivered despite a U.S mortgage market or credit inquiries were down 24.5% in the in the quarter about as expected. Core revenue growth of 21% and core organic revenue growth at 17% were both very strong and well above our new long-term financial framework. Our growth was again powered by our U.S businesses Workforce Solutions and USIS. In total, Workforce Solutions and USIS generated $1.08 billion in revenue, almost 80% of Equifax total revenue, with 14% total and 7.5% organic revenue growth, again, despite the 24.5% decline in the U.S mortgage market inquiries. Non-mortgage U.S revenue represented over 60% of total U.S revenue and delivered growth of over 32% total, with organic growth of just over 18%. International also delivered strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency, above the high end of their long-term framework of 7% to 9%. First quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $484 million, up 12% and EBITDA margins of 35.5% were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted EPS at $2.22 a share was up a strong 13% from last year and above the guidance of $2.08 to $2.18 we provided in February, driven by strong revenue growth and progress in realizing the benefits of our cloud technology transformation. We continue to accelerate our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter, including migrating approximately an additional 10,700 customers to the cloud in the U.S and approximately 1,500 customers internationally, as well as decommissioning two significant data centers this month. As you may have also seen, we recently issued our second annual security report, which is another important illustration of our ESG commitment and the power of our EFX cloud transformation and cloud technology and data transformation. In 2018, we committed that Equifax will become an industry leader in security. Our latest report highlights our investments in market leading cybersecurity capabilities and talent that enable us to detect and respond to threats with more speed and precision. We view our leading security capabilities as another competitive advantage for Equifax. Leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure, we continue to accelerate new product innovations. In the first quarter, we released about 30 new products continuing momentum from 2021 where we launched a record 151 new products. We're seeing increasing commercial traction and revenue generation from these new products leveraging the new Equifax cloud. In the quarter, our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last 3 years exceeded 12%. This is over a 300 basis point improvement from our 900 -- 9% vitality index last year, and the highest level for Equifax in the last decade. For 2022, we now expect a vitality index of over 11%, up 100 basis points from the 10% guidance we provide in February -- we provided in February, which will fuel our growth in 2022, 2023 and beyond. In the first quarter, we invested our strong free cash flow in two strategic bolt on acquisitions, with a focus on accelerating growth in Workforce Solutions with the acquisition of Efficient Hire and expanding our geographic footprint with the acquisition of Data-Credito, the largest Credit Bureau in the Dominican Republic. Bolt on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are strong leverage to accelerate our growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth from strategic bolt on acquisitions. Even facing the macro mortgage market headwinds, we are energized by our strong start to 2022 and are clearly seeing the momentum from our EFX 2022 growth strategy leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities. Turning now to Slide 5. In the first quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars, grew very strong 21% which was above our expectations and substantially above our long-term framework -- financial framework of 8% to 12%. Core organic revenue growth of 17% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework. Non-mortgage growth in EWS and international as well as the U.S drove about two-thirds of our core organic revenue growth in the quarter. Strong 27% core mortgage outperformance in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining third of first quarter core organic revenue growth. With our strong 21% core growth in the first quarter, and accelerating NPI rollouts, we now expect 2022 core revenue growth of over 17%, which is up about 150 basis points from our February guidance and 250 basis points from our original 2022 framework. This is driven by broad base strong performance across Workforce Solutions, as well as strength in international, Kount Identity and Fraud, Appriss Insights and accelerating NPIs. As detailed on Slide 6, core mortgage revenue growth in first quarter was up a very strong 17%, driven by Workforce Solutions with their core mortgage revenue growth of 27% and 2% of USIS. Due to the strong core revenue growth, our first quarter mortgage revenue was down only 7% despite the 24.5% decline in overall U.S mortgage market. Core mortgage growth of 27% at Workforce Solutions was consistent with our guidance in February and driven by twin record additions, new products, increased system-to-system integrations and increased penetration. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding core revenue growth, delivering over 40% growth for the fourth time in the last five quarters. This is very strong performance is driven -- this very strong performance is driven by Workforce Solutions, consistent execution across their key growth levers. First, growing the work number database. As we mentioned in February, we signed three new exclusive arrangements with large payroll processors late last year that we expect to implement starting in the second quarter. And we signed another new exclusive payroll processor agreement last month that we expect to also bring on board in 2022. We ended the quarter with 135 million total current records, which was up 19% from last year. There are 104 million unique individuals deliver high hit rates and represent about 65% of U.S nonfarm payroll. The flat sequential performance from year-end was also very strong as we offset reductions of approximately 3 million records from the normal seasoning hire declines from the fourth quarter with new record additions. As of today, we're already back to over 136 million records as we have begun boarding records from one of the new exclusive payroll processor agreements we signed late last year. And as a reminder, almost 50% -- 55% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers. Second, EWS's increasing penetration in their key verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance, with all four verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by leveraging our expanded data hub strategy for the fast-growing talent and government markets driving over 80% core growth in these verticals. Third, EWS is delivering increased average revenue per transaction through both higher value new product rollouts and increasing the value or pricing of existing products by expanding the depth and breadth of our data coverage. And finally, Workforce Solutions expanding their system-to-system integrations. Currently more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system-to-system, up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get a 20% plus lift in mortgage polls when we convert our customers from the web to system integrations. In talent solutions, system-to-system now represents more than 80% of our transactions. And last, Workforce Solutions continues to add capabilities in records through strategic bolt on acquisitions. Over the past 2 years, we've completed five bolt on acquisitions supporting EWS growth, including Appriss Insights last fall and Efficient Hire a few weeks ago. The strength of Workforce Solutions and unique system value of their twin income and employment data was clear again in the first quarter. Rudy Ploder and EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 33% revenue growth, well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework and are positioned to deliver a very strong '22 and continue above market growth in the future. Turning to more details and Workforce Solutions on Slide 5, another exceptional quarter delivering record revenue of $649 million, their first quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 33% with organic revenue growth of 20% despite the significant decline in the U.S mortgage market. Core revenue growth was a very strong 45% in the quarter with core organic revenue growth of 34%. Non-mortgage is now 60% of Workforce Solutions revenue, delivering organic growth of over 30%. Verification Services revenue was over $500 million for the first time, with strong growth driven by non-mortgage verticals that represent almost 50% of Verifier revenue and delivered 90% total and 50% organic growth. The inorganic growth was driven by the acquisition of Appriss Insights that performed very well during the quarter, driven by higher volumes, product penetration and new customer wins. Talent and Government Solutions, which now represent 30% and almost 40% of Verifier non-mortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters and combined were up a very strong 100% total and over 55% organic growth. The continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub and the fast growing $5 billion Talent and $2 billion Government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions over 540 million historical records for new products. The introduction of the unique Appriss Insights National Student Clearinghouse data and other talent related data assets, strengthens our ability to deliver new solutions leveraging the EWS data hub. The non-mortgage consumer lending business principally in banking and auto showed strong growth as well, up 40% in the quarter. Increasing records penetration, system-to-system integrations are driving growth in auto, card and consumer finance and debt management grew over 25% in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, mortgage revenue for Workforce Solutions was up 3% versus last year, 27 points stronger than the overall U.S mortgage market decline and consistent with our expectations that EWS would outperform the mortgage market by approaching 30 points in 2022. Employer Services revenue of $136 million was up a strong 33% in the quarter. Combined our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of $50 million, up 6% last year, but down 7% sequentially as expected. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down about 25% for all of 2022 driven by lower jobless claims and ERC as the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of $86 million, up over 55% versus last year with strong organic growth of over 15%. Our I9 business driven by our new I9 anywhere product continue to show very strong growth, up over 55%. In the first quarter, our I9 and onboarding business made up over -- made up almost 25% of Employer Services, non-UC and ERC revenue. Our combined Health e(fx) business, which is the combination of Equifax workforce analytics and our Health e(fx) acquisition that we acquired in the third quarter last year represented about 45% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter and delivered total growth of just under 70% with organic growth of about 1% as expected. As we discussed, the seasonality of ACA revenue was concentrated in the first half of the year. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6%, consistent with the guidance we provided February and very strong. The decline in margins versus last year was principally driven by the addition of Appriss Insights and Health e(fx). And as expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. As shown on Slide 9, continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub is a key strategic focus for Workforce Solutions and the engine driving future growth in the fast-growing Talent and Government Solution markets. Talent Solutions delivered 145% total and 80% organic growth in the quarter. And we began introducing new multi data talent products in the quarter with new product introductions expected to accelerate as we move through 2022 leveraging the Equifax cloud. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 89% total and 39% organic with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. As I mentioned earlier, Appriss Insights performed very well, delivering 20% growth in the quarter from increased volumes, new customers and success with existing products. More broadly, we expect revenues from NPIs to increase as the integration of Appriss Insights continues in the back half of 2022. Shifting now to Slide 10 and USIS, their revenue of $433 million was down 6% compared to first quarter last year, and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which were $140 million, and is about 30% of total USIS revenue when it was down 21% for the quarter. Positively, this was about 300 basis points stronger than the overall mortgage market decline of 24.5%. Importantly, USIS delivered their fifth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B non-mortgage revenue at $242 million, which represents over 55% of total USIS revenue, and was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2%. This was somewhat lower than the mid-single-digit organic growth we discussed in February due to the timing of deal closures in their financial marketing services business. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth, which excludes FMS was strong, at up 10% with 6% organic growth. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, commercial and identity and fraud, and auto and direct-to-consumer both showed high single-digit growth. In telco and banking and lending grew in the mid-single digits. Kount had an outstanding quarter with organic revenue growth approaching 50%. The Kount teams now delivered two consecutive quarters of very strong new deal bookings and along with the monetization of synergies between the Kount and Equifax customer and product base and continued vertical expansion. Our core new product growth continues to be very strong in Kount and the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data that we believe will drive strong growth in '22 and beyond. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $46 million, down 14% from last year's 12% growth. Importantly, we continue to see growth in marketing related projects, but our batch business was below our expectations. As we discussed in the batch -- in the past, our batch or portfolio review project business can be choppy as the revenue is often driven by larger one-time offline data licensing projects. We expect to return to growth in second quarter driven by growth in marketing pre-screen and in the portfolio review solutions inside of FMS. USIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S D2C business from GCS, it was combined with USIS in the fourth quarter had revenue of $51 million, up 2% year-over-year, which was below our expectations. With their cloud transformation complete, the team is now focused on delivering best-in-class consumer experiences, leveraging the cloud to roll out new products, and leveraging B2B relationships in traditional financial services credit unions and new fintech players to return the business to growth. The USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins resulting in a healthy win rate. The new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipeline slightly higher than the fourth quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.3% in the quarter, about flat with fourth quarter and slightly better than our expectations. Turning to Slide 11, our investments and acquisitions of Unique data assets are positioning U.S for sustainable long-term non-mortgage growth. Our Unique data goes far beyond traditional credit data and contains alternative data covering telco payment history, specialty finance transactions, cash flow and bank transaction, wealth data, e-commerce transactions and unique commercial business data. These Unique and only Equifax datasets provide scores analytics and insights that allow lenders to increase approval rates, expand credit lines and reduce losses, particularly with underbanked consumers. These differentiated alternative data assets are important growth lever for USIS to deliver new solutions that will help expand access to credit and the over 60 million on and underbanked population in the United States. Earlier this week, Equifax announced the new data partnership with Fiserv, a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions to leverage their unique data assets in combinations with -- in combination with Equifax data to deliver new solutions to the market. We intend to co-innovate with Fiserv to develop solutions that will help financial institutions and other businesses embrace the power of expanded data and real-time data insights to drive speed, the Kount acquisition mitigate risk and improve overall customer experience with an initial focus on small business commercial solutions. We're very energized about our new partnership with Fiserv. Shifting now to international on Slide 12. Their revenue of $281 million was up a very strong 10% on a local currency basis. Europe revenue was up 6% -- 16%, driven principally by our U.K debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue. As you recall, in December, Equifax was awarded a 4-year extension with the U.K on their government debt resolution contract with an estimated value of $136 million, with an incremental $90 million of potential incremental sales from analytics and other CRA related solutions. Our European CRA business was up 2% in the quarter driven by growth in identity and fraud insurance and telco and partially offset by the U.K direct-to-consumer business which was below our expectations. Asia Pacific revenue was up 6% driven by strong growth in our Australia commercial business, verification services, and identity and fraud. Latin America was up a strong 23% driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Central America. The team's strong new product introductions over the past 3 years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across the region. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America. Canada was up 2% and below our expectations driven by lower volumes in consumer direct and mortgage market declines from higher interest rates. And auto was flat for the quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.4% were down 150 basis points, primarily due to the elimination of equity income from our Russian joint venture that John discussed. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margins would have been about flat with last year and slightly -- and up slightly from our expectations. As shown on Slide 13, we're off to a very strong start with our new product vitality index over 12% in the first quarter, which is above our 10% goal for the year and the highest vitality index since we began tracking this measure over 10 years ago. Building on the record 151 new product introductions last year, we delivered about 30 new products so far in 2022, which is on a similar strong pace to the fourth quarter. Some of the more significant new product launches are detailed on the slide. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver vitality index in 2022 of over 11%, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue this year. The 11% vitality is up 100 basis points from our February guidance and up 200 basis points from our strong 2021 results. NPIs are central to our long-term growth framework in driving EFX top line growth. As detailed on Slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow in accretive and strategic bolt on M&A is central to our EFX 2023 growth strategy and our new long-term growth framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth each year from strategic bolt on M&A. And we're starting '22 strong with two strategic and accretive bolt on acquisitions, Efficient Hire and Data-Credito. Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded Employer Services to hospitality building services and senior living markets. The acquisition also allows Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market, and of course provides us with incremental twin records. Data-Credito is the largest consumer credit reporting agency in the Dominican Republic that adds to our strong market presence across Latin America. Since the beginning of 2021, we've completed 10 strategic bolt on acquisitions that strengthen and broaden EFX and that fit our M&A priorities. Number one to expand and strengthen our strongest and fastest growing business Workforce Solutions. Number two to add unique data assets. Number three to expand in a fast growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four to work to expand our global credit bureau footprint. We're well down the path of integrating the acquisitions in the EFX cloud and driving synergies to accelerate our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter and our full year 2022 guidance. Thanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 21, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage new EFX Cloud for innovation new products. EFX2023 is the foundation for our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX data cloud and technology transformation. And we now have over half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North American cloud migrations. We completed over 120,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations.  In North America, our principal consumer exchanges are in production on our new cloud-based single data fabric and delivering to our customers. Our International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some migrations being completed in 2024. And we're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities, and remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud native data analytics technology company. As shown on the next slide, Equifax is increasingly much more than a Credit Bureau and focused on faster growing identity and fraud, talent, employer and government verticals. The consistent execution of our strategy over the past 4 years and the strategic bolt on acquisitions we completed in '21, and so far in 2022, are all aligned with our strategy and in faster growing markets. In 2022, over 50% of Equifax revenue is expected to be outside our traditional consumer and commercial Credit Bureau Market segments, principally in Workforce Solutions and our identity and fraud businesses. These businesses represent about two-thirds of our 45 billion addressable markets in identity and fraud, talent, government, and HR services as well as the employment and income portions of our credit businesses, with growth rates twice as fast as our traditional credit markets. As we move forward, these businesses will increasingly become larger portions of Equifax and drive our top line growth. As shown on Slide 23, very strong 17% core revenue growth in '22 and 22% growth -- core growth last year is driven by our outperformance in higher growth vertical markets. We are a different company today with over 40% of Equifax revenue, delivering over 10% growth. And even more powerful are the businesses delivering over 20% growth in fast growing markets, including Workforce Solutions, which is up 30% -- 33% in the first quarter, with their talent businesses approaching 150%; their government business up about 90%; their consumer lending business up 40%; and I9 anywhere over 50%. Our Kount business and the identity and fraud space delivered almost 50% growth in the fast-growing market. Our Appriss Insights business was up over 20% and our 11% NPI vitality index is fueling our growth. These faster growing verticals in new markets like talent, government and identity and fraud are driving our top line and allow us to outgrow underlying market macros. Wrapping up on Slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad base quarter with 12% overall growth and 21% core growth, more than offsetting the 25% decline in the mortgage market with broad based performance which was above your and our expectations. We are operating very well with strong momentum and now have delivered nine consecutive quarters of strong above market double-digit growth reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is resilient and on offense. We have strong momentum and are delivering the strongest results since the 2017 Cyber Event and arguably the strongest results in the past 10 years at Equifax. At our Investor Day last November, we discussed how the execution of our EFX2023 strategic priorities including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, would lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth. And as you know, we introduced the new long-term financial framework with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt on acquisitions. We also expect to deliver margin expansion of 50 basis points per year over the long-term that will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth at 12% to 16%, which combined with our 1% dividend yield target will allow us to deliver a total return to shareholders of 13% to 18%. The rapidly changing and unprecedent environment makes forecasting the impacts of the U.S market -- mortgage market incredibly challenging. We do not take guidance changes lightly. But we thought it was prudent to de-risk the year by reducing our U.S mortgage market credit inquiry outlook to down 37.5% for the balance of the year, resulting in a full year decline of 33.5% in our mortgage market. This includes a decline in the mortgage market of 40% in the back half of '22, which is approaching 25% below the 5-year run rate levels from prior to 2020 and pull-forward the market declines we'd expected in 2023 into 2022. We also believe this equates to mortgage originations being down more than 40% in the back half of 2022, which is aligned with most market estimates. We feel this is a prudent and balanced framework given the unprecedented macro environment. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient and continues to deliver strong results. Our updated outlook deliver 6% growth offsetting more than $500 million over 10% of mortgage market decline, with strong core revenue growth of 17% in 2022, which is up 150 basis points from our February guide, and over 250 basis points from the framework we shared with you at our Investor Day in November. Our ability to offset the 33.5% decline in the mortgage market and deliver 6% total growth, driven by 17% core growth is powerful. Looking back at the '08, '09 global financial crisis, which is the last time we saw a macro event like this impacting the mortgage market, Equifax revenue was down 6% versus the 6% growth we will deliver in our 2022 framework. We're different company today. A more diverse, resilient, faster growing higher margin, higher free cash flow company, a new Equifax with stronger growth levers. Workforce Solutions is our strongest and fastest growing business and will be north of 45% of our revenue in 2022 with a run rate -- runway to move past 50% of Equifax revenue in the near future. A 33% growth in the first quarter is over 4x the growth rate of the rest of Equifax and the 55% EBITDA margins are over 15 points above our average and highly accretive to Equifax. Workforce Solutions has multiple levers to deliver their 13% to 15% long-term growth rate, which is highly accretive to Equifax. Our core non-mortgage market growth is very strong at 21% in the first quarter and 17% in our new 2022 guidance and above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. We think about core revenue growth as a strong indicator of the breadth, depth and strength of the underlying Equifax business model. We expect our mortgage teams will continue to outperform the market decline by almost 20 percentage points in 2022, consistent with our February guide, with Workforce Solutions outperforming by approximately 30 points from pricing NPIs new twin records, new customers and system-to-system integrations. And as you know, we're in the early days of leveraging the 50% of Equifax that's now in the Equifax cloud environment and we're just starting to realize the top and bottom-line benefits from the cloud. As we move over the coming months and quarters to be fully cloud native, the top and bottom-line benefits will really kick in over the next 2 to 3 years and drive our top line while enabling us to achieve our 2025 margin goal of 39%. And as we talked on the call this morning, we're ramping our new product capabilities, leveraging our differentiated data assets in the Equifax cloud. Our vitality index in 2022 will now be 11% or over $500 million, which is up 9% last year and 100 basis points from our start in 2021. NPIs are fueling our growth. And last, our 10 bolt on acquisitions in the last 15 months are adding $375 million to our run rate revenue. But more importantly, the M&A synergies will be kicking in during 2022 and 2023 as we complete our integrations and drive our NPI rollouts. To be clear, we believe Equifax continues to operate at a very high level. There's no change in our long-term outlook for Equifax. The change in our mortgage market framework simply pulls forward the market normalization into 2022. We remain confident in our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and 50 basis points a year of long-term margin expansion that we rolled out at our Investor Day in November. And there's no change to our 2025 goal of $7 billion of revenue and 500 basis points of margin expansion to reach EBITDA margins of 39%. We are a new Equifax. A more resilient, more diverse higher growth and higher margin company. I'm energized by our strong first quarter performance, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. I'd like to close by welcoming Trevor Burns back to the Equifax leadership -- senior leadership team. We announced earlier this week that Dorian Hare has taken another position outside of Equifax and we wish him well. We'd like to thank Dorian for his service, leading Investor Relations for the past 2 years. Trevor will now reassume the lead responsibilities for Investor Relations effective immediately. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. In mortgage. Yes, it's a great question, Manav. I think as you know, 75 million people a year change jobs, every year. It's a -- it's one that has some cyclicality, but there's an underlying base, it's very, very high. The growth that we're getting, though, is really from our penetration in the market, the new products we're rolling out, leveraging the work history we have in the 540 million records, where we have a resume for Manav of all the jobs you've had, so that work history is very valuable. And the kind of the macro change in talent is around speed, which we don't think is going to change, meaning hiring managers want to get that individual on the floor more quickly. That's always the case, even pre-pandemic and instant data that you can get from Equifax, work history data and now with incarceration data, we have medical credentialing data, we have the education data, and we're adding more datasets there allows the background screeners, which are our customers and other hiring businesses to really speed up their decisioning for the hiring manager. So, the bulk of the growth that we have there, and it's obviously, very, very strong, and we expect to continue is really putting these solutions together. And we've got more new products in the pipeline that we plan to bring out. We've talked with you before and others that, last year, we rolled out solutions that had more work history versus where does Mark work today with Equifax, where he work over the last 10 years. So those solutions we rolled out last year, and we're bringing those to the market. Those are really driving a lot of the top line growth. And then in 2022, we'll start combining some of the solutions like incarceration data with the work history, with education data to have a one click solution, and then we'll customize those around job categories. Because as you know, in each hiring process, the data that's used is different depend upon who you hire, a white-collar worker versus a banking employee versus a warehouse worker versus a truck driver or a dentist or a doctor. Those are all different data requirements, which is where we want to work towards productizing around families of jobs, which again, will make it easier for our customers to pull the data and then also results in higher revenue for Equifax because we're bringing more value to the space. The other point I would make out is we're increasingly driving system-to-system integrations here. You go back a couple years ago, like mortgage, the talent space was accessing a lot of our data through the web, through a manual web interface, meaning keying into the web and putting Mark's name in there and pulling down the data, moving the system-to-system, we get the same lift going forward. So, there's a lot of runway still with that going forward. So, it's a space that we like, it's a big space and one that we see a lot of potential going forward. Just one thing to add, we can see the power of the historical records, because if you look at twin revenue excluding mortgage, take mortgage out of the mix, we're now seeing over 50% of the revenue include historical records. And Kevin, your question is around USIS in particular versus EWS? Yes, maybe I'll start John. But there's a number of levers that we have to outperform all our underlying markets and you can use mortgage in particular, obviously, that gets more challenging when you talk about a mortgage market in the second half, that's going to be down 40%. But we've had strong outperformance for a long history. Workforce has more levers than USIS, but both businesses and I'll talk about USIS. One of their levers outperform underlying markets is price, increasing the price of the solution or the credit file and both Workforce Solutions and USIS have regular price increases that help them offset or increase their revenue depend upon where the markets going. The other is new products. Both businesses rollout new solutions. And Workforce Solutions has a lot more product opportunities than USIS, but USIS has had some new product rollouts to help them outgrow the underlying or in this case, in 2022, declining market. Third is going to be new customers. In USIS's case, that's really in their tri-merge business, growing some share there will grow their revenue. In Workforce Solutions, as you know, we only see 60% plus of mortgages still. 40% are done with manual paper pay stubs, we've been growing that. So, adding customers is a lever, or usage, if you will, is a lever. The other one both businesses have is the number of polls that happen in a transaction, and that's been growing in both USIS and in Workforce Solutions. Particularly as you see more digital interactions with consumers, which we would characterize as shopping, meaning consumers are shopping for mortgages and deciding which mortgage originator to work with in that shopping process, which is fairly new and more utilized in the last couple of years. And it's here to stay in our view, there's some data polled to qualify the customer. So, in the shopping process that mortgage originator can respond with some framework about the offer. So that's a place where number of polls, is another opportunity for the business. System-to-system integrations in USIS, it's virtually 100%, fully system-to-system. And Workforce Solutions, we've talked many times that of the 60% of mortgages, we see about 70% plus are system-to-system. We've been growing that, that's up, I think, 50% from where it was 3, 4 years ago. So, there's still opportunities versus web access. And in system-to-system we get a 20% lift in the number of polls. And then the last one that I touch on, it's really unique to Workforce Solutions is growing records. As you grow records, we have higher hit rates. Remember, in a system-to-system integration, or even a web access, our customers are coming to us for all of their mortgage applications or in their process. And when they do that, when we grow our records, which are up 19%, year-over-year in the first quarter for Workforce Solutions, that becomes revenue. We're able to monetize those additional records, which is why we're so focused on records. It's really U.S. And we give total. But certainly, one that -- we probably don't have in front of us here, Andrew, and we can look at getting that for you. Yes, we haven't seen any different. In Europe, for us, as you know, as U.K and Spain, which is really where we participate there. We're seeing a positive as the government and companies in the U.K., following the pandemic start to focus on some of the collections that were suspended during the pandemic timeframe. So that's kind of a positive for the business, which we expect to continue through 2022. And the underlying kind of credit businesses, we don't have kind of a mortgage issue. If you want the mortgage market macro in Europe, in our two countries, because we really don't participate in mortgage there. And it's really operating what you'd see in the non-mortgage business, here in the States, where it's pretty, pretty steady. And we see elements of kind of post-pandemic recovery, card issuers wanting to do marketing, wanting to rebuild their balance sheets, similar discussion around consumers, being fairly strong meaning employment is high, unemployment is low, which is kind of a good macro in those markets, same in Canada, Australia, and frankly, in Latin America, around the globe, people are working. So, outside of the interest rate environment, and then you can, as a result the inflation environment, the higher interest rates are going to attempt to offset. You see consumers that are working low unemployment, that have better balance sheets than they had coming into the COVID pandemic, because they got some stimulus spending, and of course, they're working. So, we're pretty optimistic for kind of the core portions of the business, and we're delivering that when you see the results. I think as John and I both mentioned, we tried to really stress kind of the mortgage market outlook. And let me be -- obviously transparent. This is a hard thing to forecast. We don't know where interest rates are going to go. It's pretty clear, they're going to go higher. We've never seen a Fed navigate an 8.5% inflation environment with full employment. That's a very tricky thing to do. So, it's probably hard to forecast. But what gave us comfort in de-risking, the outlook for 2022, which as you point out, and I did to that pulls forward what we thought would have been a more gradual return to normalization, until inflation heated up. We think that that's a pretty strong stress scenario from the way we looked at it. And as John pointed out, when you go back the past 5 to 10 years, pre-COVID, meaning -- and pre-COVID meaning is pre the refi run up when interest rates were slashed because of the COVID environment and refis really exploded. We're 25% below kind of a normal market when we exit the year. And really in the second half, that we think is kind of as low as it can go because when you think about the mortgage market, there's a steady purchase volume even in a recession. And this -- I don't know how to talk about what environment this is. It's certainly not a recession. But even in a recession people move. 40 million people a year move, they're buying houses, so there's a steady level of purchase volume. And then even in a rising interest rate environment, consumers do refis, particularly when they have some level of equity in their homes. And that's another calculus and looking at the way we tried to stress the mortgage environment and came up with our kind of down 40 in the second half is -- there's still a lot of home equity out there that's untapped. And doing cash out refi is even at higher interest rates is something you could see consumers do, and we've seen them do before. So, a bit long winded. But what we tried to do was really stress this in this uncertain environment to kind of is a darker mortgage environment as we could see. Yes, how much time do we have? We went through a lot of factors. I would start first with Workforce Solutions. Workforce Solutions, and we went through in real detail in our comments, non-mortgage businesses are very strong. And then, yes, I know you asked about non-mortgage, but even their ability start with growing records. Records up 19%, and the ability to continue to grow records, and their history of growing records, that puts a -- an element in the business, both mortgage and non-mortgage. Your question was around non-mortgage. So, as we grow records and what's unique about workforce is, we don't have all the records. And up 19% in the first quarter we've got three, now four larger kind of chunkier additions. Of course, we're doing M&A to add records through our Employer Services, business. So I would say that one unique element at Workforce. Certainly, our pricing power in Workforce and to a lesser degree in USIS allows us to outperform and drive non-mortgage growth. But then, as I talked about in the back half of my comments, some of the new verticals we're in where we're making acquisitions, or leveraging the cloud to roll out new products, like the talent space, or the government space, really strong growth rates they were delivering there. And then more broadly, Workforce, I think, is one which I talked about a bunch. The second is new products. Our new products are primarily a non-mortgage, because that's where most of our businesses, and that's where we're rolling them out. And a lot of our new products, as you know, are really leveraging our historical or multi data solutions. Whether it's in the talent space, instead of having a solution, that's where it is Mark worked today, which is what historically we had. Now we have, where did Mark work over the last 24 months, where at the last 36 months, in the last 48 months, the last 60 months. And we're going to add more different solutions there. Those are at higher price points. So that's driving the business. And we have commercial activity where we're out there winning share in USIS and of course, in EWS where we're just placing paper pay stubs that drives it. We talked about system-to-system integrations. I think the power of Equifax is we go through 2022 and into '23 and '24, is our differentiated data assets. It's the fact that we're really ramping NPIs, but we haven't finished the cloud. So, we're only in the early innings of really leveraging the cloud. That's going to come in the latter parts of '22 and '23. That's where we're really going to be able to drive that going forward. And I think you got a sense that taking up our guidance, really for the second time this year, around core growth, with most of that being driven by non-mortgage core growth, shows our confidence in the underlying strength of the company, which is our ability to bring new solutions to market, executing on our cloud transformation and really driving into some of these new markets, like identity and fraud, like talent, like government that have higher underlying growth rates than traditional FI credit bureau kind of markets. Yes, so there's a couple of different questions there. First on our capital allocation, we were pretty clear at our Investor Day. We talked about it really in every earnings call, no change in that. First, we believe our free cash flow will continue to accelerate meaningfully through '22, and '23 and '24. And there's no change in what our free cash generation will be in 2022. We're still confident in that. And that free cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility, certainly around M&A. And as you know, we've done well over $3 billion of M&A in the last 15 months, all of that M&A has been oriented in kind of non-mortgage, if you want to use that term. But really in kind of core areas of Workforce Solutions, differentiated data that that's really been clearly our focus is to broaden Equifax. And you saw the slide that we put in the deck, again, that we had at Investor Day about our broader focus into faster growing markets. There -- we don't have competitors that talk about growing in the $2 billion government TAM. We don't have competitors that really talk about growing in the $4 billion talent TAM. I think they have focused on the identity and fraud, TAM that we're playing in, but really a clear focus there. And as our cash flow continues to accelerate, our priorities are certainly investing in Equifax, which we're doing through the cloud transformation. As you know, we're going to complete that, then that'll free up cash for us to invest more in new products going forward, which should drive our top line. But outside of investing in CapEx, we still view M&A as an important way to do bolt on acquisitions to strengthen the core of Equifax, really discipline around where we want to do it to strengthen the core of workforce, differentiated data, or identity and fraud. But then there's going to be excess free cash flow from Equifax. And as our EBITDA continues to grow, as we go through '23 and '24, we're going to delever the company. And at the right time, we'll certainly look at returning some of that cash to shareholders through buyback, or through increasing our dividend. We're not ready to do that today, but we are clear in our Investor Day that that's a -- kind of that balance of how we think about a capital allocation framework going forward against the backdrop of a significant increase in both our free cash flow going forward and our leverage available -- cash flow available from leverage as we grow our EBITDA. Yes, we haven't seen it. And our looks are we don't expect to see it based on what we see 2022 unfolding. Certainly, inflation is a real challenge, fuel prices, food prices, et cetera. 8.5% is very, very high inflation. Some states in the U.S are above 10%. But at the same time, people are working, wages are up meaningfully for a lot of wage categories. So that's a positive. And when I talk about their balance sheet, it's really over the last 2 years, they couldn't spend much because we were in the COVID pandemic lockdown. And there was a lot of stimulus, which is still out there. There's still a lot of stimulus coming from -- and again, I'm talking about the U.S government. While they're not individual payments, a lot of the social services payments, some of the requirements have been suspended. You've seen the administration talking about pausing on student debt collections that helps balance sheets for a lot of consumers that are working out there, and they're very low unemployment. And then when we talk to the banks, and you've seen some of their numbers in the last couple of weeks, like use credit card originations, up 10% -- I'm sorry, credit card usage up 10% and the bank's balance sheets declined during COVID. So, you've got very strong customers, meaning in our financial institutions that need to grow their balance sheets, and you've got what I would still argue is a fairly strong consumer, because of the wage inflation and the fact they're working and you add to stimulus, is balancing out the inflation, but it's certainly something you will continue to watch going forward. Yes, for sure. Just again on USIS, we were quite pleased with their core online business. It was up really -- slightly above or at our expectations on the online piece, which is comes from either market share gains, or new solutions that we're delivering that deliver the online. The piece that USIS didn't deliver on within their batch, or account management, review business, there was really just some timing in March, and some of those deals closed in April. And so we expect USIS to continue moving their growth going forward in the second quarter through the rest of the year in non-mortgage. And we are seeing some good wins in the marketplace, both with the market share gains we expect from being cloud native, providing stronger stability, those are going to continue to be a positive for the USIS commercial team going forward. And as you point out, our increasing focus on alternative data in our single data cloud fabric is another positive and we're seeing definite traction around the use of alternative data. All of our customers are looking for new data solutions to help them drive originations. And when you add some of the unique data assets that we have, which we believe we have at scale, more -- much more than our competitors, those are the kinds of solutions that the USIS team are bringing to market through our new products that we're rolling out. Thanks. Yes, it definitely early innings. We see kind of global market opportunity. As you may recall, pre our cloud transformation, we launched Workforce Solutions businesses in Australia, Canada and in India. We paused on doing any more international rollouts until we got our cloud stack in place for Workforce. And then about a few months ago -- actually a month and a half ago, we announced our entry into the U.K., where we have our cloud stack in there. And we're starting to onboard records from companies and partners in the U.K. So those are the four markets we're in today. We're definitely intending and looking to grow in other markets in the future. And even in markets where we don't do business, meaning we don't have Credit Bureau businesses. As you know, we're in 25 countries outside the United States, but we see the opportunity. And you think about some of the leverage points we have. Number one is our cloud stack, meaning our infrastructure. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars building this and now we can just move it very easily into a new market. Second is our existing customer or contributor relationships if you're a big multinational company, like a GE and IBM, pick a big industrial company, a bank that's doing global business, and there's a bunch of those in the United States. If we're doing the income and employment verification for them here, they liked the idea of us doing it for them in all their global markets. So that's a kind of an opportunity to load records and add in those different markets. And then last is payroll partners that we have. As you know, we've got a substantial number of them on an exclusive basis, most of them are exclusive. And same thing, a handful of those in the U.S are global. And we already have the connections, the pipes, the relationships with them here in the States. So, the ability to do the same thing globally is a leverage point for us. So, you should look for us to do more. In the scheme of Equifax, or Workforce, what's going to move the needle is more of the U.S levers that Workforce has over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years, but you would expect us to, and we are, investing in some of these longer-term opportunities outside the United States, like the U.K expansion that we did a few weeks ago. Sure. I'll start and let, John, jump in. So, at year-end, we had about 50% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax cloud. We talked about that in our February call. By the end of this year, 2022, we expect to have substantially completed North America, which is U.S and Canada, all of that in the cloud. So that'll be a big jump for us. And as you know, the United States for us revenue wise is approaching 80% of Equifax. And then International, some of the international markets, we won't complete until '23 and there might be some migrations that will complete in 2024. So that's really our runway around -- completing the cloud. And I'll let John jump on the actual cost savings. But as you know, we had some cost savings last year, a bigger number this year, they continue in '23 and they're likely be some in 2024. But they're all embedded in our 500 basis point margin expansion between now and 2025. I think on Investor Day, we talked about half of those roughly being from the cloud. So, if there's any change in that, and John can talk a little bit about the actual numbers. Oh, my gosh, how much time do we have? We talk about it in every call we have. There's a bunch. And I would really focus them in a couple of buckets. First is Workforce Solutions. We talked about this before. If you go back a couple of years, Workforce Solutions products they deliver to market were generally around a snapshot of where does someone work today and how much did they make, and a bunch of attributes, but they were really time based and current. And so, one of the big changes we've been able to do as a result of the cloud is really leverage those historical records. And whether it's looking at someone's income and employment over a long timeframe in a mortgage application, or looking at their work history, in the hiring or talent space that trended or time-based data, historical data is incredibly valuable and was very difficult to do pre the cloud transformation. So that's been a big change. And those products are really solving a lot of our customers problems. Our customers needed more than just where does Mark work today for certain consumers, that -- if they have a -- if you're a sales commissioned employee, my income today might not reflect my annual income because I get my bonus in February. So having that 12 months data is incredibly valuable, and we can sell it at a higher price point, using the example of a Workforce Solutions that we would sell at $30, $40, $50 per pole for kind of where does Mark work today, that historical data we're able to bring to the marketplace because of its value to our customers at $150, $135, $200. So, I would say that's a very powerful element of the cloud transformation that allows us to bring new solutions to market. And more broadly, Workforce Solutions, because they're further down the path in the cloud. They're really taking advantage of that, rolling new products out. And I think we talked like in the talent space, we added the 24 -- the 12 month, 24, 48-month work history for some jobs, the hiring manager wants to see more history, those were at higher price points. But we're now going to move to productizing around job category. Meaning if you're a warehouse worker, you're going to need certain types of data, we're going to we're going to develop a one click solution to deliver all that data for that kind of job and that employee. And then someone who's a white-collar worker, is going to have more education data that has to be a part of that poll and other data elements. So that's kind of where we're going product wise. The other bucket, I would say that we're excited about is multi data solutions. And that's really driven by our single data fabric, which is very unique to Equifax. WE had siloed datasets, our competitors have siloed datasets, we're going to a single data fabric, and the ability to combine data, think about the credit file, combined with our cell phone utility payment data, our wealth data, different data elements, the cloud allows us to do that. And that's something that our customers want that alternative data because it drives higher predictability, but it's difficult for them to absorb in pieces. And that's why we're going to serve it up in a single data fabric and then in product solutions, where we combine it together. So, I'd say that's the other bucket of solutions. And then the last is just we're in just different verticals today. You go back a couple, 3 years ago, we were primarily in financial services, bringing new solutions, like I9 anywhere to our Employer Services business, where we're delivering solutions, compliance solutions to HR managers, or as we talked about in talent or government, those are just faster growing markets. And very different than our core FI or Credit Bureau space that you're really energizing. And, of course, the focus we have on it. We've added a bunch of resources in, really '19, '20 and '21. I have a direct report to my leadership team. My leadership team, it's our Chief Product Officer. And then the cloud really gives us a lot of leverage to bring those new products to market. Yes, we don't see any change in those categories in 2022, already had some comments around the consumer. And we don't think the higher interest rates will impact that in cards or -- autos impacted today by supply shortages. We're dealing with that and the market is, I'm not sure when that's going to be resolved. That's more of an inventory issue, but the underlying consumer and the underlying customer of ours that's trying to grow their financing businesses. We don't see any change from where we were a few months ago. Yes, that's a complex question, Simon. Let me talk about a couple of things. The one thing that I always start with, and I know you do too, it's very unique about Workforce Solutions is the ability to grow their assets, their data assets, meaning their twin records and drive revenue growth. And we talked before, when you think about 19% revenue growth in the first quarter, that was -- they were up roughly 19% for the year, last year. We've already got a pipeline of additional records, those records translate into revenue, just because we have the system-to-system integrations, and it just takes our hit rates up. So, that's kind of a base element of their ability to outperform their underlying markets, because you're adding records. And then you add on top of that, the ability to roll out new products, drive system-to-system integrations, all of those that we've talked about drive penetration, drive usage, those are all become levers for them to drive their top line growth. And on top of that, when you talk about non-mortgage, as you know, they're operating in some underlying macro markets, whether it's talent, or the government space, that are just growing strongly. These are kind of 20% type, high double-digit growth type markets that help fuel their non-mortgage growth of Workforce Solutions. And I think, an Investor Day we talked about a 13% to 15%, long-term revenue growth rate for the business. Obviously, they outgrew that in the first quarter, they're going to outgrow that in 2022. They outgrew that in '20 and 2021. So, we see a lot of momentum in the business going forward, a lot of levers for growth going forward. Yet, so just two things. First, I think what you would have seen over the past several months is obviously NBA, Fannie, Freddie have also substantially changed their outlooks, given the main ticket taking them down, given the significant increase in interest rates. And what we've been doing over the past several years, I think, which we've been very open about as we've been taking a look at the markets based on the run rate trends that we have in our own business, because we can see inquiries. And what we started to see and the reason we made the change we did is because we're starting to see that the inquiry trends that we were, that we can measure, were starting to decline more rapidly. So, as we took a look at the information we had, and the analysis we could do, we believe we're headed toward the type of the down 40% that we talked about, which as we do, the analysis, we now see is consistent with where NBA and Fannie are, but we think the analysis we've done and the analysis they've done are just more consistent to those point in time. Yes, so we are very bullish about the space first, identity and fraud and we're really energized about the team, the leader that we brought in, it's driving that business, and it's in a space that's growing rapidly. It's a digital macro is very, very strong. Their underlying growth is a big part of that. There's some elements of synergies, but I would say that those are more on the com, meaning some of the product solutions of combining Kount and Equifax data, we are more second half oriented, it's just a really strong execution, and they have a great product. We've added more resources in the business, I think the headcount in the business is up something like 20% or 30%, maybe it's more like that 30%, since we acquired the business. So, we're putting more feet on the street, we've got a new commercial leader, that's really partnering with the CEO that was the founder of the business that we really like a lot. We've also given the CEO responsibility for our full identity and for our business, so he was running Kount, during the 2021, early this year. He's now got responsibility for the whole business, and we think it will have a big impact there and really drive the synergies going forward. So, we're quite bullish about their market position, their pipeline, but it really starts with a space that's very good. And we bought a very attractive business that we're making stronger. Yes, so great questions. First, on the Appriss business, another great business. I was there last week in Louisville, where they're headquartered with the team. We got a great leader there, and a great team, and the growth they're delivering is primarily from their own momentum. We only acquired them in October, so they're only a few months in. We're in the throes of integrating and bringing them into our technology and a cloud data fabric and the other elements on it. It's another space. So, they're winning new state contracts, they didn't have that were in their pipeline, when we acquired them, and just executing and the synergies that we're counting on, will really start kicking in the second half and '23, and probably likely into 2024. And we really liked the unique data. The criminal justice data that they have is very, very unique. And the instant decisioning from the talent space, plays in their world. And then, of course, in social services, it's also used. As part with regards to lessons learned, I sure wouldn't want to be doing these number of acquisitions if we weren't the cloud. It's -- it would be very hard to integrate these with the pace that we're going to be doing it. If we were still in our legacy environment, and that gives us a lot of confidence around doing acquisitions. And we're always learning about how we can do the integrations, more effectively, and -- but we've got some pretty good muscle around that, because it's not new for us. We've been doing acquisitions for a long time. Long before I joined 4 years ago, at Equifax, but we're getting better at it, I think and always looking to improve it. But the cloud gives us a lot of confidence, when doing M&A and I hope you agree that we're being very disciplined around the kind of businesses we want to buy. Our criteria and M&A is very clear. We want to grow, we want to buy businesses that are growing faster than Equifax. So, they're accretive to our growth rates. We want to buy businesses that are going to deliver margin accretion with Equifax. And most importantly, we want to buy businesses that strengthen the core of Equifax, whether it's around differentiated data, or around the Employer Services business as you point out. If you look at all of our acquisitions, they're checking those boxes. And then of course, identity and fraud, around Kount is just a space we'd like to get larger in and if you look at our acquisition so far this year, efficient higher, it makes us stronger in that. Employers Solutions space that, we want to be bigger in but also delivers more records to the Workforce Solutions businesses, they add new customers. I'll do the second one, John and you could take the first one on FMS, which is an easy one, but under $75 million, the bulk of that for sure is Workforce Solutions. But International is also a piece of that. Internationals performing exceptional. USIS I think, is kind of aligned with where we started the year, we don't see any change. They're performing very, very well. The outperformance is a piece of that is from international, but the bulk is Workforce and it's all the levers we talked about on the call this morning. Yes, there's a number of levers there on the drives the Workforce Solutions outperformance broadly in all their markets, but we'll focus your question on mortgage. So, start with records. We have pretty good visibility around our record growth in we talked about the fact that we were up 19 in the first quarter. We talked about -- we've got three now four larger payroll processors coming online in 2022. So, as you know, that record growth translates into higher hit rates and revenue. So, that's kind of a big piece of that. Second is price. We did our -- we do our pricing actions late in the year, they go into effect in January and their effect through the year. So, we know what our prices on a year-over-year basis. That's pretty well nailed down. The new product rollouts, you saw our momentum in Workforce Solutions with our mortgage products that we rolled out in 2021. Those were rolled out during the year. We get the full year benefit of those, many of them are rolled out in the third and fourth quarter. So, we have kind of visibility on the take rate and the usage of those because they're solving specific solutions. So, we have pretty good visibility around that. There's visibility around customer wins that we're bringing online. Remember, 60% of mortgages are still done in paper pay stubs. We have visibility around system-to-system integrations that we're working with customers that are not system-to-system, they're web based. There's another element of visibility, around that element. And then, we have trended data around how often the twin datasets being pulled? As you know that's increased in recent years to two polls. We don't see any change in that. So, that's kind of in the [indiscernible]. What did I miss John, as far as our visibility? And that's -- your questions around what portion of our mortgage customers are in the cloud environment? I'm not sure I heard it, right. Yes, yes, sorry. Hey, Heather, I think actually what we're going to post the deck here in about an hour or two, and on that there'll be an update to that number. So great. Thank you. 11 o'clock. Sorry about that. Yes. That's a great question, Jeff. One that I don't have and John shaking his head also that he doesn't have, but it's one that I'm going to run down. I definitely want understand it. I think intuitively we find it there's some list there, but let us run it down. I would say there's always pushback from clients when it comes to price. But we've been very clear, and we probably more often talk about price at Workforce Solutions, because they just have more pricing power. They're just more unique data asset than our -- than the credit file. But USIS, pretty regularly does price increases, meaning on an annual basis. And there's some element of price there, but it's not at the same scale, or leverages our workforce. In particularly a mortgage. Yes, that's a place where we have historically done kind of consistent price increases in USIS. In some of the other verticals, we may take price up, but then have concessions that happen. So, the pricing power is not as strong, in some of the other verticals. Yes. Your question is more around customers versus obtaining records or is it both? Yes, I guess, our view of the marketplace is that our solution in the verticals we participate in for income and employment data is, price competitively meaning there, there aren't what we see in posted market prices, we don't see prices that are lower than Equifax. So, I don't think there's a price advantage there. What we do with some customers, when we tap top of waterfall, it's really to have them hit our database in a system-to-system basis versus doing manual efforts. So we've had some commercial incentives to move customers from doing manual searches around income and employment data to hit Equifax first. And part of that is, is that we've really had a very significant increase in our coverage over the last couple, 3 years. You go back, 3-years ago, we were below 50%. Now we're at 65%, approaching 70%. So, it was really more -- some commercial incentives to get customers to understand that they can get a hit very quickly from Equifax, but we haven't seen, what you described as, us having to commercially get in front of someone else who has a different solution to Equifax. And again, we haven't seen any commercial pressure from that. They're very, very small. And it would surprise us that a customer would want to change a waterfall, [indiscernible] the system effort involved in the very low hit rates, and again, there's not a pricing advantage or cost advantage for [indiscernible]. We just wanted to thank everyone for participating. If you have more questions, please reach out to Investor Relations."

The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab on our IR website. During the call, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 4Q 2023 earnings conference call. Also, we\u2019ll making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full-year 2024 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We'll also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted on certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. In the fourth quarter, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $19 million or $0.11 a share. This charge was for costs incurred as we realigned business functions ahead of completing our technology transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Before I cover results for the quarter, I wanted to spend a few minutes on our 2023 performance. Equifax performed extremely well last year against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. Our strong performance was against one of the most challenging mortgage markets in the last 20-plus years with our USIS mortgage inquiries down 34% and Equifax mortgage revenue down 17%, which equates to almost $500 million of lost mortgage revenue last year. Despite the significant decline in 2023 mortgage revenue, Equifax delivered. We delivered 2% organic constant currency revenue growth with 7% organic constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth, which was at the low end of our long-term 7% to 10% growth rate. Importantly, we had sequential improvement during the year with 8% total growth and 9% non-mortgage growth in the fourth quarter. We also delivered over 100 new products with a vitality of 14%, which was a record for Equifax and well above our 10% long-term goal. EWF delivered strong 10% organic non-mortgage revenue growth, which allowed them to deliver flat total growth despite mortgage revenue that was down 23%. They delivered sequential non-mortgage revenue growth and exited fourth quarter with strong 17% non-mortgage growth. Verifier non-mortgage revenue grew 14%, led by government that grew over 30% and talent that grew 5% despite the white collar hiring market that was down just under 10%. EWS grew current twin records to $168 million, up $16 million or 11% and grew total records to $657 million or $53 million records. We added 17 new twin partnerships last year, our highest number ever and have a strong pipeline for 2024. And in the third quarter, EWS signed a contract extension to provide income verification to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as part of a contract valued at up to $1.2 billion over the next five years, which is the largest contract in Equifax's history. EWS also delivered over 20% new product vitality. USIS delivered 4% revenue growth with 7% non-mortgage growth within their 6% to 8% long-term growth framework, while mortgage declined 5%. The USIS Commercial and Consumer Solutions business had very strong years with double-digit revenue growth led by strong market penetration and new products. International delivered 12% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant dollar growth, led by continued very strong 17% organic growth in Latin America with a vitality index over 15% and close to 10% revenue growth in our UK CRA. And in July, we completed the BVS acquisition in the fast-growing Brazilian market. We delivered these strong results while making significant progress towards completing our cloud migration, ending the year with about 70% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud. We decommissioned seven data centers and migrated about 37,000 customers to the Equifax Cloud. We are convinced that our new EFX cloud single data fabric and AI capabilities are delivering new differentiated products faster with better performance and will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. The strong progress we made in 2023 will enable the substantial completion of our North American transformation and customer migrations in the first half of 2024, including decommissioning of the mainframes and major North American data centers. Also in 2024, we expect to make substantial progress towards completing transformation activities in Europe and Latin America. By the end of 2024, we expect to have about 90% of our revenue in the new Equifax cloud with the vast majority of new models and scores being built using Equifax AI. In 2023, we executed very well against our EFX Cloud and broader operational restructuring plan across Equifax, reflecting cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers and other broader spending controls in excess of our original $210 million goal. We expect an incremental $90 million of run rate spending reductions in 2024, which is up about $25 million from our prior forecast due to the additional actions we took in the fourth quarter that will benefit 2024. Of this $90 million 2024 spending reduction, about $60 million reduces operating expenses and $30 million reduces capital spending. These actions are improving operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. As we move into 2024, I'm energized by our commercial momentum, NPI capabilities and the benefits of the new Equifax Cloud. Turning to Slide 4, our strong fourth quarter gives us momentum as we move into the new year. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.327 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.81 per share were both at the high end of our guidance. And EBITDA margins at 33.7% were up about 60 bps sequentially. Our non-mortgage businesses, which represent about 85% of total revenue in the quarter, were very strong with 14% constant currency and 9% organic constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth, also at the high end of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework driven by strong performances at EWS and international. Total U.S. mortgage market was slightly stronger than we expected in the quarter with USIS inquiries down 17%. As mortgage rates declined during the quarter from a 23-year high of 7.9% in late October to about 6.8% late in the year, we saw some increased activity to expect we'll grow if rates continue to decline in 2024. Mortgage volumes began to strengthen slightly relative to normal seasonal levels in December, and we've continued the slight improvements during January, which is a good sign if the market has bottomed. Mortgage market outperformance of 33% for USIS and 18% for EWS last year in the quarter were strong and about as expected. We'll share further perspectives on the mortgage market when we discuss our 2024 guidance. At the BU level, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 17% and above our expectations, principally due to strength in our government and talent businesses, which drove adjusted EWS EBITDA margins sequentially to above 51%. USIS had a good quarter with revenue up 5%, slightly above our expectations, principally due to stronger mortgage revenue, which drove adjusted EBITDA margins up about 100 basis points sequentially to 35%. International delivered 22% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding the impact of the BVS acquisition. Very strong growth in Latin America and Europe were principally offset by lower-than-expected growth in Asia Pacific. International delivered very strong 31.2% adjusted EBITDA margins, up about 500 basis points sequentially and much stronger than our expectations. Before I cover our business unit results in more detail, I wanted to provide an overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and with the consumer. Broadly, outside of what appears to be a bottoming of the mortgage market, there's not a lot of change from our prior view. The U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at historic levels with low unemployment and almost 9 million open jobs, which is a positive for consumers and our customers. However, there continue to be some constraints in white collar hiring. Credit card delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market are stable and at historically low levels at less than 1%, but above pre-pandemic levels. However, subprime borrower delinquencies, which have been increasing over the past year are now above pre-pandemic levels and are approaching 2009 levels. Auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market are also stable and well below 1%, but are above pre-pandemic levels. Delinquencies for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels, as well as above the levels we saw in 2009. And any credit tiding that we've seen has been largely in fintech and subprime, which started well over a year ago. When consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current on their financial obligations, which is good for our customers and for Equifax. Turning to Slide 5, strong twin record growth and the positive impact from new products, penetration and price drove a strong 18 points of EWS mortgage outperformance in the quarter. As expected, mortgage outperformance was down sequentially from the third quarter as we lapped the 2022 launch of our Mortgage 36 trended data product. EWS had another very strong quarter of twin record additions, adding five million current records in the quarter and $16 million during 2023. EWS grew twin records 11% in the quarter to $168 million on 124 million unique individuals, which was up 9%. Total records, both current and historic are now over $655 million and were up 9%. In terms of coverage, we have current employment records on about 75% of U.S. non-farm payroll and about 60% coverage on the $220 million income-producing Americans. At 124 million active records, we have plenty of room to grow the twin database. During the quarter, we signed agreements with six new payroll processors that will deliver records in 2024. In 2023, we added partnerships with 17 payroll processors and over the past three years, have added partnerships with 33 payroll processors. During the quarter, EWS also surpassed a significant milestone with over three million companies contributing to the work number every pay period, a huge milestone as we continue to focus on expanding our twin coverage. The market continues to adopt higher-value solutions that include trended employment and income history that only Equifax can deliver. For example, in the fourth quarter, over 50% of mortgage revenue incorporated historic records. Turning to Slide 6, Workforce Solutions revenue was up a strong 10% in the quarter, which is a very positive sign as we look towards 2024. Non-mortgage revenue growth of 17% was very strong and up 600 basis points sequentially and at the highest levels that we saw in 2023. Importantly, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which represents about 75% of Verifier revenue delivered very strong 27% in the growth in the quarter and was up 16 points sequentially. In Government, we saw continued very strong growth with revenue up 47% in the quarter and over 30% for the year. Government revenue was slightly stronger than our expectations given continued CMS redeterminations, the new SNAP contract, record growth, state penetration and pricing. We expect continued growth in government throughout 2024 with stronger growth in the first half as CMS redeterminations complete prior to the second quarter. Talent Solutions revenue was up 13% in the quarter and up 700 basis points sequentially. As we discussed, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white collar workers, including technology, professional services and financial services, which has seen a greater reduction in hiring activity and broad hiring freezes and layoffs than the total labor market over the past 12 to 18 months. These markets are off to a slow start again in January, and we would expect to see slower revenue growth in the first quarter in talent than we delivered in the fourth quarter. We outperformed these underlying markets in the fourth quarter by over 25 points as we delivered new digital solutions, strong new product growth, pricing and continued expansion of Twin records. Employer Services revenue was down 7% and in line with our expectations, driven by declines in ERC revenue, which is now about $5 million per quarter as the U.S. government has suspended processing new ERC claims. ERC revenue is expected to stay at about these levels through 2024, and we'll see headwinds in our employer vertical from this ERC decline through the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the impact of the declining ERC revenue, Employer Services revenue grew during the quarter driven by growth in our I9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.2% were better than our expectations, principally due to better expected revenue performance. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their twin income and employment data, and employer services businesses would clear again in 2023. EWS is expected to deliver strong growth in 2024 and continue above market growth in the future. On Slide 7, I'd like to expand on the significant opportunities still in front of us for EWS. This slide details a big $15 billion EWS TAM versus their $2.3 billion of revenue last year. EWS has plenty of room to grow. As you can see, with the exception of housing, which includes mortgage, where our penetration is on the order of 60%, our penetration is in the range of 10% to 20% in each target market where we compete. In each of these markets, we principally compete against pay-per-pay stubs or other forms of manual verifications and we deliver instant verifications, productivity, speed and accuracy. In both mortgage, government and talent, where there's a requirement for broad coverage and depth of detail and in talent and mortgage, where there's a need for historical data, we have an opportunity to drive strong future growth from penetration in our existing verticals and leverage that penetration as we continue to expand twin record coverage towards the $220 million income-producing Americans in the United States. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue was up over 5% and above our expectations, principally due to stronger-than-expected mortgage revenue. USIS delivered non-mortgage revenue growth of about just over 3% in the quarter and slightly below our 4% growth expectation. USIS mortgage revenue was up 16% and outperformed the mortgage credit inquiries that were down 17% by 33 points. The strong pricing environment drove the very strong outperformance. At $78 million in the quarter, mortgage revenue was 18% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was down slightly less than 1% and below our expectations. We continue to see double-digit growth in commercial and single-digit growth in telco and auto with banking and lending about flat. The declines were principally due to weakness in D2C, our business where we sell data to other credit bureaus and insurance. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business was up 7% and much better than our expectations. In marketing, we saw mid-single-digit growth in the quarter led by double-digit growth in our IXI consumer wealth data business, partially offset by declines in pre-screen marketing. While pre-screen marketing revenue was down in the quarter, we did see an improvement over prior quarters with a return to growth in fintech pre-screen marketing. We continue to see declines in smaller FIs, partially offset by growth in larger FIs. Within risk and account services, we saw limited growth in our portfolio review business but not to the levels we would typically see if our customers were expecting a weakening economy. And within fraud, we saw double-digit revenue growth primarily from new business. USIS Consumer Solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 15% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 35.1% in the quarter and in line with our October guidance. Todd and the U.S. team are on offense as they complete their cloud transformation in the first half of 2024 and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capabilities to deliver new products and drive share gains. In the quarter, the USIS team signed an extension to the NCTUE cellphone and utility payment data relationship, allowing USIS to exclusively manage the database and continue bringing new products to market that expand lending to consumers, including our differentiated USIS mortgage credit file solution that incorporates NC+ cell phone and utility data that only Equifax can provide. Turning to Slide 9, International revenue was up 22% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BBS and above the 20% growth we guided to in October due to better-than-expected revenue in Latin America, slightly offset by lower Asia Pacific revenue. Europe, local currency revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter from strong double-digit growth in our UK CRE business. And as expected, a return to growth from our UK debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, was up 30% versus last year, driven by strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We continue to make good progress on the Brazil integration with strong progress in bringing new Equifax solutions such as count and mitigator to the Brazilian market as well as bringing EFX data and analytics expertise to our Brazilian customers. Our global Equifax teams are very engaged in integration activities, including moving BVS to the Equifax cloud and single data fabric. Canada delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter as expected. Canada will complete their migration to the Equifax cloud by mid-2024. And similar to USIS, we expect to see accelerated NPI growth going forward. In Asia Pacific, revenue was below our expectations with revenue down 2% and to -- due to lower market volumes in Consumer and Commercial, particularly late in November and December. We expect Asia Pacific to have declining revenue in the first half of 2024 due to the softer market conditions and the near-term impact of long-term contract extensions we signed with several large customers. We expect Asia Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second half of 2024. Despite the decline in revenue, Asia Pacific adjusted EBITDA margins were up over 200 basis points sequentially from strong cost management. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 31.2%, were up almost 500 basis points sequentially, an outstanding performance. The improvement was driven by revenue growth and good execution against our 2023 cost reduction plan by Lisa and the international team. Turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, overall non-mortgage constant dollar revenue grew a very strong 14% with organic growth of 9%, up over 250 basis points sequentially. A very good sign as we move into 2024. The acceleration in organic revenue growth was driven by very strong EWS Verifier non-mortgage revenue performance. As we look to 2024, we expect non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth to be over 10.5% with organic growth of almost 8.5%, about 150 basis points above the levels delivered last year. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to be led again by EWS, driven by strong growth in their government and talent businesses. Turning to Slide 11. We delivered strong 14% vitality, again in the quarter, led by very strong performance in EWS with a VI over 20% as well as over 15% in Latin America. Importantly, USIS accelerated in the fourth quarter to 7%, which was up over 200 basis points sequentially as we get closer to cloud completion and are able to begin to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation and new products. Our strong vitality index results are not only led by over 100 new products launched in each of the last four years, but the increasing average revenue per new product, which is up close to 50% since 2021. During the quarter, about 90% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the Equifax cloud. The positive momentum in our NPI and Vitality Index is encouraging for the future and reinforces our long-term strategy of leveraging our differentiated data assets and new cloud capabilities to drive new solutions for our customers. Leveraging our Equifax cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a vitality index of over 10% again in 2024. On the right side of the slide, we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax cloud and driving innovation that can create the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities as well as drive Equifax top line growth and margins. Turning to Slide 12, we believe Equifax AI, leveraging our differentiated data assets, our new Equifax cloud capabilities and new product focus, is positioning our industry-leading EFX AI powered model scores and products. On the left of the side of the slide, our large and diverse proprietary data sets is a significant differentiator for Equifax. Our proprietary data at scale, keyed in linked in our single data fabric leveraging our new AFX cloud gives us significant advantages in using AI to build more predictive multi-data models, scores and products. Our ESXi is enabled by our EFX developed explainable AI solutions that leverage our Ignite platform and our Google Vertex capabilities. Our modern AI and ML-enabled cloud-based model scoring engine and our over 1,000 Equifax DNA professionals. AI leveraging our patented explainable AI capabilities is a big priority for Equifax in '24 and beyond as we complete the Equifax cloud. As shown on the chart in the middle of Slide 12, we've made tremendous progress building advanced models in leveraging our market-leading AI capabilities. In 2023, 70% of our new models were built using AI and ML tools, up from 60% in '22 with a goal of over 80% this year. Our investments in AI are generating results. To date, Equifax has received over 90 approved AI patents supporting areas such as our proprietary AI NeuroDecision Technology, or NDT, an explainable AI with over 130 AI patents pending. We've launched new products developing at EFX AI, including Equifax OneScore for consumers incorporating traditional credit, alternative credit, as well as cell phone utility and pay TV data, which has improved the performance of the solution to score 20% more consumers. We are energized about the capabilities that Equifax AI is bringing to strengthen our business and accelerate the value of our proprietary data through richer data combinations. Now let's turn to 2024 guidance. Moving to Slide 13, we entered 2024 with momentum from the fourth quarter and the underlying growth of our non-mortgage businesses and the strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. The U.S. mortgage market appears to have bottomed and through January, we're seeing some slight improvements versus our expectations in both USIS and EWS, which is good news for the future. Our 2024 planning assumption is that the current level of U.S. mortgage activity will continue for the rest of the year with adjustments for seasonality. On this basis, U.S. mortgage inquiries across USIS and EWS would be down on a blended basis by 15%. We're assuming twin inquiries will see a slightly smaller decline in USIS credit inquiries as the level of consumer shopping behavior moderates. For perspective, our 2024 framework is over 30 points lower than the average current forecast from MBA, which is currently forecasting 24 origination units, up 17% versus our down 15%. And Fannie Mae, which is not forecast units, but is forecasting origination dollar volumes up 24%. MBA and Fannie Mae forecast mortgage rates move down to 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively, from 6.8% today. We will continue to forecast our mortgage market trends or current EFX run rates as we have done for the past 5-plus years. And as in the past, we do not include interest rate decreases or increases in our forecast. We will continue to share mortgage credit inquiry volume changes with you each quarter so you can make your own judgments on the mortgage market outlook for the future. Further, we are assuming that the U.S. economy will see modest deacceleration in '24 with growth slightly below the 2% average we generally assume in our long-term growth framework. In our key international countries, we expect slowing and low levels of GDP growth in Australia and in Canada, UK and Brazil, we expect about flat GDP. Despite the decline in the U.S. mortgage market and some modest economic deacceleration across our major markets, we expect to deliver 2024 revenue of about $5.72 billion at the midpoint of our guidance with reported growth at the midpoint of 8.6%. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5%, with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% and again at the center of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue growth should be about 9.5%, about 24 points better than the about 15% decline from the USIS and EWS mortgage inquiries in our framework. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10.5%, with organic growth of almost 8.5% and FX is about 190 basis points negative to our revenue growth. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of about 8% in 2024. This reflects mortgage revenue at up just under 2%, about 15 points better than underlying EWS mortgage transactions. And EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow almost 10.5%. Excluding the expected significant decline in ERC revenue as that pandemic support program completes, EWS non-mortgage revenue growth is about 12%, which is a strong performance given the expected weak hiring market in 2024 as well as the weaker overall U.S. economy. Talent in EWS is expected to grow about 7% despite a decline in our underlying markets and government is expected to deliver over 15% growth against a very strong over 30% comp last year. Twin record growth in NPI Vitality Index of over our 10% EFX goal and continued strong growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive EWS outperformance. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of almost 8% in 2024 at the high-end of their long-term growth target of 6% to 8%. Mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 20%, over 35 points stronger than the expected 16% decline in mortgage market inquiries. We are continuing to see substantial revenue benefits from both pricing increases from one of our largest USIS mortgage vendors that we pass on to customers at levels to maintain consistent margins and new product and pricing benefits by USIS. Non-mortgage revenue in USIS is expected to grow almost 4% despite modestly slower economic growth. The non-mortgage growth will be driven by continued strong commercial and identity and fraud growth as well as mid-single-digit growth in FI and auto. Consumer Services is expected to grow about 5% with financial marketing services expected to grow in the low single-digit percent. And we expect to see weaker revenue growth in D2C and telco. International had a very good 2023 with 6% organic constant dollar revenue growth but saw some weakening in end markets late in the year, particularly in Canada and Australia. We expect international constant currency growth to be over 15% in 2024 with organic constant currency growth of about 10%. The accelerating inflation we are seeing in Argentina is expected to benefit overall international revenue growth by over 5 percentage points. Although uncertain, we have assumed currency devaluation in Argentina will be more than offset by inflation in our 2024 planning. We expect our new product vitality index to be over 10% again in 2024, led by EWS in Latin America. As U.S. and IS and Canada principally complete their cloud transformation, we expect their NPI rollouts to accelerate as we exit 2024. For the full year, EBITDA is expected to be about $1.9 billion, up over 12% with adjusted EBITDA margins of about 33.3%. And adjusted EPS is expected to be about $7.35 per share, up about 9.5% from last year. Capital spending will decline by over $100 million to about $475 million or about 8.3% of revenue. The reduction reflects our progress in completing our cloud transformation and is a significant step towards our goal of 7% or below as we exit 2025. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2024 assumptions and guidance and also to provide our first quarter framework. Our 2024 guidance builds on our strong 2023 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth and pricing. John?\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, and as shown on Slide 14, our planning assumes a 16% reduction in mortgage credit inquiries in 2024. 1Q \u201824 is expected to see USIS mortgage credit inquiries down over 26% year-to-year with EWS twin inquiries at similar levels. Sequentially, as we move through 2024, we are assuming overall mortgage activity stays at about these levels with normal seasonality for the remaining quarters of 2024. Slide 15 provides a full year revenue walk, detailing the drivers of the 8.6% revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2024 revenue guidance of $5.72 billion. The blended about 15% decline in the U.S. mortgage credit and twin inquiries is negatively impacting 2024 total revenue growth by almost 3%. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the mortgage market at about 24 points is expected to benefit 2024 total revenue growth by about 4.5%, more than offsetting the almost 3 percentage points of negative revenue impact from the mortgage market decline. As a result, the expected about 9.5% increase in total mortgage revenue was a positive 1.5% impact on overall revenue growth. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to be about 8.5% on a constant currency basis and is driving about 7% of the growth in overall revenue. As Mark referenced earlier, the growth is within our long-term framework and is broad-based across all three BUs and again, the strongest performance in Workforce Solutions. The BVS acquisition completed last August is expected to contribute about 2 percentage points of revenue growth to 2024. Slide 16 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 9.5% increase to the midpoint of our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.35 per share. Revenue growth of 8.6% at our 2023 EBITDA margins of 32.2% will deliver 12.5% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margins in 2024 are expected to be about 33.3%, expanding about 110 basis points from 2023. The margin expansion delivers about 6 points of adjusted EPS growth. The expansion in margins is driven by the factors: organic constant dollar revenue growth in 2024 at about 8.5% is within our long-term financial framework. Consistent with that framework, we will generate about 50 basis points of margin expansion from high variable margins on our revenue growth. The cost reduction actions we executed in 2023 as well as actions related to the charge we announced this quarter will generate about $90 million in incremental spending reductions in 2024, of which about $60 million is expense savings in 2024 or about 100 basis points in EBITDA margin expansion. The actions we took in 2023 will generate an additional $65 million in spending reductions in 2024 on top of the $210 million of spending reductions in 2023. The cost action we announced this quarter will generate an additional $25 million in spending reductions in 2024. In 2024, cost savings we will generate from decommissioning of North American infrastructure in the second half of '23 will exceed the redundant system and migration costs we are incurring, generating about 30 basis points of margin benefit. Partially offsetting the about 180 basis points of margin expansion I referenced above, is principally higher variable compensation expense from the normalization of incentive and sales comp in 2024 that were at low levels in 2023 due to the substantial impact of the weak mortgage market on our performance. In 2024, our planning assumes we return to target levels of performance. As we look beyond 2024, the cost benefits of completing our cloud migration as well as accelerating high variable profit revenue growth are expected to drive significant improvement in EBITDA margins. In 2024, adjusted EBITDA should increase to about $1.9 billion, up 12.5% from 2023. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $60 million in 2024, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 5%. D&A is increasing in 2024 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The P&L line items below operating income, principally interest and other expense and tax expense, are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates and the increased debt from our BBS acquisition. Our estimated tax rate of about 26.7% is 50 basis points higher than the 26.2% in 2023, principally from higher foreign earnings. Slide 17 provides the specifics on our 2020 full year guidance that Mark discussed in detail. This slide includes additional detail on expected BU adjusted EBITDA margins as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. EWS EBITDA margins in 2024 at 52% are expected to be up from the 51% delivered in 2023, given strong non-mortgage revenue growth from new products, record growth, penetration and pricing, partially offset by the normalization of incentive comp. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34.5%, about flat with 2023. USIS is benefiting from revenue growth and 2023 cost actions. However, in the first half \u201824, USIS will have redundant systems costs as well as costs related to customer migrations prior to completion of migration of the consumer credit systems to Data Fabric. USIS is also being impacted by the normalization of incentive comp. International EBITDA margins at about 28% are expected to expand versus the 26.5% delivered in 2023, driven principally by revenue growth and good performance on 2023 cost actions. Corporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization is increasing in 2024 relative to 2023 due to the increases in incentive and equity compensation from the lower levels incurred in 2023 that I referenced earlier. Corporate functions such as finance, legal, HR, corporate technology and others are managing costs consistent with the cost actions we have taken in 2023. As Mark indicated, capital spending should be about $475 million in 2024, down over $100 million from 2023. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. With EBITDA increasing to about $1.9 billion and capital spending declining to $475 million, we expect to deliver over 50% growth in free cash flow in 2024 versus the $518 million we delivered in 2023. At this level of EBITDA and free cash flow, our EBITDA leverage should decline from the current levels of about 3.2x to 2.5x as we complete 2024. We believe these levels of leverage are nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases as well as continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. Slide 18 provides our guidance for 1Q '24. Revenue at the midpoint of guidance is expected to be about $1.385 billion, up 6.4% from 1Q '23. Constant currency growth is expected to be about 7.8%, with organic constant currency growth of about 4.7%. Non-mortgage revenue constant currency growth will be about 9.5%. Mortgage revenue should grow about 1% despite overall USIS and twin inquiry transactions being down about 26%. Business unit performance in the first quarter are expected to be as described below: Workforce Solutions revenue is expected to grow about 2% year-to-year. EWS mortgage revenue will be down about 15% and is expected to outperform underlying twin inquiries by about 11%. This mortgage outperformance is below the 18% we saw in 4Q as we lap the substantial growth in mortgage 36 volumes that occurred in the first quarter of '23. As we have discussed in the past, EWS long-term mortgage outperformance is expected to be about 11% to 13%, consistent with twin records, product and price levers that will drive overall Workforce Solutions' long-term revenue growth to 13% to 15%. Non-mortgage revenue should grow about 9% with Verifier non-mortgage revenue up 15%. Employer revenue will be down about 4% in the quarter due to the decline in ERC revenue that was referenced earlier. Excluding the significant decline in ERC revenue, total Workforce Solutions non-mortgage revenue will be up over 11% with employer up about 4.5%. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 50.5%, about flat year-to-year and down a little over 50 basis points sequentially, principally due to negative seasonal mix from higher employer services revenue in 1Q. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 9% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue will be up over 25%. USIS mortgage revenue is expected to outperform USIS credit inquiries by over 50% in the quarter. In the first quarter, we are benefiting from the significant price increases from a vendor that we discussed earlier as well as Equifax new product growth and pricing benefits. This level of outperformance versus the mortgage credit inquiries is expected to decline to under 30% as we move through 2024. USIS non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up about 3%. Non-mortgage will again be led by strong growth in commercial and identity and fraud and continued growth in FI consumer and FMS. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32%, flat versus the first quarter of '23 and down about 300 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to the Consumer Credit Exchange on Data Fabric. This is impacting 1Q '24 margins in addition to the seasonal decline in non-mortgage revenue and normalization of incentive compensation we referenced earlier. International constant currency revenue is expected to be up about 18%, representing about 4% organic constant currency growth from continued strong growth in Latam and Europe as well as mid-single-digit growth in Canada, offset by the decline in Asia Pacific discussed earlier. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 24%, up about 50 basis points versus 1Q '23, but down sequentially due to seasonally lower revenue in Canada and the UK, CRA and incentive costs. 1Q '24 Equifax EBITDA margins are expected to be about 29%, about flat with the first quarter of '23. As we discussed last year, corporate expense is much higher in the first quarter each year. The bulk of the expense related to our equity plans occurs in the first quarter and is reflected in corporate. Excluding the timing of equity compensation expense and the normalization of variable compensation in 2024, EBITDA margins would be over 32%. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q '24 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in 1Q '24. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q '24 to be $1.33 to $1.43 per share compared to 1Q '23 adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. The unprecedented 50% decline in the mortgage market from normal 2015 to '19 levels had a significant impact on Equifax moving close to $1 billion of revenue over the past 24 months from our P&L. Against that unprecedented mortgage market decline, EFX's diverse mix of businesses delivered strong growth through outperforming the mortgage market by over 20 percentage points, strong 10% to 20% constant dollar non-mortgage growth, a 13% vitality index from new products and the addition of bolt-on acquisitions. As shown on Slide 19, based on our 2024 guidance, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the market bottoms and moves from a headwind to tailwind and the mortgage market recovers towards its historic norms, that represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our mortgage gross margins is over $1 billion of mortgage revenue, we delivered over $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L in '24, '25 and '26 as the market recovers. Wrapping up on Slide 20. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 14% constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. We have strong momentum as we move into 2024. As we look at 2024, we expect to deliver 9% revenue growth and 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from the revenue growth and our cost savings plans despite our expected about 15% decline in the mortgage market. As discussed on the prior slide, with the mortgage market bottoming, we expect mortgage to move from -- move to a tailwind over the next several years as the market returns to normal inquiry levels. A big priority for 2024 is to complete our North American cloud transformation as well as significant portions of our global markets, which will result in continued margin expansion and reductions in our capital intensity that is a key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. Exiting 2024 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax cloud is a big milestone, so the team can move towards fully focusing on growth. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, leveraging EFX AI and ML and market-leading businesses, will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. I'm energized by our strong performance in 2023 and the momentum as we enter 2024, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask real quick on your -- you guys gave some more detail on the inquiries versus -- USIS versus twin. It sounded like you were saying next year, actually twin will be a little bit better because USIS is actually comping, I guess, better shopping activity. So it will actually be a little bit better than that down 16%. Just want to confirm that. And then why because obviously, this year, the inquiries on TWN have been quite a bit worse than the USIS side?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So in your question, you gave a big chunk of the answer, right? So we do think what's happening is USIS is comping off of 2023 where shopping activity was extremely high. so that their growth -- their decline rate in 2024 will be less relative to that very high 2023 year because of the shopping activity. And we think that's probably the biggest driver that we're seeing. Also, quite honestly, as we talked about what we do is we take a look at current run rates in the market, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates year-on-year, and we just run them throughout the year. That's when we say we're using run rates. That's what we mean. And we're kind of seeing that as we take a look through the January and the latter part of December. So we think it's both consistent with what we're seeing and also with the description I gave.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just one more on -- could you walk through some of your assumptions on talent like the volume assumptions that you're using?\nJohn Gamble: So I think what we indicated in talent, right, is that we're looking at BLS and BLS currently for the segments that we support is down about 10%. And we\u2019re just expecting that we\u2019re going to significantly outperform the markets we indicated by -- on the -- well over 10 points, right? So we feel very, very good about our ability to continue to grow talent despite the fact that we\u2019re going to see a hiring market that we think is probably going to be down in the order of 10%, which, again, is kind of what we\u2019re seeing so far this year. And in the -- sorry, and in the back half of the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Sternerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: John, could you just tell us how much mortgage revenues was as a percent of revenues in the fourth quarter? And also, could you just give us a sense of how much mortgage revenues have in terms of incremental margins in the '24 guide?\nJohn Gamble: So mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter was 15% of total. And for the fiscal year was 19%, right? And just for perspective, in the first quarter, it's going to be on the order of 20%, we think. A little under 20% based on the guidance we provided. That's driven by our outperformance in both EWS and USIS, that we talked about, Andrew.\nMark Begor: Can you ask the second question again?\nAndrew Steinerman: Yes. What's the incremental margin on mortgage revenues assumed in the '24 guide?\nJohn Gamble: Generally speaking, we've talked about this in the past, right, is that our variable -- let's say, our gross margin on mortgage blended. And obviously, it's heavily dependent on mix because our margin on mortgage solutions, our tri-merge business is very different than our margin in the USIS business overall, which is obviously very different than our margin in EWS, right? With EWS having the highest margins, obviously of the three in general versus the blended USIS margins. But generally, what we\u2019ve indicated is you think something like 65% gross margins for the mortgage business.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.\nSeth Weber: Just on the guidance for 8.5% non-mortgage growth for 2024. Can you just talk to how we should be interpreting that in maybe just any areas where you think there could be some upside in your mind as we go through the year?\nMark Begor: Well, we think the 8.5% is quite good. It's obviously inside of our 8% to 12% range, which is how we want to grow the company. We've talked about some of the pressures on our non-mortgage really in the talent market. And then second is the ERC impact, which that program has been curtailed by the IRS. And John talked about the impact that, that's having, which is on Equifax is a meaningful amount on a year-over-year basis. As far as upsides, I don't think we think about any upsides to that 8.5% because we think it's a pretty good growth rate.\nSeth Weber: Okay. Fair enough. And then can you just maybe talk to how much is left on the Medicaid determination here for the second quarter? How much is that like or -- sorry, through the first half of '24, how much that's going to contribute?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So we haven't given specific dollar amounts. What we've indicated, right, is that it continues to be a benefit for us, it was in the fourth quarter, and we expect it will continue to be in the first and the second quarters. But then again, just as a reminder, right, redetermination is something that occurs consistently as part of benefits programs that are funded by the federal government. So yes, there was an accelerated redetermination program following the end of the pandemic freezes that occurred. But the fact is, as we go forward, we'll continue to see redetermination revenue across our government business, and it is -- it will be an ongoing driver of growth once we get through '24 and we get past the accelerated redetermination activity we're seeing right now.\nMark Begor: And that's only one lever, obviously, for government vertical growth inside of Workforce Solutions, as we've talked about. As you know, that business was up super strong last year and again in '22, ended the year at over $500 million. So a very big business for us with big growth potential at the state level of continuing penetration. We've got a TAM there that's $3 billion plus against that $500 million. So there's a lot of opportunities to get the states that are not using our solution today. They're still using manual verification of income and employment, which is required for government social services. As you recall, we -- a couple of months ago, we landed a big extension to our CMS contract. It was $1.2 billion. That rolls into 2024. And then the new USDA contract that we signed in September was a new contract that obviously rolls into 2024. So there's a meaningful number of growth levers at government, and we're quite bullish as we talked about. We expect that business to be a big growth contributor to Workforce Solutions and outgrow Workforce Solutions 13 to 15 long-term growth rate, significantly outgrow that again in \u201824.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company.\nKyle Peterson: Great. I appreciate you taking the questions. I wanted to touch on the non-mortgage growth that you guys called out in the guide. I think you guys have walked through some assumptions on kind of volume on mortgage and talent really well. I just wanted to see if you could provide any color for your volume assumptions around some other areas such as whether it's auto or cards, auto, consumer just to try to kind of figure out the delta between pricing and share versus volume trends in those markets?\nMark Begor: I'd start with -- and I think we tried to be clear about that. We don't see any real change as we go into 2024 from those verticals like cards, auto, p loans, how they performed in the second half of last year. We talked a little bit about fintech was impacted in the second half of '22 and into '23, but that seems to be kind of a, I would call it, a stable level now, meaning it's not declining, which is good news versus the declines that happened last year. Large FIs are fairly consistent as far as they're still originating because consumers are strong. There's some choppiness with some of the smaller FIs that might be impacted by some liquidity stuff. But again, not a real change from what we saw in the second half of last year.\nKyle Peterson: That make sense and is helpful. And I guess just a follow-up on capital deployment and priorities there. Just want to see how -- if you kind of prioritize where some of the near-term priorities are on the capital front, you mentioned leverage and eventually being to potentially buy back stock or increase the dividend. How are you guys thinking about some of those initiatives and priorities versus potential bolt-on M&A and kind of what's the near-term priority between the two?\nMark Begor: Yes. So I'll go near term, which is 2024, I think we laid out that CapEx is coming down again this year in 2024. We expect it to step down again next year as we complete the cloud, big cloud completion in our USIS business and some of our international properties in the first half of this year and getting to 90% cloud complete will be a big milestone. So you're going to see our CapEx come down over the short term, meaning in '24 and over the medium term in '25 again as we complete the cloud. Over that timeframe, we expect our margins to continue to expand, which will grow our free cash flow. Our free cash flow this year is up almost 2x.\nJohn Gamble: It's well over 50% this year, yes.\nMark Begor: So our free cash flow in 2024 is up substantially. We expect that to continue to grow as we get into '25 and '26. And so as you get over the -- again, back in '24, we have a pipeline of M&A that we're watching. I suspect that given we're already in February here that, that M&A would be in the second half if we do some. We're going to be very disciplined around M&A as we always have been. And we're focused on integrating the large number of acquisitions. We've done 14 in a little over three years that we're integrating like Boa Vista, as we talked about on the call. But when you get look forward to '25 and '26, we'll continue to add bolt-on M&A inside of that 8 to 12 framework that includes 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A. So that's clearly a part of our strategy. And we've been crystal clear that as our margins expand and we still have the goal of 39%, and we still have the goal of growing 50 bps a year post 39. As we move towards that 39% and our CapEx comes down, we would expect to have significant excess free cash flow when you get into '25 and '26, where we could look at restarting the dividend and also look at buying back meaningful amounts of our stock, and that's no change in that. We've been very clear in that over the last really three years that that\u2019s the goal we\u2019ve been working towards as we complete the cloud.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research.\nKelsey Zhu: I think you have raised government TAM numbers, again, from $4 billion to $5 billion. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on where the incremental upside comes from? And just in general, what are some of the major programs that you're targeting or states that you're trying to get in growth into that will bridge to this $5 billion TAM number?\nMark Begor: Yes. And it's really around the government social services delivery, which is huge. There's 90 million Americans roughly that get some form of government social services, whether it's food support, rent support, cash support, childcare support, student lending support, all those different programs, unemployment support. All of those programs have to be verified by income and you have to verify employment and there's also an incarceration check on many of them, which is from our APRs data set. We've been growing rapidly there because of the real desire to deliver those social services quickly to those that deserve them and need them. And our instant data really delivers that. And we're competing, as you know, against manual processes and paper paste dogs, which means the recipient who's after the social services generally has to bring in proof of income. We can deliver it instantly. And of course, where our data is accurate, it's one to two weeks old depending upon the time frame because we're getting payroll every two weeks and we have such broad coverage. So our programs are really at kind of three levels at the federal, state and local level. We have federal programs where some of that verification is done at the federal level like with Social Security Administration. That's a large contract for us. We talked earlier in this call about the CMS contract that we extended. It's done at the federal, but then executed at the state level and the new USDA contract. And then we operate at the very state level and the state levels are more complex. There's a large, large penetration opportunity at the states. That's really where a big portion of our growth will come and a big portion of that TAM that you referenced is all the states -- all 50 states are not with Equifax, and it's really at the agency level, each state has separate agencies that deliver these services, and that's who our customers are. I think as you know, we've added resources over the last number of years at the state capital levels to work on deploying these resources. So we have a large pipeline. As you might imagine, we're focused on the large states: California, Texas, New York, Florida and some of the big, big states that are out there, but we have a focus on all of them. And as you go forward over the next '24, into '25, '26, that will be a big part of the growth is our penetration into the states to deliver these services. And it's a very strong value prop. In many cases, the data costs are subsidized by the federal government just as the social services are. So it's matter of getting the technology aligned with ours and helping change the process flow at each of those different agencies in all 50 states in order to deliver those. So we're very bullish about that business. As we said, it's close to $0.5 billion at the end of last year, and we expect strong double-digit growth again in 2024.\nJohn Gamble: I think one of the reasons the TAM is growing as we continue to integrate the insights business into Workforce Solutions fully. We're able to now see there's incremental products that can serve portions of that government market that we couldn't serve before. So I think the part of the increase in the TAM in addition to what Mark described is the broadening of our product set because of the Insights acquisition. So we feel very good how that's going to continue to allow us to broaden that TAM even further over time as we generate new products to service government needs.\nKelsey Zhu: Got it. Super helpful. My second question is. I'm not sure if it's too early to talk about how you think about pricing for VantageScore 4.0 in the mortgage vertical. I think based on the FHA\u2019s original time line guidance; we should start transitioning towards that two score system later this year. And I think pricing decision for VantageScore is being made at the bureau level. So just curious to hear how you're thinking about setting prices for VantageScore for mortgage?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think as you know, there's two pieces to that potential change by the regulator that is still in a comment period. One is to add Vantage to every federally supported mortgage. That's going to be a good guide for Equifax when it happens going forward. And then second is the 3B requirement going to 2B. We've talked before that we expect on the second half of that mortgage originators to continue to pull the three credit files because there are meaningful differences between the three credit bureaus, three credit files. For example, there's 8.5 million consumers that are only in one of the three credit files in the United States. So the value of three is quite important. On the Vantage plus FICO, same thing. It\u2019s still in a comment period. We haven\u2019t put either of those into our framework for 2024 because we\u2019re not sure they\u2019re going to happen or what the impact would be. But you point out that if it\u2019s a mandatory to have a FICO and Vantage score, that\u2019s a positive for our business to sell a second score in every mortgage. And no, we haven\u2019t thought about pricing on it because we really -- it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s going to happen or when it will happen, if it does.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: I wanted to ask first -- well, I guess two clarifying questions for you. One is the issuance metric for workforce on the mortgage side. I know that's something you guys introduced last quarter. Can you just help us again walk us through what that measure, kind of how you're getting to that number? And there's a lot of data out there around what issuance is. So just kind of helping us think through if we're comparing your number to kind of market data out there, what should we be thinking about? And then my second question is on the incremental margins on mortgage. I think last year, the 80% came up a fair amount, and I realize there's a mix impact, I think you said 65% earlier. Just trying to reconcile that, too.\nJohn Gamble: So I'll do the second one first. And so I think I was asked about what I gave as gross margins, right, so that people should think about gross margins. Incremental margins may be a little higher, right? They're going to be a little lower than the 80% that would have been talked about last year simply because there's been a significant price increase from one of our vendors. We pass it through. We do mark it up, so we can maintain EBITDA margins, but we don't -- we can't mark it up to maintain gross margins, right? So we did see -- we'll see some negative impact on variable margins on the mortgage business overall.\nMark Begor: Regardless, incremental mortgage margins are super attractive. And we tried to be clear in including that our view of what normal mortgage volumes are in the 2015 to '19 range versus where we are today at 50% below that. There's a lot of upsides in '24, '25, '26, and we try to frame that in talking about the $1 billion of revenue potential in the future. On the second half of your -- or first half of your question about inquiries. The USIS inquiries because of shopping are different than the EWS inquiries, which generally are more involved in closed loans, meaning on the shopping side, someone will do shopping on two or three different mortgage originators, but close with only one. So that's the difference. And last year, we opted to try to disclose that data. You referenced market volume data that's out there. There really isn't any market volume data out there, except on a very long lag basis. There are forecasts which you can describe as data, I would call those forecasts and that data. And we talked about what MBA is forecasting and some of the others and some of the Street is forecasting improvements later in the year based on rate cuts that haven't happened yet for mortgage volume. We've been very clear, and we've been doing it since I've been here that we forecast mortgage volumes on the way up. We did it on the way down, and we're doing it currently based on our current trends. And as it changes, we'll share it with you. We tried to frame the positive potential impact on us on the top line as well as the bottom line as mortgage returns to normal. And again, we think over time, whether it's \u201824, \u201825, \u201926, mortgage volumes will return to normal. It's just uncertain when the Fed is going to make those rate changes and we'll be transparent on what our activity is because we see activity every day. And that's what we talk about when we talk about trends. We have -- we know what the inquiries are we got yesterday, and we know what they were last week and the week before, and we used those to really forecast what we think they're going to be going forward.\nHeather Balsky: I think -- I was curious more on the origination side, but potentially, the answer is kind of the same there.\nMark Begor: It's actually, it's a little bit different. Originations, we don't get actual originations and the industry doesn't for until six months after they happen, somewhere in that time frame. It's a complex process for mortgages to close and then those mortgages to be posted in essence, on the credit file is when we see it. So the -- any mortgage origination data is actually on a lag basis. Obviously, there are forecasts that lots of people put together, but those are forecasts and not actual data. You can't determine what -- how many originations happened yesterday, that's just not available. Inquiries, yes, and we're super transparent with you about inquiries that we see on a current basis.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: First one, John, for you. Could you talk a little bit about maybe quantifying the duplicative cost and migration costs during the first half of '24? That should go away as you start to hit those milestones. And is there a substantial risk of some of this stuff kind of trickling into 3Q and 4Q in terms of just not necessarily getting all the clients to migrate? That's kind of the first question I got.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So I think in the margin bridge, we talked about this, right? I think what we indicated is the net benefit is about 30 basis points in the year, right? And so what you can think about Shlomo's exactly as described, right, we're incurring incremental costs in the first half of the year. The bulk of which go away by the second half of the year, principally related to the North American migrations to the -- of the consumer credit file to Data Fabric. And so we see those incremental costs mostly occurring in the first half. Some of them continue, right, because we're continuing to do migrations in international, et cetera, but we see a substantial cost reduction or benefit from the elimination of the redundant costs principally and also the elimination of migration costs as you go into next year. So in total, it's 30 basis points for the year. The biggest part of the cost occurs in the first half.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then also just going back to kind of those inquiries forecast. I think last quarter, you said that based on what you were seeing in the market, the inquiries would be down around close to 15%. And it seems like that's the same forecast this quarter despite the fact that rates are -- have gone down. And I was wondering, did you kind of hone your forecast a little bit based on changes in shopping activity like -- can you talk about the difference in terms of -- or I guess the reason why you kept that forecast the same despite the fact that rates have gone down?\nMark Begor: I think we did highlight that we saw some -- we used the term slight because they are slight improvements in, call it, the net last almost 60 days, which we view as a positive, which is why we're -- it feels like we're at a bottom in the mortgage market, which I think is a positive for Equifax. And when you look at Equifax at -- and again, we're calling a mark-to-market that's down. But meaning said differently, in a flat mortgage market, we grow our revenue because of our outperformance in both businesses through price product, more records in EWS and penetration in EWS. I think the 15, John, is kind of in the same ZIP code even with those slight improvements. But we'll continue to be transparent as we look forward. And we know you and many others on the call, are looking for an improvement in inquiries. We are, too. When it happens, we'll share it with you, and I think that's going to be a real positive for Equifax going forward. But we want to be consistent in how we forecasted for as long as I've been here around -- off of current trends because, look, we're not economists, we can't forecast where rates are going. None of us forecasted the rates last year and the increases. And as recently as this past weekend, I think the Fed kind of pushed out the potential rate decreases that many were expecting in March out to later in the year. So we think it\u2019s prudent to have a balanced forecast that\u2019s consistent with how we\u2019ve done it historically.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Guru on for Owen. Can you maybe please talk a little bit about the mortgage increased trends in January? Has it been -- was it better or has it trended down 16% full year expectation?\nMark Begor: Yes, they're a little bit better than how we thought they would be when we gave guidance in October. That started in December, I said we called it slight improvements. But that's factored into the guidance we've shared with you this morning. So we've included that in the down 15%, and we'll continue to watch that closely. And watch it going forward. And obviously, we all know if, in fact, the Fed is going to take rates down. That's good news for our mortgage business in the future, which is why we tried to frame that $1 billion of potential revenue in the future as mortgage volumes return to more normal levels, and we expect them to return to normal levels. At these high rates, people are sitting on homes that they want to upgrade and move to that 4-bedroom home versus a three and they're waiting for rates to come down. Now what's that inflection point? We'll see. But the positive from our eyes is that it feels like the market has bottomed and with the Fed's managing inflation and indicating rate cuts in the future, that's going to be a good guide for Equifax and a tailwind going forward. The question is when?\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's really helpful. Also, could you maybe please add some -- a little bit more color on how the 24% outperformance compared to the mortgage market figure was arrived at? I mean I know some of this has already been touched upon, but if you can maybe expand on that a little bit.\nJohn Gamble: Our overall mortgage outperformance lended USIS and EWS, right? So again -- so it's kind of two drivers, right? So we've talked about. We expect in the first quarter, for example, EWS outperformed by on the order of 11 points, and we think that's really driven by price and records, right? And then -- and product, as we said, we're lapping the launch of mortgage 36, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, right, and was kind of fully implemented in the first quarter of 2023. So we don't see the big product benefits that we saw in '23 recurring here in 2024. Over time, we will continue to launch new products. We do it very consistently across the business. and we should see that in mortgage as well, and that will continue to add to the outperformance in EWS. In USIS, obviously, the outperformance is extremely strong in the first quarter, right, on the order of 50 points relative to what we're seeing the market at. And again, it's really two big drivers. We've talked about it already. We've seen a substantial increase from a vendor that we passed through as part of our pricing and we mark it up to try to maintain our EBITDA margins. That is a little dilutive on our overall margins, but it is something that we generate significant incremental profit from. So we do mark it up to maintain EBITDA margins. We're also seeing some incremental growth because in the second half of last year, we saw some -- we saw acceleration in products that are sold very early in the mortgage cycle. And since they accelerated in the second half of last year relative to the first half of last year, we're seeing incremental growth relative to the mortgage market transaction levels in the first quarter of 2023 relative to what we would have seen last year.\nMark Begor: On some new products that Equifax rolled out.\nJohn Gamble: And it's also the prequal products that have gone on across the industry. So that's why we're indicating as, as we move through 2024, we would expect the level of outperformance in USIS mortgage to decline as we lap the periods in which those prequal products were launched.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: I wanted to ask about the comment you made on the delinquencies. It seems like subprime has been getting worse approaching '09 levels, as you called out earlier. Do you see that spreading to near prime or prime? And I guess, so far, it hasn't -- you haven't seen changes in consumer behavior and things like that. But I guess, how do you think that this plays out?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. I've been in the financial services space for a long time. Obviously, here at Equifax for almost six years, but for 10 years, we're in what is now Synchrony. So I know the financial services space well. And personally, I don't. Yes, that's not my view that it's going to spread and primarily because unemployment is so low and employment is so high. As long as people are working, they have the capacity to maintain their financial obligations. And of course, financial institutions like meaning our customers are using data to make sure they're offering credit to those that can pay it back. So we're in an environment where unemployment really drives positives in most of the delinquency bands. Subprime has been pressured primarily because of inflation in what we see. While they're working that demographic inflation, whether it's heat, gas, groceries, all those have pressured that group. And then as a reminder, it's a small part, a small part, an important part, but a small part of the financial services ecosystem, meaning most of the lending that takes place in cards and auto is done in prime and near prime. Subprime is generally done today with fintechs. That's where most of the -- and they've tightened up starting in the summer of '22, almost 18 months ago. They started tightening up because they saw subprime consumers pressured by inflation, and they were getting pressured around their balance sheets because most of them are bank funded or securitization funded. So they had some pressures. So no, I don't see it as long as unemployment stays. The thing that we watch a lot and I watch a lot personally is where's unemployment. And as it stays low and it feels like it's going to stay low. I think we still have something like nine million jobs open with five billion people looking, and we're still generating net new jobs. So that's a good environment generally for the financial services industry.\nToni Kaplan: Yes, makes a lot of sense. I wanted to ask a question on margins in a slightly different way. You talked about the moving pieces, very helpful bridge that you gave. And so the way I'm thinking about it is you have sort of the normal margin expansion from growth, you have the more cost savings than you previously expected. Better mortgage environment in the second half and then you have the redundant -- some of the redundant system costs going away in the second half. So basically, a lot of positives in second half of the year for margins. I guess where -- what kind of ballpark should we be thinking about exiting '24? And obviously, I'm trying to think about my '25 number.\nJohn Gamble: I think it's a little too early for us to begin in third and fourth quarter guidance. But look, we've said consistently, we expect to see nice margin improvements as we move through this year. And that's both sequentially and then relative to what we delivered last year. So we continue -- we expect that to continue to happen. I think you summarized what we talked about very well, right? And we do expect to see very good margin progression as we go through this year. And then obviously, to the extent that there was a mortgage recovery, which we haven\u2019t forecast, we should see accelerated margin expansion as that occurs, right, based on variable to gross profit margins that you apply against our mortgage.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Trevor Burns for any closing remarks.\nTrevor Burns: I just want to thank you everybody for joining the call today. And do you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to myself or Sam. Otherwise, have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, and as shown on Slide 14, our planning assumes a 16% reduction in mortgage credit inquiries in 2024. 1Q \u201824 is expected to see USIS mortgage credit inquiries down over 26% year-to-year with EWS twin inquiries at similar levels. Sequentially, as we move through 2024, we are assuming overall mortgage activity stays at about these levels with normal seasonality for the remaining quarters of 2024. Slide 15 provides a full year revenue walk, detailing the drivers of the 8.6% revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2024 revenue guidance of $5.72 billion. The blended about 15% decline in the U.S. mortgage credit and twin inquiries is negatively impacting 2024 total revenue growth by almost 3%. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the mortgage market at about 24 points is expected to benefit 2024 total revenue growth by about 4.5%, more than offsetting the almost 3 percentage points of negative revenue impact from the mortgage market decline. As a result, the expected about 9.5% increase in total mortgage revenue was a positive 1.5% impact on overall revenue growth. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to be about 8.5% on a constant currency basis and is driving about 7% of the growth in overall revenue. As Mark referenced earlier, the growth is within our long-term framework and is broad-based across all three BUs and again, the strongest performance in Workforce Solutions. The BVS acquisition completed last August is expected to contribute about 2 percentage points of revenue growth to 2024. Slide 16 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 9.5% increase to the midpoint of our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.35 per share. Revenue growth of 8.6% at our 2023 EBITDA margins of 32.2% will deliver 12.5% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margins in 2024 are expected to be about 33.3%, expanding about 110 basis points from 2023. The margin expansion delivers about 6 points of adjusted EPS growth. The expansion in margins is driven by the factors: organic constant dollar revenue growth in 2024 at about 8.5% is within our long-term financial framework. Consistent with that framework, we will generate about 50 basis points of margin expansion from high variable margins on our revenue growth. The cost reduction actions we executed in 2023 as well as actions related to the charge we announced this quarter will generate about $90 million in incremental spending reductions in 2024, of which about $60 million is expense savings in 2024 or about 100 basis points in EBITDA margin expansion. The actions we took in 2023 will generate an additional $65 million in spending reductions in 2024 on top of the $210 million of spending reductions in 2023. The cost action we announced this quarter will generate an additional $25 million in spending reductions in 2024. In 2024, cost savings we will generate from decommissioning of North American infrastructure in the second half of '23 will exceed the redundant system and migration costs we are incurring, generating about 30 basis points of margin benefit. Partially offsetting the about 180 basis points of margin expansion I referenced above, is principally higher variable compensation expense from the normalization of incentive and sales comp in 2024 that were at low levels in 2023 due to the substantial impact of the weak mortgage market on our performance. In 2024, our planning assumes we return to target levels of performance. As we look beyond 2024, the cost benefits of completing our cloud migration as well as accelerating high variable profit revenue growth are expected to drive significant improvement in EBITDA margins. In 2024, adjusted EBITDA should increase to about $1.9 billion, up 12.5% from 2023. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $60 million in 2024, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 5%. D&A is increasing in 2024 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The P&L line items below operating income, principally interest and other expense and tax expense, are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates and the increased debt from our BBS acquisition. Our estimated tax rate of about 26.7% is 50 basis points higher than the 26.2% in 2023, principally from higher foreign earnings. Slide 17 provides the specifics on our 2020 full year guidance that Mark discussed in detail. This slide includes additional detail on expected BU adjusted EBITDA margins as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. EWS EBITDA margins in 2024 at 52% are expected to be up from the 51% delivered in 2023, given strong non-mortgage revenue growth from new products, record growth, penetration and pricing, partially offset by the normalization of incentive comp. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34.5%, about flat with 2023. USIS is benefiting from revenue growth and 2023 cost actions. However, in the first half \u201824, USIS will have redundant systems costs as well as costs related to customer migrations prior to completion of migration of the consumer credit systems to Data Fabric. USIS is also being impacted by the normalization of incentive comp. International EBITDA margins at about 28% are expected to expand versus the 26.5% delivered in 2023, driven principally by revenue growth and good performance on 2023 cost actions. Corporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization is increasing in 2024 relative to 2023 due to the increases in incentive and equity compensation from the lower levels incurred in 2023 that I referenced earlier. Corporate functions such as finance, legal, HR, corporate technology and others are managing costs consistent with the cost actions we have taken in 2023. As Mark indicated, capital spending should be about $475 million in 2024, down over $100 million from 2023. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. With EBITDA increasing to about $1.9 billion and capital spending declining to $475 million, we expect to deliver over 50% growth in free cash flow in 2024 versus the $518 million we delivered in 2023. At this level of EBITDA and free cash flow, our EBITDA leverage should decline from the current levels of about 3.2x to 2.5x as we complete 2024. We believe these levels of leverage are nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases as well as continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. Slide 18 provides our guidance for 1Q '24. Revenue at the midpoint of guidance is expected to be about $1.385 billion, up 6.4% from 1Q '23. Constant currency growth is expected to be about 7.8%, with organic constant currency growth of about 4.7%. Non-mortgage revenue constant currency growth will be about 9.5%. Mortgage revenue should grow about 1% despite overall USIS and twin inquiry transactions being down about 26%. Business unit performance in the first quarter are expected to be as described below: Workforce Solutions revenue is expected to grow about 2% year-to-year. EWS mortgage revenue will be down about 15% and is expected to outperform underlying twin inquiries by about 11%. This mortgage outperformance is below the 18% we saw in 4Q as we lap the substantial growth in mortgage 36 volumes that occurred in the first quarter of '23. As we have discussed in the past, EWS long-term mortgage outperformance is expected to be about 11% to 13%, consistent with twin records, product and price levers that will drive overall Workforce Solutions' long-term revenue growth to 13% to 15%. Non-mortgage revenue should grow about 9% with Verifier non-mortgage revenue up 15%. Employer revenue will be down about 4% in the quarter due to the decline in ERC revenue that was referenced earlier. Excluding the significant decline in ERC revenue, total Workforce Solutions non-mortgage revenue will be up over 11% with employer up about 4.5%. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 50.5%, about flat year-to-year and down a little over 50 basis points sequentially, principally due to negative seasonal mix from higher employer services revenue in 1Q. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 9% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue will be up over 25%. USIS mortgage revenue is expected to outperform USIS credit inquiries by over 50% in the quarter. In the first quarter, we are benefiting from the significant price increases from a vendor that we discussed earlier as well as Equifax new product growth and pricing benefits. This level of outperformance versus the mortgage credit inquiries is expected to decline to under 30% as we move through 2024. USIS non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up about 3%. Non-mortgage will again be led by strong growth in commercial and identity and fraud and continued growth in FI consumer and FMS. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32%, flat versus the first quarter of '23 and down about 300 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to the Consumer Credit Exchange on Data Fabric. This is impacting 1Q '24 margins in addition to the seasonal decline in non-mortgage revenue and normalization of incentive compensation we referenced earlier. International constant currency revenue is expected to be up about 18%, representing about 4% organic constant currency growth from continued strong growth in Latam and Europe as well as mid-single-digit growth in Canada, offset by the decline in Asia Pacific discussed earlier. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 24%, up about 50 basis points versus 1Q '23, but down sequentially due to seasonally lower revenue in Canada and the UK, CRA and incentive costs. 1Q '24 Equifax EBITDA margins are expected to be about 29%, about flat with the first quarter of '23. As we discussed last year, corporate expense is much higher in the first quarter each year. The bulk of the expense related to our equity plans occurs in the first quarter and is reflected in corporate. Excluding the timing of equity compensation expense and the normalization of variable compensation in 2024, EBITDA margins would be over 32%. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q '24 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in 1Q '24. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q '24 to be $1.33 to $1.43 per share compared to 1Q '23 adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Yes. So in your question, you gave a big chunk of the answer, right? So we do think what's happening is USIS is comping off of 2023 where shopping activity was extremely high. so that their growth -- their decline rate in 2024 will be less relative to that very high 2023 year because of the shopping activity. And we think that's probably the biggest driver that we're seeing. Also, quite honestly, as we talked about what we do is we take a look at current run rates in the market, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates year-on-year, and we just run them throughout the year. That's when we say we're using run rates. That's what we mean. And we're kind of seeing that as we take a look through the January and the latter part of December. So we think it's both consistent with what we're seeing and also with the description I gave. So I think what we indicated in talent, right, is that we're looking at BLS and BLS currently for the segments that we support is down about 10%. And we're just expecting that we're going to significantly outperform the markets we indicated by -- on the -- well over 10 points, right? So we feel very, very good about our ability to continue to grow talent despite the fact that we're going to see a hiring market that we think is probably going to be down in the order of 10%, which, again, is kind of what we're seeing so far this year. And in the -- sorry, and in the back half of the fourth quarter. So mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter was 15% of total. And for the fiscal year was 19%, right? And just for perspective, in the first quarter, it's going to be on the order of 20%, we think. A little under 20% based on the guidance we provided. That's driven by our outperformance in both EWS and USIS, that we talked about, Andrew. Generally speaking, we've talked about this in the past, right, is that our variable -- let's say, our gross margin on mortgage blended. And obviously, it's heavily dependent on mix because our margin on mortgage solutions, our tri-merge business is very different than our margin in the USIS business overall, which is obviously very different than our margin in EWS, right? With EWS having the highest margins, obviously of the three in general versus the blended USIS margins. But generally, what we've indicated is you think something like 65% gross margins for the mortgage business. Yes. So we haven't given specific dollar amounts. What we've indicated, right, is that it continues to be a benefit for us, it was in the fourth quarter, and we expect it will continue to be in the first and the second quarters. But then again, just as a reminder, right, redetermination is something that occurs consistently as part of benefits programs that are funded by the federal government. So yes, there was an accelerated redetermination program following the end of the pandemic freezes that occurred. But the fact is, as we go forward, we'll continue to see redetermination revenue across our government business, and it is -- it will be an ongoing driver of growth once we get through '24 and we get past the accelerated redetermination activity we're seeing right now. It's well over 50% this year, yes. I think one of the reasons the TAM is growing as we continue to integrate the insights business into Workforce Solutions fully. We're able to now see there's incremental products that can serve portions of that government market that we couldn't serve before. So I think the part of the increase in the TAM in addition to what Mark described is the broadening of our product set because of the Insights acquisition. So we feel very good how that's going to continue to allow us to broaden that TAM even further over time as we generate new products to service government needs. So I'll do the second one first. And so I think I was asked about what I gave as gross margins, right, so that people should think about gross margins. Incremental margins may be a little higher, right? They're going to be a little lower than the 80% that would have been talked about last year simply because there's been a significant price increase from one of our vendors. We pass it through. We do mark it up, so we can maintain EBITDA margins, but we don't -- we can't mark it up to maintain gross margins, right? So we did see -- we'll see some negative impact on variable margins on the mortgage business overall. Yes. So I think in the margin bridge, we talked about this, right? I think what we indicated is the net benefit is about 30 basis points in the year, right? And so what you can think about Shlomo's exactly as described, right, we're incurring incremental costs in the first half of the year. The bulk of which go away by the second half of the year, principally related to the North American migrations to the -- of the consumer credit file to Data Fabric. And so we see those incremental costs mostly occurring in the first half. Some of them continue, right, because we're continuing to do migrations in international, et cetera, but we see a substantial cost reduction or benefit from the elimination of the redundant costs principally and also the elimination of migration costs as you go into next year. So in total, it's 30 basis points for the year. The biggest part of the cost occurs in the first half. Our overall mortgage outperformance lended USIS and EWS, right? So again -- so it's kind of two drivers, right? So we've talked about. We expect in the first quarter, for example, EWS outperformed by on the order of 11 points, and we think that's really driven by price and records, right? And then -- and product, as we said, we're lapping the launch of mortgage 36, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, right, and was kind of fully implemented in the first quarter of 2023. So we don't see the big product benefits that we saw in '23 recurring here in 2024. Over time, we will continue to launch new products. We do it very consistently across the business. and we should see that in mortgage as well, and that will continue to add to the outperformance in EWS. In USIS, obviously, the outperformance is extremely strong in the first quarter, right, on the order of 50 points relative to what we're seeing the market at. And again, it's really two big drivers. We've talked about it already. We've seen a substantial increase from a vendor that we passed through as part of our pricing and we mark it up to try to maintain our EBITDA margins. That is a little dilutive on our overall margins, but it is something that we generate significant incremental profit from. So we do mark it up to maintain EBITDA margins. We're also seeing some incremental growth because in the second half of last year, we saw some -- we saw acceleration in products that are sold very early in the mortgage cycle. And since they accelerated in the second half of last year relative to the first half of last year, we're seeing incremental growth relative to the mortgage market transaction levels in the first quarter of 2023 relative to what we would have seen last year. And it's also the prequal products that have gone on across the industry. So that's why we're indicating as, as we move through 2024, we would expect the level of outperformance in USIS mortgage to decline as we lap the periods in which those prequal products were launched. Yes. I've been in the financial services space for a long time. Obviously, here at Equifax for almost six years, but for 10 years, we're in what is now Synchrony. So I know the financial services space well. And personally, I don't. Yes, that's not my view that it's going to spread and primarily because unemployment is so low and employment is so high. As long as people are working, they have the capacity to maintain their financial obligations. And of course, financial institutions like meaning our customers are using data to make sure they're offering credit to those that can pay it back. So we're in an environment where unemployment really drives positives in most of the delinquency bands. Subprime has been pressured primarily because of inflation in what we see. While they're working that demographic inflation, whether it's heat, gas, groceries, all those have pressured that group. And then as a reminder, it's a small part, a small part, an important part, but a small part of the financial services ecosystem, meaning most of the lending that takes place in cards and auto is done in prime and near prime. Subprime is generally done today with fintechs. That's where most of the -- and they've tightened up starting in the summer of '22, almost 18 months ago. They started tightening up because they saw subprime consumers pressured by inflation, and they were getting pressured around their balance sheets because most of them are bank funded or securitization funded. So they had some pressures. So no, I don't see it as long as unemployment stays. The thing that we watch a lot and I watch a lot personally is where's unemployment. And as it stays low and it feels like it's going to stay low. I think we still have something like nine million jobs open with five billion people looking, and we're still generating net new jobs. So that's a good environment generally for the financial services industry. I think it's a little too early for us to begin in third and fourth quarter guidance. But look, we've said consistently, we expect to see nice margin improvements as we move through this year. And that's both sequentially and then relative to what we delivered last year. So we continue -- we expect that to continue to happen. I think you summarized what we talked about very well, right? And we do expect to see very good margin progression as we go through this year. And then obviously, to the extent that there was a mortgage recovery, which we haven't forecast, we should see accelerated margin expansion as that occurs, right, based on variable to gross profit margins that you apply against our mortgage."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Before I cover results for the quarter, I wanted to spend a few minutes on our 2023 performance. Equifax performed extremely well last year against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. Our strong performance was against one of the most challenging mortgage markets in the last 20-plus years with our USIS mortgage inquiries down 34% and Equifax mortgage revenue down 17%, which equates to almost $500 million of lost mortgage revenue last year. Despite the significant decline in 2023 mortgage revenue, Equifax delivered. We delivered 2% organic constant currency revenue growth with 7% organic constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth, which was at the low end of our long-term 7% to 10% growth rate. Importantly, we had sequential improvement during the year with 8% total growth and 9% non-mortgage growth in the fourth quarter. We also delivered over 100 new products with a vitality of 14%, which was a record for Equifax and well above our 10% long-term goal. EWF delivered strong 10% organic non-mortgage revenue growth, which allowed them to deliver flat total growth despite mortgage revenue that was down 23%. They delivered sequential non-mortgage revenue growth and exited fourth quarter with strong 17% non-mortgage growth. Verifier non-mortgage revenue grew 14%, led by government that grew over 30% and talent that grew 5% despite the white collar hiring market that was down just under 10%. EWS grew current twin records to $168 million, up $16 million or 11% and grew total records to $657 million or $53 million records. We added 17 new twin partnerships last year, our highest number ever and have a strong pipeline for 2024. And in the third quarter, EWS signed a contract extension to provide income verification to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as part of a contract valued at up to $1.2 billion over the next five years, which is the largest contract in Equifax's history. EWS also delivered over 20% new product vitality. USIS delivered 4% revenue growth with 7% non-mortgage growth within their 6% to 8% long-term growth framework, while mortgage declined 5%. The USIS Commercial and Consumer Solutions business had very strong years with double-digit revenue growth led by strong market penetration and new products. International delivered 12% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant dollar growth, led by continued very strong 17% organic growth in Latin America with a vitality index over 15% and close to 10% revenue growth in our UK CRA. And in July, we completed the BVS acquisition in the fast-growing Brazilian market. We delivered these strong results while making significant progress towards completing our cloud migration, ending the year with about 70% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud. We decommissioned seven data centers and migrated about 37,000 customers to the Equifax Cloud. We are convinced that our new EFX cloud single data fabric and AI capabilities are delivering new differentiated products faster with better performance and will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. The strong progress we made in 2023 will enable the substantial completion of our North American transformation and customer migrations in the first half of 2024, including decommissioning of the mainframes and major North American data centers. Also in 2024, we expect to make substantial progress towards completing transformation activities in Europe and Latin America. By the end of 2024, we expect to have about 90% of our revenue in the new Equifax cloud with the vast majority of new models and scores being built using Equifax AI. In 2023, we executed very well against our EFX Cloud and broader operational restructuring plan across Equifax, reflecting cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers and other broader spending controls in excess of our original $210 million goal. We expect an incremental $90 million of run rate spending reductions in 2024, which is up about $25 million from our prior forecast due to the additional actions we took in the fourth quarter that will benefit 2024. Of this $90 million 2024 spending reduction, about $60 million reduces operating expenses and $30 million reduces capital spending. These actions are improving operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. As we move into 2024, I'm energized by our commercial momentum, NPI capabilities and the benefits of the new Equifax Cloud. Turning to Slide 4, our strong fourth quarter gives us momentum as we move into the new year. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.327 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.81 per share were both at the high end of our guidance. And EBITDA margins at 33.7% were up about 60 bps sequentially. Our non-mortgage businesses, which represent about 85% of total revenue in the quarter, were very strong with 14% constant currency and 9% organic constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth, also at the high end of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework driven by strong performances at EWS and international. Total U.S. mortgage market was slightly stronger than we expected in the quarter with USIS inquiries down 17%. As mortgage rates declined during the quarter from a 23-year high of 7.9% in late October to about 6.8% late in the year, we saw some increased activity to expect we'll grow if rates continue to decline in 2024. Mortgage volumes began to strengthen slightly relative to normal seasonal levels in December, and we've continued the slight improvements during January, which is a good sign if the market has bottomed. Mortgage market outperformance of 33% for USIS and 18% for EWS last year in the quarter were strong and about as expected. We'll share further perspectives on the mortgage market when we discuss our 2024 guidance. At the BU level, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 17% and above our expectations, principally due to strength in our government and talent businesses, which drove adjusted EWS EBITDA margins sequentially to above 51%. USIS had a good quarter with revenue up 5%, slightly above our expectations, principally due to stronger mortgage revenue, which drove adjusted EBITDA margins up about 100 basis points sequentially to 35%. International delivered 22% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding the impact of the BVS acquisition. Very strong growth in Latin America and Europe were principally offset by lower-than-expected growth in Asia Pacific. International delivered very strong 31.2% adjusted EBITDA margins, up about 500 basis points sequentially and much stronger than our expectations. Before I cover our business unit results in more detail, I wanted to provide an overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and with the consumer. Broadly, outside of what appears to be a bottoming of the mortgage market, there's not a lot of change from our prior view. The U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at historic levels with low unemployment and almost 9 million open jobs, which is a positive for consumers and our customers. However, there continue to be some constraints in white collar hiring. Credit card delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market are stable and at historically low levels at less than 1%, but above pre-pandemic levels. However, subprime borrower delinquencies, which have been increasing over the past year are now above pre-pandemic levels and are approaching 2009 levels. Auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market are also stable and well below 1%, but are above pre-pandemic levels. Delinquencies for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels, as well as above the levels we saw in 2009. And any credit tiding that we've seen has been largely in fintech and subprime, which started well over a year ago. When consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current on their financial obligations, which is good for our customers and for Equifax. Turning to Slide 5, strong twin record growth and the positive impact from new products, penetration and price drove a strong 18 points of EWS mortgage outperformance in the quarter. As expected, mortgage outperformance was down sequentially from the third quarter as we lapped the 2022 launch of our Mortgage 36 trended data product. EWS had another very strong quarter of twin record additions, adding five million current records in the quarter and $16 million during 2023. EWS grew twin records 11% in the quarter to $168 million on 124 million unique individuals, which was up 9%. Total records, both current and historic are now over $655 million and were up 9%. In terms of coverage, we have current employment records on about 75% of U.S. non-farm payroll and about 60% coverage on the $220 million income-producing Americans. At 124 million active records, we have plenty of room to grow the twin database. During the quarter, we signed agreements with six new payroll processors that will deliver records in 2024. In 2023, we added partnerships with 17 payroll processors and over the past three years, have added partnerships with 33 payroll processors. During the quarter, EWS also surpassed a significant milestone with over three million companies contributing to the work number every pay period, a huge milestone as we continue to focus on expanding our twin coverage. The market continues to adopt higher-value solutions that include trended employment and income history that only Equifax can deliver. For example, in the fourth quarter, over 50% of mortgage revenue incorporated historic records. Turning to Slide 6, Workforce Solutions revenue was up a strong 10% in the quarter, which is a very positive sign as we look towards 2024. Non-mortgage revenue growth of 17% was very strong and up 600 basis points sequentially and at the highest levels that we saw in 2023. Importantly, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which represents about 75% of Verifier revenue delivered very strong 27% in the growth in the quarter and was up 16 points sequentially. In Government, we saw continued very strong growth with revenue up 47% in the quarter and over 30% for the year. Government revenue was slightly stronger than our expectations given continued CMS redeterminations, the new SNAP contract, record growth, state penetration and pricing. We expect continued growth in government throughout 2024 with stronger growth in the first half as CMS redeterminations complete prior to the second quarter. Talent Solutions revenue was up 13% in the quarter and up 700 basis points sequentially. As we discussed, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white collar workers, including technology, professional services and financial services, which has seen a greater reduction in hiring activity and broad hiring freezes and layoffs than the total labor market over the past 12 to 18 months. These markets are off to a slow start again in January, and we would expect to see slower revenue growth in the first quarter in talent than we delivered in the fourth quarter. We outperformed these underlying markets in the fourth quarter by over 25 points as we delivered new digital solutions, strong new product growth, pricing and continued expansion of Twin records. Employer Services revenue was down 7% and in line with our expectations, driven by declines in ERC revenue, which is now about $5 million per quarter as the U.S. government has suspended processing new ERC claims. ERC revenue is expected to stay at about these levels through 2024, and we'll see headwinds in our employer vertical from this ERC decline through the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the impact of the declining ERC revenue, Employer Services revenue grew during the quarter driven by growth in our I9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.2% were better than our expectations, principally due to better expected revenue performance. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their twin income and employment data, and employer services businesses would clear again in 2023. EWS is expected to deliver strong growth in 2024 and continue above market growth in the future. On Slide 7, I'd like to expand on the significant opportunities still in front of us for EWS. This slide details a big $15 billion EWS TAM versus their $2.3 billion of revenue last year. EWS has plenty of room to grow. As you can see, with the exception of housing, which includes mortgage, where our penetration is on the order of 60%, our penetration is in the range of 10% to 20% in each target market where we compete. In each of these markets, we principally compete against pay-per-pay stubs or other forms of manual verifications and we deliver instant verifications, productivity, speed and accuracy. In both mortgage, government and talent, where there's a requirement for broad coverage and depth of detail and in talent and mortgage, where there's a need for historical data, we have an opportunity to drive strong future growth from penetration in our existing verticals and leverage that penetration as we continue to expand twin record coverage towards the $220 million income-producing Americans in the United States. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue was up over 5% and above our expectations, principally due to stronger-than-expected mortgage revenue. USIS delivered non-mortgage revenue growth of about just over 3% in the quarter and slightly below our 4% growth expectation. USIS mortgage revenue was up 16% and outperformed the mortgage credit inquiries that were down 17% by 33 points. The strong pricing environment drove the very strong outperformance. At $78 million in the quarter, mortgage revenue was 18% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was down slightly less than 1% and below our expectations. We continue to see double-digit growth in commercial and single-digit growth in telco and auto with banking and lending about flat. The declines were principally due to weakness in D2C, our business where we sell data to other credit bureaus and insurance. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business was up 7% and much better than our expectations. In marketing, we saw mid-single-digit growth in the quarter led by double-digit growth in our IXI consumer wealth data business, partially offset by declines in pre-screen marketing. While pre-screen marketing revenue was down in the quarter, we did see an improvement over prior quarters with a return to growth in fintech pre-screen marketing. We continue to see declines in smaller FIs, partially offset by growth in larger FIs. Within risk and account services, we saw limited growth in our portfolio review business but not to the levels we would typically see if our customers were expecting a weakening economy. And within fraud, we saw double-digit revenue growth primarily from new business. USIS Consumer Solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 15% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 35.1% in the quarter and in line with our October guidance. Todd and the U.S. team are on offense as they complete their cloud transformation in the first half of 2024 and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capabilities to deliver new products and drive share gains. In the quarter, the USIS team signed an extension to the NCTUE cellphone and utility payment data relationship, allowing USIS to exclusively manage the database and continue bringing new products to market that expand lending to consumers, including our differentiated USIS mortgage credit file solution that incorporates NC+ cell phone and utility data that only Equifax can provide. Turning to Slide 9, International revenue was up 22% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BBS and above the 20% growth we guided to in October due to better-than-expected revenue in Latin America, slightly offset by lower Asia Pacific revenue. Europe, local currency revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter from strong double-digit growth in our UK CRE business. And as expected, a return to growth from our UK debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, was up 30% versus last year, driven by strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We continue to make good progress on the Brazil integration with strong progress in bringing new Equifax solutions such as count and mitigator to the Brazilian market as well as bringing EFX data and analytics expertise to our Brazilian customers. Our global Equifax teams are very engaged in integration activities, including moving BVS to the Equifax cloud and single data fabric. Canada delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter as expected. Canada will complete their migration to the Equifax cloud by mid-2024. And similar to USIS, we expect to see accelerated NPI growth going forward. In Asia Pacific, revenue was below our expectations with revenue down 2% and to -- due to lower market volumes in Consumer and Commercial, particularly late in November and December. We expect Asia Pacific to have declining revenue in the first half of 2024 due to the softer market conditions and the near-term impact of long-term contract extensions we signed with several large customers. We expect Asia Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second half of 2024. Despite the decline in revenue, Asia Pacific adjusted EBITDA margins were up over 200 basis points sequentially from strong cost management. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 31.2%, were up almost 500 basis points sequentially, an outstanding performance. The improvement was driven by revenue growth and good execution against our 2023 cost reduction plan by Lisa and the international team. Turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, overall non-mortgage constant dollar revenue grew a very strong 14% with organic growth of 9%, up over 250 basis points sequentially. A very good sign as we move into 2024. The acceleration in organic revenue growth was driven by very strong EWS Verifier non-mortgage revenue performance. As we look to 2024, we expect non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth to be over 10.5% with organic growth of almost 8.5%, about 150 basis points above the levels delivered last year. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to be led again by EWS, driven by strong growth in their government and talent businesses. Turning to Slide 11. We delivered strong 14% vitality, again in the quarter, led by very strong performance in EWS with a VI over 20% as well as over 15% in Latin America. Importantly, USIS accelerated in the fourth quarter to 7%, which was up over 200 basis points sequentially as we get closer to cloud completion and are able to begin to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation and new products. Our strong vitality index results are not only led by over 100 new products launched in each of the last four years, but the increasing average revenue per new product, which is up close to 50% since 2021. During the quarter, about 90% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the Equifax cloud. The positive momentum in our NPI and Vitality Index is encouraging for the future and reinforces our long-term strategy of leveraging our differentiated data assets and new cloud capabilities to drive new solutions for our customers. Leveraging our Equifax cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a vitality index of over 10% again in 2024. On the right side of the slide, we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax cloud and driving innovation that can create the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities as well as drive Equifax top line growth and margins. Turning to Slide 12, we believe Equifax AI, leveraging our differentiated data assets, our new Equifax cloud capabilities and new product focus, is positioning our industry-leading EFX AI powered model scores and products. On the left of the side of the slide, our large and diverse proprietary data sets is a significant differentiator for Equifax. Our proprietary data at scale, keyed in linked in our single data fabric leveraging our new AFX cloud gives us significant advantages in using AI to build more predictive multi-data models, scores and products. Our ESXi is enabled by our EFX developed explainable AI solutions that leverage our Ignite platform and our Google Vertex capabilities. Our modern AI and ML-enabled cloud-based model scoring engine and our over 1,000 Equifax DNA professionals. AI leveraging our patented explainable AI capabilities is a big priority for Equifax in '24 and beyond as we complete the Equifax cloud. As shown on the chart in the middle of Slide 12, we've made tremendous progress building advanced models in leveraging our market-leading AI capabilities. In 2023, 70% of our new models were built using AI and ML tools, up from 60% in '22 with a goal of over 80% this year. Our investments in AI are generating results. To date, Equifax has received over 90 approved AI patents supporting areas such as our proprietary AI NeuroDecision Technology, or NDT, an explainable AI with over 130 AI patents pending. We've launched new products developing at EFX AI, including Equifax OneScore for consumers incorporating traditional credit, alternative credit, as well as cell phone utility and pay TV data, which has improved the performance of the solution to score 20% more consumers. We are energized about the capabilities that Equifax AI is bringing to strengthen our business and accelerate the value of our proprietary data through richer data combinations. Now let's turn to 2024 guidance. Moving to Slide 13, we entered 2024 with momentum from the fourth quarter and the underlying growth of our non-mortgage businesses and the strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. The U.S. mortgage market appears to have bottomed and through January, we're seeing some slight improvements versus our expectations in both USIS and EWS, which is good news for the future. Our 2024 planning assumption is that the current level of U.S. mortgage activity will continue for the rest of the year with adjustments for seasonality. On this basis, U.S. mortgage inquiries across USIS and EWS would be down on a blended basis by 15%. We're assuming twin inquiries will see a slightly smaller decline in USIS credit inquiries as the level of consumer shopping behavior moderates. For perspective, our 2024 framework is over 30 points lower than the average current forecast from MBA, which is currently forecasting 24 origination units, up 17% versus our down 15%. And Fannie Mae, which is not forecast units, but is forecasting origination dollar volumes up 24%. MBA and Fannie Mae forecast mortgage rates move down to 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively, from 6.8% today. We will continue to forecast our mortgage market trends or current EFX run rates as we have done for the past 5-plus years. And as in the past, we do not include interest rate decreases or increases in our forecast. We will continue to share mortgage credit inquiry volume changes with you each quarter so you can make your own judgments on the mortgage market outlook for the future. Further, we are assuming that the U.S. economy will see modest deacceleration in '24 with growth slightly below the 2% average we generally assume in our long-term growth framework. In our key international countries, we expect slowing and low levels of GDP growth in Australia and in Canada, UK and Brazil, we expect about flat GDP. Despite the decline in the U.S. mortgage market and some modest economic deacceleration across our major markets, we expect to deliver 2024 revenue of about $5.72 billion at the midpoint of our guidance with reported growth at the midpoint of 8.6%. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5%, with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% and again at the center of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue growth should be about 9.5%, about 24 points better than the about 15% decline from the USIS and EWS mortgage inquiries in our framework. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10.5%, with organic growth of almost 8.5% and FX is about 190 basis points negative to our revenue growth. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of about 8% in 2024. This reflects mortgage revenue at up just under 2%, about 15 points better than underlying EWS mortgage transactions. And EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow almost 10.5%. Excluding the expected significant decline in ERC revenue as that pandemic support program completes, EWS non-mortgage revenue growth is about 12%, which is a strong performance given the expected weak hiring market in 2024 as well as the weaker overall U.S. economy. Talent in EWS is expected to grow about 7% despite a decline in our underlying markets and government is expected to deliver over 15% growth against a very strong over 30% comp last year. Twin record growth in NPI Vitality Index of over our 10% EFX goal and continued strong growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive EWS outperformance. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of almost 8% in 2024 at the high-end of their long-term growth target of 6% to 8%. Mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 20%, over 35 points stronger than the expected 16% decline in mortgage market inquiries. We are continuing to see substantial revenue benefits from both pricing increases from one of our largest USIS mortgage vendors that we pass on to customers at levels to maintain consistent margins and new product and pricing benefits by USIS. Non-mortgage revenue in USIS is expected to grow almost 4% despite modestly slower economic growth. The non-mortgage growth will be driven by continued strong commercial and identity and fraud growth as well as mid-single-digit growth in FI and auto. Consumer Services is expected to grow about 5% with financial marketing services expected to grow in the low single-digit percent. And we expect to see weaker revenue growth in D2C and telco. International had a very good 2023 with 6% organic constant dollar revenue growth but saw some weakening in end markets late in the year, particularly in Canada and Australia. We expect international constant currency growth to be over 15% in 2024 with organic constant currency growth of about 10%. The accelerating inflation we are seeing in Argentina is expected to benefit overall international revenue growth by over 5 percentage points. Although uncertain, we have assumed currency devaluation in Argentina will be more than offset by inflation in our 2024 planning. We expect our new product vitality index to be over 10% again in 2024, led by EWS in Latin America. As U.S. and IS and Canada principally complete their cloud transformation, we expect their NPI rollouts to accelerate as we exit 2024. For the full year, EBITDA is expected to be about $1.9 billion, up over 12% with adjusted EBITDA margins of about 33.3%. And adjusted EPS is expected to be about $7.35 per share, up about 9.5% from last year. Capital spending will decline by over $100 million to about $475 million or about 8.3% of revenue. The reduction reflects our progress in completing our cloud transformation and is a significant step towards our goal of 7% or below as we exit 2025. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2024 assumptions and guidance and also to provide our first quarter framework. Our 2024 guidance builds on our strong 2023 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth and pricing. John? Thanks, John. The unprecedented 50% decline in the mortgage market from normal 2015 to '19 levels had a significant impact on Equifax moving close to $1 billion of revenue over the past 24 months from our P&L. Against that unprecedented mortgage market decline, EFX's diverse mix of businesses delivered strong growth through outperforming the mortgage market by over 20 percentage points, strong 10% to 20% constant dollar non-mortgage growth, a 13% vitality index from new products and the addition of bolt-on acquisitions. As shown on Slide 19, based on our 2024 guidance, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the market bottoms and moves from a headwind to tailwind and the mortgage market recovers towards its historic norms, that represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our mortgage gross margins is over $1 billion of mortgage revenue, we delivered over $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L in '24, '25 and '26 as the market recovers. Wrapping up on Slide 20. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 14% constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. We have strong momentum as we move into 2024. As we look at 2024, we expect to deliver 9% revenue growth and 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from the revenue growth and our cost savings plans despite our expected about 15% decline in the mortgage market. As discussed on the prior slide, with the mortgage market bottoming, we expect mortgage to move from -- move to a tailwind over the next several years as the market returns to normal inquiry levels. A big priority for 2024 is to complete our North American cloud transformation as well as significant portions of our global markets, which will result in continued margin expansion and reductions in our capital intensity that is a key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. Exiting 2024 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax cloud is a big milestone, so the team can move towards fully focusing on growth. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, leveraging EFX AI and ML and market-leading businesses, will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. I'm energized by our strong performance in 2023 and the momentum as we enter 2024, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Can you ask the second question again? Well, we think the 8.5% is quite good. It's obviously inside of our 8% to 12% range, which is how we want to grow the company. We've talked about some of the pressures on our non-mortgage really in the talent market. And then second is the ERC impact, which that program has been curtailed by the IRS. And John talked about the impact that, that's having, which is on Equifax is a meaningful amount on a year-over-year basis. As far as upsides, I don't think we think about any upsides to that 8.5% because we think it's a pretty good growth rate. And that's only one lever, obviously, for government vertical growth inside of Workforce Solutions, as we've talked about. As you know, that business was up super strong last year and again in '22, ended the year at over $500 million. So a very big business for us with big growth potential at the state level of continuing penetration. We've got a TAM there that's $3 billion plus against that $500 million. So there's a lot of opportunities to get the states that are not using our solution today. They're still using manual verification of income and employment, which is required for government social services. As you recall, we -- a couple of months ago, we landed a big extension to our CMS contract. It was $1.2 billion. That rolls into 2024. And then the new USDA contract that we signed in September was a new contract that obviously rolls into 2024. So there's a meaningful number of growth levers at government, and we're quite bullish as we talked about. We expect that business to be a big growth contributor to Workforce Solutions and outgrow Workforce Solutions 13 to 15 long-term growth rate, significantly outgrow that again in \u201824. I'd start with -- and I think we tried to be clear about that. We don't see any real change as we go into 2024 from those verticals like cards, auto, p loans, how they performed in the second half of last year. We talked a little bit about fintech was impacted in the second half of '22 and into '23, but that seems to be kind of a, I would call it, a stable level now, meaning it's not declining, which is good news versus the declines that happened last year. Large FIs are fairly consistent as far as they're still originating because consumers are strong. There's some choppiness with some of the smaller FIs that might be impacted by some liquidity stuff. But again, not a real change from what we saw in the second half of last year. Yes. So I'll go near term, which is 2024, I think we laid out that CapEx is coming down again this year in 2024. We expect it to step down again next year as we complete the cloud, big cloud completion in our USIS business and some of our international properties in the first half of this year and getting to 90% cloud complete will be a big milestone. So you're going to see our CapEx come down over the short term, meaning in '24 and over the medium term in '25 again as we complete the cloud. Over that timeframe, we expect our margins to continue to expand, which will grow our free cash flow. Our free cash flow this year is up almost 2x. So our free cash flow in 2024 is up substantially. We expect that to continue to grow as we get into '25 and '26. And so as you get over the -- again, back in '24, we have a pipeline of M&A that we're watching. I suspect that given we're already in February here that, that M&A would be in the second half if we do some. We're going to be very disciplined around M&A as we always have been. And we're focused on integrating the large number of acquisitions. We've done 14 in a little over three years that we're integrating like Boa Vista, as we talked about on the call. But when you get look forward to '25 and '26, we'll continue to add bolt-on M&A inside of that 8 to 12 framework that includes 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A. So that's clearly a part of our strategy. And we've been crystal clear that as our margins expand and we still have the goal of 39%, and we still have the goal of growing 50 bps a year post 39. As we move towards that 39% and our CapEx comes down, we would expect to have significant excess free cash flow when you get into '25 and '26, where we could look at restarting the dividend and also look at buying back meaningful amounts of our stock, and that's no change in that. We've been very clear in that over the last really three years that that's the goal we've been working towards as we complete the cloud. Yes. And it's really around the government social services delivery, which is huge. There's 90 million Americans roughly that get some form of government social services, whether it's food support, rent support, cash support, childcare support, student lending support, all those different programs, unemployment support. All of those programs have to be verified by income and you have to verify employment and there's also an incarceration check on many of them, which is from our APRs data set. We've been growing rapidly there because of the real desire to deliver those social services quickly to those that deserve them and need them. And our instant data really delivers that. And we're competing, as you know, against manual processes and paper paste dogs, which means the recipient who's after the social services generally has to bring in proof of income. We can deliver it instantly. And of course, where our data is accurate, it's one to two weeks old depending upon the time frame because we're getting payroll every two weeks and we have such broad coverage. So our programs are really at kind of three levels at the federal, state and local level. We have federal programs where some of that verification is done at the federal level like with Social Security Administration. That's a large contract for us. We talked earlier in this call about the CMS contract that we extended. It's done at the federal, but then executed at the state level and the new USDA contract. And then we operate at the very state level and the state levels are more complex. There's a large, large penetration opportunity at the states. That's really where a big portion of our growth will come and a big portion of that TAM that you referenced is all the states -- all 50 states are not with Equifax, and it's really at the agency level, each state has separate agencies that deliver these services, and that's who our customers are. I think as you know, we've added resources over the last number of years at the state capital levels to work on deploying these resources. So we have a large pipeline. As you might imagine, we're focused on the large states: California, Texas, New York, Florida and some of the big, big states that are out there, but we have a focus on all of them. And as you go forward over the next '24, into '25, '26, that will be a big part of the growth is our penetration into the states to deliver these services. And it's a very strong value prop. In many cases, the data costs are subsidized by the federal government just as the social services are. So it's matter of getting the technology aligned with ours and helping change the process flow at each of those different agencies in all 50 states in order to deliver those. So we're very bullish about that business. As we said, it's close to $0.5 billion at the end of last year, and we expect strong double-digit growth again in 2024. Yes. I think as you know, there's two pieces to that potential change by the regulator that is still in a comment period. One is to add Vantage to every federally supported mortgage. That's going to be a good guide for Equifax when it happens going forward. And then second is the 3B requirement going to 2B. We've talked before that we expect on the second half of that mortgage originators to continue to pull the three credit files because there are meaningful differences between the three credit bureaus, three credit files. For example, there's 8.5 million consumers that are only in one of the three credit files in the United States. So the value of three is quite important. On the Vantage plus FICO, same thing. It's still in a comment period. We haven't put either of those into our framework for 2024 because we're not sure they're going to happen or what the impact would be. But you point out that if it's a mandatory to have a FICO and Vantage score, that's a positive for our business to sell a second score in every mortgage. And no, we haven't thought about pricing on it because we really -- it's unclear if it's going to happen or when it will happen, if it does. Regardless, incremental mortgage margins are super attractive. And we tried to be clear in including that our view of what normal mortgage volumes are in the 2015 to '19 range versus where we are today at 50% below that. There's a lot of upsides in '24, '25, '26, and we try to frame that in talking about the $1 billion of revenue potential in the future. On the second half of your -- or first half of your question about inquiries. The USIS inquiries because of shopping are different than the EWS inquiries, which generally are more involved in closed loans, meaning on the shopping side, someone will do shopping on two or three different mortgage originators, but close with only one. So that's the difference. And last year, we opted to try to disclose that data. You referenced market volume data that's out there. There really isn't any market volume data out there, except on a very long lag basis. There are forecasts which you can describe as data, I would call those forecasts and that data. And we talked about what MBA is forecasting and some of the others and some of the Street is forecasting improvements later in the year based on rate cuts that haven't happened yet for mortgage volume. We've been very clear, and we've been doing it since I've been here that we forecast mortgage volumes on the way up. We did it on the way down, and we're doing it currently based on our current trends. And as it changes, we'll share it with you. We tried to frame the positive potential impact on us on the top line as well as the bottom line as mortgage returns to normal. And again, we think over time, whether it's \u201824, \u201825, '26, mortgage volumes will return to normal. It's just uncertain when the Fed is going to make those rate changes and we'll be transparent on what our activity is because we see activity every day. And that's what we talk about when we talk about trends. We have -- we know what the inquiries are we got yesterday, and we know what they were last week and the week before, and we used those to really forecast what we think they're going to be going forward. It's actually, it's a little bit different. Originations, we don't get actual originations and the industry doesn't for until six months after they happen, somewhere in that time frame. It's a complex process for mortgages to close and then those mortgages to be posted in essence, on the credit file is when we see it. So the -- any mortgage origination data is actually on a lag basis. Obviously, there are forecasts that lots of people put together, but those are forecasts and not actual data. You can't determine what -- how many originations happened yesterday, that's just not available. Inquiries, yes, and we're super transparent with you about inquiries that we see on a current basis. I think we did highlight that we saw some -- we used the term slight because they are slight improvements in, call it, the net last almost 60 days, which we view as a positive, which is why we're -- it feels like we're at a bottom in the mortgage market, which I think is a positive for Equifax. And when you look at Equifax at -- and again, we're calling a mark-to-market that's down. But meaning said differently, in a flat mortgage market, we grow our revenue because of our outperformance in both businesses through price product, more records in EWS and penetration in EWS. I think the 15, John, is kind of in the same ZIP code even with those slight improvements. But we'll continue to be transparent as we look forward. And we know you and many others on the call, are looking for an improvement in inquiries. We are, too. When it happens, we'll share it with you, and I think that's going to be a real positive for Equifax going forward. But we want to be consistent in how we forecasted for as long as I've been here around -- off of current trends because, look, we're not economists, we can't forecast where rates are going. None of us forecasted the rates last year and the increases. And as recently as this past weekend, I think the Fed kind of pushed out the potential rate decreases that many were expecting in March out to later in the year. So we think it's prudent to have a balanced forecast that's consistent with how we've done it historically. Yes, they're a little bit better than how we thought they would be when we gave guidance in October. That started in December, I said we called it slight improvements. But that's factored into the guidance we've shared with you this morning. So we've included that in the down 15%, and we'll continue to watch that closely. And watch it going forward. And obviously, we all know if, in fact, the Fed is going to take rates down. That's good news for our mortgage business in the future, which is why we tried to frame that $1 billion of potential revenue in the future as mortgage volumes return to more normal levels, and we expect them to return to normal levels. At these high rates, people are sitting on homes that they want to upgrade and move to that 4-bedroom home versus a three and they're waiting for rates to come down. Now what's that inflection point? We'll see. But the positive from our eyes is that it feels like the market has bottomed and with the Fed's managing inflation and indicating rate cuts in the future, that's going to be a good guide for Equifax and a tailwind going forward. The question is when? On some new products that Equifax rolled out."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Trevor, please go ahead.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website investor.equifax.com. During the call today we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 3Q 2023 earnings conference call. Also, we\u2019ll be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full-year 2023 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk Factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  We will also be referring certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. Recently Equifax reached an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority in relation to the 2017 cyber security incident. In connection with the agreement Equifax taken the charge in the third quarter of $14 million which is excluded from third quarter adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included in our earnings release and can be found in our financial results section of the financial info tab at our IR website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Trevor and good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we continue to face a very challenging U.S. mortgage market that weakened substantially in August and September beyond our July framework with mortgage rates moving above 7% and now approaching almost 8% over a 20 year high. Revenue in the third quarter was 1.32 billion, was up 6% on a reported basis, 6.5% on a constant currency basis, and 3.5% on an organic, constant currency basis. An adjusted EPS of $1.76 per share was up 2% versus last year. In the quarter BVS, the Brazilian credit bureau that we acquired in August had revenue of 23 million and contributed $0.02 per share to adjusted EPS, which was not in our July framework for the third quarter.  Overall, Equifax revenue of 1.32 billion was $34 million below the midpoint of the guidance we provide in July, which excluded Brazil, driven primarily by the weaker U.S. mortgage market and FX. Together, these items impacted revenue by about $28 million and adjusted EPS by about $0.10 per share. Adjusting for the mortgage markets and FX impact, revenue in the third quarter would have been just below the midpoint of our July framework, and both adjusted EPS and EBITDA margins would have exceeded the framework we provided in July.  Overall mortgage market volumes, measured based on our credit and TWN inquiry volumes, we are on the order of 650 basis points weaker than we expected in our July guidance. Mortgage rates increased substantially during the quarter, with a 100 basis point increase in the ten-year Treasury rate, driving mortgage rates to almost 7.5% in September. The mortgage volume decline negatively impacted mortgage revenue by about 22 million, and the strengthening dollar negatively impacted revenue versus our July expectations by about $6 million. The U.S. mortgage revenue from EWS and USIS was down about 8%, reflecting the significantly weaker mortgage market conditions. Mortgage outperformance relative to the mortgage industry volumes I referenced remains strong in both USIS at over 30% and EWS at 22%.  Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter and was up 8% excluding revenue from BVS, against a strong 20% growth last year. Non-mortgage constant dollar organic growth was up 7% versus last year with our non-mortgage growth rate strengthening 300 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Non-mortgage growth was led by EWS that was up over 11% and up 800 basis points sequentially. And USIS that was up almost 8.5% and up 50 bps sequentially. International organic non-mortgage revenue growth at 3% was slightly weaker than our expectations, principally due to lower revenue in our UK debt management business.  We had another very strong quarter in new product growth with a record 15% vitality index, which is well above our 10% long-term growth framework for NPIs. As I referenced earlier, despite the much lower than expected mortgage revenue in the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.76 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 33.1%. Excluding BVS we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.74 and adjusted EBITDA margins of 33.3%, up 60 bps sequentially, both in line with the guidance we provided in July, while absorbing the significant impact of the $22 million of lower mortgage revenue. The impact of lower mortgage revenue and FX negatively impacted adjusted EPS by about $0.10 per share. We delivered very good execution against our $210 million cloud and broader spending reduction programs, which allowed us to grow margins sequentially in the quarter despite the lower mortgage revenue. We continue to expect to deliver spending reductions of $210 million in 2023, with 120 million benefiting operating expenses and over 65 million of incremental run rate savings in 2024.  We also continue to make good progress on completing our cloud transformation with large North American customers migrating to the cloud during the quarter. We expect both USIS and Canada to complete their credit exchange cloud migrations in the first half of 2024. At the end of the quarter, about 75% of North American revenue was being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. We are convinced that our Equifax Cloud single data fabric and AI capabilities will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax in the future.  As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of 1.317 billion, adjusted EPS of $1.77, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 34% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. This includes about 38 million of revenue from BVS, which adds about 3% to our revenue growth. We expect fourth quarter revenue will be up 10% with organic constant dollar growth of 7%, adjusted EPS to be up over 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins will expand about 300 basis points versus last year. Non-mortgage constant dollar growth is expected to be strong at about 13%, with organic growth of about 9% led by EWS which should deliver over 15% non-mortgage growth. However, excluding BVS, this framework is about $70 million below the implied fourth quarter revenue guidance of $1.35 billion at the midpoint we provided in July. The sharp decline in the mortgage market and FX drive the majority or about $60 million of this decline.  Our guidance assumes that substantially weakening trends in the U.S. mortgage market that we're currently seeing continue through the remainder of the year, and that we also see normal seasonal mortgage declines in November and December. On this basis, we're assuming U.S. mortgage credit inquiries will be down about 22% in the fourth quarter, driving a reduction in overall mortgage volumes of about 18 percentage points versus the guidance implied for the fourth quarter in our July framework. This negatively impacts mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter by about $47 million. At these levels, U.S. mortgage activity will be down an unprecedented more than 50% from 2015 to 29 averages, which we consider to be normal mortgage market levels.  We expect FX to negatively impact revenue in the fourth quarter versus our July guidance by $13 million. The net impact of the $70 million reduction in revenue is driving the reduction in EPS and EBITDA margin from our original fourth quarter goals of $2 a share and 36%, respectively. The second half of 2023 has clearly been very challenging as the accelerated decline in the U.S. mortgage market in August and September, as well as FX negatively impacted revenue by almost $90 million. Like many, we are struggling to forecast the bottom of the mortgage market in this unprecedented environment of fed rate increases, driving mortgage rates up over 2X to 20 year highs in such a short 20-month time frame.  Outside the unprecedented mortgage market decline, we are executing extremely well. As I'll cover in the remainder of my remarks, we are delivering accelerated non mortgage growth, executing on our cloud customer migrations and overall cost plans, outperforming our expectations for new products. and adding new EWS record partnerships and records at an accelerated pace adding over 25 million records since the beginning of last year. In both our mortgage and non-mortgage businesses, we are continuing to outgrow our underlying markets.  Before I cover our business unit results in more detail, I wanted to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and consumer. Outside of the challenging U.S. mortgage market, the U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at record historic levels with low unemployment and about 10 million open jobs against about 5 million people who are looking for jobs. Excess consumer savings built up during the pandemic still exist, however, have declined to the lowest levels since the second quarter of 2020, particularly amongst lower and middle income households. Credit card utilization is increasing, credit card delinquency rates for prime consumers which represent about 20% of the market are stable but are above pre-pandemic levels in less than 1%. However, subprime borrower delinquencies which have been increasing over the past year are now above pre-pandemic levels and approaching the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010.  Auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 20% of the market, are also stable but above pre-pandemic levels and still well below 1%. Delinquencies for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels as well above levels that we saw in 2009 and 2010. And any customer credit tightening has largely been in fintech and subprime, which started over a year ago. Overall, still a solid market for Equifax outside of mortgage and hiring. When consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current on their financial obligations.  Turning to Slide 5, overall workforce solutions revenue was up 3% in the quarter, a return to growth, which is a very positive sign as we look towards 2024. Strong TWN record growth, the positive impact of 2023 price actions, and strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of mortgage trended data drove a strong 22 points of mortgage outperformance again in the quarter. EWS had another very strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 2 million current records added to the TWN database. EWS closed the third quarter with 163 million current records on 121 million unique individuals or SSNs, which was up 12% and 9% respectively versus last year. Total records, both current and historic are now over 640 million and we now have current records on over 70% of U.S. non-farm payroll and over 50% of the 220 million people in the U.S. with employment and income records relevant to the TWN database. The EWS team has acquired over 11 million records so far in 2023 that are driving top line growth and will significantly benefit Verifier Revenue Growth when the U.S. mortgage and white-collar hiring markets recover.  During the quarter, we signed agreements with four new payroll processors that will deliver records in the fourth quarter in 2024 and over the past three years, we've added partnerships with 27 payroll processors. As a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers from our employer services customer relationships. The remaining 50% are contributed through partnerships with payroll processors, HR software companies, pension administrators, and other relationships. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporating both current and historical records with about 50% of our third quarter verification services revenue, as well as about 50% of our mortgage verification services revenue coming from products that include historical records.  Turning to Slide 6, Workforce Solutions delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth of 11%, a return to double-digit revenue growth with a growth rate up about 800 basis points sequentially. And as a reminder, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 40% in the third quarter last year, which of course, was a very tough comp. Verification services non-mortgage revenue, which represents just under 70% of Verifier Revenue, delivered 11% growth versus last year in the quarter. This was also against a very challenging 72% non-mortgage growth comp last year. In government, we saw a continued very strong growth with revenue up 23% compared to over 90% revenue growth last year in the third quarter. Government revenue was slightly lower than our expectations due to timing of Medicaid redetermination volumes. We continue to expect that EWS will capture significant volume from these redeterminations as they complete prior to the end of the second quarter of next year.  During the quarter, we signed a contract extension to provide income verification to the U.S. centers for Medicare and Medicaid services as a part of a contract valued at up to $1.2 billion over the next five years. This contract is the largest in Equifax's history and extends our services via healthcare.gov for ACA related determinations while allowing workforce solutions to continue to work to penetrate the state level Medicaid verification services market. Also during the quarter, USDA's Food and Nutrition Service awarded a national contract to Equifax Workforce Solutions to provide verification services in support of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. The award is for $38 million in the base year, which we began on September 30th with a potential total contract value of $190 million. These large new EWS government contracts reflect the uniqueness of the TWN data supporting the delivery of social services at the U.S. federal, state, and local level.  These new contracts give us confidence in strong future EWS growth in the large 4 billion TAM for our government vertical. We expect to see accelerating sequential growth in our government vertical in the fourth quarter, driven by growth from CMS Medicaid Redeterminations, ACA open enrollment volume, further state government penetration, and pricing from state contract renewals, as well as revenue from the new SNAP agreement with the USDA.  Talent Solutions was up 6% in the quarter versus a very strong over 110% growth last year in the third quarter from record levels of U.S. hiring. As a reminder, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white-collar workers, including technology, professional services, healthcare, and financial services, which has seen a greater reduction in hiring activity and broader hiring freezes and about 10% decline that the BLS reported in the third quarter through August. We outperformed the hiring market by about 20 percentage points in the quarter as we delivered new digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and pricing. Employer services revenue of 118 million was up 13%, driven by growth in our I9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring, as well as growth in our ACA business. In the fourth quarter, we expect overall employer services revenue to decline slightly as growth in I9 and onboarding is offset by declines in ERC revenue as the U.S. government has suspended processing new ERC claims.  Earlier this year, we announced the launch of PeopleHQ, a workforce solutions cloud native solution that brings together multiple best in class employer compliance services and a single unified customer experience. PeopleHQ will help companies of all sizes access EWS employer services, including income verification, I9, and ACA from our new self-service portal. Since the launch of PeopleHQ in the first quarter, EWS has onboarded about 45,000 companies, which also delivers new records for TWN. Workforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.9% was up 140 basis points versus last year, but down 60 basis points from the second quarter from the mortgage market decline. The EWS team continue to perform very well despite the macro headwinds from mortgage and U.S. hiring, outperforming their underlying markets from strong TWN record growth, penetration, new products, and price. As shown on Slide 7, USIS revenue of 426 million was up over 7% and down slightly from our expectations due to the impact of the much weaker mortgage market. USIS delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth of about 8% in the quarter. USIS mortgage revenue was up 4% and outperformed the mortgage credit inquiries that were down 29% by 33 points. The strong pricing environment that we discussed in July drove very strong outperformance. At 101 million, mortgage revenue was 24% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up a very strong 10% total and up 5% organically. During the quarter, online revenue had strong double-digit growth in commercial and banking and lending from strong identity and fraud revenue and mid-single-digit growth in auto and insurance, offset by declines in telco and direct-to-consumer. USIS also saw a strong double-digit growth in count from very good new business and NPI performance.  Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business had revenue of 51 million that was down just under 1%. In marketing, declines in pre-screen marketing revenue in the quarter that were consistent with declines in the first half, more than offset nice revenue growth from our IXI consumer wealth data business. In pre-screen, we continue to see weakness with the smaller FIs and Fintechs in the subprime space, offset by growth with larger FIs. Within risk and account reviews, we did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but we have not seen a meaningful increase in risk-based portfolio reviews that are typical during challenging economic periods.  USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter with revenue of $56 million of 12% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and our indirect channels. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.2% in the quarter and slightly below the 35% we had guided from the impact of weaker mortgage market as well as higher technology spend as we migrate customers to the new cloud data fabric. Todd and USIS team are on offense as they work to complete their cloud transformation and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capability to deliver new products and drive share gains. In the third quarter, USIS onboarded a new large FI customer to our new cloud platform, which you expect to deliver share gains moving forward.  Turning to Slide 8, international revenue was 316 million, up 12% in constant currency and up 3% in organic constant currency, and below the 4.5% growth we had guided to in July due to the greater decline in our European debt collection revenue than we expected. Europe local currency revenue was down 2% in the quarter. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was up a very strong 8% in the quarter, a very good performance offset by the weaker than expected 17% decline in our UK debt management business. We expect Europe to deliver almost 10% growth in the fourth quarter from continued strength in the CRA business and a return to growth in our debt management business as we lacked difficult comps from last year. Latin America, local currency revenue, including Brazil, was up a very strong 21% comping off a very strong 34% growth in the third quarter of last year driven by double digit growth in Argentina and Paraguay and from new product introductions and pricing actions. We expect LATAM to deliver strong double digit revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. Canada and Asia Pacific both delivered low single digit growth in the quarter as we expected. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.3% were up 210 basis points sequentially. Excluding Brazil adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.8% were up 260 basis points and in line with our expectations. The improvement was driven by revenue growth and good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans by Lisa and our international team.  Turning to Slide 9, in the third quarter overall non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth grew a strong 11% with organic growth of 7%, both inside our long-term framework. Positively, this was up 300 basis points sequentially. The acceleration in organic revenue growth was driven by strong 11% EWS non-mortgage growth and improvement of about 800 basis points sequentially. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect non-mortgage revenue growth to be about 13% with organic growth of about 9% above the levels we delivered in the third quarter. The acceleration organic growth is expected to be led again by EWS with growth of over 15% driven by their government and talent businesses.  Turning to Slide 10, new product introductions leveraging our differentiated data and new AFX cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. In the quarter, we delivered a record 15% vitality again led by very strong performances in EWS and Latin America. EWS non-mortgage VI in the quarter was over 25%, a very strong performance. And in the third quarter, about 85% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the EFX Cloud. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver vitality index of approximately 14% in 2023, which is about 400 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality index goal. Importantly second half USIS VI is expected to be up about a 100 bps higher than first half as we are closer to cloud completion and able to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure in USIS for innovation and new products. This is broadly positive momentum for 2024. On the right side of this slide we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud and AI in driving innovation that increase -- that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial products while driving Equifax's top line. Turning to Slide 11, we're very excited to have closed the Boa Vista AC acquisition in early August and welcome the Boa Vista team to Equifax. We're focused on driving growth in Brazil and expanding BVS's capabilities by deploying our cloud-based decisioning and analytical products, as well as expanding in new verticals like identity and fraud. In the third quarter for the period after our acquisition closed on August 7th, EFX Brazil delivered revenue of $23 million and was accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.02 per share. Going forward, Brazil will be included in our Latin American region for reporting, and as a reminder, we expect Brazil to deliver approximately 160 million in run rate revenue to Equifax to be accretive to adjusted EPS in its first year. And now I'd like to turn over to John to provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year guidance. John.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 12, as Mark mentioned, third quarter mortgage market credit inquiries were down about 29% weaker than the down 23% in our July guidance and EWS mortgage outperformance was about 22% from records and price product and mix, and consistent with the second quarter. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming the weakening trend in mortgage market volume estimated based on the change in our credit inquiries we have seen in October continues as well as further normal seasonal declines in November and December. On this basis, we expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 22% in the fourth quarter, which is an 18 percentage point reduction from our July framework for the fourth quarter. For perspective, to the extent the mortgage market continues at the levels we've assumed for 4Q 2023, which is more than 50% below pre-pandemic averages, 2024 mortgage market credit inquiry volumes would be down approaching 15% versus 2023. Slide 13 provides the details of our guidance for 4Q 2023. In 4Q 2023, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.307 billion and $1.327 billion with revenue up 10% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to 13%. Mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be below 15% of Equifax revenue. Business unit performance in the fourth quarter is expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 8%, which is lower than the implied fourth quarter framework we outlined in July. The bulk of the $47 million mortgage market impact on revenue that Mark referenced impacts EWS. As we discussed in July USIS benefits from greater mortgage revenue in the early application phases, which should continue into the fourth quarter.  EWS non-mortgage revenue will return to strong over 15% growth year-to-year in the fourth quarter. However, this strong growth is below our framework from July. Government growth should be above the 23% we saw in the third quarter, but is below our framework from July as state benefit redeterminations are occurring at a slower pace than we anticipated. Talent growth should be above the 6% we saw this quarter as well, but will also be below our July framework as overall hiring has decelerated from the levels we were seeing in July with BLS now down 10% with white collar verticals down significantly more. And employer services revenue will be below our 4Q framework from July for both I9 and onboarding that should continue to deliver year-to-year growth but at levels below our July framework from weaker overall hiring and ERC with the IRS announcement that they would pause on new ERC claims. Adjusted EBITDA margins for EWS are expected to be about 50.5%.  USIS revenue is expected to be up about 4% year-to-year despite the increased mortgage headwind. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of 4% should be down from the about 8.5% growth we saw this quarter as we lap 4Q 2022 pricing actions. This is somewhat stronger than we expected in our July framework driven by continued good growth in commercial, consumer solutions, auto, and across our account IB [ph] products. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 35%, up sequentially, principally due to revenue growth and cost actions. International revenue is expected to be up about 20% in constant currency due to the addition of BVS and as we lap headwinds in our UK debt management business. Revenue is expected to be up about 6.5% in organic constant currency, this is somewhat stronger than our July framework. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 30%, reflecting revenue growth and strong cost management, including the benefit of planned cost reduction actions. We expect Brazil to deliver revenue of about $38 million in the fourth quarter. Equifax 4Q 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34% at the midpoint of our guidance, an increase sequentially of almost 100 basis points. And adjusted EPS in 4Q 2023 is expected to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share, up 17% versus 4Q 2022 at the midpoint. Both adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin are below the $2 per share and 36% targets that we set as goals as we entered 2023, principally due to the assumed further decline in mortgage market volumes and associated reduction of high-margin mortgage revenue that Mark discussed. Slide 14 provides the specifics of our 2023 full year guidance. 2023 revenue and adjusted EPS are being reduced consistent with our 3Q 2023 results and our 4Q 2023 guidance. We expect 2023 non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth to be strong at about 9% and organic revenue growth of about 7%. Total capital spending for 2023, including the addition of Brazil, which was not previously included in our guidance, is expected to be about $580 million. Capital spending in the third quarter was about $145 million. We did see the expected decline in spending sequentially, however, the reduction was slightly less than the expected, principally due to higher spending related to customer migrations. We expect capital spending in the fourth quarter to decline sequentially by about $15 million as we continue to progress U.S. and Canadian migrations to Data Fabric. We remain focused on reducing CAPEX as a percentage of revenue to about 7% by the end of 2025.  We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50-plus basis points of margin expansion annually on average over a cycle. Although the unprecedented decline in the U.S. mortgage market in 2022 and 2023, pushes out our prior midterm goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins to beyond 2025, it does not change our focus on expanding our margins toward our 39% goal as we drive revenue higher. We will continue to focus on delivering strong non-mortgage growth at or above our long-term revenue growth framework, outperforming our underlying markets, including the mortgage market, and executing our cloud transformation, including delivering ongoing cost improvements. As mentioned earlier, to the extent the mortgage market continues at the levels we have assumed for 4Q 2023, 2024 mortgage market inquiry volumes would be down approaching 15% versus 2023. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Wrapping up, Equifax delivered on its earnings guidance in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS within our guidance range despite the challenging U.S. mortgage market. While the mortgage market was down significantly again, our non-mortgage businesses delivered strong constant dollar organic growth of 7% and overall growth of 11%, including BVS. Importantly, EWS returned a strong 11% non-mortgage growth and USIS delivered a strong over 8% non-mortgage quarter. We expect our strong third quarter constant dollar non-mortgage revenue of 11% to accelerate in the fourth quarter to about 13%, including EWS, above 15% and international, including BVS at about 20%. The breadth and depth of our non-mortgage businesses, which account for about 81% of Equifax revenue in the third quarter and execution against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction program, allowed us to deliver against our earnings guidance despite the decline in the mortgage market. While it's early to provide 2024 guidance, I wanted to give you a perspective on how we plan to operate in 2024 in what could be another challenging year from a macro perspective as we exit 2023 with U.S. mortgage volumes at historically low levels with record mortgage rates. We remain committed to executing against our EFX 2025 strategy with a focus on things we can control. As we move towards 2024, we're focused on: first, continuing above-market non-mortgage growth inside our 8% to 12% long-term framework and outperforming the underlying mortgage market. Second, substantially completing our cloud transformation in 2024 with revenue from our new cloud platforms approaching 90% by the end of the year, which will be a big milestone to allow our team to pivot to fully focus on innovation and growth. Third, as we complete our cloud investments, we expect CAPEX to move towards our long-term goal of 7% of revenue in 2025 and our CAPEX spend to pivot from maintenance and cloud investments to innovation and new products.  Aligned with our cloud technology completion, we will continue to execute against the cloud and broader spending reduction program we announced in February, which we expect to deliver $65 million of 2023 carryover next year with additional cost savings next year as we complete the cloud. Our 14% vitality performance in the second half of this year gives us strong momentum as we move towards 2024. We will continue our focus on new product innovation using our single data fabric, cloud capabilities, and AI to bring new models and scores to the market, including a focus on bringing EWS and USIS assets much closer together with a long-term annual vitality goal of 10%. We'll focus on adding new ERB records to further strengthen the TWN data set, including the acquisition of traditional W-2 pension and 1099 records.  And last, we'll continue to look for financially attractive bolt-on M&A aligned with our strategic priorities around differentiated data, strengthening EWS, and identity and fraud. Despite the challenges of an unprecedented decline in the U.S. mortgage market, Equifax demonstrated in 2022 and 2023 that we can grow revenue as we outperform our underlying markets over the last two years from above-market non-mortgage growth, outperforming the mortgage market, vertical penetration, new product innovation, adding new records to TWN, and pricing. We are committed to delivering on our long-term framework of 8% to 12% revenue growth and 50 basis points of annual margin expansion as well as our medium-term goal of 39% EBITDA margins. And when the mortgage market recovers, we are poised to generate accelerated above-market growth and margin expansion from investments we have made in our cloud technology, new products, TWN record additions, and expanding our unique data assets. During the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. \nManav Patnaik: Thank you and good morning. Mark, I just had a question, I think the negative 15%, I guess potential decline in mortgage increase next year based on I guess, your current run rate, seasonality, etcetera. If that is the case, you've obviously been outperforming the market consistently this year, but are there other initiatives you can put in place to potentially outperform further, or just curious on what the strategy in a longer -- weaker for longer, I guess, mortgage market would be?\nMark Begor: Yes, Manav, we believe that we have multiple levers in both mortgage and non-mortgage. I'll focus on mortgage because that's your question, to continue to outperform the underlying market. And you've seen us do that over an extended period of time. And we'll talk about USIS and EWS, if you want, because that's a mortgage. In USIS, they obviously have the ability to deliver price, and we expect price to be a part of the levers for 2024. There's new product rollouts inside of USIS. For example, if you recall earlier this year, we rolled out our new mortgage credit report that includes those NC+ attributes. That's going to be a positive for us to outperform the underlying market. And then if you go to EWS, you've got the same two levers there plus more, obviously. Price is an opportunity as we have more records, and we can deliver more value to the mortgage customers. We've got a big focus in more leverage in EWS around new products. You've seen us roll out new solutions like a year ago, mortgage 36 with 36 months' worth of history. So new products will be a continued lever for us in the mortgage space. And of course, records growing records double digit in the quarter, the new payroll processors that we're adding in the fourth quarter and next year that we signed up during the quarter, and of course, our pipeline of new records those drive higher hit rates in the EWS mortgage business, which we expect that to continue going forward. And then the last for EWS quite uniquely, is ability to drive penetration, meaning more usage of the income and employment data inside the mortgage process. And as we've talked before, we don't have -- every customer doesn't use our solutions. Some still use manual verifications and we're driving them to using our verified solution. So yes, we've got confidence about our ability. I wouldn't characterize that we have new levers, but we've got a lot of focus around them. And I think -- when you think about EWS and USIS, and we mentioned it earlier in our prepared comments, as USIS completes the cloud, and of course, EWS is already there, we think the ability to have each business bring new products to market will continue, but the ability to bring solutions that combine the two businesses, data assets for mortgage and non-mortgage with USIS getting into the cloud is another year for us in the future.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then just on the margin front, the 34% for the fourth quarter, is that a right run rate to think about as you exit the year, I know you have a lot of, obviously, mortgage headwinds and then cost savings coming in to offset that. And if you could just remind us versus the 39% target that you had, how much of that is going to be a mortgage shortfall in terms of getting to that 39%?\nMark Begor: I think first on the 39, we tried to be clear, our goal hasn't changed. As you know, for a couple of years, we carried a goal of 2025 for 39% against $7 billion of revenue. Clearly, that $7 billion is going to be pushed out with the mortgage market decline and we wanted to be transparent today that we view that as being post-2025. But our focus on 39% hasn't changed. We have a path to 39%. In the future, it's going to be beyond 2025 and then post 39%, we still see between operating leverage in the businesses, the strong margins in EWS, the ability to grow 50 basis points per year post that 39%.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: And as you're specifically looking at 2024, right, we've already talked about the fact that we have significant cost reduction plans we put in place in 2023. They'll drive an additional $65 million of savings as we get into next year. We also look at some savings as we continue to migrate to the cloud, which weren't included in that $65 million. So we expect to have cost levers that will help drive our margins higher. Obviously, we're not giving revenue guidance but again, for us, for 2024 but for us, as you know, our variable margin on new revenue is very high, right. So as we drive more revenue, that also is a way that we drive margins as we go forward. So just as a reminder, those people think about next year, first quarter margins for us tend to be lower, right, because a significant amount of equity and variable compensation expense hits in the first quarter as opposed to being spread throughout the year because of the structure of our plan. So just as a reminder, first quarter margins tend to move down.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, two quickies. Well, actually, we'll see if it is quick. The first one is, for third quarter, what was mortgage as a percentage of total revenues? And then the second question has to do with, could you just review with us the cadence of Equifax government revenues from the Medicaid redetermination fourth quarter to second quarter. I'm also assuming that it might be higher in total now because you talked about additional state penetration?\nMark Begor: I think the first question, John, it was 19%.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: 19%, yes.\nMark Begor: In the third quarter, that will be lower in the fourth quarter for obvious reasons on the percent of revenue, Andrew from mortgage. On the government one, maybe just a couple of comments on government, and I'll get to redeterminations and John can jump in. We've got a lot of positive levers in government. I hope you saw Andrew had noted that those two large contracts, which we alluded to in July, meaning that we talked about some visibility that we had of new contracts, $1.2 billion and $190 million USDA contracts give us some visibility and momentum in our government vertical, not only in the fourth quarter but also for 2024. Those contracts as well as others also give us the ability to continue our expansion at the state level. As you know, our government vertical inside of EWS is call it roughly $500 million run rate business, but in a $4 billion TAM. So there's a lot of opportunity to add new states and new agencies at the state levels and you might imagine we have a deal pipeline of customers or agencies that we're working on adding at the state level, which is a part of our visibility for fourth quarter and into 2024 for the government vertical. And in particular, the CMS contract is -- and the USDA contract actually are both helpful in the addition of more state-level relationships.  On redeterminations, it's clearly been a very challenging forecasting about when will states actually activate those redeterminations. We saw a strong volume of that in the third quarter. We expect that to continue in the fourth. And then as you point out, in first and second next year, there'll be continued redeterminations because of the time line is to really complete those, I believe, at the end of the second quarter. So we work closely on those, but it has been a bit more challenging to forecast those. Anything you add, John?\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Just in terms of pacing, you covered it, right? It's just it's very difficult to forecast, right? So although we did see lift from redeterminations, it wasn't to the level we expected, and we certainly saw that to a degree in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But we still think we're the best solution and expect to get the revenue related to redeterminations, as Mark said, by the time it completes at the end of the second quarter. But as we said, in the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter, a little lower growth than the level we'd expected.\nAndrew Steinerman: Perfect, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nKelsey Zhu: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I think on the talent vertical, you talked about 20 percentage point outperformance if I heard that correctly. I was wondering, between the different factors that was driving that 20 percentage outperformance what is the biggest factor and how durable is this 20 percentage point outperformance over the next few quarters?\nMark Begor: Yes, the 20% we were pleased with the market -- the business is up 6%, the talent vertical and from our measure, the BLS market was down 10%. We think the white collar market was down double that. So that's how you get close to double that. So that's how you get to the 20 points of outperformance. And there isn't really -- I wouldn't characterize a single lever that's really driving that outperformance. It's really similar in all our businesses. In talent, we've got the ability to drive price, which we do every year. We expect to do that as we go into 2024 in the talent vertical like our others because of the value we're delivering. In talent, quite uniquely, we have the ability to drive penetration. That's a big multibillion dollar TAM in a business that's roughly $400 million at run rate. So there's a lot of customers in talent that are still doing manual verifications of employment history that our 640 million jobs that we have in our database are just immensely valuable from a speed and productivity standpoint. So that's a lever in talent that we think is quite durable along with price.  Product is another big one. You've seen us roll out almost every quarter, a couple of new products from EWS and the talent vertical really to get more narrowly focused around products that match kind of job categories. We rolled out an hourly solution, I think, last quarter for hourly workers to try to drive some growth there. So new products are clearly a growth. And then the addition of records. And as you know, with the 50 attributes we get every pay period, we get job title and 75 million people a year or roughly that number change jobs in the United States. So having those new jobs from our record additions every pay period is a very valuable asset that just drives higher hit rates, which drives revenue going forward. So we have a lot of confidence in our ability to outperform the underlying talent market, just like we do with the rest of our markets because of those levers.\nKelsey Zhu: Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks so much. My second question is on mortgage. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the spread between kind of the increased trend versus origination and how you calculate the mortgage outperformance for EWS?\nMark Begor: Yes, I'll start and let John jump in. We've been consistent really. There's been a phenomena that's a major change, a meaningful change in the mortgage market over the last, call it, 12 to 18 months, where when rates were starting to increase consumers did a lot more shopping and that benefited our USIS business. Meaning that the consumers would go to multiple mortgage originators and as you know, as a part of that process, when someone applies online, the first thing a mortgage originator will do is determine is that a consumer that can qualify for the loan they're trying to get, meaning are they going to invest that 5,000 or 6,000 or actually 7,000 of COGS in that mortgage process. So there's an inquiry that goes into or a pull on the USIS side. And that's why inquiries versus originations or closed loans have really separated. There's been an increase in originations. And we expect that to continue with these high interest rates. Consumers, they'll be more deliberate around their shopping behavior. And that's why there's a positive, if you will, for USIS in inquiries or credit polls in this environment where EWS typically in the back end of the mortgage process in -- really around closed loans.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Just broadly, right, we're finding it difficult to get good market data that we can correlate across applications and other measures, including originations. So as you know, for USIS, right, we determine our outperformance based on our own internal volume data. And we share that internal volume data, obviously, with you every quarter. And then going forward, what we're going to do is we're going to provide outperformance for EWS also based on our internal volume data, which are actuals, which we can actually measure. And as we've been talking to you about for quite some time, right, our outperformance is driven by record growth, which is more specific to TWN, but then also product price and mix. And as we said in the script, those are things we can measure together, understanding the difference between our volume and our overall revenue. And that's our outperformance. And I think going forward, we'll use that measure because it's all based on internal data that we can validate each quarter. And again, what we -- our internal volume data is transaction volume data, it's the transactions that are related directly to mortgage application approvals, doesn't really include things around batches or monitoring so that the data stays pure. And we feel like that's a much better measure of the level of outperformance driven by record growth, product, pricing and mix that we can deliver each quarter, and we'll continue to share that with you.\nMark Begor: Maybe just one more point, John, as a reminder, as you know, we get mortgage originations because we have the credit file on every consumer. So we see the actual new mortgage originations, but they're typically on a what five to six-month lag. So between that five to six-month lag, we're forecasting based on MBA data, based on our own tracking, based on our own run rates, we use multiple inputs to try to forecast those originations. We obviously have been challenged by that in this current environment with interest rates increasing. But we have a lot of data around mortgage originations.\nKelsey Zhu: Got it, thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate you taking my questions this morning. Mark, I mean, I get there a lot of moving pieces here outside of mortgage, especially I'm thinking about EWS verifier government, a little bit weaker maybe than you thought and you enumerated the reasons. I guess my question overall is do you think that, that EWS non-verifier -- sorry, non-mortgage verifier business has perhaps gotten a little more difficult to forecast as you do more business with the government and all these different programs, appreciating the new contract wins and do you think you're going to take that into account when you start to think about guiding for 2024?\nMark Begor: Yes, for sure. There's no question. Look, it's a big business. It's dealing in multiple verticals. In some regards, these -- like talent in government or I would still characterize them as fairly new verticals for us at scale, we've only been large in those verticals in the last couple of years. And you've got some macro impacts certainly in talent, leave mortgage side, which we talked about a bunch, but the hiring market is obviously under some pressure, particularly in white collar in the U.S. And we've tried to forecast that, and we're going to try to be more conservative or more balanced whatever word you want to use around that vertical. Same with government. There's a lot of moving parts there. I would say the most complex for us or the one we've been challenged by is the redeterminations. Outside of that, we have pretty clear visibility about adding new customers, adding new clients, new product rollouts, pricing actions and government, that is pretty dialed in. And I think the other -- if you think about 2023, both of those businesses had really, really, really strong 2022. So we're comping off very strong years, which is great because we're driving more penetration, more product, more price, and we had to look forward to where we're going to take those businesses. And while we've been off a little bit, we're really pleased with the growth of those businesses. Those are -- they both delivered strong growth in the quarter. You've seen accelerated growth in non-mortgage and EWS from second quarter. We expect that non-mortgage verifier growth to accelerate again in fourth quarter, which gives us really positive momentum going into 2024. But short answer to your question about, are we going to be more balanced around how we forecast there, for sure.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Okay. Yes, I think the market would welcome that. And then if I could just ask, it feels like obligatory competitive question in EWS. There are a couple of pieces of business that you characterize as manual and low margin that kind of let go last quarter. Can you just sort of reiterate your thinking, especially in mortgage Verifier in terms of the competitiveness of your solution?\nMark Begor: Yes. No change from what we talked about in July. In July, we tried to talk about the manual work we were doing for customers when we didn't have records. And that got I think somewhat misconstrued in the marketplace. We're not seeing an impact from competition in our mortgage business or any other businesses. We tried to be clear about that in July, and I'll be clear again today. We're well aware of what our competitors' data records that they have and what they don't have. To me, a big proof point about our competitiveness is our ability to continue to add new partnerships. We added four in the quarter. We added, I think, 27 in the last couple of years. We're growing our records. That's really, I think, a proof point of the strength of our ability to deliver solutions to our partners and execute for them. And they want to be partnered with Equifax. So I think that's a really important metric for us going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nKyle Peterson: Great, thanks, good morning guys. And appreciate you taking the questions. I wanted to touch on the consumer lending volumes within EWS. Looks like that was down a bit year-on-year. Just wanted to see, is that fairly broad based or was there any more concentration, whether it's card or personal loan or auto, just any more color would be helpful?\nMark Begor: Yes. Maybe at the kind of the macro level about a year ago, we talked about and we continue to talk about subprime really got tightened up. So that happened over the last, call it, three, four, five quarters. That's starting to bottom out because we're comping off really sharp declines from last year as we go into fourth quarter. But subprime has clearly pulled back. A combination of concern around that consumer base being more challenged, not from unemployment, but really from inflation. And we talked earlier that we've seen some delinquencies increase there. And as an old card guy from my prior life, when delinquencies go up, you typically will pull back on originations or be more deliberate around originations, meaning you want to make sure you're finding the consumers that can really afford that financial product. Prime is still fairly strong. The consumers are working, they've had some wage growth, while they've been impacted by inflation. We haven't seen much impact there. And would you add anything, John?\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: No, just as Mark said, our -- it tends to be in our consumer finance business, right, is that we tend to be more concentrated, we tend to be more concentrated in subprime and more concentrated on specific lenders. So the fact that that we're seeing subprime week, and we're seeing some fintechs week is driving it. And because we have more concentration other than the extremely broad coverage that USIS has, we tend to be -- we tend to move around a little bit more in EWS and our revenue for consumer finance.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's really helpful. And then just a follow-up, I know you guys have talked a bit about some of the previous spending reductions and kind of the benefits that will be in the 2024 numbers based on the actions taken this year. I just want to see, are there any other funding plans or things you guys are looking at if you guys are -- if we're going to be in kind of a lower-for-longer kind of mortgage inquiry market, I just want to see, are there any more levers you guys can push on the cost side of things if volumes don't come back next year?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think as John mentioned, and we did earlier, we had the $65 million of carryover from our $275 million program this year. The bulk of that, as you know, is from cloud completion and cloud cost savings. And as we go through 2024 we mentioned, and we'll give guidance in Feb on that, but we'll have additional cloud cost savings as we complete migrations next year. As we said, we expect to complete USIS and Canada and other of our international platforms. And as a reminder, we're carrying double cost today in those environments where we have a cloud environment we're paying for, and then we also have a legacy environment. When we complete the migrations, we shut down the legacy. So that will be the incremental savings which we expect to have in 2024 and 2025, and we'll give guidance on that. Beyond those kind of savings, we're going to keep our belt tight in 2024. We're going to want to continue to invest in the right places, but I'd characterize that as we're going to be balanced around it given the environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Redburn. Your line is now live.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. A lot of my questions have been asked already, but maybe we could zero in again on EWS mortgage. And I just wanted to -- just going back to your -- the way you're measuring the outperformance this time and the implied decline in origination volumes this quarter that you've seen versus what the sort of industry forecasts have been for third quarter. And there's quite a wide gap. And I just wanted to make sure that there's nothing else at play here in terms of I don't know, maybe sort of just you're not seeing all the volumes that you would otherwise be seeing or for any sort of color you can give around that sort of divergence would be useful?\nMark Begor: We try to forecast what the originations are as mentioned earlier. We know what actual originations are like, a five to six-month lag. Between that time frame, we try to forecast. If you're referring to like NBA and some of the other forecasts, if you look back over the last two years, three years, four years, five years, they're consistently long. It's a hard thing to forecast, and we just try to use our best data on it. And then we also factor in our current run rates on originations. So that's the way that we're forecasting to try to get more current because MBA is done on a survey basis. I think they survey like half of the mortgage originators in order to get that data. Ours is actual originations on a lag and then our current forecast based on what we're seeing in current time frame.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: And again, going forward, what we're going to try to make sure we do is we're going to make sure we're providing you with actual data, right. So I mean we'll be able to give you the benefit we're seeing from records, product, price and mix which are really the big drivers of our outperformance. And we'll be measuring that against our actual volumes across USIS and TWN separately so that we can validate the information. We know what the actuals are and we can explain how we're performing and driving those levers, which we think is what's really important to make sure we explain because that's what we're driving and delivering outperformance through.\nSimon Clinch: Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up. I mean if we want to talk about or think about a tougher mortgage market for longer sort of current levels, does that in any way change the I guess the pricing power, the competitive dynamics for EWS and mortgage going through a period like that, a prolonged period like that. Just wondering if you could help us think about the puts and takes in that regard?\nMark Begor: We don't think so. The power of instant data, and in this case, we're talking about income and employment data is super valuable to every mortgage originator. They want to make sure that they have accurate data. We get it directly from the company every two weeks on the consumer. We deliver it instantly. In this environment of more shopping, a mortgage originator that's investing in a consumer, they want to make sure that they close that loan as they get down the path of delivering it. So we don't see a change in our ability to deliver new solutions, meaning products to the industry. Obviously, with more records, we're going to drive higher hit rates that happens really because we're getting the inquiries from our customers for all their applicants. And then we still believe that we have pricing power going forward because of the uniqueness of our data set, the alternative for our customers is to do it -- the mortgage customers to do the verification manually, which is very challenging, meaning getting a company on the phone to verify the income is very hard to do and it takes time, and that's labor and also time. So speed and productivity and accuracy is the value we deliver.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Mark, just my first question, I just wanted to talk a little bit more like how we should be thinking about the future with some of the items that you were talking about, the increase in subprime delinquencies. We talked about auto for a while, we're talking about credit cards, cash being used up, like how does that impact the business over the next 12 months, I mean I know the employment has been fairly good at the lower end of the spectrum, but like there's a lot of parts of the spectrum where there's open jobs. They're not really filling those open jobs. And so I guess the first question is, how are you thinking about this on a go-forward basis? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Begor: Yes. Go forward, you got to kind of talk time frames. When you think out the next couple of quarters, it doesn't feel to us or to me like there's going to be a lot of change, meaning it's a fairly -- outside of the mortgage market, obviously, let's leave that aside. That's obviously super challenging and really unprecedented what's happening with interest rates. But when you have people working and very low unemployment rates, generally, they're able to pay their bills. When they pay their bills, delinquencies stay generally low, and then you have the ability -- our customers have confidence in continuing to extend credit through loans and other solutions to those consumers. Subprime has been challenged for a year. That's generally subprime is with the fintechs. Most of the big banks don't do subprime business. And that's been challenged for a year. And we're actually, as I mentioned earlier, starting to comp against fairly low levels. I would expect subprime to stay high as we go through 2024 because those consumers are really more challenged, not around being unemployed, but around inflation is still pressuring them. But the big metric that I always think about and you should, too, in my view, is unemployment. So back to your question about 2024, give me your forecast for unemployment next year. Is it going to go up, down or sideways, if you think unemployment is going to spike or go up, which I don't think it will in this environment with 10 million open jobs and only 5 million people looking right now, that's a pretty good environment to go into 2024 in kind of the core elements of our business outside of mortgage.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you. And then just going back to those government redeterminations, can you talk about like how does that work exactly, like once they get done, let\u2019s say they get done by June of next year. Is this something that the government is going to be doing annually or is this kind of a big onetime bang and then we're going to end up with tough comps on that after we're done with it?\nMark Begor: Yes. Remember that the redeterminations were suspended during COVID. So they didn't happen over the last couple of years. Once President Biden lifted the COVID pandemic rule or requirement, these redeterminations went back into place. So it's really the completion of the annual verifications are happening in this 12-month time frame in third, fourth and first and second quarter next year. Post second quarter, they'll have the requirement to do the annual redeterminations that are a requirement of the programs. So there may be some elements of comp that from a timing standpoint, but we don't expect it to be meaningful.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: And these redeterminations apply across multiple government subsidized programs, it's not just Medicaid, Medicare. And so it's more broad and we participate in many of those.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yeah, thank you. Sorry to keep pulling you back to this, but just given that it's a new metric you're going to be providing on an ongoing basis. So on the footnote and you said this as well, you're looking at internal data and then you're doing a Calcon [ph] records product, price and mix. It's not clear to me, like I know you said you don't think there's any change in share dynamics relative to a quarter ago. But if there are share shifts, is that accounted for in your market estimate, is it accounted for an outperformance, it's just -- it's not clear to me if you're looking at internal data based upon what volumes you're seeing how you would account first year...?\nMark Begor: First off, we don't see any share shifts, Jeff. If there were, they would be in the outperformance. And remember, we still have a grounding in originations. As I mentioned, you have to forecast originations. And there's MBA which a lot of you look at and we look at it, too, is really diverge from what we're seeing in originations. And remember, we see originations on two sides of our business. We see it in in the credit business in USIS, and we see it in EWS and then we get actual originations on a five to six-month lag when they actually get posted to the credit file after the mortgage is closed. So we have really meaningful data. I think we were trying to highlight that the divergence we're seeing from some of those industry forecasts have just become larger in recent times, my view is my personal view because of the rapid change in rates. I think rates went up overnight or the last 48 hours by 50 bps. That's not in a forecast that MBA did a month ago, but we can see what's happening this afternoon.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: And so what we'll be disclosing -- so what we'll disclose every quarter, again, is the outperformance with records, product, price and mix. And then over time, obviously, you're asking -- and we're comparing that against our volume, obviously. So over time, to the extent anything was to occur, which we're not seeing, okay, but then we would obviously talk to you about whether we're seeing differences between our own volume, and what we think is happening broadly in the market. But the metric we'll disclose every quarter really is driven by records, product, price and mix, which compares effectively our revenue to our volume. Because that's what we can actually measure. So when we talk about -- and it's what we've been doing in USIS for a very long time, right, as long as I can remember.\nMark Begor: 15 to 20 years.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: More than 10 years. So what we're talking about doing for EWS now is the same thing we've been doing for USIS for a very long period of time comparing revenue and the drivers against our volume metrics.\nJeffrey Meuler: Understood. It's just been uses share shift now the dynamics I wanted to make sure I understood it. And then just can you just give us what the assumption is in the guidance for Q4 mortgage origination unit volumes? And can you comment on the number of TWN pulls per closed mortgage. It took a step up, I think, to like 2.5% in the pandemic. Has that been stable since, is it still going up, has it come down at all?\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. So in terms of again, we're not forecasting mortgage originations. What we're using is our internal volume data. So we gave you in the guidance what we're assuming for credit inquiries in the fourth quarter. And that's the basis we'd ask you to consider if we are going to see, I think, credit increase down 22%, which is about 18 percentage points worse than what we expected back in July. And so we think that's an indication of the direction of the market. And it's the basis on which we're calculating our volumes for USIS. We have a similar metric we use internally with EWS on their own volumes. And that's the basis on which we generated our forecast. We didn't try to come up with a mortgage originations forecast because we're going to focus on using the internal volume that we can actually measure. As Mark said, we can't measure originations at the end of the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter. It's something that we want to have visibility to for quite some time following.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, wanted to touch on Boa Vista. I know you had given originally like $165 million revenue run rate. I think it was $160 million when you cited it in the second quarter, and you're holding that here today post close. Just kind of curious if you could bridge the performance there over the past nine months with how that end market is doing, how the business is doing, just kind of an update as it's now under your official ownership?\nMark Begor: Yes. We're only, I don't know, 60 days in of having it under the ownership, but pleased to have it in. The market from our perspective is growing kind of high single digit. That's why we like the market down there in Brazil. We're very active in driving the integration of getting our new products and solutions there. We're going to move them to the Equifax Cloud over the next number of quarters to get them on our new cloud environment. We're going to bring down our large platforms like Interconnect, which they don't really have a version of that as well as Ignite, our analytics platform, which will really drive some strong competitiveness with Serasa Experian in the marketplace. The business performance, I would say, is probably lagging a bit that market performance, primarily through the integration. This is -- it was a complex integration for a small publicly traded company to go through the process. It was a long process to go through. Gosh, it was almost seven to eight months of the process to do the take private, but we're energized around the future of the business and focused on getting this integration complete and getting into new solutions and to help them drive their top line.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great, thank you. And then if I could ask just a clarifying question for my follow-up. In terms of the mortgage market outperformance in EWS, I think, first, I want to clarify that the 15% decline for 2024 that you talked about if conditions persist. I want to make sure that I understood that that's an inquiry estimate, or is that an origination estimate? And then also, when we think about the gap between those two numbers, is there any reason to believe that, that gap would -- and this is just kind of a question around the market itself, not your guys' performance. Any reason of that gap to narrow or widen in a prolonged weak environment, just kind of thinking about the different levels, levers if you can?\nMark Begor: I'll jump in, and John can dive in behind me. First, on the last half of your question, we would expect the inquiries to be stronger than originations in this high mortgage rate environment. You call it weaker, but if you're a consumer and in many cases, stretching to get a mortgage for a home that you want to buy because prices are still very high you do a lot of shopping around when there's a high interest rate environment. I don't think that's going to change next year. I think we're still going to see that environment, which certainly will benefit USIS with more credit pulls in that shopping environment. You want to add, John, on the forecast.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Sure. So the first question, yes, the down 15% was a statement specifically about to the extent the run rate we're talking about in the fourth quarter of 2023 for mortgage credit inquiries continues, then we would expect 2024 to be down 15%, if that's the level that the market stays at, right. So...\nMark Begor: From origination?\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: For mortgage credit inquiries, down 15%.\nMark Begor: And then against that, and we'll give guidance in February. But against that down 15%, we would have our levers in both businesses around price, product penetration to deliver the outperformance against that market.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live.\nCraig Huber: Hi, good morning. First question, can you quantify for us the revenue performance in the U.S. for credit cards and autos and what the outlook is there for the fourth quarter?\nMark Begor: Yes. I don't think we give the actual revenue numbers, John.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: We do not. What we indicated is we thought that FI performed well in the quarter that auto performed well in the quarter. We had very good performance in commercial and we had really nice performance in counts identity and fraud business. So auto and FI were two of the strong performers that showed very good growth in the quarter for us, but we don't actually disclose the specific revenue levels.\nMark Begor: And I would say we don't expect real change in the fourth quarter from that third quarter run rate.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: No, we're expecting business. We're expecting fourth quarter to continue to be good in those businesses really.\nCraig Huber: So is your argument then with the much higher interest rates out there, obviously impacting mortgages, as you've talked quite a bit about here. You're not seeing significant impact to the rest of your business with a much higher rate. Obviously, the 10-year rate is approaching 5% here, has been at that level for many, many years are you not seeing an impact from much higher rates anywhere else in your business?\nMark Begor: We haven't. But again, let me just be a little more deliberate for example, like in subprime auto, there's been some pressure there from originations because they're more deliberate around that subprime consumer being challenged. And then that subprime consumer at that higher interest rate even in parts is sometimes challenged to qualify for that. But broadly, no, when you think sometimes a small portion of the financial services industry, most of it is near in prime. And higher interest rates have not impacted auto originations or card originations in the near prime and prime space like they have in mortgage. Mortgage is just a big ticket item that had a massive impact on the rates over such a short time frame.\nCraig Huber: Great, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nFaiza Alwy: Yeah, hi, thank you. So I wanted to ask about mortgage again and really inquiries. So I know that the MBA forecast changes quite a bit. But I'm curious how you think about the MBA index and the application data that comes out every Wednesday morning because that showed that 3Q applications were down 29%, which is in line with your inquiry decline. So I would have thought that inquiries because you're talking about higher shopping, I would have thought inquiries would have done better than that. So just give us some perspective into how we should think about that data and really what's going on with inquiries relative to applications?\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. So I think to our earlier commentary, I think what we're finding is there's lots of pieces of market estimates that are being disclosed by various third parties that I think in this current environment, our difficult -- estimates are difficult to make. And admittedly, they're difficult to correlate. So that's why -- honestly, we've shifted to trying to use our own internal actual volume data so that we can try to track it over time. We'll certainly have a perspective as we look back historically, and we look at our volume data on inquiries relative to actual applications and actual originations they occur, and we'll be happy to talk about that. But trying to do it real time right now, I think it's just is very difficult given the movements in the environment. And that's why we think it's better for us and better for you, quite honestly, if what we talk to you about is our actual volume data and then the things that are driving our performance to be better than our actual volume data.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. And then maybe just give us some perspective, again, on this inquiry question sort of where we were maybe pre-pandemic and what happened during the pandemic in terms of number of inquiries per whether it's application or for origination sort of how far ahead are we, was it three or four inquiries back in 2019, did that fall down, are we at seven or eight now. Just some perspective on how much higher inquiries are now would be helpful?\nMark Begor: And versus what time frame, they've grown over the last three, four, five years really because of consumer behavior as well as more -- the majority of mortgage applications happen online today, which is a phenomenon that is very different from what it was five years ago, which drives more credit polls. Over the last year, they're fairly consistent, meaning it hasn't changed in the last year, but they're clearly up from five, four years ago, even three years ago.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: And again, and I know you know this right, but we disclosed -- we provide every quarter what the actual inquiry numbers look like, how the -- sorry, what the actual movements in inquiries were so you can see how that's trending over time.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay, understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks for taking my question. Historically, pricing wasn't really a big contributor to growth for the bureaus overall, but it seems like it's more of a driver in recent years for you and especially now. Obviously, work number has been an area you've been able to increase price. I think you've also talked about introducing new products at higher price points in other parts of the business, too. So I guess when we think about like a 7% to 10% normalized organic growth rate for Equifax, how much of that should come from price increases and maybe help us out with regard to like the segments as well?\nMark Begor: Sure. First, I'm not sure when you talk about history, I've only been here five years, but over the past five years, price has always been a lever for Equifax and, I believe, for our competitors. I think it's one of the things that data analytics companies have is if you have more valuable data, you're able to charge more for it. Price, as you point out, we really execute two ways, pure price, meaning we do annual price increases. And we also get price through delivering new products with either more historical data or data combinations that deliver more value to our customers. And remember, our sale is an ROI sale. So with regards to the 7% to 10% organic, which is the subset of our 8% to 12%, if you go back to our Investor Day from a couple of years ago, there's charts on each business where we talk about the levers to deliver that 7% to 10%. And as a reminder, the 7% to 10% is really driven by EWS being north of that and International and USIS being south of that. And if you think about we have levers that are fairly balanced to deliver that 7% to 10%. You've got a few points over the long term of market in GDP. You've got a few points of price. You've got a few points each of these are kind of a couple -- 2 points to 3 points, a couple of points of product driving that top line. And then you've got penetration in new verticals that we move into. And that's kind of how you walk up. And then in EWS uniquely, we get a couple of points from records. So I think 2, 3, 4 points from record additions over the long term that drive our revenue. And as you know, on the records is because we're already getting inquiries and when we add a new record to the data set we monetize. So that drives the revenue growth. So I wouldn't characterize price as being disproportionate in -- versus the other levers that we have, and it's been fairly consistent over the time I've been here about how we've executed it.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: And then we'll publish a supplemental deck here in the next couple of hours. And then in that deck for each of the business units, we'll provide a walk kind of for the long-term model that gives you price and depending on the business unit records, etcetera, that can provide perspectives on how we expect to be able to drive benefits for the drivers between -- the drivers of our revenue growth on a long-term basis. So hopefully, that will help as well.\nToni Kaplan: Yes, terrific. And then if I caught your comments earlier correctly, you mentioned that 50% of your revenue is coming -- within EWS is coming from products containing historical records. Has that mix meaningfully changed versus like a year ago, just wanting to understand?\nMark Begor: It's probably up slightly from a year ago, but it's up meaningfully from three, four, five years ago. And it's really -- as you may recall, Toni, and we talked about it, as we've moved EWS to the cloud, call it 18 months ago almost, it really opened up the window for them number one, to deliver new products; and number two, a lot of those new products are using trended or historical data, which was more challenging to do pre-cloud. So -- and you've seen EWS' Vitality Index, which kind of pre-cloud was in the 3% to 5% range, something like that, probably at the low end. And now as we talked about earlier this morning is north of 20. And all those products, either our data combinations or predominantly our trended historical data. And if you think about it, just quite -- it's common sense, Mark's income today is very valuable as a data element, but Mark's income over the last 36 months is even more valuable if it's going up. It's a very important indicator if it was going down. And then if it's stable, it's an important indicator. So that's the value that we're able to deliver in that massive historical data set we have. And we would expect that 50% to move up, but it's probably up 20 points in the last three or four years.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: It's up certainly significantly, right. And I think if you just look at it by line of business, mortgage has grown substantially, as Mark's talked about, because of mortgage 36 and the use of trended data across mortgage very broadly now, and that's moved up towards 50% of transactions. The government is less, right, in terms of trended information. It tends to be more point in time. Talent is virtually all trended information. And then so as the mix of our business moves, that ratio can mix a bit, it can change a bit. But generally speaking, in all of our verticals, we're driving the mix to trended data from the levels they're at today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to drill down further on Toni's question on pricing. And particularly, FICO price increases was a significant tailwind for mortgage revenues within USIS or OIS this year. How should we think about those tailwinds going into next year and offsetting some of the mortgage inquiry headwinds for next year? Thanks. \nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. I don't know if you follow FICO or you talked to the FICO team, but I would expect that they're going to do a price increase in 2024. You should talk to them. And if they do, we're obviously the conduit along with you and Experian to deliver that to the marketplace, and that's something that we would execute on.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just on the Boa Vista earnings accretion. So that was pretty positive $0.02 accretion in the quarter. Is that the run rate that we should think about going into 2024 or can you talk about the puts and takes from an earnings accretion perspective in 2024? Thanks. \nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. So we'll give you that detail when we give guidance, obviously, for 2024. But in the fourth quarter, it's similar to what it was in the third.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nSeth Weber: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Boa Vista for a second. The footnote on Slide 4 seems to suggest the margins were higher excluding Boa Vista, but I thought at the time of the acquisition, EBITDA margins for that asset were running like in the high 30% range. So were there some kind of like onetime costs there that impacted the results or is there something -- I'm just trying -- I'm just looking at the footnote on Slide 4? Thanks.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: Fair enough. The EBITDA margin was -- for Boa Vista was slightly below, it was below the Equifax average margin. And what we're expecting over time, as Mark talked about, through the investments we're making through integrating them into Equifax processes that will work to drive that margin higher. But yes, for what you saw in the footnote, the BVS margins were below the Equifax margins for the third quarter. Now as a reminder, we've owned them for about six weeks, so we'll see what happens as we move through the fourth quarter and then into 2024.\nSeth Weber: No, that's fair. I just -- I thought that the acquisition, the margins were high 30s. That was the frame and spirit of the question. But -- and then just another follow-up. Sorry if I missed this, but are there any more details on this, the new $1.2 billion contract, when that starts, how that rolls in, is that ratable over the term of the contract or just how we should start thinking about filtering that into our forecasts? Thanks. \nMark Begor: Yes. Remember, that's an extension of an existing contract. So we've had a contract for five-plus years and maybe longer with CMS. It's certainly larger and it will roll in both at the federal and then at the state level as we go through fourth quarter in 2024 and 2025 and beyond.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: I think it's an outstanding, as Mark said, largest contract we've ever signed. Just as you take a look at over the next five years it doesn't mean you're going to -- we'll generate all the revenue up to the maximum amount of the contract. So what it does is gives us the opportunity to work with states and obviously with the federal government to drive increasing revenue under the auspices of the agreement, which is extremely positive, but it is certainly in no way a guarantee of revenue at that level.\nSeth Weber: Got it, okay. Thank you guys, I appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You've previously seen evidence of mortgage insourcing of their verification needs within EWS. Can you provide an update on some of those trends and in-sourcing activity outside of the mortgage vertical?\nMark Begor: So George, I'm not sure what you mean by in-sourcing or I think you used the terms we provided evidence. Are you referring to our comments in July about the manual work we were doing for customers that was where we did not have records?\nGeorge Tong: No, it's where mortgage originators because volumes are down so much and because they apparently had so much time on their hands they were just doing it themselves rather than...\nMark Begor: And that was the discussion we had back in July, and it was around where we were doing the manual efforts for our customers and a very small operation in Iowa, where we did not have the records. And we talked about the fact that I was moving in house. We haven't seen any evidence of mortgage originators shifting from using our instant solution to doing it themselves. So that has not been a dialogue from Equifax.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And assuming that the same holds true outside of the mortgage vertical.\nMark Begor: Yes, for sure. That's how we're growing our business because they're using more of our solutions. We deliver productivity and we deliver speed and accuracy. So that's fundamental. We see no trends in any of the verticals of where they're going back to manual what you're seeing in the business. That's how we're delivering the double-digit growth in the quarter and the double-digit growth we expect in the fourth quarter of -- one of those levers is more conversions of existing manual effort to using our instant solution.\nGeorge Tong: Got it, thank you for that. And then sticking with EWS. Workforce Solutions, non-mortgage, nongovernment, can you discuss some of the trends that you're seeing there and the sensitivity of customers to pricing trends in the Verifications business?\nMark Begor: Yes. Do you want to talk about talent or exclude talent from that, too?\nGeorge Tong: Focus on verifications.\nMark Begor: Well, okay. So you're talking about like in -- and you want to leave mortgage out and focus on card and P loans and auto or do you want to talk mortgage to, I'm just trying to figure out which part of verification you want to cover.\nGeorge Tong: Yes, non-mortgage, non-government.\nMark Begor: Non-mortgage, nongovernment talent.\nGeorge Tong: Yes. Talent, I guess.\nMark Begor: Yes. So we haven't seen sensitivity to our customers around pricing in any of those verticals. Because of the value that it delivers, you got to be obviously clear that we're balanced around pricing, but the customers are using our solution because of the productivity and accuracy and then the instant access to the information as well as the scale of the data set. We didn't talk much on the call about our ability to continue to add records. And we're approaching 70% of nonfarm payroll and over 50% of kind of working Americans, including 1099 and income-producing Americans, including pension, that data set is super valuable in all those verification markets. And -- as you know, we also have a big focus on adding new products, which is exhibited by the Vitality Index, which a lot of that vitality -- actually, most of that vitality is in verification, is really delivering new solutions that help our customers expedite or complete the transactions using our Instant data.\nJohn W. Gamble, Jr.: And talent, I know we've said this many times, no one likes price increases. But for example, in talent, one of the things we do in other segments as we provide incentives for people to be able to get better pricing from us by moving to top of waterfall, or by selling additional products to drive growth across the broader sweat -- I'm sorry, broader suite of our entire group of products that's talent solutions like our education solutions and other solutions, and we're launching now products that support health care directly. We have staffing products. We have other products that allow people to get better pricing from Equifax while helping us drive volumes through the system. So again, we -- just like we don't like price increases, we know no one likes price increases, but we try to be balanced, and we try to structure them so that people have the opportunity to purchase the products that they want at price points that are effective for them.\nGeorge Tong: Got it, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the cloud migration. So first part, it sounds like it's lagging a little bit from what you said last quarter. I'm curious if you can help us kind of understand what's going on with that transition and where, I guess, the headwinds have been? And then with regards to your plans with the transition, when do you think we could start seeing the benefits of that on the USIS side? Thanks. \nMark Begor: Yes. Look, cloud transformations are hard. This has been super complex and the most complex cloud transformation that we're executing is in USIS given the age of the legacy infrastructure and formats that we had. And we're clearly a few months behind, but we can see the finish line in completing it. As we said earlier, we're migrating large customers, as we speak, in the fourth quarter. Those will continue in the first quarter, and we'd expect to be complete with USIS as well as many of our international platforms in the early parts or first half of 2024. And that's a big pivot point, as you point out. When are we going to start seeing the benefits? We're starting to see it. And what we saw in EWS is what we would expect to see in USIS. And we talked earlier about EWS' ability to drive new product rollouts at a very rapid pace, well above our 10% goal at the 20% plus. We would expect USIS to grow their vitality index, which today is south of 10 and move towards 10. And I think we mentioned they've grown their vitality about 100 basis points. We also mentioned, and we've talked about it on calls really for the last four years, but in the last couple of calls, that in USIS in particular, because of the ability to deliver always-on stability, the ability to have faster data transmission and then obviously leveraging our differentiated data, we do expect in USIS to get some share gains. And that really comes forward, where we move from a tertiary position to a second or primary position. And we had one large FI in the U.S., which is where USIS is, obviously, that's making that move with us because of the cloud. So we would expect more of those to come forward as we complete the cloud in 2024 and then really between share gains and new product rollouts that to help drive USIS' growth rates in 2024 and 2025 and beyond.\nHeather Balsky: And can I ask a follow-up. Just when you talk about share gains, how should we think about it, are you taking business from other creditors or is it expanding the wallet and benefiting that way?\nMark Begor: No. When you talk about share gains, it's what you would think a share gain is, is where we're moving from secondary to primary or tertiary to secondary because of the cloud. And having the most advanced technology, we think, is an advantage. That's one of the reasons we embarked on this is at our gut, we believe, to be a great data analytics company, a great technology company. And when you overlay the digital macro of our customers doing the vast majority of their transactions with their consumers online, you have to delivered 99 [ph] to stability. You can't do that in the legacy environment. You can only do with cloud, and you have to have that for data transmission. So we think that's going to advantage Equifax going forward. And then you lay on top of it, you'd be able to roll out new solutions more quickly and more of them. That's going to be advantaged to Equifax to become a more important partner that will drive us up from those secondary positions that could be 20% or 30% of the volume to the primary positions, which could be 60%, 70%, 80%. And that's really what we have in front of us from the cloud investment, and we would expect those benefits to roll the USIS. And one last point that we mentioned is getting USIS cloud native will also allow us to do more between EWS and USIS. That was hard pre-cloud in two legacy environments with different data sets that are in different data environments. As you know, we went to a single data fabric and having them both in the cloud, that's going to be another gear for us going forward to have data combination solutions between USIS and EWS that was really hard to do before. And of course, only we can do that between credit data and the other differentiated data in USIS in combination with the income and employment data that's really only Equifax.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.\nTrevor Burns: Yes, it's Trevor Burns. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to me and Sam. Otherwise, have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "John W. Gamble, Jr.",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 12, as Mark mentioned, third quarter mortgage market credit inquiries were down about 29% weaker than the down 23% in our July guidance and EWS mortgage outperformance was about 22% from records and price product and mix, and consistent with the second quarter. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming the weakening trend in mortgage market volume estimated based on the change in our credit inquiries we have seen in October continues as well as further normal seasonal declines in November and December. On this basis, we expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 22% in the fourth quarter, which is an 18 percentage point reduction from our July framework for the fourth quarter. For perspective, to the extent the mortgage market continues at the levels we've assumed for 4Q 2023, which is more than 50% below pre-pandemic averages, 2024 mortgage market credit inquiry volumes would be down approaching 15% versus 2023. Slide 13 provides the details of our guidance for 4Q 2023. In 4Q 2023, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.307 billion and $1.327 billion with revenue up 10% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to 13%. Mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be below 15% of Equifax revenue. Business unit performance in the fourth quarter is expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 8%, which is lower than the implied fourth quarter framework we outlined in July. The bulk of the $47 million mortgage market impact on revenue that Mark referenced impacts EWS. As we discussed in July USIS benefits from greater mortgage revenue in the early application phases, which should continue into the fourth quarter.  EWS non-mortgage revenue will return to strong over 15% growth year-to-year in the fourth quarter. However, this strong growth is below our framework from July. Government growth should be above the 23% we saw in the third quarter, but is below our framework from July as state benefit redeterminations are occurring at a slower pace than we anticipated. Talent growth should be above the 6% we saw this quarter as well, but will also be below our July framework as overall hiring has decelerated from the levels we were seeing in July with BLS now down 10% with white collar verticals down significantly more. And employer services revenue will be below our 4Q framework from July for both I9 and onboarding that should continue to deliver year-to-year growth but at levels below our July framework from weaker overall hiring and ERC with the IRS announcement that they would pause on new ERC claims. Adjusted EBITDA margins for EWS are expected to be about 50.5%.  USIS revenue is expected to be up about 4% year-to-year despite the increased mortgage headwind. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of 4% should be down from the about 8.5% growth we saw this quarter as we lap 4Q 2022 pricing actions. This is somewhat stronger than we expected in our July framework driven by continued good growth in commercial, consumer solutions, auto, and across our account IB [ph] products. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 35%, up sequentially, principally due to revenue growth and cost actions. International revenue is expected to be up about 20% in constant currency due to the addition of BVS and as we lap headwinds in our UK debt management business. Revenue is expected to be up about 6.5% in organic constant currency, this is somewhat stronger than our July framework. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 30%, reflecting revenue growth and strong cost management, including the benefit of planned cost reduction actions. We expect Brazil to deliver revenue of about $38 million in the fourth quarter. Equifax 4Q 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34% at the midpoint of our guidance, an increase sequentially of almost 100 basis points. And adjusted EPS in 4Q 2023 is expected to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share, up 17% versus 4Q 2022 at the midpoint. Both adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin are below the $2 per share and 36% targets that we set as goals as we entered 2023, principally due to the assumed further decline in mortgage market volumes and associated reduction of high-margin mortgage revenue that Mark discussed. Slide 14 provides the specifics of our 2023 full year guidance. 2023 revenue and adjusted EPS are being reduced consistent with our 3Q 2023 results and our 4Q 2023 guidance. We expect 2023 non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth to be strong at about 9% and organic revenue growth of about 7%. Total capital spending for 2023, including the addition of Brazil, which was not previously included in our guidance, is expected to be about $580 million. Capital spending in the third quarter was about $145 million. We did see the expected decline in spending sequentially, however, the reduction was slightly less than the expected, principally due to higher spending related to customer migrations. We expect capital spending in the fourth quarter to decline sequentially by about $15 million as we continue to progress U.S. and Canadian migrations to Data Fabric. We remain focused on reducing CAPEX as a percentage of revenue to about 7% by the end of 2025.  We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50-plus basis points of margin expansion annually on average over a cycle. Although the unprecedented decline in the U.S. mortgage market in 2022 and 2023, pushes out our prior midterm goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins to beyond 2025, it does not change our focus on expanding our margins toward our 39% goal as we drive revenue higher. We will continue to focus on delivering strong non-mortgage growth at or above our long-term revenue growth framework, outperforming our underlying markets, including the mortgage market, and executing our cloud transformation, including delivering ongoing cost improvements. As mentioned earlier, to the extent the mortgage market continues at the levels we have assumed for 4Q 2023, 2024 mortgage market inquiry volumes would be down approaching 15% versus 2023. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. And as you're specifically looking at 2024, right, we've already talked about the fact that we have significant cost reduction plans we put in place in 2023. They'll drive an additional $65 million of savings as we get into next year. We also look at some savings as we continue to migrate to the cloud, which weren't included in that $65 million. So we expect to have cost levers that will help drive our margins higher. Obviously, we're not giving revenue guidance but again, for us, for 2024 but for us, as you know, our variable margin on new revenue is very high, right. So as we drive more revenue, that also is a way that we drive margins as we go forward. So just as a reminder, those people think about next year, first quarter margins for us tend to be lower, right, because a significant amount of equity and variable compensation expense hits in the first quarter as opposed to being spread throughout the year because of the structure of our plan. So just as a reminder, first quarter margins tend to move down. 19%, yes. Just in terms of pacing, you covered it, right? It's just it's very difficult to forecast, right? So although we did see lift from redeterminations, it wasn't to the level we expected, and we certainly saw that to a degree in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But we still think we're the best solution and expect to get the revenue related to redeterminations, as Mark said, by the time it completes at the end of the second quarter. But as we said, in the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter, a little lower growth than the level we'd expected. Just broadly, right, we're finding it difficult to get good market data that we can correlate across applications and other measures, including originations. So as you know, for USIS, right, we determine our outperformance based on our own internal volume data. And we share that internal volume data, obviously, with you every quarter. And then going forward, what we're going to do is we're going to provide outperformance for EWS also based on our internal volume data, which are actuals, which we can actually measure. And as we've been talking to you about for quite some time, right, our outperformance is driven by record growth, which is more specific to TWN, but then also product price and mix. And as we said in the script, those are things we can measure together, understanding the difference between our volume and our overall revenue. And that's our outperformance. And I think going forward, we'll use that measure because it's all based on internal data that we can validate each quarter. And again, what we -- our internal volume data is transaction volume data, it's the transactions that are related directly to mortgage application approvals, doesn't really include things around batches or monitoring so that the data stays pure. And we feel like that's a much better measure of the level of outperformance driven by record growth, product, pricing and mix that we can deliver each quarter, and we'll continue to share that with you. No, just as Mark said, our -- it tends to be in our consumer finance business, right, is that we tend to be more concentrated, we tend to be more concentrated in subprime and more concentrated on specific lenders. So the fact that that we're seeing subprime week, and we're seeing some fintechs week is driving it. And because we have more concentration other than the extremely broad coverage that USIS has, we tend to be -- we tend to move around a little bit more in EWS and our revenue for consumer finance. And again, going forward, what we're going to try to make sure we do is we're going to make sure we're providing you with actual data, right. So I mean we'll be able to give you the benefit we're seeing from records, product, price and mix which are really the big drivers of our outperformance. And we'll be measuring that against our actual volumes across USIS and TWN separately so that we can validate the information. We know what the actuals are and we can explain how we're performing and driving those levers, which we think is what's really important to make sure we explain because that's what we're driving and delivering outperformance through. And these redeterminations apply across multiple government subsidized programs, it's not just Medicaid, Medicare. And so it's more broad and we participate in many of those. And so what we'll be disclosing -- so what we'll disclose every quarter, again, is the outperformance with records, product, price and mix. And then over time, obviously, you're asking -- and we're comparing that against our volume, obviously. So over time, to the extent anything was to occur, which we're not seeing, okay, but then we would obviously talk to you about whether we're seeing differences between our own volume, and what we think is happening broadly in the market. But the metric we'll disclose every quarter really is driven by records, product, price and mix, which compares effectively our revenue to our volume. Because that's what we can actually measure. So when we talk about -- and it's what we've been doing in USIS for a very long time, right, as long as I can remember. More than 10 years. So what we're talking about doing for EWS now is the same thing we've been doing for USIS for a very long period of time comparing revenue and the drivers against our volume metrics. Yes. So in terms of again, we're not forecasting mortgage originations. What we're using is our internal volume data. So we gave you in the guidance what we're assuming for credit inquiries in the fourth quarter. And that's the basis we'd ask you to consider if we are going to see, I think, credit increase down 22%, which is about 18 percentage points worse than what we expected back in July. And so we think that's an indication of the direction of the market. And it's the basis on which we're calculating our volumes for USIS. We have a similar metric we use internally with EWS on their own volumes. And that's the basis on which we generated our forecast. We didn't try to come up with a mortgage originations forecast because we're going to focus on using the internal volume that we can actually measure. As Mark said, we can't measure originations at the end of the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter. It's something that we want to have visibility to for quite some time following. Sure. So the first question, yes, the down 15% was a statement specifically about to the extent the run rate we're talking about in the fourth quarter of 2023 for mortgage credit inquiries continues, then we would expect 2024 to be down 15%, if that's the level that the market stays at, right. So... For mortgage credit inquiries, down 15%. We do not. What we indicated is we thought that FI performed well in the quarter that auto performed well in the quarter. We had very good performance in commercial and we had really nice performance in counts identity and fraud business. So auto and FI were two of the strong performers that showed very good growth in the quarter for us, but we don't actually disclose the specific revenue levels. No, we're expecting business. We're expecting fourth quarter to continue to be good in those businesses really. Yes. So I think to our earlier commentary, I think what we're finding is there's lots of pieces of market estimates that are being disclosed by various third parties that I think in this current environment, our difficult -- estimates are difficult to make. And admittedly, they're difficult to correlate. So that's why -- honestly, we've shifted to trying to use our own internal actual volume data so that we can try to track it over time. We'll certainly have a perspective as we look back historically, and we look at our volume data on inquiries relative to actual applications and actual originations they occur, and we'll be happy to talk about that. But trying to do it real time right now, I think it's just is very difficult given the movements in the environment. And that's why we think it's better for us and better for you, quite honestly, if what we talk to you about is our actual volume data and then the things that are driving our performance to be better than our actual volume data. And again, and I know you know this right, but we disclosed -- we provide every quarter what the actual inquiry numbers look like, how the -- sorry, what the actual movements in inquiries were so you can see how that's trending over time. And then we'll publish a supplemental deck here in the next couple of hours. And then in that deck for each of the business units, we'll provide a walk kind of for the long-term model that gives you price and depending on the business unit records, etcetera, that can provide perspectives on how we expect to be able to drive benefits for the drivers between -- the drivers of our revenue growth on a long-term basis. So hopefully, that will help as well. It's up certainly significantly, right. And I think if you just look at it by line of business, mortgage has grown substantially, as Mark's talked about, because of mortgage 36 and the use of trended data across mortgage very broadly now, and that's moved up towards 50% of transactions. The government is less, right, in terms of trended information. It tends to be more point in time. Talent is virtually all trended information. And then so as the mix of our business moves, that ratio can mix a bit, it can change a bit. But generally speaking, in all of our verticals, we're driving the mix to trended data from the levels they're at today. Yes. I don't know if you follow FICO or you talked to the FICO team, but I would expect that they're going to do a price increase in 2024. You should talk to them. And if they do, we're obviously the conduit along with you and Experian to deliver that to the marketplace, and that's something that we would execute on. Yes. So we'll give you that detail when we give guidance, obviously, for 2024. But in the fourth quarter, it's similar to what it was in the third. Fair enough. The EBITDA margin was -- for Boa Vista was slightly below, it was below the Equifax average margin. And what we're expecting over time, as Mark talked about, through the investments we're making through integrating them into Equifax processes that will work to drive that margin higher. But yes, for what you saw in the footnote, the BVS margins were below the Equifax margins for the third quarter. Now as a reminder, we've owned them for about six weeks, so we'll see what happens as we move through the fourth quarter and then into 2024. I think it's an outstanding, as Mark said, largest contract we've ever signed. Just as you take a look at over the next five years it doesn't mean you're going to -- we'll generate all the revenue up to the maximum amount of the contract. So what it does is gives us the opportunity to work with states and obviously with the federal government to drive increasing revenue under the auspices of the agreement, which is extremely positive, but it is certainly in no way a guarantee of revenue at that level. And talent, I know we've said this many times, no one likes price increases. But for example, in talent, one of the things we do in other segments as we provide incentives for people to be able to get better pricing from us by moving to top of waterfall, or by selling additional products to drive growth across the broader sweat -- I'm sorry, broader suite of our entire group of products that's talent solutions like our education solutions and other solutions, and we're launching now products that support health care directly. We have staffing products. We have other products that allow people to get better pricing from Equifax while helping us drive volumes through the system. So again, we -- just like we don't like price increases, we know no one likes price increases, but we try to be balanced, and we try to structure them so that people have the opportunity to purchase the products that they want at price points that are effective for them."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor and good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we continue to face a very challenging U.S. mortgage market that weakened substantially in August and September beyond our July framework with mortgage rates moving above 7% and now approaching almost 8% over a 20 year high. Revenue in the third quarter was 1.32 billion, was up 6% on a reported basis, 6.5% on a constant currency basis, and 3.5% on an organic, constant currency basis. An adjusted EPS of $1.76 per share was up 2% versus last year. In the quarter BVS, the Brazilian credit bureau that we acquired in August had revenue of 23 million and contributed $0.02 per share to adjusted EPS, which was not in our July framework for the third quarter.  Overall, Equifax revenue of 1.32 billion was $34 million below the midpoint of the guidance we provide in July, which excluded Brazil, driven primarily by the weaker U.S. mortgage market and FX. Together, these items impacted revenue by about $28 million and adjusted EPS by about $0.10 per share. Adjusting for the mortgage markets and FX impact, revenue in the third quarter would have been just below the midpoint of our July framework, and both adjusted EPS and EBITDA margins would have exceeded the framework we provided in July.  Overall mortgage market volumes, measured based on our credit and TWN inquiry volumes, we are on the order of 650 basis points weaker than we expected in our July guidance. Mortgage rates increased substantially during the quarter, with a 100 basis point increase in the ten-year Treasury rate, driving mortgage rates to almost 7.5% in September. The mortgage volume decline negatively impacted mortgage revenue by about 22 million, and the strengthening dollar negatively impacted revenue versus our July expectations by about $6 million. The U.S. mortgage revenue from EWS and USIS was down about 8%, reflecting the significantly weaker mortgage market conditions. Mortgage outperformance relative to the mortgage industry volumes I referenced remains strong in both USIS at over 30% and EWS at 22%.  Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter and was up 8% excluding revenue from BVS, against a strong 20% growth last year. Non-mortgage constant dollar organic growth was up 7% versus last year with our non-mortgage growth rate strengthening 300 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Non-mortgage growth was led by EWS that was up over 11% and up 800 basis points sequentially. And USIS that was up almost 8.5% and up 50 bps sequentially. International organic non-mortgage revenue growth at 3% was slightly weaker than our expectations, principally due to lower revenue in our UK debt management business.  We had another very strong quarter in new product growth with a record 15% vitality index, which is well above our 10% long-term growth framework for NPIs. As I referenced earlier, despite the much lower than expected mortgage revenue in the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.76 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 33.1%. Excluding BVS we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.74 and adjusted EBITDA margins of 33.3%, up 60 bps sequentially, both in line with the guidance we provided in July, while absorbing the significant impact of the $22 million of lower mortgage revenue. The impact of lower mortgage revenue and FX negatively impacted adjusted EPS by about $0.10 per share. We delivered very good execution against our $210 million cloud and broader spending reduction programs, which allowed us to grow margins sequentially in the quarter despite the lower mortgage revenue. We continue to expect to deliver spending reductions of $210 million in 2023, with 120 million benefiting operating expenses and over 65 million of incremental run rate savings in 2024.  We also continue to make good progress on completing our cloud transformation with large North American customers migrating to the cloud during the quarter. We expect both USIS and Canada to complete their credit exchange cloud migrations in the first half of 2024. At the end of the quarter, about 75% of North American revenue was being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. We are convinced that our Equifax Cloud single data fabric and AI capabilities will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax in the future.  As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of 1.317 billion, adjusted EPS of $1.77, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 34% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. This includes about 38 million of revenue from BVS, which adds about 3% to our revenue growth. We expect fourth quarter revenue will be up 10% with organic constant dollar growth of 7%, adjusted EPS to be up over 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins will expand about 300 basis points versus last year. Non-mortgage constant dollar growth is expected to be strong at about 13%, with organic growth of about 9% led by EWS which should deliver over 15% non-mortgage growth. However, excluding BVS, this framework is about $70 million below the implied fourth quarter revenue guidance of $1.35 billion at the midpoint we provided in July. The sharp decline in the mortgage market and FX drive the majority or about $60 million of this decline.  Our guidance assumes that substantially weakening trends in the U.S. mortgage market that we're currently seeing continue through the remainder of the year, and that we also see normal seasonal mortgage declines in November and December. On this basis, we're assuming U.S. mortgage credit inquiries will be down about 22% in the fourth quarter, driving a reduction in overall mortgage volumes of about 18 percentage points versus the guidance implied for the fourth quarter in our July framework. This negatively impacts mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter by about $47 million. At these levels, U.S. mortgage activity will be down an unprecedented more than 50% from 2015 to 29 averages, which we consider to be normal mortgage market levels.  We expect FX to negatively impact revenue in the fourth quarter versus our July guidance by $13 million. The net impact of the $70 million reduction in revenue is driving the reduction in EPS and EBITDA margin from our original fourth quarter goals of $2 a share and 36%, respectively. The second half of 2023 has clearly been very challenging as the accelerated decline in the U.S. mortgage market in August and September, as well as FX negatively impacted revenue by almost $90 million. Like many, we are struggling to forecast the bottom of the mortgage market in this unprecedented environment of fed rate increases, driving mortgage rates up over 2X to 20 year highs in such a short 20-month time frame.  Outside the unprecedented mortgage market decline, we are executing extremely well. As I'll cover in the remainder of my remarks, we are delivering accelerated non mortgage growth, executing on our cloud customer migrations and overall cost plans, outperforming our expectations for new products. and adding new EWS record partnerships and records at an accelerated pace adding over 25 million records since the beginning of last year. In both our mortgage and non-mortgage businesses, we are continuing to outgrow our underlying markets.  Before I cover our business unit results in more detail, I wanted to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and consumer. Outside of the challenging U.S. mortgage market, the U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at record historic levels with low unemployment and about 10 million open jobs against about 5 million people who are looking for jobs. Excess consumer savings built up during the pandemic still exist, however, have declined to the lowest levels since the second quarter of 2020, particularly amongst lower and middle income households. Credit card utilization is increasing, credit card delinquency rates for prime consumers which represent about 20% of the market are stable but are above pre-pandemic levels in less than 1%. However, subprime borrower delinquencies which have been increasing over the past year are now above pre-pandemic levels and approaching the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010.  Auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 20% of the market, are also stable but above pre-pandemic levels and still well below 1%. Delinquencies for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels as well above levels that we saw in 2009 and 2010. And any customer credit tightening has largely been in fintech and subprime, which started over a year ago. Overall, still a solid market for Equifax outside of mortgage and hiring. When consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current on their financial obligations.  Turning to Slide 5, overall workforce solutions revenue was up 3% in the quarter, a return to growth, which is a very positive sign as we look towards 2024. Strong TWN record growth, the positive impact of 2023 price actions, and strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of mortgage trended data drove a strong 22 points of mortgage outperformance again in the quarter. EWS had another very strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 2 million current records added to the TWN database. EWS closed the third quarter with 163 million current records on 121 million unique individuals or SSNs, which was up 12% and 9% respectively versus last year. Total records, both current and historic are now over 640 million and we now have current records on over 70% of U.S. non-farm payroll and over 50% of the 220 million people in the U.S. with employment and income records relevant to the TWN database. The EWS team has acquired over 11 million records so far in 2023 that are driving top line growth and will significantly benefit Verifier Revenue Growth when the U.S. mortgage and white-collar hiring markets recover.  During the quarter, we signed agreements with four new payroll processors that will deliver records in the fourth quarter in 2024 and over the past three years, we've added partnerships with 27 payroll processors. As a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers from our employer services customer relationships. The remaining 50% are contributed through partnerships with payroll processors, HR software companies, pension administrators, and other relationships. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporating both current and historical records with about 50% of our third quarter verification services revenue, as well as about 50% of our mortgage verification services revenue coming from products that include historical records.  Turning to Slide 6, Workforce Solutions delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth of 11%, a return to double-digit revenue growth with a growth rate up about 800 basis points sequentially. And as a reminder, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 40% in the third quarter last year, which of course, was a very tough comp. Verification services non-mortgage revenue, which represents just under 70% of Verifier Revenue, delivered 11% growth versus last year in the quarter. This was also against a very challenging 72% non-mortgage growth comp last year. In government, we saw a continued very strong growth with revenue up 23% compared to over 90% revenue growth last year in the third quarter. Government revenue was slightly lower than our expectations due to timing of Medicaid redetermination volumes. We continue to expect that EWS will capture significant volume from these redeterminations as they complete prior to the end of the second quarter of next year.  During the quarter, we signed a contract extension to provide income verification to the U.S. centers for Medicare and Medicaid services as a part of a contract valued at up to $1.2 billion over the next five years. This contract is the largest in Equifax's history and extends our services via healthcare.gov for ACA related determinations while allowing workforce solutions to continue to work to penetrate the state level Medicaid verification services market. Also during the quarter, USDA's Food and Nutrition Service awarded a national contract to Equifax Workforce Solutions to provide verification services in support of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. The award is for $38 million in the base year, which we began on September 30th with a potential total contract value of $190 million. These large new EWS government contracts reflect the uniqueness of the TWN data supporting the delivery of social services at the U.S. federal, state, and local level.  These new contracts give us confidence in strong future EWS growth in the large 4 billion TAM for our government vertical. We expect to see accelerating sequential growth in our government vertical in the fourth quarter, driven by growth from CMS Medicaid Redeterminations, ACA open enrollment volume, further state government penetration, and pricing from state contract renewals, as well as revenue from the new SNAP agreement with the USDA.  Talent Solutions was up 6% in the quarter versus a very strong over 110% growth last year in the third quarter from record levels of U.S. hiring. As a reminder, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white-collar workers, including technology, professional services, healthcare, and financial services, which has seen a greater reduction in hiring activity and broader hiring freezes and about 10% decline that the BLS reported in the third quarter through August. We outperformed the hiring market by about 20 percentage points in the quarter as we delivered new digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and pricing. Employer services revenue of 118 million was up 13%, driven by growth in our I9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring, as well as growth in our ACA business. In the fourth quarter, we expect overall employer services revenue to decline slightly as growth in I9 and onboarding is offset by declines in ERC revenue as the U.S. government has suspended processing new ERC claims.  Earlier this year, we announced the launch of PeopleHQ, a workforce solutions cloud native solution that brings together multiple best in class employer compliance services and a single unified customer experience. PeopleHQ will help companies of all sizes access EWS employer services, including income verification, I9, and ACA from our new self-service portal. Since the launch of PeopleHQ in the first quarter, EWS has onboarded about 45,000 companies, which also delivers new records for TWN. Workforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.9% was up 140 basis points versus last year, but down 60 basis points from the second quarter from the mortgage market decline. The EWS team continue to perform very well despite the macro headwinds from mortgage and U.S. hiring, outperforming their underlying markets from strong TWN record growth, penetration, new products, and price. As shown on Slide 7, USIS revenue of 426 million was up over 7% and down slightly from our expectations due to the impact of the much weaker mortgage market. USIS delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth of about 8% in the quarter. USIS mortgage revenue was up 4% and outperformed the mortgage credit inquiries that were down 29% by 33 points. The strong pricing environment that we discussed in July drove very strong outperformance. At 101 million, mortgage revenue was 24% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up a very strong 10% total and up 5% organically. During the quarter, online revenue had strong double-digit growth in commercial and banking and lending from strong identity and fraud revenue and mid-single-digit growth in auto and insurance, offset by declines in telco and direct-to-consumer. USIS also saw a strong double-digit growth in count from very good new business and NPI performance.  Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business had revenue of 51 million that was down just under 1%. In marketing, declines in pre-screen marketing revenue in the quarter that were consistent with declines in the first half, more than offset nice revenue growth from our IXI consumer wealth data business. In pre-screen, we continue to see weakness with the smaller FIs and Fintechs in the subprime space, offset by growth with larger FIs. Within risk and account reviews, we did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but we have not seen a meaningful increase in risk-based portfolio reviews that are typical during challenging economic periods.  USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter with revenue of $56 million of 12% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and our indirect channels. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.2% in the quarter and slightly below the 35% we had guided from the impact of weaker mortgage market as well as higher technology spend as we migrate customers to the new cloud data fabric. Todd and USIS team are on offense as they work to complete their cloud transformation and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capability to deliver new products and drive share gains. In the third quarter, USIS onboarded a new large FI customer to our new cloud platform, which you expect to deliver share gains moving forward.  Turning to Slide 8, international revenue was 316 million, up 12% in constant currency and up 3% in organic constant currency, and below the 4.5% growth we had guided to in July due to the greater decline in our European debt collection revenue than we expected. Europe local currency revenue was down 2% in the quarter. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was up a very strong 8% in the quarter, a very good performance offset by the weaker than expected 17% decline in our UK debt management business. We expect Europe to deliver almost 10% growth in the fourth quarter from continued strength in the CRA business and a return to growth in our debt management business as we lacked difficult comps from last year. Latin America, local currency revenue, including Brazil, was up a very strong 21% comping off a very strong 34% growth in the third quarter of last year driven by double digit growth in Argentina and Paraguay and from new product introductions and pricing actions. We expect LATAM to deliver strong double digit revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. Canada and Asia Pacific both delivered low single digit growth in the quarter as we expected. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.3% were up 210 basis points sequentially. Excluding Brazil adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.8% were up 260 basis points and in line with our expectations. The improvement was driven by revenue growth and good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans by Lisa and our international team.  Turning to Slide 9, in the third quarter overall non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth grew a strong 11% with organic growth of 7%, both inside our long-term framework. Positively, this was up 300 basis points sequentially. The acceleration in organic revenue growth was driven by strong 11% EWS non-mortgage growth and improvement of about 800 basis points sequentially. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect non-mortgage revenue growth to be about 13% with organic growth of about 9% above the levels we delivered in the third quarter. The acceleration organic growth is expected to be led again by EWS with growth of over 15% driven by their government and talent businesses.  Turning to Slide 10, new product introductions leveraging our differentiated data and new AFX cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. In the quarter, we delivered a record 15% vitality again led by very strong performances in EWS and Latin America. EWS non-mortgage VI in the quarter was over 25%, a very strong performance. And in the third quarter, about 85% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the EFX Cloud. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver vitality index of approximately 14% in 2023, which is about 400 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality index goal. Importantly second half USIS VI is expected to be up about a 100 bps higher than first half as we are closer to cloud completion and able to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure in USIS for innovation and new products. This is broadly positive momentum for 2024. On the right side of this slide we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud and AI in driving innovation that increase -- that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial products while driving Equifax's top line. Turning to Slide 11, we're very excited to have closed the Boa Vista AC acquisition in early August and welcome the Boa Vista team to Equifax. We're focused on driving growth in Brazil and expanding BVS's capabilities by deploying our cloud-based decisioning and analytical products, as well as expanding in new verticals like identity and fraud. In the third quarter for the period after our acquisition closed on August 7th, EFX Brazil delivered revenue of $23 million and was accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.02 per share. Going forward, Brazil will be included in our Latin American region for reporting, and as a reminder, we expect Brazil to deliver approximately 160 million in run rate revenue to Equifax to be accretive to adjusted EPS in its first year. And now I'd like to turn over to John to provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year guidance. John. Thanks, John. Wrapping up, Equifax delivered on its earnings guidance in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS within our guidance range despite the challenging U.S. mortgage market. While the mortgage market was down significantly again, our non-mortgage businesses delivered strong constant dollar organic growth of 7% and overall growth of 11%, including BVS. Importantly, EWS returned a strong 11% non-mortgage growth and USIS delivered a strong over 8% non-mortgage quarter. We expect our strong third quarter constant dollar non-mortgage revenue of 11% to accelerate in the fourth quarter to about 13%, including EWS, above 15% and international, including BVS at about 20%. The breadth and depth of our non-mortgage businesses, which account for about 81% of Equifax revenue in the third quarter and execution against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction program, allowed us to deliver against our earnings guidance despite the decline in the mortgage market. While it's early to provide 2024 guidance, I wanted to give you a perspective on how we plan to operate in 2024 in what could be another challenging year from a macro perspective as we exit 2023 with U.S. mortgage volumes at historically low levels with record mortgage rates. We remain committed to executing against our EFX 2025 strategy with a focus on things we can control. As we move towards 2024, we're focused on: first, continuing above-market non-mortgage growth inside our 8% to 12% long-term framework and outperforming the underlying mortgage market. Second, substantially completing our cloud transformation in 2024 with revenue from our new cloud platforms approaching 90% by the end of the year, which will be a big milestone to allow our team to pivot to fully focus on innovation and growth. Third, as we complete our cloud investments, we expect CAPEX to move towards our long-term goal of 7% of revenue in 2025 and our CAPEX spend to pivot from maintenance and cloud investments to innovation and new products.  Aligned with our cloud technology completion, we will continue to execute against the cloud and broader spending reduction program we announced in February, which we expect to deliver $65 million of 2023 carryover next year with additional cost savings next year as we complete the cloud. Our 14% vitality performance in the second half of this year gives us strong momentum as we move towards 2024. We will continue our focus on new product innovation using our single data fabric, cloud capabilities, and AI to bring new models and scores to the market, including a focus on bringing EWS and USIS assets much closer together with a long-term annual vitality goal of 10%. We'll focus on adding new ERB records to further strengthen the TWN data set, including the acquisition of traditional W-2 pension and 1099 records.  And last, we'll continue to look for financially attractive bolt-on M&A aligned with our strategic priorities around differentiated data, strengthening EWS, and identity and fraud. Despite the challenges of an unprecedented decline in the U.S. mortgage market, Equifax demonstrated in 2022 and 2023 that we can grow revenue as we outperform our underlying markets over the last two years from above-market non-mortgage growth, outperforming the mortgage market, vertical penetration, new product innovation, adding new records to TWN, and pricing. We are committed to delivering on our long-term framework of 8% to 12% revenue growth and 50 basis points of annual margin expansion as well as our medium-term goal of 39% EBITDA margins. And when the mortgage market recovers, we are poised to generate accelerated above-market growth and margin expansion from investments we have made in our cloud technology, new products, TWN record additions, and expanding our unique data assets. During the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes, Manav, we believe that we have multiple levers in both mortgage and non-mortgage. I'll focus on mortgage because that's your question, to continue to outperform the underlying market. And you've seen us do that over an extended period of time. And we'll talk about USIS and EWS, if you want, because that's a mortgage. In USIS, they obviously have the ability to deliver price, and we expect price to be a part of the levers for 2024. There's new product rollouts inside of USIS. For example, if you recall earlier this year, we rolled out our new mortgage credit report that includes those NC+ attributes. That's going to be a positive for us to outperform the underlying market. And then if you go to EWS, you've got the same two levers there plus more, obviously. Price is an opportunity as we have more records, and we can deliver more value to the mortgage customers. We've got a big focus in more leverage in EWS around new products. You've seen us roll out new solutions like a year ago, mortgage 36 with 36 months' worth of history. So new products will be a continued lever for us in the mortgage space. And of course, records growing records double digit in the quarter, the new payroll processors that we're adding in the fourth quarter and next year that we signed up during the quarter, and of course, our pipeline of new records those drive higher hit rates in the EWS mortgage business, which we expect that to continue going forward. And then the last for EWS quite uniquely, is ability to drive penetration, meaning more usage of the income and employment data inside the mortgage process. And as we've talked before, we don't have -- every customer doesn't use our solutions. Some still use manual verifications and we're driving them to using our verified solution. So yes, we've got confidence about our ability. I wouldn't characterize that we have new levers, but we've got a lot of focus around them. And I think -- when you think about EWS and USIS, and we mentioned it earlier in our prepared comments, as USIS completes the cloud, and of course, EWS is already there, we think the ability to have each business bring new products to market will continue, but the ability to bring solutions that combine the two businesses, data assets for mortgage and non-mortgage with USIS getting into the cloud is another year for us in the future. I think first on the 39, we tried to be clear, our goal hasn't changed. As you know, for a couple of years, we carried a goal of 2025 for 39% against $7 billion of revenue. Clearly, that $7 billion is going to be pushed out with the mortgage market decline and we wanted to be transparent today that we view that as being post-2025. But our focus on 39% hasn't changed. We have a path to 39%. In the future, it's going to be beyond 2025 and then post 39%, we still see between operating leverage in the businesses, the strong margins in EWS, the ability to grow 50 basis points per year post that 39%. I think the first question, John, it was 19%. In the third quarter, that will be lower in the fourth quarter for obvious reasons on the percent of revenue, Andrew from mortgage. On the government one, maybe just a couple of comments on government, and I'll get to redeterminations and John can jump in. We've got a lot of positive levers in government. I hope you saw Andrew had noted that those two large contracts, which we alluded to in July, meaning that we talked about some visibility that we had of new contracts, $1.2 billion and $190 million USDA contracts give us some visibility and momentum in our government vertical, not only in the fourth quarter but also for 2024. Those contracts as well as others also give us the ability to continue our expansion at the state level. As you know, our government vertical inside of EWS is call it roughly $500 million run rate business, but in a $4 billion TAM. So there's a lot of opportunity to add new states and new agencies at the state levels and you might imagine we have a deal pipeline of customers or agencies that we're working on adding at the state level, which is a part of our visibility for fourth quarter and into 2024 for the government vertical. And in particular, the CMS contract is -- and the USDA contract actually are both helpful in the addition of more state-level relationships.  On redeterminations, it's clearly been a very challenging forecasting about when will states actually activate those redeterminations. We saw a strong volume of that in the third quarter. We expect that to continue in the fourth. And then as you point out, in first and second next year, there'll be continued redeterminations because of the time line is to really complete those, I believe, at the end of the second quarter. So we work closely on those, but it has been a bit more challenging to forecast those. Anything you add, John? Yes, the 20% we were pleased with the market -- the business is up 6%, the talent vertical and from our measure, the BLS market was down 10%. We think the white collar market was down double that. So that's how you get close to double that. So that's how you get to the 20 points of outperformance. And there isn't really -- I wouldn't characterize a single lever that's really driving that outperformance. It's really similar in all our businesses. In talent, we've got the ability to drive price, which we do every year. We expect to do that as we go into 2024 in the talent vertical like our others because of the value we're delivering. In talent, quite uniquely, we have the ability to drive penetration. That's a big multibillion dollar TAM in a business that's roughly $400 million at run rate. So there's a lot of customers in talent that are still doing manual verifications of employment history that our 640 million jobs that we have in our database are just immensely valuable from a speed and productivity standpoint. So that's a lever in talent that we think is quite durable along with price.  Product is another big one. You've seen us roll out almost every quarter, a couple of new products from EWS and the talent vertical really to get more narrowly focused around products that match kind of job categories. We rolled out an hourly solution, I think, last quarter for hourly workers to try to drive some growth there. So new products are clearly a growth. And then the addition of records. And as you know, with the 50 attributes we get every pay period, we get job title and 75 million people a year or roughly that number change jobs in the United States. So having those new jobs from our record additions every pay period is a very valuable asset that just drives higher hit rates, which drives revenue going forward. So we have a lot of confidence in our ability to outperform the underlying talent market, just like we do with the rest of our markets because of those levers. Yes, I'll start and let John jump in. We've been consistent really. There's been a phenomena that's a major change, a meaningful change in the mortgage market over the last, call it, 12 to 18 months, where when rates were starting to increase consumers did a lot more shopping and that benefited our USIS business. Meaning that the consumers would go to multiple mortgage originators and as you know, as a part of that process, when someone applies online, the first thing a mortgage originator will do is determine is that a consumer that can qualify for the loan they're trying to get, meaning are they going to invest that 5,000 or 6,000 or actually 7,000 of COGS in that mortgage process. So there's an inquiry that goes into or a pull on the USIS side. And that's why inquiries versus originations or closed loans have really separated. There's been an increase in originations. And we expect that to continue with these high interest rates. Consumers, they'll be more deliberate around their shopping behavior. And that's why there's a positive, if you will, for USIS in inquiries or credit polls in this environment where EWS typically in the back end of the mortgage process in -- really around closed loans. Maybe just one more point, John, as a reminder, as you know, we get mortgage originations because we have the credit file on every consumer. So we see the actual new mortgage originations, but they're typically on a what five to six-month lag. So between that five to six-month lag, we're forecasting based on MBA data, based on our own tracking, based on our own run rates, we use multiple inputs to try to forecast those originations. We obviously have been challenged by that in this current environment with interest rates increasing. But we have a lot of data around mortgage originations. Yes, for sure. There's no question. Look, it's a big business. It's dealing in multiple verticals. In some regards, these -- like talent in government or I would still characterize them as fairly new verticals for us at scale, we've only been large in those verticals in the last couple of years. And you've got some macro impacts certainly in talent, leave mortgage side, which we talked about a bunch, but the hiring market is obviously under some pressure, particularly in white collar in the U.S. And we've tried to forecast that, and we're going to try to be more conservative or more balanced whatever word you want to use around that vertical. Same with government. There's a lot of moving parts there. I would say the most complex for us or the one we've been challenged by is the redeterminations. Outside of that, we have pretty clear visibility about adding new customers, adding new clients, new product rollouts, pricing actions and government, that is pretty dialed in. And I think the other -- if you think about 2023, both of those businesses had really, really, really strong 2022. So we're comping off very strong years, which is great because we're driving more penetration, more product, more price, and we had to look forward to where we're going to take those businesses. And while we've been off a little bit, we're really pleased with the growth of those businesses. Those are -- they both delivered strong growth in the quarter. You've seen accelerated growth in non-mortgage and EWS from second quarter. We expect that non-mortgage verifier growth to accelerate again in fourth quarter, which gives us really positive momentum going into 2024. But short answer to your question about, are we going to be more balanced around how we forecast there, for sure. Yes. No change from what we talked about in July. In July, we tried to talk about the manual work we were doing for customers when we didn't have records. And that got I think somewhat misconstrued in the marketplace. We're not seeing an impact from competition in our mortgage business or any other businesses. We tried to be clear about that in July, and I'll be clear again today. We're well aware of what our competitors' data records that they have and what they don't have. To me, a big proof point about our competitiveness is our ability to continue to add new partnerships. We added four in the quarter. We added, I think, 27 in the last couple of years. We're growing our records. That's really, I think, a proof point of the strength of our ability to deliver solutions to our partners and execute for them. And they want to be partnered with Equifax. So I think that's a really important metric for us going forward. Yes. Maybe at the kind of the macro level about a year ago, we talked about and we continue to talk about subprime really got tightened up. So that happened over the last, call it, three, four, five quarters. That's starting to bottom out because we're comping off really sharp declines from last year as we go into fourth quarter. But subprime has clearly pulled back. A combination of concern around that consumer base being more challenged, not from unemployment, but really from inflation. And we talked earlier that we've seen some delinquencies increase there. And as an old card guy from my prior life, when delinquencies go up, you typically will pull back on originations or be more deliberate around originations, meaning you want to make sure you're finding the consumers that can really afford that financial product. Prime is still fairly strong. The consumers are working, they've had some wage growth, while they've been impacted by inflation. We haven't seen much impact there. And would you add anything, John? Yes. I think as John mentioned, and we did earlier, we had the $65 million of carryover from our $275 million program this year. The bulk of that, as you know, is from cloud completion and cloud cost savings. And as we go through 2024 we mentioned, and we'll give guidance in Feb on that, but we'll have additional cloud cost savings as we complete migrations next year. As we said, we expect to complete USIS and Canada and other of our international platforms. And as a reminder, we're carrying double cost today in those environments where we have a cloud environment we're paying for, and then we also have a legacy environment. When we complete the migrations, we shut down the legacy. So that will be the incremental savings which we expect to have in 2024 and 2025, and we'll give guidance on that. Beyond those kind of savings, we're going to keep our belt tight in 2024. We're going to want to continue to invest in the right places, but I'd characterize that as we're going to be balanced around it given the environment. We try to forecast what the originations are as mentioned earlier. We know what actual originations are like, a five to six-month lag. Between that time frame, we try to forecast. If you're referring to like NBA and some of the other forecasts, if you look back over the last two years, three years, four years, five years, they're consistently long. It's a hard thing to forecast, and we just try to use our best data on it. And then we also factor in our current run rates on originations. So that's the way that we're forecasting to try to get more current because MBA is done on a survey basis. I think they survey like half of the mortgage originators in order to get that data. Ours is actual originations on a lag and then our current forecast based on what we're seeing in current time frame. We don't think so. The power of instant data, and in this case, we're talking about income and employment data is super valuable to every mortgage originator. They want to make sure that they have accurate data. We get it directly from the company every two weeks on the consumer. We deliver it instantly. In this environment of more shopping, a mortgage originator that's investing in a consumer, they want to make sure that they close that loan as they get down the path of delivering it. So we don't see a change in our ability to deliver new solutions, meaning products to the industry. Obviously, with more records, we're going to drive higher hit rates that happens really because we're getting the inquiries from our customers for all their applicants. And then we still believe that we have pricing power going forward because of the uniqueness of our data set, the alternative for our customers is to do it -- the mortgage customers to do the verification manually, which is very challenging, meaning getting a company on the phone to verify the income is very hard to do and it takes time, and that's labor and also time. So speed and productivity and accuracy is the value we deliver. Yes. Go forward, you got to kind of talk time frames. When you think out the next couple of quarters, it doesn't feel to us or to me like there's going to be a lot of change, meaning it's a fairly -- outside of the mortgage market, obviously, let's leave that aside. That's obviously super challenging and really unprecedented what's happening with interest rates. But when you have people working and very low unemployment rates, generally, they're able to pay their bills. When they pay their bills, delinquencies stay generally low, and then you have the ability -- our customers have confidence in continuing to extend credit through loans and other solutions to those consumers. Subprime has been challenged for a year. That's generally subprime is with the fintechs. Most of the big banks don't do subprime business. And that's been challenged for a year. And we're actually, as I mentioned earlier, starting to comp against fairly low levels. I would expect subprime to stay high as we go through 2024 because those consumers are really more challenged, not around being unemployed, but around inflation is still pressuring them. But the big metric that I always think about and you should, too, in my view, is unemployment. So back to your question about 2024, give me your forecast for unemployment next year. Is it going to go up, down or sideways, if you think unemployment is going to spike or go up, which I don't think it will in this environment with 10 million open jobs and only 5 million people looking right now, that's a pretty good environment to go into 2024 in kind of the core elements of our business outside of mortgage. Yes. Remember that the redeterminations were suspended during COVID. So they didn't happen over the last couple of years. Once President Biden lifted the COVID pandemic rule or requirement, these redeterminations went back into place. So it's really the completion of the annual verifications are happening in this 12-month time frame in third, fourth and first and second quarter next year. Post second quarter, they'll have the requirement to do the annual redeterminations that are a requirement of the programs. So there may be some elements of comp that from a timing standpoint, but we don't expect it to be meaningful. First off, we don't see any share shifts, Jeff. If there were, they would be in the outperformance. And remember, we still have a grounding in originations. As I mentioned, you have to forecast originations. And there's MBA which a lot of you look at and we look at it, too, is really diverge from what we're seeing in originations. And remember, we see originations on two sides of our business. We see it in in the credit business in USIS, and we see it in EWS and then we get actual originations on a five to six-month lag when they actually get posted to the credit file after the mortgage is closed. So we have really meaningful data. I think we were trying to highlight that the divergence we're seeing from some of those industry forecasts have just become larger in recent times, my view is my personal view because of the rapid change in rates. I think rates went up overnight or the last 48 hours by 50 bps. That's not in a forecast that MBA did a month ago, but we can see what's happening this afternoon. 15 to 20 years. Yes. We're only, I don't know, 60 days in of having it under the ownership, but pleased to have it in. The market from our perspective is growing kind of high single digit. That's why we like the market down there in Brazil. We're very active in driving the integration of getting our new products and solutions there. We're going to move them to the Equifax Cloud over the next number of quarters to get them on our new cloud environment. We're going to bring down our large platforms like Interconnect, which they don't really have a version of that as well as Ignite, our analytics platform, which will really drive some strong competitiveness with Serasa Experian in the marketplace. The business performance, I would say, is probably lagging a bit that market performance, primarily through the integration. This is -- it was a complex integration for a small publicly traded company to go through the process. It was a long process to go through. Gosh, it was almost seven to eight months of the process to do the take private, but we're energized around the future of the business and focused on getting this integration complete and getting into new solutions and to help them drive their top line. I'll jump in, and John can dive in behind me. First, on the last half of your question, we would expect the inquiries to be stronger than originations in this high mortgage rate environment. You call it weaker, but if you're a consumer and in many cases, stretching to get a mortgage for a home that you want to buy because prices are still very high you do a lot of shopping around when there's a high interest rate environment. I don't think that's going to change next year. I think we're still going to see that environment, which certainly will benefit USIS with more credit pulls in that shopping environment. You want to add, John, on the forecast. From origination? And then against that, and we'll give guidance in February. But against that down 15%, we would have our levers in both businesses around price, product penetration to deliver the outperformance against that market. Yes. I don't think we give the actual revenue numbers, John. And I would say we don't expect real change in the fourth quarter from that third quarter run rate. We haven't. But again, let me just be a little more deliberate for example, like in subprime auto, there's been some pressure there from originations because they're more deliberate around that subprime consumer being challenged. And then that subprime consumer at that higher interest rate even in parts is sometimes challenged to qualify for that. But broadly, no, when you think sometimes a small portion of the financial services industry, most of it is near in prime. And higher interest rates have not impacted auto originations or card originations in the near prime and prime space like they have in mortgage. Mortgage is just a big ticket item that had a massive impact on the rates over such a short time frame. And versus what time frame, they've grown over the last three, four, five years really because of consumer behavior as well as more -- the majority of mortgage applications happen online today, which is a phenomenon that is very different from what it was five years ago, which drives more credit polls. Over the last year, they're fairly consistent, meaning it hasn't changed in the last year, but they're clearly up from five, four years ago, even three years ago. Sure. First, I'm not sure when you talk about history, I've only been here five years, but over the past five years, price has always been a lever for Equifax and, I believe, for our competitors. I think it's one of the things that data analytics companies have is if you have more valuable data, you're able to charge more for it. Price, as you point out, we really execute two ways, pure price, meaning we do annual price increases. And we also get price through delivering new products with either more historical data or data combinations that deliver more value to our customers. And remember, our sale is an ROI sale. So with regards to the 7% to 10% organic, which is the subset of our 8% to 12%, if you go back to our Investor Day from a couple of years ago, there's charts on each business where we talk about the levers to deliver that 7% to 10%. And as a reminder, the 7% to 10% is really driven by EWS being north of that and International and USIS being south of that. And if you think about we have levers that are fairly balanced to deliver that 7% to 10%. You've got a few points over the long term of market in GDP. You've got a few points of price. You've got a few points each of these are kind of a couple -- 2 points to 3 points, a couple of points of product driving that top line. And then you've got penetration in new verticals that we move into. And that's kind of how you walk up. And then in EWS uniquely, we get a couple of points from records. So I think 2, 3, 4 points from record additions over the long term that drive our revenue. And as you know, on the records is because we're already getting inquiries and when we add a new record to the data set we monetize. So that drives the revenue growth. So I wouldn't characterize price as being disproportionate in -- versus the other levers that we have, and it's been fairly consistent over the time I've been here about how we've executed it. It's probably up slightly from a year ago, but it's up meaningfully from three, four, five years ago. And it's really -- as you may recall, Toni, and we talked about it, as we've moved EWS to the cloud, call it 18 months ago almost, it really opened up the window for them number one, to deliver new products; and number two, a lot of those new products are using trended or historical data, which was more challenging to do pre-cloud. So -- and you've seen EWS' Vitality Index, which kind of pre-cloud was in the 3% to 5% range, something like that, probably at the low end. And now as we talked about earlier this morning is north of 20. And all those products, either our data combinations or predominantly our trended historical data. And if you think about it, just quite -- it's common sense, Mark's income today is very valuable as a data element, but Mark's income over the last 36 months is even more valuable if it's going up. It's a very important indicator if it was going down. And then if it's stable, it's an important indicator. So that's the value that we're able to deliver in that massive historical data set we have. And we would expect that 50% to move up, but it's probably up 20 points in the last three or four years. Yes. Remember, that's an extension of an existing contract. So we've had a contract for five-plus years and maybe longer with CMS. It's certainly larger and it will roll in both at the federal and then at the state level as we go through fourth quarter in 2024 and 2025 and beyond. So George, I'm not sure what you mean by in-sourcing or I think you used the terms we provided evidence. Are you referring to our comments in July about the manual work we were doing for customers that was where we did not have records? And that was the discussion we had back in July, and it was around where we were doing the manual efforts for our customers and a very small operation in Iowa, where we did not have the records. And we talked about the fact that I was moving in house. We haven't seen any evidence of mortgage originators shifting from using our instant solution to doing it themselves. So that has not been a dialogue from Equifax. Yes, for sure. That's how we're growing our business because they're using more of our solutions. We deliver productivity and we deliver speed and accuracy. So that's fundamental. We see no trends in any of the verticals of where they're going back to manual what you're seeing in the business. That's how we're delivering the double-digit growth in the quarter and the double-digit growth we expect in the fourth quarter of -- one of those levers is more conversions of existing manual effort to using our instant solution. Yes. Do you want to talk about talent or exclude talent from that, too? Well, okay. So you're talking about like in -- and you want to leave mortgage out and focus on card and P loans and auto or do you want to talk mortgage to, I'm just trying to figure out which part of verification you want to cover. Non-mortgage, nongovernment talent. Yes. So we haven't seen sensitivity to our customers around pricing in any of those verticals. Because of the value that it delivers, you got to be obviously clear that we're balanced around pricing, but the customers are using our solution because of the productivity and accuracy and then the instant access to the information as well as the scale of the data set. We didn't talk much on the call about our ability to continue to add records. And we're approaching 70% of nonfarm payroll and over 50% of kind of working Americans, including 1099 and income-producing Americans, including pension, that data set is super valuable in all those verification markets. And -- as you know, we also have a big focus on adding new products, which is exhibited by the Vitality Index, which a lot of that vitality -- actually, most of that vitality is in verification, is really delivering new solutions that help our customers expedite or complete the transactions using our Instant data. Yes. Look, cloud transformations are hard. This has been super complex and the most complex cloud transformation that we're executing is in USIS given the age of the legacy infrastructure and formats that we had. And we're clearly a few months behind, but we can see the finish line in completing it. As we said earlier, we're migrating large customers, as we speak, in the fourth quarter. Those will continue in the first quarter, and we'd expect to be complete with USIS as well as many of our international platforms in the early parts or first half of 2024. And that's a big pivot point, as you point out. When are we going to start seeing the benefits? We're starting to see it. And what we saw in EWS is what we would expect to see in USIS. And we talked earlier about EWS' ability to drive new product rollouts at a very rapid pace, well above our 10% goal at the 20% plus. We would expect USIS to grow their vitality index, which today is south of 10 and move towards 10. And I think we mentioned they've grown their vitality about 100 basis points. We also mentioned, and we've talked about it on calls really for the last four years, but in the last couple of calls, that in USIS in particular, because of the ability to deliver always-on stability, the ability to have faster data transmission and then obviously leveraging our differentiated data, we do expect in USIS to get some share gains. And that really comes forward, where we move from a tertiary position to a second or primary position. And we had one large FI in the U.S., which is where USIS is, obviously, that's making that move with us because of the cloud. So we would expect more of those to come forward as we complete the cloud in 2024 and then really between share gains and new product rollouts that to help drive USIS' growth rates in 2024 and 2025 and beyond. No. When you talk about share gains, it's what you would think a share gain is, is where we're moving from secondary to primary or tertiary to secondary because of the cloud. And having the most advanced technology, we think, is an advantage. That's one of the reasons we embarked on this is at our gut, we believe, to be a great data analytics company, a great technology company. And when you overlay the digital macro of our customers doing the vast majority of their transactions with their consumers online, you have to delivered 99 [ph] to stability. You can't do that in the legacy environment. You can only do with cloud, and you have to have that for data transmission. So we think that's going to advantage Equifax going forward. And then you lay on top of it, you'd be able to roll out new solutions more quickly and more of them. That's going to be advantaged to Equifax to become a more important partner that will drive us up from those secondary positions that could be 20% or 30% of the volume to the primary positions, which could be 60%, 70%, 80%. And that's really what we have in front of us from the cloud investment, and we would expect those benefits to roll the USIS. And one last point that we mentioned is getting USIS cloud native will also allow us to do more between EWS and USIS. That was hard pre-cloud in two legacy environments with different data sets that are in different data environments. As you know, we went to a single data fabric and having them both in the cloud, that's going to be another gear for us going forward to have data combination solutions between USIS and EWS that was really hard to do before. And of course, only we can do that between credit data and the other differentiated data in USIS in combination with the income and employment data that's really only Equifax."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 2Q 2023 earnings conference call. Also, we\u2019ll be making certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full-year 2023 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk Factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in our financial results section of the financial info tab at our IR website. In the second quarter Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $17.5 million or $0.10 per share. This charge is for costs principally incurred to reduce additional head counts in 2023 as we realign our business functions in advance of completing our cloud transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, as well as adjusted EPS. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Trevor. Good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we executed well in the second quarter against a challenging mortgage and hiring markets, while delivering on our 2023 financial objectives. We continued to outperform our underlying markets with broad-based 6% non-mortgage growth against a tough 22% comp last year. We continued strong mortgage outperformance in a challenging market and very strong new product growth with a record 14% vitality index. We also executed well against the $200 million cloud and broad-based spending reduction program we announced in February and delivered 350 basis points of sequential margin expansion in the quarter. Globally, with the exception of the U.S. mortgage and hiring markets, we continue to see good customer demand across our consumer \u2013 good customer demand across our consumer, commercial and government lines of business. However, the U.S. mortgage market weakened relative to our expectations as we moved through the latter portions of the second quarter when mortgage rates moved above 7%, which will impact our results in the second half. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.71 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.7%, both above the guidance we provided in April. Execution against our cloud and broader spending reduction programs was also very strong and drove the 350 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Revenue at $1.318 billion was close to the midpoint of guidance with USIS and International delivering strong quarters, both above our expectations. EWS non-mortgage revenue at up 4% was below our expectations, but off a very strong 52% comp last year, principally due to the weaker hiring market that impacted our talent solutions and onboarding businesses. EWS had outstanding operational execution in the quarter, delivering a new product vitality index of 25% and expanded current twin records by 12% to 161 million records, a growth of 5 million records sequentially. EWS also had strong cost management as they fully operational their new cloud capabilities, delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and stronger than our expectations. USIS had an outstanding quarter and delivered almost 6% revenue growth, much stronger than our expectations. Total non-mortgage revenue grew 8%, led by 9% growth in our B2B online and 10% growth in consumer solutions and adjusted EBITDA margins of 36% were also stronger than our expectations, expanding over 300 basis points sequentially. Total U.S. mortgage revenue from both USIS and EWS was down about 13% or 24 points better than the 37% market decline from pricing actions, new products, records and penetration. We continue to see stronger than expected consumer shopping behavior in these higher interest rate environments. So the weaker mortgage market we saw in June had a much smaller impact on USIS than in EWS, where their mortgage activity is more aligned with closed loans. International delivered 7% growth in constant currency, also stronger than our expectations with double digit growth in Latin America and high single digit growth in Canada and the UK CRA. International delivered 24.2% adjusted EBITDA margins of 70 bips sequentially and stronger than our expectations. New product innovation leveraging our differentiated data assets and new capabilities delivered by the Equifax cloud is also executing at a very high level. Our new product vitality index of over 14% in the quarter was a record for Equifax and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal and up over 100 basis points sequentially. This is encouraging for the future and reinforces our long-term strategy of leveraging our differentiated data assets, our new cloud capabilities to deliver new solutions for our customers. We continue to make good progress on completing our cloud transformation. At the end of the quarter, over 70% of North American revenue was being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. We're convinced that our Equifax Cloud, Single Data Fabric and AI Capabilities will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. As we look to the second half, we expect the weaker than expected U.S. mortgage market that we saw in the latter half of the quarter to continue through the remainder of the year. Our updated guidance is for U.S. mortgage originations to be down about 37% for the year and about 20% in the second half, a reduction of five points from our prior full-year framework. We expect EFX mortgage origination outperformance to continue to be very strong in 2023. We're also expecting to see weaker U.S. hiring market continue through for the remainder of the year, impacting Workforce Solutions talent and onboarding businesses. However, we expect to offset the hiring weakness principally from strength in the Workforce Solutions government business and continued solid performances at USIS and international. EFX non-mortgage revenue growth was up 6%, up a very strong 22% comp last year. We expect non-mortgage revenue growth to strengthen in the second half to up 11% and up over 300 basis points sequentially relative to the first half from continued commercial execution and strong new product rollouts. Our 2023 cloud and broader cost reduction program executed well in the quarter. As we continue to operate more of Equifax in the new cloud environment, we're seeing more opportunities for efficiencies and expect an additional $10 million of spending reductions in the second half. These new actions will deliver additional run rate savings of $25 million next year. So we now expect to deliver spending reductions of $210 million this year and over $275 million in 2024. And as a reminder, the 2023 savings are weighted to the second half and will deliver $65 million of 2024 run rate benefit. We expect the weaker mortgage originations to impact our mortgage revenue by about $40 million in the second half. Despite the weakening in U.S. hiring, we expect to deliver 2023 non-mortgage revenue growth of about 8% from strong growth in EWS government, USIS non-mortgage and international and stronger NPI growth. This above 8% non-mortgage growth is against a strong 20% non-mortgage growth last year, and well within our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. The net impact of the weaker than expected mortgage market of about $40 million, partially offset by positive FX, is a reduction of our 2023 revenue guidance at the midpoint by $25 million to about $5.3 billion. The impact of the lower mortgage revenue results in a reduction of our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance at the midpoint of $0.22 to $6.98 per share. We remain focused on delivering EBITDA margins of 36% and over $2 in adjusted EPS per share in the fourth quarter, which we believe sets us up well for 2024 and beyond. In June we received shareholder approval for the acquisition of Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil. We're energized to complete this strategic and financially attractive acquisition. We expect the transaction to close in early August and are actively planning for integration and the transfer of our cloud capabilities, global platforms and products to help accelerate BVS growth. The BVS acquisition will add approximately $160 million of year one run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market, and we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to year one adjusted EPS. The guidance we provided for 2023 does not include BVS. We intend to provide more details on our expectations for BVS in 2023 at our October earnings call after we close the deal. Before I cover results in more detail, I wanted to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer. Since our April update, outside the challenging mortgage and hiring markets I already discussed, the U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. We continue to navigate a higher interest rate environment that's negatively impacting the U.S. mortgage market. Mortgage interest rates have trended upward since April and were slightly above 7% at the beginning of July and were just under 7% at the end of last week, which is clearly impacting originations. We expect mortgage originations, as I mentioned earlier, to further weaken in the second half with originations down about 37% in 2023 or 500 basis points weaker than our April framework. Broadly, consumers are still strong and working with unemployment at historically low levels, and the market is resilient with roughly 10 million open jobs against 5 million people who are looking for jobs. Inflation is starting to abate at 3% in July, which should mean we are approaching a peak in Fed interest rates. Consumers are spending and borrowing with average credit card and personal loan balances back above pre-pandemic levels. With consumers working and still leveraging pre-cloud stimulus and savings, delinquencies are still at historic low levels, and close to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Subprime DQs are the only areas of stress that we're seeing. We're also seeing credit card and personal loan utilization increases with some delinquency increases in subprime, but more broadly delinquencies are back at pre-pandemic levels, which as we all know were very low, although they remain significantly below levels we saw in the last economic event in 2009 and 2010. Auto delinquency rates for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels, as well as above levels we saw in \u201808 and \u2013 I'm sorry, \u201809 and \u201810. We believe there's been some credit tightening by our financial customers, but principally in FinTech and subprime. And looking forward, consumers holding student loans will need to resume making payments to begin in October, and we believe removing student loan payment fees will have a modest increase \u2013 a decrease on average credit scores. Beyond the weaker motors market and slowing white-collar hiring market, which had a larger impact on EWS than we anticipated in the quarter. The combination of white-collar job reductions and broad hiring freezes has reduced both background screening and onboarding activity, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect this to continue in the second half. Turning to Slide 5, Workforce Solutions revenue was down 4% in the quarter. Mortgage revenue was down 20%, but up about 3 percentage points sequentially. The decline of 20% compares to a mortgage origination down 37% as estimated by MBA based on data through May. As I mentioned, overall market performance in the latter part of the quarter weakened relative to our expectations, resulting in lower mortgage revenue than we expected in our April framework. Strong record growth, the positive impact of 2023 price actions, and strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of our Mortgage 36 Solution, which is a 36-month trended mortgage product, drove to 17 points of mortgage outperformance by EWS in the quarter. And during the quarter, about 50% of twin mortgage inquiries were for products that include EWS trended or historical information, and of course, these are all at higher price points. In the quarter, Workforce Solutions saw declines in low margin, manual mortgage verification services revenue, as some customers move some of these activities back in-house. And this negatively impacted mortgage outperformance by about 300 basis points in the quarter. EWS had another very strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 5 million records added to the twin database, ending the quarter with 161 million current records, which was up 12%, with 120 million unique records or SSNs, which was up almost 10%. Over the past five years, EWS has doubled the size of the twin database, a strong testament to the record acquisition strategy EWS has executed across the multiple segments of direct employers, third party payroll providers, HR software management companies, pension administrators, and self-employed individuals. As a reminder, twin\u2019s 120 million unique records represent individuals or SSNs on the twin database, and their 161 million current records represent current active jobs on the database, which means there's close to 40 million individuals in our data set that have more than one job, including self-employed or 1099 employees and people on defined benefit pension plans, we now covered just over 50% of the 220 million working and income producing individuals in the United States. And through our cloud tech transformation, we're expanding our capabilities to ingest all levels of records, including 1099 based self-employment records. And as a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers, as they are customers of our expanding employer services business, and the remaining are contributed through partnerships, principally with payroll companies. During the quarter we signed agreements with four new payroll processors that will deliver records during the rest of the year. The twin database now has 631 million total current and historical records, from over 2.8 million employers in the United States. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporating current and historical records, with about 50% of second quarter verification services revenue, coming from products that included historical records. Turning the Slide 6, Workforce Solutions delivered non-mortgage revenue growth about 4%, with non-mortgage revenue, now representing over 70% of Workforce Solutions revenue. And as a reminder, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 52% in second quarter last year, which was a very tough comp. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue which now represents about two thirds of verified revenue delivered 4% growth both sequentially and versus last year in the quarter, which was below our expectations. This was also against a very challenging 90% non-mortgage growth comp by Workforce Solutions last year. The miss versus expectations was predominantly in-town solutions from weaker white color hiring. Government performed exceptionally well, consistent with the high growth that we had expected and consumer finance declined somewhat in the quarter. In government we saw continued very strong growth with revenue up 21% off over a 100% growth last year in second quarter. And revenue also up almost 10% sequentially driven by strong growth was CMS at the state level, new products in twin record growth. Government now represents about 45% of verifier non-mortgage revenue. We expect to see accelerating sequential growth in our government vertical in the second half, driven by growth from CMS Medicaid re-determinations, ACA open enrollment volume, further state penetration and pricing from state contract renewals. We began to see incremental volumes from CMS re-determinations in May and expect to see this accelerate in the second half. This strong sequential growth will also result in accelerated second half EWS growth rates. Talent Solutions were down 6% in the quarter, but up about 1% sequentially, as we are comping off a very strong 130% growth last year from record levels of hiring in the second quarter. Also as a reminder, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white collar workers including technology, professional services, health care and financial services, which has seen greater reductions in hiring activity and broader hiring freezes than the about 7% decline that BLS is reporting through May. Approaching 70% of Talent Solutions revenue in the quarter was from industries that had negative hiring growth versus last year, with many of those industries having significant double-digit negative growth in the quarter. We are out growing the declining market from penetration of our digital solutions with background screeners, strong new product growth, continued expansion of twin records in favorable pricing. We are also seeing continued customer penetration of our new differentiated educational products. We expect these new products to continue to drive above underlying market talent revenue growth through 2023 and in a 2024 beyond. The consumer lending vertical and Workforce Solutions which includes P-Loan, card, auto and debt management was about flat sequentially, but down 11% versus last year to lower auto volumes with financial services and P-Loan declines with FinTech lenders, both principally in the subprime space. We expect modest consumer lending sequential growth in the second half driven by record growth penetration in pricing. This will result in revenue growth in the second half as we lap 2022 headwinds in the auto and P-Loan verticals. In total, we expect to see accelerated sequential growth in verifier non-mortgage in the second half, driven by strong government growth, as well as moderate sequential growth in talent and consumer lending. Employer Services revenue of $109 million was up 4% driven by growth in our I-9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring. In total, our UC and ERC businesses were up slightly. Despite the slowdown in U.S. hiring, we have not seen an increase in UC revenue yet. As a reminder, first quarter employer service revenues were seasonally higher than other quarters due to the higher Affordable Care Act in W-2 volumes. In the third and fourth quarters we expect to see overall growth in Employer Services sequentially from the second quarter levels driven by penetration and I-9 onboarding. Workflow Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5% were up 110 bips from first quarter and in line with our April guidance from strong operational execution. The EWS team continued to perform well despite the macro headwinds from mortgage in U.S. hiring, outpeforming the underlying markets from strong record growth, new products, penetration and price. As shown on Slide 7, USIS revenue of $445 million was up 6% and much better than our expectations due to stronger mortgage and non-mortgage performance. USIS mortgage revenue was down less than 1% and outperformed the mortgage market credit inquiries that were down 33% by more than 30 points. The strong pricing environment that we discussed in April, both from the addition of Telecom & Utilities attributes to our new mortgage credit solution and the increased pricing for credit scores drove the very strong out performance. At $113 million mortgage revenue was 25% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Mortgage credit increase again outperformed MBA's current estimate of originations by about five points from increased shopping behavior. We expect this increase shopping behavior to continue as we move through the remainder of the year. Total non-mortgage revenue of $332 million was up 8% in the quarter, with organic growth of about 4% and better than our expectations. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $278 million which represented over 60% of total USIS revenue was up 7% with organic revenue growth of 3%. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up 9% total and 3% organically. During the quarter online revenue had strong double digit growth in commercial and identity and fraud with auto approaching 10% growth and telco and insurance growing low single digits. Banking was up slightly consistent with first quarter, with market volumes at larger financial institutions offsetting declines with smaller financial institutions and FinTechs that were more principally focused on subprime. Financial Marketing Services or B2B offline business had revenue of $56 million that was up 1%. Strong revenue growth in fraud and header, as well as risk and account reviews was partially offset by declines in marketing, principally pre-screen marketing with IXI wealth revenue growth about flat. Pre-screen marketing revenue was at similar levels at first quarter as we continue to see significant weakness from smaller FIs and FinTech in the subprime space, which was partially offset by growth from larger FIs. USIS is using the power of their ignite platform along with their proprietary data to ensure customers \u2013 to enable customers to drive deeper marketing insights and identifying extending offers to better prospects and delivering better marketing performance management. USIS has seen incremental penetration of growing pipeline from our advanced ignite capabilities. We did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but have not seen a meaningful increase in our risk-based portfolio reviews that typically pick up during challenging economic times. USIS consumer solutions direct-to-consumer business had another strong quarter with revenue up $54 million, up 10% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. USIS is winning in the marketplace with strong momentum from new solutions and differentiated data and key verticals of identity and fraud, commercial and auto. We're also in active dialogues with USIS customers about the competitive benefits of the Equifax Cloud that will deliver always unsubility, faster data speeds and Equifax Cloud enabled new products driving us, which is driving a strong active new deal pipeline, which was up from the first quarter. Todd and the USIS team are on offense as they complete their cloud transformation and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capabilities to deliver new products. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 36% in the quarter, up 340 basis points sequentially and the strongest USUS margins since the beginning of the mortgage market decline a year ago. EBITDA margins were up sequentially from better than expected revenue performance and good execution against their cloud and broader cost reduction program. Turning the Slide 8, international revenue was $290 million, up 7% in constant currency and better than our expectations. Europe local currency revenue was down 2% through the expected about 16% decline in our U.K. debt management business. As we discussed previously, our U.K. debt management business was very strong in the first half last year, as the U.K. government made large catch up debt placements following COVID debt collection moratoriums. As a result, we expect to see declines in the first half versus last year. We expected to see those declines. However, we do not expect \u2013 we do expect to see consistent sequential debt management growth as we move through the second half and we expect debt management to return to revenue growth later this year. Our U.K. and Spain CRA business revenue was up 7% in the quarter in a very good performance. This strong performance was driven principally by strong growth within identity and fraud decisioning consumer and direct-to-consumer. Asia Pacific delivered solid local currency revenue growth at 4%, with growth in commercial identity and fraud and D2C, as well as continued very strong growth in our India business which was up 38% in the quarter. Latin America local currency revenue was up a very strong 23%, driven by double digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of strong double digit growth for Latin America which we expect to continue in the second half. Canada local currency revenue was up 8% with broad base growth in consumer and identity and fraud decisioning and commercial. In Canada we recently completed a full migration to our new cloud base fraud IQ exchange and now have all of our Canadian fraud exchange customers on this new cloud based solution. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.2% were up 70 basis points sequentially and better than our expectations. The improvement was driven by good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans. Turning now to Slide 9 and the second quarter overall non-mortgage, constant dollar revenue growth of 6% was lower than our expectations, but against a very strong 22% growth last year. USIS and international, both delivered stronger non-mortgage growth than we expected. This was offset by the slower growth in EWS non-mortgage that I mentioned earlier in Talent and non-boarding, despite their very strong growth in their government business. As we looked at the second half, we expect non-mortgage revenue growth to grow sequentially in the third and fourth quarter, led by very strong growth in the EWS government business, and growth in EWS talent and consumer lending from new products. We also expect continued strong performance in USIS and international, resulting in third quarter Equifax non-mortgage revenue growth above 9%, which is well within our 8% to 12% long term growth framework. Turning to Slide 10, new product introductions leveraging our differentiated data and the Equifax Cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. In the second quarter we launched over 30 new products and delivered a record 14% Vitality Index. Our second quarter VI was again led by strong performances in EWS and Latin America. In the second quarter over 80% of our new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the Equifax Cloud. Leveraging our Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product roll-outs, we expect to deliver Vitality Index of approximately 13% in 2023, which is 300 basis points above our 10% long term Vitality Goal Index. This equates to about $700 million of revenue in 2023 from new products introduced in the past three years. New products leveraging our differentiated data, Equifax Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long term growth framework in driving Equifax top line and margins. On the right side of the slide we highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud and driving innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities. We launched a new product this quarter, Talent Report Flex 2.0, a customizable pre-higher employment verification solution, that helps solve the challenge background screeners and HR professionals may experience when seeking to verify a candidate specific employment records. With a unique and first-to-market employer preview option, a list of employer names is now available on the work number using a candidate's SSM. This allows the customization of the employment history report by selecting only the records wanted. With the power of the Equifax Cloud, we'll bring new solutions to market to meet the needs of our customers. Turning the Slide 10, we were very excited to receive shareholder approval for our new Boa Vista acquisition in late June. BVS is the second largest credit bureau in the fast growing Brazilian market with over a $2 billion TAM. We expect the transaction to close and early August and Equifax will be able to provide Boa Vista with access to expansive Equifax international capabilities, our cloud native data, products decisioning and analytic technology for the rapid development of new products and services and expansion into new verticals like identity and fraud in Brazil. As a reminder, I mentioned earlier, we expect Boa Vista to deliver approximately $160 million in run rate revenue to Equifax and to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first year. As I mentioned earlier, Boa Vista results are not included in the guidance we're providing today. We'll provide more detail on Boa Vista\u2019s impact in 2023 during our October earnings call after the transaction is closed. Given the size of the transaction, we plan to pause on M&A activity in the second half to focus on integration of BVS and our \u201821 and \u201822 acquisitions. And our intention is to use excess free cash flow over the coming quarters to pay down debt and reduce our leverage. Turning this Slide 12, we believe that artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing Equifax business capabilities and is becoming table-sticks for data analytics companies to manage increasingly large diverse and complex data sets, within a highly regulated data bringing unique complex challenges around AI explainability. On the left side of Side 12, our large and diverse proprietary data base \u2013 data set is a big differentiator for Equifax including our income and employment data, traditional alternative credit data, cell phone, utility and Pay TV data, identity and fraud data in our commercial and wealth data. This proprietary data at scale, heat and length in our new Single Data Fabric gives us significant advantages in using AI to build advanced models, scores and products including identity and fraud solutions, enabled by our best in class Equifax Cloud native technology. To date, Equifax has about 70 approved AI patents supporting our AI NeuroDecision Technology which we call NDT, and Explainable AI which is critical to ensuring that the correct data is used to make credit decisions that surface by AI models and scores. Equifax will continue to invest in AI as we may remain on offense, leveraging Google's Vertex AI capabilities, combined with our own Equifax NDT capabilities will be building more predictive and valuable models and scores with our expanding data set, and accelerating the speed at which we develop new model scores and products to bring more current solutions to our customers. We believe Equifax is uniquely positioned to capture the value of AI going forward. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our third quarter and full year guidance. We're executing very well against our strategic priorities and delivering revenue growth and expanding margins in a challenging macro environment.\nJohn Gamble : Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned, second quarter mortgage market originations were estimated by MBA with data through May at down about 37%, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. As shown on Slide 13, second quarter credit increase were down 33% and also in line with our April expectations. However, as Mark mentioned, we saw weaker than expected inquiry data in June, which impacted our overall mortgage revenue for the quarter. As we look to the second half of 2023, our planning does not assume a fundamental improvement in the mortgage or housing markets from the levels we saw in late June and early July. We're applying normal seasonal patterns to these current run rates of credit and twin inquiries. In the first half of 2023, credit inquiries were down about 39% year-to-year, about 8 percentage points better than the about 47% decline in mortgage originations as estimated based on MBA data. In the second quarter, this spread narrowed to about 5 percentage points. In the third and fourth quarters, we expect this elevated impact from mortgage shopping and application activity that does not result in a closed loan to continue at about 5 percentage points. Applying normal seasonal patterns to the run rate we are seeing for mortgage credit inquiries in the end of June and early July, we expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down 31% for all of 2023, which is a slight reduction from our April guidance. However, we are expecting mortgage originations to be down about 37%, reflecting about 6 percentage points of shopping behavior that benefits credit inquiries. This is about 5 percentage points weaker than the 32% we discussed in our April guidance for mortgage originations. This full year guidance for mortgage credit inquiries would result in second half mortgage credit inquiries being down about 14%, with the third and fourth quarter credit inquiries being down about 23% and 4% respectively. And applying the 5 percentage point benefit to credit inquiries relative to mortgage originations from shopping that is consistent with what we saw in the second quarter, we would estimate mortgage originations in the second half would be down just under 20%. We are expecting the number of originations to weaken slightly in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and fourth quarter originations to weaken somewhat seasonally relative to the third. As we have discussed in the past, Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue is more closely tied to mortgage originations. This reduction in 2023 expected mortgage originations relative to our April guidance reduces Workforce Solutions revenue in the second half of 2023 by about $40 million. As our expectation for USIS credit inquiries in the second half of 2023 is slightly weaker than our April guidance, USIS mortgage revenue did not change meaningfully. Turning to Slide 14, as Mark referenced earlier, in the second quarter we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS guidance and delivered well against our 2023 spending reduction plan that will now deliver $210 million in spending reduction in \u201823 versus 2022 levels, including workforce reduction, closer to data centers and additional cost control measures. For 3Q we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of about 33.5% at approximately the midpoint of our guidance range. The sequential margin expansion is driven by both revenue growth, as well as the savings related to our expanded $210 million dollar spending reduction plan Mark previously discussed. As revenue grows sequentially through the second half of \u201923 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, we are focused on delivering fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of about 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. Slide 15 provides our guidance for 3Q\u201823. In 3Q\u201923 we expect total Equifax revenue of between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion, with revenue up about 6.9% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to over 9% and will be partially offset by mortgage revenue that is down low single digits. FX is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue, and acquisitions are expected to benefit revenue by about 1%. As a reminder, this guidance does not include BVS. We\u2019ll provide more information on BVS at our October earnings call. 3Q\u201923 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially by about 75 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting both sequential revenue growth and the benefits of our cost actions. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are expected to be up sequentially for 2Q\u201923, driven by Workforce Solutions returning to revenue growth in the quarter, as well as margin improvement international. Corporate expenses for 3Q\u201923 are expected to be about flat with 2Q\u201923. Business unit performance in the third quarter is expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 7.5%. We expect non-mortgage revenue will return to over 10% growth year-to-year from continued strong growth in government and a return to growth in Talent Solutions in consumer lending verticals. EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat sequentially. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 7.5% year-to-year. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth should be up slightly from the 8% we saw this quarter, above their long term 6% to 8% revenue growth framework. Mortgage revenue is expected to return to year-to-year growth in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be down about 100 basis points sequentially, principally due to the lower revenue. International revenue is expected to be up 4.5% in constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to increase a very strong 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting sequential revenue growth and strong cost management, including the benefit of planned cost reductions. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q\u201923 to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share. Slide 16 provides the specifics of our 2023 full year guidance. As Mark mentioned, we're lowering our full year revenue guidance by $25 million at the midpoint of $5.3 billion from the weaker mortgage market. As Mark discussed, the reduction in revenue guidance reflects our assumption that U.S. mortgage originations will decline 37% in \u201823, 5 percentage points more than our April guidance, reducing mortgage revenue by over $40 million in Workforce Solutions. As I referenced earlier, we're seeing continued high levels of shopping, which is benefiting USIS, and as such mortgage revenue and USIS is not expected to be meaningfully impacted by the lower level of originations. Total mortgage revenue is expected to decline about 13% in 2023. Partially offsetting the reduction of Workforce Solutions, mortgage revenue is positive FX. We continue to expect non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth to be strong at above 8% in 2023, slightly stronger than our April guidance. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue is expected to grow over 11% in the second half of \u201823 as continued solid performance from USIS and international and accelerating growth in the EWS government vertical more than offset the impact of weaker U.S. hiring. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve consistently throughout 2023, with the third quarter at 33.5% and the fourth quarter at about 36%. As Mark mentioned, we remain focused on delivering both 36% EBITDA margins and over $2 per share in 4Q\u201923. As Mark also mentioned, we're reducing our adjusted EPS guidance for 2023 to the range of $6.85 to $7.10 per share at the midpoint of $6.98. This is a reduction of $0.22 or about $35 million in operating income. This is principally driven by the loss of over $40 million of high margin Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue. We believe that our full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Total capital spending for 2023 is expected to be slightly over $550 million. Capital spending in the second quarter was about $150 million in line with our expectations. We expect capital spending in the third quarter to decline sequentially by almost $15 million as we continue to progress U.S. and Canadian migrations to Date Fabric. CapEx as a percentage of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. As we discussed in April, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion in revenue with 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than when we first discussed in November 2021, our goal of achieving these 2025 goals. The U.S. mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down about 40% from the normal 2015 to 19 average levels we had discussed, to deliver $7 billion in revenue in 2025. Our non-mortgage revenue has grown faster than we discussed with you back in November 2021. However, even after considering the additional revenue from the BVS acquisition of recovery in the mortgage market from the levels we are seeing in 2023, of on the order of two-thirds of the loss volume still needed to achieve our $7 billion goal in 2025. We are focused on driving above market growth and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed with our expanded 2023 and 2024 spending reduction plans, and as part of our data and technology cloud transformation, which are needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins as we exceed the 7 billion revenue level. We will continue to discuss with you our progress toward our 7 billion dollar goal as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. And I would like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks John. Wrapping up on slide 17, Equifax delivered a solid quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS above our guidance despite the challenging mortgage and hiring markets. USIS and international delivered strong quarters offsetting some weakness in the EWS Talent and Onboarding businesses, to allow us to deliver revenue at about the midpoint and EPS above guidance. The breadth and depth of our businesses and execution against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction program allowed us to deliver despite a challenging macro environment. Summarizing at the business unit level, Workforce Solutions continue to deliver against their long-term growth strategy. While their 4% revenue decline was pressured by mortgage and hiring macros, they were comping off a very strong 21% growth last year. We expect that growth to recover in the second half, and importantly EWS had another very strong quarter of twin record additions, adding formula payroll providers, which brings a total added since the beginning of last year to 17, and increased current records to $161 million, up $5 million from the third quarter and toward 12% versus last year, with total records growing to $631 million. Workforce delivered a very strong NPI vitality index of 25%, leveraging their cloud capabilities which will benefit them in the second half and in \u201824 and beyond. In the continued growth of Twin, strong NPI and government growth positions EWS for 15% growth in the second half. And EWS operating focus delivered 51.5% EBITDA margins, which is up over 100 basis points and stronger than we expected. Second, USIS continued their momentum for the first quarter was strong non-mortgage growth of 8% total and at the top end of their long-term framework and 4% organic, driven by online B2B non-mortgage growth of 9% total and 4% organic, as they focus on customer migrations to the Equifax Cloud. USIS delivered EBITDA margins of 36%, up over 300 basis points sequentially through revenue growth and strong cost management. International delivered strong 7% local currency growth with strong growth in what\u2019s Latin America, Canada, India and our European credit businesses. And they delivered EBITDA margins of 24%, up 70 basis points and stronger than our expectations. As mentioned earlier, our second quarter Vitality Index of 14% is an Equifax record and was 400 bips above our 10% long-term growth framework, as we've delivered over 60 new products year-to-date, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. The focus of our Equifax Cloud Data and Technology Transformation is in completing those North American migrations, which will allow us to further accelerate new product launches and complete legacy system decommissioning. Our Cloud native technology will differentiate Equifax and allows us to be an offense with leading systems stability and capabilities that position us to leverage AI tools to drive revenue growth and cost efficiencies. We're executing well against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction plan that will now deliver $210 million of savings this year, with run rate savings of $275 million in 2024. And this is up $10 million in \u201823 and $25 million in \u201824 from our April framework. We remain focused on delivering 36% adjusted EBITDA margins and over $2 per share in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter, which sets us up well for 2024. And we're energized about receiving shareholder approval for the BVS acquisition in June, and we're on track to close this strategic and financially attractive acquisition in early August. And as mentioned earlier given the weaker than expected mortgage market, we're lowering our full year revenue guidance by $25 million to $5.3 billion at the midpoint, with full year 2023 adjusted EPS at the midpoint to be down $0.22 per share to $6.98 from the impact of the lower high \u2013 high \u2013 lower but high margin mortgage revenue. We're energized to be entering the next chapter of new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. This is an exciting time for Equifax \u2013 exciting time for Equifax, and we're convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets, and our new Single Data Fabric and our market leading businesses will deliver higher growth expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan, please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman : Hi John! Let me just ask my two questions together. The first one is, could you just tell us what second quarter mortgage revenues is as a percentage of total revenues. I didn\u2019t catch that if you gave it. And the second one is looking at the EWS revenue growth guide for third quarter of 7.5% which is on slide 15, and then kind of taking it together with the comments for EWS revenue guide on slide 16. It seems to imply a rather strong revenue ramp for EWS in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and could you just comment on that?\nA - John Gamble: So, your first question, it is 21%, the answer your first question.\nAndrew Steinerman : Thanks.\nA - John Gamble: And as we take a look at EWS, Mark talked about it very \u2013 I think fairly completely right. What we're seeing is we're expecting to see nice sequential improvements. I'm talking specifically about non-mortgage as we move through third quarter and into fourth quarter. A lot of it driven by very strong growth in government, which we feel very good about and the strength we're seeing in the government business, not only in the third and fourth quarter, but we've seen in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And we're also expecting to move back to see sequential growth in Talent driven by new product, and also in our consumer lending businesses, also driven by new product and to some extent penetration. So we think those factors allow us to see nice sequential growth as we go through the year. And as on mortgage and as we're now comparing against easier comps as we get into the second half of 2023 versus 2022, we see better growth rates. You're also going to see obviously better growth rates in mortgage, although we took mortgage down, right, the level of decline in mortgage year-on-year and originations declined substantially going through the year, we can expect to continue to have very good mortgage out performance in EWS, so that allows us to return to growth in EWS mortgages we get toward the best of the very end of this year. So with those two factors together, we think we're going to see nice acceleration in EWS revenue as we go through the rest of this year.\nAndrew Steinerman : Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Manav Patnaik of Barclays, please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe my first question, just to follow-up on that. I guess you addressed the revenue visibility to seem to have as your ramp up into the end of the year. Can you just talk about the moving pieces on margins? Like how confident are you to hit that 36% and how that flows through to next year?\nMark Begor: I'll start Manav and John can jump in. So we\u2019ll leave the revenue leverage aside, so we have \u2013 you know we think its good visibility outside of the mortgage piece. As you know, we increased our cost program by another $10 million this year and $25 million next year. So we see additional efficiencies as we get further into the cloud completion. So combining that with the core program we announced in February, we just have a lot of visibility, because we know when contractors are leaving and when we're taking other cost actions. So that that gives us a lot of confidence in the cost side of that across all the businesses and at the corporate level.\nJohn Gamble: And again, as Mark said, good focus on cost, we have good visibility on cost and we do \u2013 obviously we do need to see the revenue growth we're talking about. But I think we feel very good about the sequential movements we're talking about in our non-mortgage business. We delivered well in non-mortgage other than the Talent impacts we talked about in the second quarter. And then obviously we've made an assumption on the mortgage market. We think we've made a reasonable assumption, but having the mortgage market deliberate the levels we're talking about, obviously it\u2019s also needed for us to deliver our 36% margins in the fourth quarter.\nManav Patnaik : Got it. And then just not work force solutions, I mean I guess most of the changes are just your volume assumptions. I missed what your new gross hiring assumption is, but I was also hoping you could address \u2013 I\u2019ll confirm that you're not seeing any changes in the competitive behavior, like all these changes are really just your volume assumptions.\nMark Begor: John, I'll let you jump on the hiring assumption, but you know we did mention Manav that for example in mortgage, we're seeing some mortgage originators move manual verifications back from Equifax in-house, so that had an impact us on the quarter. We expect that to continue, so that it is clearly a revenue impact and what we're seeing is that you've got mortgage originators doing less activity, so they've got people sitting in their offices and they are deciding to do some of those manual verifications in-house, so that clearly had an impact. I think there was no question that experience through, to a lesser degree, Transunion and they're kind of new focus on this or. In the marketplace we don't see that being a meaningful impact on our revenue, but they are definitely out there and they are doing more than they were a year ago. So that clearly also has an impact, particularly probably in mortgage.\nA - John Gamble: In terms of Talent Market I don't think we gave a percentage. I think in April we talked about the market being down like 10%. We said June was worse and that we're expecting that weaker level of the Talent Market to continue through the rest of the year. We didn't really give a number, but weaker than the 10% we talked about in April.\nA - Mark Begor: And again, we also commented Manav that we see ourselves over indexing to white collar employers in our customer base, and those are more impacted from both hiring freezes, you know as well as layoffs and blue collar side.\nManav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse, please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh : Great! Thanks so much. I\u2019ll ask one multi-part question. So thanks for framing the $40 million run off. Was that purely higher rates or any dislocation from regional banks or maybe tightening standards and then I wondered if you could give us a sense of \u2013 the sensitivity on the way up. So the extent rates started to go down. Like, what would be that theoretical level, where you may see people get a little bit more aggressive with a heloc or refinance. I mean it seems like 7% was a trigger for some weakness. What level of rate and is there any way to maybe frame the sensitivity of what 6.5% might mean for the businesses as we think about 2024.\nMark Begor: Yes, I think there's a lot of factors Kevin in the mortgage space. Clearly higher rates \u2013 you know I think the uncertainty around rates is as much as that consumers that are thinking about purchasing a home. Rates go up towards that 7%. They pull back and wait to see what's happening. Where will rates stabilize is an activity that we're definitely seeing. There's an element of \u2013 and you've read about this, you see it, as if the shortage of housing stock. You mean there isn't a lot of inventory out there for people to make home purchases. Those that own homes are doing \u2013 are not upgrading, you know meaning, going buying a larger home or moving in a different neighborhood in town, because of the low rate they're currently sitting on in their mortgage and some uncertainty about where rates are going. So we believe that there's some element of rate stabilization that consumers will increase their activity from that. I don't think we're thinking about rate reductions. You know that'll happen sometime in the future, whether it's a year from now or in \u201825 or \u201826 you know going forward. But as a reminder, we've never seen purchase volume declines at this level, that from historical levels we're well below 40% of below historic levels, excluding kind of a refi boom that we had in \u201920 and \u201821 and \u201922. You know that just has never happened before, so it's our view that at some point we\u2019ll return to normal historical levels, you know whether that's in a year from now, as people get more comfortable operating in a 6%, 7% mortgage interest rate environment where it\u2019s into \u201926. There\u2019ll be return to normalization over time is our expectation. What would you add John?\nJohn Gamble: Well, just I think the important thing for us also is we're continuing to drive very good performance above market, right. So again, very strong performance in the first quarter at 20 points. In the second quarter effectively 20 points if you adjust for the fact that we made a decision to not participate to the same level, in what's really a not particularly profitable manual business and we talked about how that reduced our out performance by about 300 basis points. So again, on the very high margin Digital Verification Business, again about 20 points out performance. So we feel good about our continued outperformance. We also feel good about the fact that to the extent we see a faster growing mortgage market than what we forecast that will participate very clearly and we'll see the upside from that. But, we clearly saw the reduction in transaction volume when rates moved up to above seven. It's hard to predict what's going to happen when they move back below, but to the extent that we see nice growth, from that to the extent it occurs, we think will participate well.\nMark Begor: Then at some point on the other side it is high inflationary environment where the feds had to raise interest rates. There'll be a time \u2013 I'm not an economist, but at some point in the future, the feds going to reduce interest rates to boost economic activity. It's just the cycle that we typically have and there'll be another refi window whether that's in \u201925, \u201926, \u201827 but we'll be well positioned for that, and it\u2019s been a very high incremental margins on mortgage revenue declines or mortgage revenue growth. We\u2019ll see the other side of that at some point in the future at Equifax.\nKevin McVeigh : Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nKelsey Zhu: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the government vertical for EWS. So part of the acceleration of growth in the second half is coming from the government vertical which part of that is coming from the Medicaid re-determination process. I was wondering if you can talk about how much of that was done in Q2 and kind of how much do you expect to be done in Q3 and Q4. And in general, it will be helpful to understand a little better about the government revenue breakdown across different programs for Medicaid, Social Security that\u2019s down. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, there's a bunch of factors driving government which is the good news for us. You know it's a very important, fast growing segment of Workforce Solutions. It's one where we have a very, very strong market position given the scale of our data set to 630 million you know historical records and our active records. You point out one of the levers you know on the re-determination, we saw some of that activity pick up in May and June and we expect that to continue in third quarter and fourth quarter and much of that to be a 2023 event which is positive. We're also seeing more ACA volume. We're getting more penetration at the state level. Remember this business, which is approaching $500 million is in a TAM that's close to $3 billion and each state and each agency at the state level are separate organizations and we have a commercial team that's headquartered at many of the state capitals that's working to bring our solutions to convert current manual activity around verifications for whether it's unemployment claims or childcare support, food support, all the other social services to convert them from manual to using our automated solution. So that's a big lever for growth is we add more states and more agencies, so that we have a pipeline. We have visibility around those relationships. Another lever is we're constantly renegotiating those individual contracts that we have. And again remember, 50 states. Think about maybe six or eight agencies in each state that we have relationships with a portion of them. The ones that we have, those contracts come up and we worked \u2013 increase price for the additional value that we're delivering. And then the other lever we have is at the federal level. We have federal programs with some of the big organizations. You mentioned one security administration, those are also growth programs for us at the government level.\nKelsey Zhu: Got it. My second question is on the talent vertical. I was wondering, could you share a little bit more about revenue breakdown kind of cross blue collar higher activity versus white collar. And I know you've introduced this new pre-employment verification services kind of targeting the hourly workforce, nothing that will help drive penetration with the blue collar higher activity. So I was wondering if you can talk about, how much penetration you've gained with that product and kind of the growth outlook for blue color revenue versus white collar.\nMark Begor: Yes, so we participate in all employees. We're making the point that we with our current customer base, again customers being background screeners. The customers that we have tend to over index to white collar jobs, which is why we're seeing more of an impact right now. But we have a lot of blue collar jobs coming through and employment verification work that we do. The new solution on hourly has only been in the marketplace for 30 days, so it's very new but we've seen very positive traction. We think it's not only going to drive penetration, with our existing customers, but it's also going to allow them to drive growth and their business. Meaning they can go out and pick up more volume or share in those kind of employees doing verification work. We also talked about some of the other solutions we have outside of just employment history. We've seen very positive growth in our education solution, where we have an instant solution around verifying education backgrounds which is used in a lot of white collar job. That's a newer solution for us that we've been in the marketplace for call it a year, but we're growing a lot of usage and share with that, so that's a positive for the Talent business. And then the last one is you know, we have our insights business that we acquired a couple years ago that has the incarceration data and that's another one where we're bringing new products to market and new solutions. So for talent, you've got the ability to drive penetration. That business is a north of $400 million at run rate in a $4 billion TAM, so there's a lot of penetration growth opportunity there. A lot of our new product focuses around Talent. You talked about the solution for the hourly work force that we rolled out about a month ago and then we rolled out one a couple weeks ago. It provides more flexibility about which employers our customers want to focus on foreign employee, you know that's another solution that should drive growth. So new products are a big focus of ours in the Talent vertical.\nKelsey Zhu: Super helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The you the next question is coming from Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nKyle Peterson : Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. I appreciate you taking the questions. Just wanted to dig a little bit more into some of the talent weakness that you guys kind of saw is \u2013 I get that this is yeah more white color based, but I guess is within kind of verticals of the white color workforces, the hiring slowed down. You guys saw in June. It sounds like is that fairly broad based or you know that concentrated in one or two verticals or anymore color there would be really helpful.\nMark Begor: It's pretty broad based. I think you look at them like we do. You see less of them, but in the first half of the year you saw companies left and right announcing either layoffs or hiring freezes. I think it was Ford a couple of weeks ago announced another white color reduction, if a company is reducing people and making those kind of announcements, they also typically have a hiring freeze in place. So there's less inbound, new hires coming in. So that clearly is not \u2013 it didn't just happen in late in the quarter, it's been happening for quite some time as we've kind of nine months into that hiring reduction that has had an impact on, is that we've been able to outgrow through pricing in 2023, through new products, through penetration, in adding new customers in the background screening space, but it's clearly had an impact, and we expected it to continue to be an impact in the second half and we've laid that into our framework.\nKyle Peterson : Makes sense. And just a follow-up, on the cost side, good the additional cost savings you guys identified. This quarter it's kind of offset some of the weaker volumes. But you just wanted to think about you know if we continue to see challenging volumes whether it's through mortgage or background screening or any other areas of the business. Are there any other efficiencies and levers that you guys might be able to pull, you know if we're in kind of a prolonged period of weaker volumes and revenue per share, or you guys kind of at approaching to the max efficiency here.\nMark Begor: I think as you know we're going to have a $65 million of run rate benefit next year, because a lot of the actions from the broader cost and cloud program that we have in 2023 are in the second half, so that'll be a benefit. And we've talked previously that we still expect to get further cloud efficiencies in \u201824 and \u201825 as we complete the cloud. We're at 70% now. We still got that remaining 30% of Equifax to complete over the next couple of years, and as we complete that cloud we expect to see further efficiencies that will benefit our margins and in margin rate in \u201824 and \u201925, including the carry over benefit of the cloud actions that we're taking you know in broader restructuring in 2023.\nJohn Gamble: And just as a reminder right, the actions we've already taken and the site control we have on cost broadly are allowing us to drive our margins higher in the third quarter and the fourth quarter substantially. So we think we've taken pretty significant actions already, which are allowing us to see nice improvement in margins.\nMark Begor: And maybe one other point, I wouldn't think about the actions is being aligned with a revenue decline, that's not how we operate our business. The program we announced in February you expected. We talked about it last year that we would be reducing our costs as we complete the cloud. This is something we've been talking about for years. And as we said in February, in April, and again today, we're just seeing broader opportunities to improve our efficiencies as we get further into the cloud. The real backbone of these cost efficiencies and margin expansions are what we've talked about for the last three or four years and it's really driven by our ability to get closer to completion of our cloud investment.\nKyle Peterson : Make sense, and that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Good morning. I know nature of course is a vacuum Mark, but I'm just going to ask you one question, sort of high level. When I look out at the U.S. economy and think about perhaps a soft landing or a Goldilocks environment, however you want to consider it. It strikes me that there are there are parts of Equifax\u2019s business that benefit from the rate of change in the economy, either improving or deteriorating, and if we're sort of in stasis. Does that impact your business? I'm thinking about UC, I'm thinking about mortgage. Just broadly, is change as important regardless of direction? Obviously improving is better than deteriorating, but is change a meaningful impact to your growth rates, your revenue growth rates?\nMark Begor: Yes, you've got to kind of break some pieces apart there. Mortgage obviously has had a huge impact on our business. It's been \u2013 we've never seen a mortgage decline like this to be 40% below \u2013 well over 40%. I think it's 45% below historic levels in the second half. It\u2019s just never happened before, that's going to recover right. It's just a matter of when will it return to call it norm, that minus 45 and that'll be a very positive thing for Equifax, and whether it's \u201924, \u201825 or \u201926, the mortgage market is not going to stay at this level. People are going to buy houses, people keep moving and then add on it at some point. When rates start coming down again from these higher levels which should happen, there'll be a refi element, so that's kind of mortgage. We're very pleased, and I hope most of our investors are of our ability to continue to drive the 80% of Equifax it's not mortgage quite strongly in what you characterize as a uncertain economic environment, the diversity of our businesses. If you look at Equifax 10 years ago being primarily a credit bureau and now you \u2013 we're talking on this call predominantly around our talent vertical and government vertical that didn't exist 10 years ago. And talent you know still performing even with a macro impact and government super strong just because of the power of the unique solutions that we have. So I think that's the kind of the underlying strength of Equifax, is our non-mortgage businesses are super strong and lay on top of that, the new product initiative, it's not an initiative, it's really how we operate. We're a product led organization leveraging our differentiated data and our cloud capabilities. You know the 14% vitality in the quality, that's great momentum for the second half in \u201924 and \u201925, meaning that we're seeing we can leverage our differentiated data assets, our product led culture and capabilities and cloud and put new solutions in market. And those new solutions are higher price points that are going to expand our margins going forward. So that's a real positive. And then the underlying macros, I think the diversity of Equifax plays into that. So is there going to be a soft landing? My personal view is there is. I think we're kind of already feeling it and seeing it with inflation down to 3%. That's going to head towards where the fed wants it and unemployment is so low, people are still working. That's a pretty good economic environment for all businesses, but importantly ours going forward. And then you lay on top of it the completion of the cloud from a kind of timing standpoint over the next year and change. And the cost benefits that you\u2019re seeing this year and margin benefits this year that carry into 2024, those are quite powerful in our ability to expand our free cash generation. And have \u2013 as we get into \u201924. \u201825 and \u201926, have significant excess free cash flow to return to shareholders at the right time.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Now, as usual a very comprehensive, thoughtful answer. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the dynamic on mortgage underwriters moving the employment and income verification in-house. Are you saying that that's just for the manual portion of the verification and you are not losing them as a client?\nMark Begor: Correct. Yes, that's where we've seen it Jeff. In part of it was that customers came to us and were looking for lower pricing on the manual efforts that we do for them. I think you know we have an operation in Iowa where we do that. We opted not to chase price down because it's a low margin solution now for us, but an attractive one, and some of them moved that in-house and it was you know meaningful. Its 300 basis points of the mortgage out performance in the quarter. But no, it's isolated to that manual effort we were doing four customers. We've just seen less activity there and it's logical when you think about a mortgage originator that just has more people doing less mortgages, they can do some of that themselves. But we haven't seen the impact on the instant verification side, which is where as you know, where all our revenue and margin is.\nJohn Gamble: You've also heard some of our competitors talk about growing their manual business, and again we think that's part of the ship. This is just business that this low margin that we're moving away from.\nJeff Meuler: And can you give us any sense of how much revenue you generate from doing the manual verification?\nMark Begor: We didn't give totals, but we did talk about it as a level of decline right. So we said it impacted our out performance by about 300 basis points so.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then Mark you answered the Verifier competition question a bit differently today or at least I've perceived your answer a little bit differently today. And John, you just kind of alluded to, hey, some of the competition is manual and that's low margin. But you can see the credit file inquiries, so you can triangulate share for verifier mortgage. If you look at the non-exclusive records that you have, have there been any recent share changes for digital verifications. Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes, not that I would characterize as meaningful Jeff, but we don't see it in our marketplace, but we hear our so called competitors talking about their revenue growth and I don't know what the real numbers are that some of those smaller players have, but they are definitely getting revenue somewhere. We just don't feel it in our business but we continue to watch it.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Huber: Great, thank you. You obviously mentioned a 14% vitality index. Can you give us a flavor of some of the areas of the new products that you're most excited about here is you kind of think out. What's working really well? Where do you think is the biggest opportunity to growth revenues?\nMark Begor: Oh man, how much time do we have, but I'll try to be precise.\nCraig Huber: You can give top two or three.\nMark Begor: Yes, I know but first time I\u2019d start with the 14%. When we set the 10% vitality goal, remember our long term run rate, pre-cloud and pre the 10% goal was 5% to 7%. And I think 5% to 7% is what most data analytics companies do and 5% to 7% is a big number. To have 5% to 7% of your revenue from new products introduced in the time frame, we picked three years. That's a pretty vibrant innovative company. We set a goal for 10% and since we set the goal we've been over achieving it and 14% in the quarter and 13% for the year. So I would start with that I'm energized about the broad based ability at Equifax across all of our business units to leverage our differentiated data, our cloud capabilities or bring new solutions to market. That's the company that you want to have as a partner if you're a customer. Someone who is innovating to bring new solutions, because remember, all of our products deliver ROI. We are not Coke versus Pepsi or doing Sprite versus Diet Coke. We're delivering a solution that's going to help our customer to originate more consumers, lower their losses, increase they're marketing hit rates you name it, we're delivering ROI. So what excites me, certainly all of the solutions in Workforce. That would be kind of number two for me beyond the 14%. Having Workforce Solutions, that I think it was 23% vitality in the quarter, and remember Workforce is the first business at Equifax to get into fully cloud native for over a year now. And they've really been able to unleash, kind of the pent-up capacity if you will to bring new solutions to market and they're doing it in every vertical. Mortgage 36, delivering a 36 month solution of historical data to our mortgage customers. To the earlier question from Jeff a few minutes ago, our so called startup competitors can't do that. They don't have the 630 million historical records. So uniquely we can deliver a 36 solution that's integral now to many mortgage originations going back three years. So that historical data is something that super energizes me. I'll jump to USIS. Our new mortgage credit file that includes the NC+ plus, 14 NC+ attributes. Really energizing to have multi data assets delivered. The mortgage credit file is, looked the same for 40 years. We're now making ours differentiated and because of the scale of the cell phone utility database that we have, our competitors can't do that. So only Equifax can have a differentiated mortgage credit file, super exciting. The solutions for talent that we already talked about, also super exciting. So we're really focused on our new product initiative. We think it's going to drive top line in margin expansion going forward, and you're seeing us outperform the 10%, which we think is a good thing for the future.\nCraig Huber: My final question, as you sort of look out beyond this weak sluggish environment here into \u201824 into 2025, a lot of your business to recover very nicely next year and in the year after. So what areas are you most excited about when getting to a better economic backdrop.\nMark Begor: Certainly mortgage, which we already talked about that. Mortgage 40% below, 45% below kind of historic normal market levels. That recovery which is going to happen at some point, whether it's \u201924, \u201825 or \u201826 and how it meters in, that's going to be good news for Equifax. So it\u2019s going to be very high incremental margin in EWS and USIS is that recovery takes place. You know at some point there'll be more stabilization in the hiring market. Once employers get more comfortable around the economy, I would expect there'd be less hiring freezes and you know some level of employment improvement going forward. So that you know is going to be a positive you know for Equifax. When the subprime market stabilizes, that's had an impact us on us over the last three quarters in USIS. That'll be you know positive for us going forward.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair, please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas : Hi! Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First question I wanted to ask is, just maybe a point of clarification. I hear the acceleration commentary and what makes you confident in that through the back after the year. Just wanted to make sure I understand it. Is there any change to kind of your economic assumptions for the second half as well? So you're still baking in some level of [inaudible] down on the outside? Okay.\nMark Begor: Correct. 100%. It's just really our visibility around pipelines, government we talked a bunch about, that we can see just a visibility in that business and in the others, but we still have the same view of a no change in the macro.\nAndrew Nicholas : Got it. And then for my follow-up, a different topic entirely. Mark, you spend a decent bit of time on artificial intelligence and how Equifax is well positioned to leverage it going forward. I'm just wondering if you could speak to kind of the cost side of that equation. How expensive is it to leverage the cloud and Google Vertex in an environment where I think chips are expensive and there's some shortages there. Just wondering how you think about cost and whether or not that's a meaningful consideration when you go down the AI path, the large language model path.\nMark Begor: Yes, so what I've talked most about today and what our principle focus in is around using AI to really manage large data and multi data sets to deliver better performing scores, better performing models. You may remember we rolled out a solution called One Score in April that combines some of our differentiated data assets across USIS. We used AI modeling in that and that provides significant performance enhancement, and when you deliver a performance enhancement it's more valuable when you charge a higher price. So that's going to be our principle focus around AI and no, there's not a high cost in completing AI. There's actually a bunch of efficiencies from a DNA perspective of using AI because it's just faster. You can complete more work and we'll be more productive if you will in delivering these higher performing solutions. I thought where you were going was in our operation side, where we expect to use some of the AI capabilities to improve our call centers, our operating centers. That will clearly be a leverage point for us in 24 and beyond. But our \u2013 I believe our big leverage is going to be around having more sophisticated higher performing, products scores, models and solutions.\nAndrew Nicholas : Makes sense. Certainly having everything on the same Data Fabric is helpful to that too.\nMark Begor: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Hi! Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Mark, I'm just asking my first question. I want to focus over one, some of the questions that came in earlier about the manual verifications to move back in-house or you know you're talking about there's some competitors over there. Like Truework has a product over there that they're very focused on the manual verifications. And I just want to ask you about strategically, as you move back a little bit from that because of pricing, are you concerned that that's going to give them kind of an entr\u00e9e into the client base, which will also give them potentially the ability to move Truework to a top of waterfall position, to take advantage of potentially getting kind of like ADP data which is not, it's not unique to all the players that are in there. And so strategically how are you thinking about that, in terms of you're not wanting to cut cost in there and then I have a follow.\nMark Begor: Yes, and that one we are going to be obviously focused on maintaining our strong customer relationships. I don't know what Truework\u2019s revenue is. Maybe it's $15 million or something or $20 million. It's a fairly small player. It doesn't have really any scale differentiated data assets. We've got at the end of the quarter 161 million records. I don't even know what their record count is, but we certainly watch them. We just don\u2019t feel that they are having a meaningful impact on our business, but we certainly are keeping an eye on them.\nJohn Gamble: Shlomo, the other thing that\u2019s happening right, as we continue to rapidly grow our database, so the need to do manual verifications when you use Equifax continues to decline substantially, right. So given where we are at 120 million uniques against U.S. non-firm payroll of say 160 million, we're getting to the point now where the need for a manual verification when you use Equifax is very small.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. And then hey John, also I have a question for you. I'm just trying to understand the lowering of the EPS guidance. Like the midpoint is $0.22. Even if I assume that $40 million of lower revenue coming from mortgage is above 90% contribution, I mean that would be like all of that reduction, but there's also other stuff that's doing better on USIS and government talent and you also increased by $10 million the cost savings program. It just seems to me like the midpoint of the guidance and the EPS was lower to a lot more than it needed to be. Can you comment on that?\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So really the driver was lower mortgage revenue, right. We said Workforce Solutions workers revenues down over $40 million right, so applying a very high margin to that you do get a very substantial amount of operating income. We said non-mortgage is slightly better, so for the entire company I know pieces have moved around, but in total non-mortgage is slightly better. So that wasn't a big driver a positive operating income in the changing guidance. And really the difference between the reduction of over $40 million in mortgage revenue and the down $25 million we talked about is just heavily FX which has very little flow through in terms of positive operating income, So it's really driven by the fact that we lost very high margin mortgage revenue, I mean EWS, and that really drove the reduction right. Yes, there was some cost savings, but again they weren't a big number of $10 million of incremental that we talked about. You can think that was kind of split between capital and cost. So not a big driver of recovery, so the big movement is just related to the fact that we saw the reduction in mortgage revenue.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeather Balsky : Hi! Thank you for taking my question. I know there's been a fair number of questions already on the acceleration in non-mortgage EWS revenue. So I just wanted to kind of follow-up here, because I think we're backing into something in a healthy double digit range for the fourth quarter. And you've outlined the drivers, but I guess where do you expect to see the most meaningful acceleration in your business. It sounds like the macro isn\u2019t changing. So just trying to understand how you go from how you did this quarter to double digit growth in the fourth.\nJohn Gamble: So Heather, if you look at it sequentially right, what we're talking about here in terms of EWS is really nice sequential improvement. We talked about this in government right, and we think government revenue is a big driver of our improvement. When you compared to last year, obviously last year what you saw was some weakening in the back half of the year as you saw weakening talent markets, etc. So the compare is easier, but if you just look at sequentially the performance we're talking about, we expect government to improve substantially as you move through the rest of the year. Mark covered very completely what the drivers of that are. And then sequentially we're also talking about seeing talent get a little better from where we are today. A lot of it driven by product, again, as Mark covered in his prepared margin and earlier answers. And then also on consumer finance we kind of think we've hit a bottom and we're going to \u2013 we'll see slight improvements in consumer finance sequentially, which again given what the second half of last year looked like, gives us growth rates that are substantially different than we saw on the first half. So the big driver in sequential improvement certainly is government. We're seeing some sequential improvements in the other segments in EWS, but that's how we think about the improvement and we think the trend we've already seen in government supports the level of improvement we're talking about.\nMark Begor: And then outside of EWS, I think as we talked earlier, both USIS and international were above our expectations in the quarter and we expect them to perform well in the second half also.\nHeather Balsky : Okay, thank you for that. And then just another question with regards to the outperformance at EWS versus the mortgage market, you called out 17% this quarter. Is that the new run rate factored into your forecast or is there some assumption that the impact from the manual polls going in-house kind of worsened in the back?\nJohn Gamble: So again, adjusting for the impact of manual, we're at about 20 we're at about 20 last quarter. So yes, we'll have another impact. We\u2019ll have more impact as we go through the rest of this year in terms of the lower levels of manual revenue, which again very low margin right so.\nMark Begor: Fairly low revenue.\nJohn Gamble: And fairly low revenue. So we'll see an impact from that if we go through the rest of this year, but we continue to expect to see nice out performance in the mortgage market.\nHeather Balsky : Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan : Thanks very much. One of your competitors launched a product this week that allows consumers to choose to share their employment information directly from their payroll provider, and this is a model that's been in the market obviously. I guess, do you see the market moving more that way in the future or parts of the market moving that way? And is there any benefit for you to offer that type of model in addition to your traditional model or does that not make sense for you? Thanks.\nMark Begor: We have a solution that does much of that Toni. We just see it, that there's a ton of friction for the customer, whether it's a mortgage originator, an auto lender, and a lot of friction for the consumer. And remember, if you think about our data set, the 161 million records that we have today or 120 million SSNs, you know that's against 160 million non-form payroll. So in non-form there's 40 million people not in our data set that are out getting mortgages and doing other products. And then when you add pension and the self-employed individuals, there's another call it close to $100 million in total. So the solution that was announced, it\u2019s actually been in the market \u2013 I think Experian had that in the marketplace for quite some time. I'm not sure what kind of traction they're getting with it, but we just find that if there's an instant record available, it's always going to trump any of these friction filled processing, where the consumer has to put their user id and password in. In this example, the consumer would have to give there, in my case Equifax HR user id and password in order to get to my payroll records, in my sit, in my case, and most consumers that are employed in W-2 non-form payroll would have to provide those credentials if you will in order to get to that. That's against our company policy and every company policy. So there's just a ton of friction and then it's just the consumers required to do it. Where I believe there is value in some of these alternative solutions and as we talked earlier on the call, we have a manual verification team where we do manual for our customers. There\u2019s another version of what you're talking about, is in the records that we don't have. So think about the, call it $40 million non-form payroll, the $30 million to $40 million self-employed, the $20 million to $30 million pensioners. Those records, if they are not doing a solution with Equifax like our manual or our conventional solution or something like we described, it's being done manually by the company, whether it's a mortgage originator, auto lender, you pick your solution. So it's replacing that manual to really drive speed. That's where there's value in it, but just - it's very very hard to get a lot of penetration with these solutions because of the significant friction for the consumer. And my view and what we see in the market place is it won't replace instant records.\nToni Kaplan : Yes, that makes sense. I want to ask about the technology transformation and the potential revenue opportunities. So I think about it in two ways. So one, sort of faster new product introduction and you're already seeing that with the 14% Vitality Index and that was greater than last year too. Like are you already getting some benefits from the technology transformation or should we expect that to really even accelerate next year. And then I think the other benefit is the being always on and I guess I'm not sure how to quantify that benefit, either like how frequently are you not on today and sort of what's the incremental from always being on thanks.\nMark Begor: I think you're nailing at Toni about the two elements. And so on the first one you talk about really new product rollouts. The ability to roll out new products, and remember when you think about the 14 for Equifax, remember there's a bifurcation of where the different businesses are. USIS is well below the 14, because they haven't completed the cloud yet. EWS is well above 14, because they completed the cloud and are really driving those new products, and international is slightly south of the 10 or the 14. So as the businesses complete the cloud, particularly USIS and international, we would expect them to move towards the 10%, which is going to be a good thing, it's going to drive new solution there. So that's clearly one of the benefit to the cloud is the ability to leverage those scale differentiated data assets to bring more new solutions to market, and allow us to deliver long term that 10% vitality goal. Your second point is an excellent one also, and in my view it's going to be more impactful in USIS and international. Although EWS is getting real benefits of being in a cloud environment and how they're able to operate their business. The always on stability is clearly a benefit for them. The bigger benefit for Workforce is the ability to scale their data assets. There's no way they could have doubled in the last five years their twin data records without the cloud, period. It just is no way and we've gone \u2013 I think in 2018 we had something like 300,000 employers contributing to the data set, last quarter was 2.8 million. It wouldn't have happened without the cloud. So that that's another benefit of the ability to manage data that's more Workforce oriented. On the benefits of always on and faster data transmission, we believe that that's going to result in market share games. And particularly in USIS and international, where their credit file business is typically a customer will have a primary and secondary as you know. And we would expect by being always on, we're going to be a more valuable partner and allow us to move where we're tertiary or secondary into those secondary and primary positions. And I mentioned in my comments that we have deal pipelines in USIS where customers are talking to us about moving our market position, because of our investment in the cloud. Now, when will that show up in USIS revenue? Likely in \u201824 and \u201825 and \u201826 as they get you know post cloud completion and the same thing should happen in international markets where you've got that same dynamic of a customer using us and one of the other guys. We're going to be a more valuable partner being always on.\nToni Kaplan : Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Ashish Sabadra : Hi! Just wanted to ask on the OS mortgage business where the out performance compared to inquiry was much wider compared to the first quarter. There was common tree in the prepared calls around improved pricing, but I was just wondering if there was another step up in pricing in the second quarter or was this more driven by mix or other tailwinds.\nMark Begor: Yes, truly carry over the pricing comment was really for both businesses. EWS did their normal one-one price increase that's just carrying through. But so no incremental price increase, we have no intention to do that. We basically focus on doing annual price increase in all our businesses. As you may remember back in January or February in the earnings call, we talked about a larger price increase in USIS related to one of our partners who has a credit score and everyone knows who I'm talking about, its FICO, who put through a price increase in both Equifax and Experian deliver that price increase to the marketplace when they increase the price of their credit score. So that holds through in mortgage is what we're talking about, a fairly sizable pricing crease that we mark up to maintain our margins and there's no change in that, that's just rolling through the year.\nJohn Gamble: And if your comparing first quarter to second quarter. The full effect of the price increase Market talking about didn't impact the first quarter, but it did the second quarter.\nQ \u2013 Ashish Sabadra : Yes, that's very helpful color. And then maybe just on the background screener side, have you seen any change in their use of the waterfall model or any change in the market dynamics there? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, I think we talked about the big market macro of less hiring taking place in \u201820. It really started two, three quarters ago. It started in the second half of 2022 when you saw companies announcing hiring freezes and layoffs and that's carried through the second quarter. That's kind of the macro that's taking place. The real opportunity for us is that we have fairly low market share of using our instant data, whether it's employment or education, our new education solution, newer education solution, for background screen. So that's where we're rolling out new products and you\u2019re working to add new customers and get them to convert from doing manual employment verification to using our instant solution.\nQ \u2013 Ashish Sabadra : That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Seth Weber of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weber : Hey! Good morning guys. Mark, you mentioned the resumption of student loans that's expected to pinch credit scores, maybe weigh on consumer balance sheets. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of that rolling through? If there was a lag effect and any dynamics between prime and subprime categories? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, I think as you know, there's a lot of political elements to that. That has somewhat been episodic as far as announcements and then legal challenges on it. If it happens, it would be in the second half. As you point out, it will put pressure on some of the balance sheets or operating statements, operating available income for some of those recipients. It does skew to subprime consumers. So to put more pressure on those that have outstanding student debt that's been on pause for a couple of years if that actually does get resumed. I personally think it'll be absorbable inside of the kind of economic environment that we have. What's positive for those impacted consumers is that there are individuals, most of them working. So they still have \u2013 in this employment environment they've got you know jobs and they'll have to adjust likely they're spending behavior. It may crimp their ability or desire to get new credit, but it should be a fairly small portion of the full population.\nSeth Weber : Got it, thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for John. I think the \u2013 just looking at your margin guidance for the year, the international segment, I think the guide for the full year implies the fourth quarter is north of 30%. Is that the right way to think about it? And is there something going on there that creates this kind of hockey stick move in the back half the year, in the fourth quarter. Thanks.\nMark Begor: I think all the business. John, I\u2019ll let you jump in, but as you know international, USIS and EWS are a part of the cloud and broader cost restructuring program that we increased by $10 million in the second half. So all the businesses, that's primarily second half oriented. There wasn't much in the first quarter of that cost program, there was some in the second, but it really picks up steam in the third and fourth so which is why we have to carry over benefit in 2024 that will be a good positive for us next year. Would you add anything on international specifically?\nJohn Gamble: No, we are expecting to see nice improvement in international margins. I think the number you're quoting might be a little lofty. But we are expecting to see nice improvement in international margins and it's driven by the fact that they are driving revenue improvements. They generally get stronger revenue in the fourth quarter. We are expecting that to continue and they are doing a really nice job as Mark said on cost on cost management. So those are the drivers.\nSeth Weber : Got it, okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong : Hi! Thanks. Good morning. In EWS you talked about how mortgage originators are taking some of their manual verifications in-houses as volumes come down. Can you talk about in sourcing trends you're seeing in the non-mortgage business in response to volume and/or pricing trends?\nMark Begor: George, are you talking about like in auto or background screening or government, what?\nGeorge Tong : Yes, non-mortgage broadly, in non-government, non-mortgage.\nMark Begor: Maybe quite simply is we're not. We are not seeing any impact of kind of in sourcing if you will income or employment verifications in non-mortgage. And the mortgage piece is really quite specifically around the manual operation that we have in Iowa. We saw some pressures around us reducing \u2013 requests from customers for us to reduce our pricing which would impact our margins, which are thinner if you will there than they are instant verifications, because they have capacity to do the manual verifications in house and we decided to let those move in house, but not on the instant side and not in the non-mortgage.\nGeorge Tong : Got it. And you mentioned a strength in the USI business from increased shopping activity. Can you elaborate on some of the trends you're seeing there and how sustainable that shopping activity is?\nMark Begor: As George, we've been talking about it for, I don't know four, five quarters. As rates were coming up, we're just seeing consumers spent more time shopping around for mortgages, and as you know, every time they click on mortgage originator website, that mortgage originator will generally before they spend much time responding they have to understand who that consumer is so they pull a credit file to see whether they are going to qualify. So that is clearly a change in behavior than call it the low interest rate environment we had in 1920 and \u201821 and the early parts of \u201922, where consumers were really just taking the first mortgage they clicked on, because it was lower than their existing mortgage and a refi or met their expectations. They are just more shopping in this higher interest rate environment, which does benefit USIS. And as you know George, the EWS is generally \u2013 there's multiple pulls by EWS. There is more polls on the credit file side. But EWS is generally in the closed mortgages where they see their activity when they get further into the pipeline versus that early shopping behavior. And this is just really a prequel that the mortgage originator is doing to see whether \u2013 you know how much effort they're going to put into it and really how can they respond to that consumer about what they might qualify for.\nGeorge Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Burns for closing comments.\nTrevor Burns : Thanks everybody. If you have any follow-up questions, let me and Sam know, we'd like to get on the phone. Otherwise have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned, second quarter mortgage market originations were estimated by MBA with data through May at down about 37%, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. As shown on Slide 13, second quarter credit increase were down 33% and also in line with our April expectations. However, as Mark mentioned, we saw weaker than expected inquiry data in June, which impacted our overall mortgage revenue for the quarter. As we look to the second half of 2023, our planning does not assume a fundamental improvement in the mortgage or housing markets from the levels we saw in late June and early July. We're applying normal seasonal patterns to these current run rates of credit and twin inquiries. In the first half of 2023, credit inquiries were down about 39% year-to-year, about 8 percentage points better than the about 47% decline in mortgage originations as estimated based on MBA data. In the second quarter, this spread narrowed to about 5 percentage points. In the third and fourth quarters, we expect this elevated impact from mortgage shopping and application activity that does not result in a closed loan to continue at about 5 percentage points. Applying normal seasonal patterns to the run rate we are seeing for mortgage credit inquiries in the end of June and early July, we expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down 31% for all of 2023, which is a slight reduction from our April guidance. However, we are expecting mortgage originations to be down about 37%, reflecting about 6 percentage points of shopping behavior that benefits credit inquiries. This is about 5 percentage points weaker than the 32% we discussed in our April guidance for mortgage originations. This full year guidance for mortgage credit inquiries would result in second half mortgage credit inquiries being down about 14%, with the third and fourth quarter credit inquiries being down about 23% and 4% respectively. And applying the 5 percentage point benefit to credit inquiries relative to mortgage originations from shopping that is consistent with what we saw in the second quarter, we would estimate mortgage originations in the second half would be down just under 20%. We are expecting the number of originations to weaken slightly in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and fourth quarter originations to weaken somewhat seasonally relative to the third. As we have discussed in the past, Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue is more closely tied to mortgage originations. This reduction in 2023 expected mortgage originations relative to our April guidance reduces Workforce Solutions revenue in the second half of 2023 by about $40 million. As our expectation for USIS credit inquiries in the second half of 2023 is slightly weaker than our April guidance, USIS mortgage revenue did not change meaningfully. Turning to Slide 14, as Mark referenced earlier, in the second quarter we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS guidance and delivered well against our 2023 spending reduction plan that will now deliver $210 million in spending reduction in \u201823 versus 2022 levels, including workforce reduction, closer to data centers and additional cost control measures. For 3Q we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of about 33.5% at approximately the midpoint of our guidance range. The sequential margin expansion is driven by both revenue growth, as well as the savings related to our expanded $210 million dollar spending reduction plan Mark previously discussed. As revenue grows sequentially through the second half of '23 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, we are focused on delivering fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of about 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. Slide 15 provides our guidance for 3Q\u201823. In 3Q'23 we expect total Equifax revenue of between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion, with revenue up about 6.9% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to over 9% and will be partially offset by mortgage revenue that is down low single digits. FX is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue, and acquisitions are expected to benefit revenue by about 1%. As a reminder, this guidance does not include BVS. We'll provide more information on BVS at our October earnings call. 3Q'23 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially by about 75 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting both sequential revenue growth and the benefits of our cost actions. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are expected to be up sequentially for 2Q'23, driven by Workforce Solutions returning to revenue growth in the quarter, as well as margin improvement international. Corporate expenses for 3Q'23 are expected to be about flat with 2Q'23. Business unit performance in the third quarter is expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 7.5%. We expect non-mortgage revenue will return to over 10% growth year-to-year from continued strong growth in government and a return to growth in Talent Solutions in consumer lending verticals. EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat sequentially. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 7.5% year-to-year. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth should be up slightly from the 8% we saw this quarter, above their long term 6% to 8% revenue growth framework. Mortgage revenue is expected to return to year-to-year growth in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be down about 100 basis points sequentially, principally due to the lower revenue. International revenue is expected to be up 4.5% in constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to increase a very strong 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting sequential revenue growth and strong cost management, including the benefit of planned cost reductions. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q'23 to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share. Slide 16 provides the specifics of our 2023 full year guidance. As Mark mentioned, we're lowering our full year revenue guidance by $25 million at the midpoint of $5.3 billion from the weaker mortgage market. As Mark discussed, the reduction in revenue guidance reflects our assumption that U.S. mortgage originations will decline 37% in \u201823, 5 percentage points more than our April guidance, reducing mortgage revenue by over $40 million in Workforce Solutions. As I referenced earlier, we're seeing continued high levels of shopping, which is benefiting USIS, and as such mortgage revenue and USIS is not expected to be meaningfully impacted by the lower level of originations. Total mortgage revenue is expected to decline about 13% in 2023. Partially offsetting the reduction of Workforce Solutions, mortgage revenue is positive FX. We continue to expect non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth to be strong at above 8% in 2023, slightly stronger than our April guidance. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue is expected to grow over 11% in the second half of \u201823 as continued solid performance from USIS and international and accelerating growth in the EWS government vertical more than offset the impact of weaker U.S. hiring. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve consistently throughout 2023, with the third quarter at 33.5% and the fourth quarter at about 36%. As Mark mentioned, we remain focused on delivering both 36% EBITDA margins and over $2 per share in 4Q'23. As Mark also mentioned, we're reducing our adjusted EPS guidance for 2023 to the range of $6.85 to $7.10 per share at the midpoint of $6.98. This is a reduction of $0.22 or about $35 million in operating income. This is principally driven by the loss of over $40 million of high margin Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue. We believe that our full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Total capital spending for 2023 is expected to be slightly over $550 million. Capital spending in the second quarter was about $150 million in line with our expectations. We expect capital spending in the third quarter to decline sequentially by almost $15 million as we continue to progress U.S. and Canadian migrations to Date Fabric. CapEx as a percentage of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. As we discussed in April, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion in revenue with 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than when we first discussed in November 2021, our goal of achieving these 2025 goals. The U.S. mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down about 40% from the normal 2015 to 19 average levels we had discussed, to deliver $7 billion in revenue in 2025. Our non-mortgage revenue has grown faster than we discussed with you back in November 2021. However, even after considering the additional revenue from the BVS acquisition of recovery in the mortgage market from the levels we are seeing in 2023, of on the order of two-thirds of the loss volume still needed to achieve our $7 billion goal in 2025. We are focused on driving above market growth and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed with our expanded 2023 and 2024 spending reduction plans, and as part of our data and technology cloud transformation, which are needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins as we exceed the 7 billion revenue level. We will continue to discuss with you our progress toward our 7 billion dollar goal as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. And I would like to turn it back over to Mark. And again, as Mark said, good focus on cost, we have good visibility on cost and we do \u2013 obviously we do need to see the revenue growth we're talking about. But I think we feel very good about the sequential movements we're talking about in our non-mortgage business. We delivered well in non-mortgage other than the Talent impacts we talked about in the second quarter. And then obviously we've made an assumption on the mortgage market. We think we've made a reasonable assumption, but having the mortgage market deliberate the levels we're talking about, obviously it's also needed for us to deliver our 36% margins in the fourth quarter. Well, just I think the important thing for us also is we're continuing to drive very good performance above market, right. So again, very strong performance in the first quarter at 20 points. In the second quarter effectively 20 points if you adjust for the fact that we made a decision to not participate to the same level, in what's really a not particularly profitable manual business and we talked about how that reduced our out performance by about 300 basis points. So again, on the very high margin Digital Verification Business, again about 20 points out performance. So we feel good about our continued outperformance. We also feel good about the fact that to the extent we see a faster growing mortgage market than what we forecast that will participate very clearly and we'll see the upside from that. But, we clearly saw the reduction in transaction volume when rates moved up to above seven. It's hard to predict what's going to happen when they move back below, but to the extent that we see nice growth, from that to the extent it occurs, we think will participate well. And just as a reminder right, the actions we've already taken and the site control we have on cost broadly are allowing us to drive our margins higher in the third quarter and the fourth quarter substantially. So we think we've taken pretty significant actions already, which are allowing us to see nice improvement in margins. You've also heard some of our competitors talk about growing their manual business, and again we think that's part of the ship. This is just business that this low margin that we're moving away from. Shlomo, the other thing that's happening right, as we continue to rapidly grow our database, so the need to do manual verifications when you use Equifax continues to decline substantially, right. So given where we are at 120 million uniques against U.S. non-firm payroll of say 160 million, we're getting to the point now where the need for a manual verification when you use Equifax is very small. Sure. So really the driver was lower mortgage revenue, right. We said Workforce Solutions workers revenues down over $40 million right, so applying a very high margin to that you do get a very substantial amount of operating income. We said non-mortgage is slightly better, so for the entire company I know pieces have moved around, but in total non-mortgage is slightly better. So that wasn't a big driver a positive operating income in the changing guidance. And really the difference between the reduction of over $40 million in mortgage revenue and the down $25 million we talked about is just heavily FX which has very little flow through in terms of positive operating income, So it's really driven by the fact that we lost very high margin mortgage revenue, I mean EWS, and that really drove the reduction right. Yes, there was some cost savings, but again they weren't a big number of $10 million of incremental that we talked about. You can think that was kind of split between capital and cost. So not a big driver of recovery, so the big movement is just related to the fact that we saw the reduction in mortgage revenue. So Heather, if you look at it sequentially right, what we're talking about here in terms of EWS is really nice sequential improvement. We talked about this in government right, and we think government revenue is a big driver of our improvement. When you compared to last year, obviously last year what you saw was some weakening in the back half of the year as you saw weakening talent markets, etc. So the compare is easier, but if you just look at sequentially the performance we're talking about, we expect government to improve substantially as you move through the rest of the year. Mark covered very completely what the drivers of that are. And then sequentially we're also talking about seeing talent get a little better from where we are today. A lot of it driven by product, again, as Mark covered in his prepared margin and earlier answers. And then also on consumer finance we kind of think we've hit a bottom and we're going to \u2013 we'll see slight improvements in consumer finance sequentially, which again given what the second half of last year looked like, gives us growth rates that are substantially different than we saw on the first half. So the big driver in sequential improvement certainly is government. We're seeing some sequential improvements in the other segments in EWS, but that's how we think about the improvement and we think the trend we've already seen in government supports the level of improvement we're talking about. So again, adjusting for the impact of manual, we're at about 20 we're at about 20 last quarter. So yes, we'll have another impact. We'll have more impact as we go through the rest of this year in terms of the lower levels of manual revenue, which again very low margin right so. And fairly low revenue. So we'll see an impact from that if we go through the rest of this year, but we continue to expect to see nice out performance in the mortgage market. And if your comparing first quarter to second quarter. The full effect of the price increase Market talking about didn't impact the first quarter, but it did the second quarter.\nQ \u2013 Ashish Sabadra:Yes, that's very helpful color. And then maybe just on the background screener side, have you seen any change in their use of the waterfall model or any change in the market dynamics there? Thanks. No, we are expecting to see nice improvement in international margins. I think the number you're quoting might be a little lofty. But we are expecting to see nice improvement in international margins and it's driven by the fact that they are driving revenue improvements. They generally get stronger revenue in the fourth quarter. We are expecting that to continue and they are doing a really nice job as Mark said on cost on cost management. So those are the drivers."

            "content": "So, your first question, it is 21%, the answer your first question. And as we take a look at EWS, Mark talked about it very \u2013 I think fairly completely right. What we're seeing is we're expecting to see nice sequential improvements. I'm talking specifically about non-mortgage as we move through third quarter and into fourth quarter. A lot of it driven by very strong growth in government, which we feel very good about and the strength we're seeing in the government business, not only in the third and fourth quarter, but we've seen in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And we're also expecting to move back to see sequential growth in Talent driven by new product, and also in our consumer lending businesses, also driven by new product and to some extent penetration. So we think those factors allow us to see nice sequential growth as we go through the year. And as on mortgage and as we're now comparing against easier comps as we get into the second half of 2023 versus 2022, we see better growth rates. You're also going to see obviously better growth rates in mortgage, although we took mortgage down, right, the level of decline in mortgage year-on-year and originations declined substantially going through the year, we can expect to continue to have very good mortgage out performance in EWS, so that allows us to return to growth in EWS mortgages we get toward the best of the very end of this year. So with those two factors together, we think we're going to see nice acceleration in EWS revenue as we go through the rest of this year. In terms of Talent Market I don't think we gave a percentage. I think in April we talked about the market being down like 10%. We said June was worse and that we're expecting that weaker level of the Talent Market to continue through the rest of the year. We didn't really give a number, but weaker than the 10% we talked about in April."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor. Good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we executed well in the second quarter against a challenging mortgage and hiring markets, while delivering on our 2023 financial objectives. We continued to outperform our underlying markets with broad-based 6% non-mortgage growth against a tough 22% comp last year. We continued strong mortgage outperformance in a challenging market and very strong new product growth with a record 14% vitality index. We also executed well against the $200 million cloud and broad-based spending reduction program we announced in February and delivered 350 basis points of sequential margin expansion in the quarter. Globally, with the exception of the U.S. mortgage and hiring markets, we continue to see good customer demand across our consumer \u2013 good customer demand across our consumer, commercial and government lines of business. However, the U.S. mortgage market weakened relative to our expectations as we moved through the latter portions of the second quarter when mortgage rates moved above 7%, which will impact our results in the second half. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.71 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.7%, both above the guidance we provided in April. Execution against our cloud and broader spending reduction programs was also very strong and drove the 350 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Revenue at $1.318 billion was close to the midpoint of guidance with USIS and International delivering strong quarters, both above our expectations. EWS non-mortgage revenue at up 4% was below our expectations, but off a very strong 52% comp last year, principally due to the weaker hiring market that impacted our talent solutions and onboarding businesses. EWS had outstanding operational execution in the quarter, delivering a new product vitality index of 25% and expanded current twin records by 12% to 161 million records, a growth of 5 million records sequentially. EWS also had strong cost management as they fully operational their new cloud capabilities, delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and stronger than our expectations. USIS had an outstanding quarter and delivered almost 6% revenue growth, much stronger than our expectations. Total non-mortgage revenue grew 8%, led by 9% growth in our B2B online and 10% growth in consumer solutions and adjusted EBITDA margins of 36% were also stronger than our expectations, expanding over 300 basis points sequentially. Total U.S. mortgage revenue from both USIS and EWS was down about 13% or 24 points better than the 37% market decline from pricing actions, new products, records and penetration. We continue to see stronger than expected consumer shopping behavior in these higher interest rate environments. So the weaker mortgage market we saw in June had a much smaller impact on USIS than in EWS, where their mortgage activity is more aligned with closed loans. International delivered 7% growth in constant currency, also stronger than our expectations with double digit growth in Latin America and high single digit growth in Canada and the UK CRA. International delivered 24.2% adjusted EBITDA margins of 70 bips sequentially and stronger than our expectations. New product innovation leveraging our differentiated data assets and new capabilities delivered by the Equifax cloud is also executing at a very high level. Our new product vitality index of over 14% in the quarter was a record for Equifax and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal and up over 100 basis points sequentially. This is encouraging for the future and reinforces our long-term strategy of leveraging our differentiated data assets, our new cloud capabilities to deliver new solutions for our customers. We continue to make good progress on completing our cloud transformation. At the end of the quarter, over 70% of North American revenue was being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. We're convinced that our Equifax Cloud, Single Data Fabric and AI Capabilities will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. As we look to the second half, we expect the weaker than expected U.S. mortgage market that we saw in the latter half of the quarter to continue through the remainder of the year. Our updated guidance is for U.S. mortgage originations to be down about 37% for the year and about 20% in the second half, a reduction of five points from our prior full-year framework. We expect EFX mortgage origination outperformance to continue to be very strong in 2023. We're also expecting to see weaker U.S. hiring market continue through for the remainder of the year, impacting Workforce Solutions talent and onboarding businesses. However, we expect to offset the hiring weakness principally from strength in the Workforce Solutions government business and continued solid performances at USIS and international. EFX non-mortgage revenue growth was up 6%, up a very strong 22% comp last year. We expect non-mortgage revenue growth to strengthen in the second half to up 11% and up over 300 basis points sequentially relative to the first half from continued commercial execution and strong new product rollouts. Our 2023 cloud and broader cost reduction program executed well in the quarter. As we continue to operate more of Equifax in the new cloud environment, we're seeing more opportunities for efficiencies and expect an additional $10 million of spending reductions in the second half. These new actions will deliver additional run rate savings of $25 million next year. So we now expect to deliver spending reductions of $210 million this year and over $275 million in 2024. And as a reminder, the 2023 savings are weighted to the second half and will deliver $65 million of 2024 run rate benefit. We expect the weaker mortgage originations to impact our mortgage revenue by about $40 million in the second half. Despite the weakening in U.S. hiring, we expect to deliver 2023 non-mortgage revenue growth of about 8% from strong growth in EWS government, USIS non-mortgage and international and stronger NPI growth. This above 8% non-mortgage growth is against a strong 20% non-mortgage growth last year, and well within our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. The net impact of the weaker than expected mortgage market of about $40 million, partially offset by positive FX, is a reduction of our 2023 revenue guidance at the midpoint by $25 million to about $5.3 billion. The impact of the lower mortgage revenue results in a reduction of our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance at the midpoint of $0.22 to $6.98 per share. We remain focused on delivering EBITDA margins of 36% and over $2 in adjusted EPS per share in the fourth quarter, which we believe sets us up well for 2024 and beyond. In June we received shareholder approval for the acquisition of Boa Vista Servic\u0327os, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil. We're energized to complete this strategic and financially attractive acquisition. We expect the transaction to close in early August and are actively planning for integration and the transfer of our cloud capabilities, global platforms and products to help accelerate BVS growth. The BVS acquisition will add approximately $160 million of year one run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market, and we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to year one adjusted EPS. The guidance we provided for 2023 does not include BVS. We intend to provide more details on our expectations for BVS in 2023 at our October earnings call after we close the deal. Before I cover results in more detail, I wanted to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer. Since our April update, outside the challenging mortgage and hiring markets I already discussed, the U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. We continue to navigate a higher interest rate environment that's negatively impacting the U.S. mortgage market. Mortgage interest rates have trended upward since April and were slightly above 7% at the beginning of July and were just under 7% at the end of last week, which is clearly impacting originations. We expect mortgage originations, as I mentioned earlier, to further weaken in the second half with originations down about 37% in 2023 or 500 basis points weaker than our April framework. Broadly, consumers are still strong and working with unemployment at historically low levels, and the market is resilient with roughly 10 million open jobs against 5 million people who are looking for jobs. Inflation is starting to abate at 3% in July, which should mean we are approaching a peak in Fed interest rates. Consumers are spending and borrowing with average credit card and personal loan balances back above pre-pandemic levels. With consumers working and still leveraging pre-cloud stimulus and savings, delinquencies are still at historic low levels, and close to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Subprime DQs are the only areas of stress that we're seeing. We're also seeing credit card and personal loan utilization increases with some delinquency increases in subprime, but more broadly delinquencies are back at pre-pandemic levels, which as we all know were very low, although they remain significantly below levels we saw in the last economic event in 2009 and 2010. Auto delinquency rates for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels, as well as above levels we saw in \u201808 and \u2013 I'm sorry, \u201809 and \u201810. We believe there's been some credit tightening by our financial customers, but principally in FinTech and subprime. And looking forward, consumers holding student loans will need to resume making payments to begin in October, and we believe removing student loan payment fees will have a modest increase \u2013 a decrease on average credit scores. Beyond the weaker motors market and slowing white-collar hiring market, which had a larger impact on EWS than we anticipated in the quarter. The combination of white-collar job reductions and broad hiring freezes has reduced both background screening and onboarding activity, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect this to continue in the second half. Turning to Slide 5, Workforce Solutions revenue was down 4% in the quarter. Mortgage revenue was down 20%, but up about 3 percentage points sequentially. The decline of 20% compares to a mortgage origination down 37% as estimated by MBA based on data through May. As I mentioned, overall market performance in the latter part of the quarter weakened relative to our expectations, resulting in lower mortgage revenue than we expected in our April framework. Strong record growth, the positive impact of 2023 price actions, and strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of our Mortgage 36 Solution, which is a 36-month trended mortgage product, drove to 17 points of mortgage outperformance by EWS in the quarter. And during the quarter, about 50% of twin mortgage inquiries were for products that include EWS trended or historical information, and of course, these are all at higher price points. In the quarter, Workforce Solutions saw declines in low margin, manual mortgage verification services revenue, as some customers move some of these activities back in-house. And this negatively impacted mortgage outperformance by about 300 basis points in the quarter. EWS had another very strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 5 million records added to the twin database, ending the quarter with 161 million current records, which was up 12%, with 120 million unique records or SSNs, which was up almost 10%. Over the past five years, EWS has doubled the size of the twin database, a strong testament to the record acquisition strategy EWS has executed across the multiple segments of direct employers, third party payroll providers, HR software management companies, pension administrators, and self-employed individuals. As a reminder, twin's 120 million unique records represent individuals or SSNs on the twin database, and their 161 million current records represent current active jobs on the database, which means there's close to 40 million individuals in our data set that have more than one job, including self-employed or 1099 employees and people on defined benefit pension plans, we now covered just over 50% of the 220 million working and income producing individuals in the United States. And through our cloud tech transformation, we're expanding our capabilities to ingest all levels of records, including 1099 based self-employment records. And as a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers, as they are customers of our expanding employer services business, and the remaining are contributed through partnerships, principally with payroll companies. During the quarter we signed agreements with four new payroll processors that will deliver records during the rest of the year. The twin database now has 631 million total current and historical records, from over 2.8 million employers in the United States. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporating current and historical records, with about 50% of second quarter verification services revenue, coming from products that included historical records. Turning the Slide 6, Workforce Solutions delivered non-mortgage revenue growth about 4%, with non-mortgage revenue, now representing over 70% of Workforce Solutions revenue. And as a reminder, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 52% in second quarter last year, which was a very tough comp. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue which now represents about two thirds of verified revenue delivered 4% growth both sequentially and versus last year in the quarter, which was below our expectations. This was also against a very challenging 90% non-mortgage growth comp by Workforce Solutions last year. The miss versus expectations was predominantly in-town solutions from weaker white color hiring. Government performed exceptionally well, consistent with the high growth that we had expected and consumer finance declined somewhat in the quarter. In government we saw continued very strong growth with revenue up 21% off over a 100% growth last year in second quarter. And revenue also up almost 10% sequentially driven by strong growth was CMS at the state level, new products in twin record growth. Government now represents about 45% of verifier non-mortgage revenue. We expect to see accelerating sequential growth in our government vertical in the second half, driven by growth from CMS Medicaid re-determinations, ACA open enrollment volume, further state penetration and pricing from state contract renewals. We began to see incremental volumes from CMS re-determinations in May and expect to see this accelerate in the second half. This strong sequential growth will also result in accelerated second half EWS growth rates. Talent Solutions were down 6% in the quarter, but up about 1% sequentially, as we are comping off a very strong 130% growth last year from record levels of hiring in the second quarter. Also as a reminder, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white collar workers including technology, professional services, health care and financial services, which has seen greater reductions in hiring activity and broader hiring freezes than the about 7% decline that BLS is reporting through May. Approaching 70% of Talent Solutions revenue in the quarter was from industries that had negative hiring growth versus last year, with many of those industries having significant double-digit negative growth in the quarter. We are out growing the declining market from penetration of our digital solutions with background screeners, strong new product growth, continued expansion of twin records in favorable pricing. We are also seeing continued customer penetration of our new differentiated educational products. We expect these new products to continue to drive above underlying market talent revenue growth through 2023 and in a 2024 beyond. The consumer lending vertical and Workforce Solutions which includes P-Loan, card, auto and debt management was about flat sequentially, but down 11% versus last year to lower auto volumes with financial services and P-Loan declines with FinTech lenders, both principally in the subprime space. We expect modest consumer lending sequential growth in the second half driven by record growth penetration in pricing. This will result in revenue growth in the second half as we lap 2022 headwinds in the auto and P-Loan verticals. In total, we expect to see accelerated sequential growth in verifier non-mortgage in the second half, driven by strong government growth, as well as moderate sequential growth in talent and consumer lending. Employer Services revenue of $109 million was up 4% driven by growth in our I-9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring. In total, our UC and ERC businesses were up slightly. Despite the slowdown in U.S. hiring, we have not seen an increase in UC revenue yet. As a reminder, first quarter employer service revenues were seasonally higher than other quarters due to the higher Affordable Care Act in W-2 volumes. In the third and fourth quarters we expect to see overall growth in Employer Services sequentially from the second quarter levels driven by penetration and I-9 onboarding. Workflow Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5% were up 110 bips from first quarter and in line with our April guidance from strong operational execution. The EWS team continued to perform well despite the macro headwinds from mortgage in U.S. hiring, outpeforming the underlying markets from strong record growth, new products, penetration and price. As shown on Slide 7, USIS revenue of $445 million was up 6% and much better than our expectations due to stronger mortgage and non-mortgage performance. USIS mortgage revenue was down less than 1% and outperformed the mortgage market credit inquiries that were down 33% by more than 30 points. The strong pricing environment that we discussed in April, both from the addition of Telecom & Utilities attributes to our new mortgage credit solution and the increased pricing for credit scores drove the very strong out performance. At $113 million mortgage revenue was 25% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Mortgage credit increase again outperformed MBA's current estimate of originations by about five points from increased shopping behavior. We expect this increase shopping behavior to continue as we move through the remainder of the year. Total non-mortgage revenue of $332 million was up 8% in the quarter, with organic growth of about 4% and better than our expectations. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $278 million which represented over 60% of total USIS revenue was up 7% with organic revenue growth of 3%. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up 9% total and 3% organically. During the quarter online revenue had strong double digit growth in commercial and identity and fraud with auto approaching 10% growth and telco and insurance growing low single digits. Banking was up slightly consistent with first quarter, with market volumes at larger financial institutions offsetting declines with smaller financial institutions and FinTechs that were more principally focused on subprime. Financial Marketing Services or B2B offline business had revenue of $56 million that was up 1%. Strong revenue growth in fraud and header, as well as risk and account reviews was partially offset by declines in marketing, principally pre-screen marketing with IXI wealth revenue growth about flat. Pre-screen marketing revenue was at similar levels at first quarter as we continue to see significant weakness from smaller FIs and FinTech in the subprime space, which was partially offset by growth from larger FIs. USIS is using the power of their ignite platform along with their proprietary data to ensure customers \u2013 to enable customers to drive deeper marketing insights and identifying extending offers to better prospects and delivering better marketing performance management. USIS has seen incremental penetration of growing pipeline from our advanced ignite capabilities. We did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but have not seen a meaningful increase in our risk-based portfolio reviews that typically pick up during challenging economic times. USIS consumer solutions direct-to-consumer business had another strong quarter with revenue up $54 million, up 10% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. USIS is winning in the marketplace with strong momentum from new solutions and differentiated data and key verticals of identity and fraud, commercial and auto. We're also in active dialogues with USIS customers about the competitive benefits of the Equifax Cloud that will deliver always unsubility, faster data speeds and Equifax Cloud enabled new products driving us, which is driving a strong active new deal pipeline, which was up from the first quarter. Todd and the USIS team are on offense as they complete their cloud transformation and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capabilities to deliver new products. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 36% in the quarter, up 340 basis points sequentially and the strongest USUS margins since the beginning of the mortgage market decline a year ago. EBITDA margins were up sequentially from better than expected revenue performance and good execution against their cloud and broader cost reduction program. Turning the Slide 8, international revenue was $290 million, up 7% in constant currency and better than our expectations. Europe local currency revenue was down 2% through the expected about 16% decline in our U.K. debt management business. As we discussed previously, our U.K. debt management business was very strong in the first half last year, as the U.K. government made large catch up debt placements following COVID debt collection moratoriums. As a result, we expect to see declines in the first half versus last year. We expected to see those declines. However, we do not expect \u2013 we do expect to see consistent sequential debt management growth as we move through the second half and we expect debt management to return to revenue growth later this year. Our U.K. and Spain CRA business revenue was up 7% in the quarter in a very good performance. This strong performance was driven principally by strong growth within identity and fraud decisioning consumer and direct-to-consumer. Asia Pacific delivered solid local currency revenue growth at 4%, with growth in commercial identity and fraud and D2C, as well as continued very strong growth in our India business which was up 38% in the quarter. Latin America local currency revenue was up a very strong 23%, driven by double digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of strong double digit growth for Latin America which we expect to continue in the second half. Canada local currency revenue was up 8% with broad base growth in consumer and identity and fraud decisioning and commercial. In Canada we recently completed a full migration to our new cloud base fraud IQ exchange and now have all of our Canadian fraud exchange customers on this new cloud based solution. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.2% were up 70 basis points sequentially and better than our expectations. The improvement was driven by good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans. Turning now to Slide 9 and the second quarter overall non-mortgage, constant dollar revenue growth of 6% was lower than our expectations, but against a very strong 22% growth last year. USIS and international, both delivered stronger non-mortgage growth than we expected. This was offset by the slower growth in EWS non-mortgage that I mentioned earlier in Talent and non-boarding, despite their very strong growth in their government business. As we looked at the second half, we expect non-mortgage revenue growth to grow sequentially in the third and fourth quarter, led by very strong growth in the EWS government business, and growth in EWS talent and consumer lending from new products. We also expect continued strong performance in USIS and international, resulting in third quarter Equifax non-mortgage revenue growth above 9%, which is well within our 8% to 12% long term growth framework. Turning to Slide 10, new product introductions leveraging our differentiated data and the Equifax Cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. In the second quarter we launched over 30 new products and delivered a record 14% Vitality Index. Our second quarter VI was again led by strong performances in EWS and Latin America. In the second quarter over 80% of our new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the Equifax Cloud. Leveraging our Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product roll-outs, we expect to deliver Vitality Index of approximately 13% in 2023, which is 300 basis points above our 10% long term Vitality Goal Index. This equates to about $700 million of revenue in 2023 from new products introduced in the past three years. New products leveraging our differentiated data, Equifax Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long term growth framework in driving Equifax top line and margins. On the right side of the slide we highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud and driving innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities. We launched a new product this quarter, Talent Report Flex 2.0, a customizable pre-higher employment verification solution, that helps solve the challenge background screeners and HR professionals may experience when seeking to verify a candidate specific employment records. With a unique and first-to-market employer preview option, a list of employer names is now available on the work number using a candidate's SSM. This allows the customization of the employment history report by selecting only the records wanted. With the power of the Equifax Cloud, we'll bring new solutions to market to meet the needs of our customers. Turning the Slide 10, we were very excited to receive shareholder approval for our new Boa Vista acquisition in late June. BVS is the second largest credit bureau in the fast growing Brazilian market with over a $2 billion TAM. We expect the transaction to close and early August and Equifax will be able to provide Boa Vista with access to expansive Equifax international capabilities, our cloud native data, products decisioning and analytic technology for the rapid development of new products and services and expansion into new verticals like identity and fraud in Brazil. As a reminder, I mentioned earlier, we expect Boa Vista to deliver approximately $160 million in run rate revenue to Equifax and to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first year. As I mentioned earlier, Boa Vista results are not included in the guidance we're providing today. We'll provide more detail on Boa Vista's impact in 2023 during our October earnings call after the transaction is closed. Given the size of the transaction, we plan to pause on M&A activity in the second half to focus on integration of BVS and our \u201821 and \u201822 acquisitions. And our intention is to use excess free cash flow over the coming quarters to pay down debt and reduce our leverage. Turning this Slide 12, we believe that artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing Equifax business capabilities and is becoming table-sticks for data analytics companies to manage increasingly large diverse and complex data sets, within a highly regulated data bringing unique complex challenges around AI explainability. On the left side of Side 12, our large and diverse proprietary data base \u2013 data set is a big differentiator for Equifax including our income and employment data, traditional alternative credit data, cell phone, utility and Pay TV data, identity and fraud data in our commercial and wealth data. This proprietary data at scale, heat and length in our new Single Data Fabric gives us significant advantages in using AI to build advanced models, scores and products including identity and fraud solutions, enabled by our best in class Equifax Cloud native technology. To date, Equifax has about 70 approved AI patents supporting our AI NeuroDecision Technology which we call NDT, and Explainable AI which is critical to ensuring that the correct data is used to make credit decisions that surface by AI models and scores. Equifax will continue to invest in AI as we may remain on offense, leveraging Google's Vertex AI capabilities, combined with our own Equifax NDT capabilities will be building more predictive and valuable models and scores with our expanding data set, and accelerating the speed at which we develop new model scores and products to bring more current solutions to our customers. We believe Equifax is uniquely positioned to capture the value of AI going forward. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our third quarter and full year guidance. We're executing very well against our strategic priorities and delivering revenue growth and expanding margins in a challenging macro environment. Thanks John. Wrapping up on slide 17, Equifax delivered a solid quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS above our guidance despite the challenging mortgage and hiring markets. USIS and international delivered strong quarters offsetting some weakness in the EWS Talent and Onboarding businesses, to allow us to deliver revenue at about the midpoint and EPS above guidance. The breadth and depth of our businesses and execution against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction program allowed us to deliver despite a challenging macro environment. Summarizing at the business unit level, Workforce Solutions continue to deliver against their long-term growth strategy. While their 4% revenue decline was pressured by mortgage and hiring macros, they were comping off a very strong 21% growth last year. We expect that growth to recover in the second half, and importantly EWS had another very strong quarter of twin record additions, adding formula payroll providers, which brings a total added since the beginning of last year to 17, and increased current records to $161 million, up $5 million from the third quarter and toward 12% versus last year, with total records growing to $631 million. Workforce delivered a very strong NPI vitality index of 25%, leveraging their cloud capabilities which will benefit them in the second half and in \u201824 and beyond. In the continued growth of Twin, strong NPI and government growth positions EWS for 15% growth in the second half. And EWS operating focus delivered 51.5% EBITDA margins, which is up over 100 basis points and stronger than we expected. Second, USIS continued their momentum for the first quarter was strong non-mortgage growth of 8% total and at the top end of their long-term framework and 4% organic, driven by online B2B non-mortgage growth of 9% total and 4% organic, as they focus on customer migrations to the Equifax Cloud. USIS delivered EBITDA margins of 36%, up over 300 basis points sequentially through revenue growth and strong cost management. International delivered strong 7% local currency growth with strong growth in what's Latin America, Canada, India and our European credit businesses. And they delivered EBITDA margins of 24%, up 70 basis points and stronger than our expectations. As mentioned earlier, our second quarter Vitality Index of 14% is an Equifax record and was 400 bips above our 10% long-term growth framework, as we've delivered over 60 new products year-to-date, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. The focus of our Equifax Cloud Data and Technology Transformation is in completing those North American migrations, which will allow us to further accelerate new product launches and complete legacy system decommissioning. Our Cloud native technology will differentiate Equifax and allows us to be an offense with leading systems stability and capabilities that position us to leverage AI tools to drive revenue growth and cost efficiencies. We're executing well against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction plan that will now deliver $210 million of savings this year, with run rate savings of $275 million in 2024. And this is up $10 million in \u201823 and $25 million in \u201824 from our April framework. We remain focused on delivering 36% adjusted EBITDA margins and over $2 per share in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter, which sets us up well for 2024. And we're energized about receiving shareholder approval for the BVS acquisition in June, and we're on track to close this strategic and financially attractive acquisition in early August. And as mentioned earlier given the weaker than expected mortgage market, we're lowering our full year revenue guidance by $25 million to $5.3 billion at the midpoint, with full year 2023 adjusted EPS at the midpoint to be down $0.22 per share to $6.98 from the impact of the lower high \u2013 high \u2013 lower but high margin mortgage revenue. We're energized to be entering the next chapter of new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. This is an exciting time for Equifax \u2013 exciting time for Equifax, and we're convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets, and our new Single Data Fabric and our market leading businesses will deliver higher growth expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. I'll start Manav and John can jump in. So we'll leave the revenue leverage aside, so we have \u2013 you know we think its good visibility outside of the mortgage piece. As you know, we increased our cost program by another $10 million this year and $25 million next year. So we see additional efficiencies as we get further into the cloud completion. So combining that with the core program we announced in February, we just have a lot of visibility, because we know when contractors are leaving and when we're taking other cost actions. So that that gives us a lot of confidence in the cost side of that across all the businesses and at the corporate level. John, I'll let you jump on the hiring assumption, but you know we did mention Manav that for example in mortgage, we're seeing some mortgage originators move manual verifications back from Equifax in-house, so that had an impact us on the quarter. We expect that to continue, so that it is clearly a revenue impact and what we're seeing is that you've got mortgage originators doing less activity, so they've got people sitting in their offices and they are deciding to do some of those manual verifications in-house, so that clearly had an impact. I think there was no question that experience through, to a lesser degree, Transunion and they're kind of new focus on this or. In the marketplace we don't see that being a meaningful impact on our revenue, but they are definitely out there and they are doing more than they were a year ago. So that clearly also has an impact, particularly probably in mortgage. Yes, I think there's a lot of factors Kevin in the mortgage space. Clearly higher rates \u2013 you know I think the uncertainty around rates is as much as that consumers that are thinking about purchasing a home. Rates go up towards that 7%. They pull back and wait to see what's happening. Where will rates stabilize is an activity that we're definitely seeing. There's an element of \u2013 and you've read about this, you see it, as if the shortage of housing stock. You mean there isn't a lot of inventory out there for people to make home purchases. Those that own homes are doing \u2013 are not upgrading, you know meaning, going buying a larger home or moving in a different neighborhood in town, because of the low rate they're currently sitting on in their mortgage and some uncertainty about where rates are going. So we believe that there's some element of rate stabilization that consumers will increase their activity from that. I don't think we're thinking about rate reductions. You know that'll happen sometime in the future, whether it's a year from now or in \u201825 or \u201826 you know going forward. But as a reminder, we've never seen purchase volume declines at this level, that from historical levels we're well below 40% of below historic levels, excluding kind of a refi boom that we had in '20 and \u201821 and '22. You know that just has never happened before, so it's our view that at some point we'll return to normal historical levels, you know whether that's in a year from now, as people get more comfortable operating in a 6%, 7% mortgage interest rate environment where it's into '26. There'll be return to normalization over time is our expectation. What would you add John? Then at some point on the other side it is high inflationary environment where the feds had to raise interest rates. There'll be a time \u2013 I'm not an economist, but at some point in the future, the feds going to reduce interest rates to boost economic activity. It's just the cycle that we typically have and there'll be another refi window whether that's in '25, '26, \u201827 but we'll be well positioned for that, and it's been a very high incremental margins on mortgage revenue declines or mortgage revenue growth. We'll see the other side of that at some point in the future at Equifax. Yes, there's a bunch of factors driving government which is the good news for us. You know it's a very important, fast growing segment of Workforce Solutions. It's one where we have a very, very strong market position given the scale of our data set to 630 million you know historical records and our active records. You point out one of the levers you know on the re-determination, we saw some of that activity pick up in May and June and we expect that to continue in third quarter and fourth quarter and much of that to be a 2023 event which is positive. We're also seeing more ACA volume. We're getting more penetration at the state level. Remember this business, which is approaching $500 million is in a TAM that's close to $3 billion and each state and each agency at the state level are separate organizations and we have a commercial team that's headquartered at many of the state capitals that's working to bring our solutions to convert current manual activity around verifications for whether it's unemployment claims or childcare support, food support, all the other social services to convert them from manual to using our automated solution. So that's a big lever for growth is we add more states and more agencies, so that we have a pipeline. We have visibility around those relationships. Another lever is we're constantly renegotiating those individual contracts that we have. And again remember, 50 states. Think about maybe six or eight agencies in each state that we have relationships with a portion of them. The ones that we have, those contracts come up and we worked \u2013 increase price for the additional value that we're delivering. And then the other lever we have is at the federal level. We have federal programs with some of the big organizations. You mentioned one security administration, those are also growth programs for us at the government level. Yes, so we participate in all employees. We're making the point that we with our current customer base, again customers being background screeners. The customers that we have tend to over index to white collar jobs, which is why we're seeing more of an impact right now. But we have a lot of blue collar jobs coming through and employment verification work that we do. The new solution on hourly has only been in the marketplace for 30 days, so it's very new but we've seen very positive traction. We think it's not only going to drive penetration, with our existing customers, but it's also going to allow them to drive growth and their business. Meaning they can go out and pick up more volume or share in those kind of employees doing verification work. We also talked about some of the other solutions we have outside of just employment history. We've seen very positive growth in our education solution, where we have an instant solution around verifying education backgrounds which is used in a lot of white collar job. That's a newer solution for us that we've been in the marketplace for call it a year, but we're growing a lot of usage and share with that, so that's a positive for the Talent business. And then the last one is you know, we have our insights business that we acquired a couple years ago that has the incarceration data and that's another one where we're bringing new products to market and new solutions. So for talent, you've got the ability to drive penetration. That business is a north of $400 million at run rate in a $4 billion TAM, so there's a lot of penetration growth opportunity there. A lot of our new product focuses around Talent. You talked about the solution for the hourly work force that we rolled out about a month ago and then we rolled out one a couple weeks ago. It provides more flexibility about which employers our customers want to focus on foreign employee, you know that's another solution that should drive growth. So new products are a big focus of ours in the Talent vertical. It's pretty broad based. I think you look at them like we do. You see less of them, but in the first half of the year you saw companies left and right announcing either layoffs or hiring freezes. I think it was Ford a couple of weeks ago announced another white color reduction, if a company is reducing people and making those kind of announcements, they also typically have a hiring freeze in place. So there's less inbound, new hires coming in. So that clearly is not \u2013 it didn't just happen in late in the quarter, it's been happening for quite some time as we've kind of nine months into that hiring reduction that has had an impact on, is that we've been able to outgrow through pricing in 2023, through new products, through penetration, in adding new customers in the background screening space, but it's clearly had an impact, and we expected it to continue to be an impact in the second half and we've laid that into our framework. I think as you know we're going to have a $65 million of run rate benefit next year, because a lot of the actions from the broader cost and cloud program that we have in 2023 are in the second half, so that'll be a benefit. And we've talked previously that we still expect to get further cloud efficiencies in \u201824 and \u201825 as we complete the cloud. We're at 70% now. We still got that remaining 30% of Equifax to complete over the next couple of years, and as we complete that cloud we expect to see further efficiencies that will benefit our margins and in margin rate in \u201824 and '25, including the carry over benefit of the cloud actions that we're taking you know in broader restructuring in 2023. And maybe one other point, I wouldn't think about the actions is being aligned with a revenue decline, that's not how we operate our business. The program we announced in February you expected. We talked about it last year that we would be reducing our costs as we complete the cloud. This is something we've been talking about for years. And as we said in February, in April, and again today, we're just seeing broader opportunities to improve our efficiencies as we get further into the cloud. The real backbone of these cost efficiencies and margin expansions are what we've talked about for the last three or four years and it's really driven by our ability to get closer to completion of our cloud investment. Yes, you've got to kind of break some pieces apart there. Mortgage obviously has had a huge impact on our business. It's been \u2013 we've never seen a mortgage decline like this to be 40% below \u2013 well over 40%. I think it's 45% below historic levels in the second half. It's just never happened before, that's going to recover right. It's just a matter of when will it return to call it norm, that minus 45 and that'll be a very positive thing for Equifax, and whether it's '24, \u201825 or '26, the mortgage market is not going to stay at this level. People are going to buy houses, people keep moving and then add on it at some point. When rates start coming down again from these higher levels which should happen, there'll be a refi element, so that's kind of mortgage. We're very pleased, and I hope most of our investors are of our ability to continue to drive the 80% of Equifax it's not mortgage quite strongly in what you characterize as a uncertain economic environment, the diversity of our businesses. If you look at Equifax 10 years ago being primarily a credit bureau and now you \u2013 we're talking on this call predominantly around our talent vertical and government vertical that didn't exist 10 years ago. And talent you know still performing even with a macro impact and government super strong just because of the power of the unique solutions that we have. So I think that's the kind of the underlying strength of Equifax, is our non-mortgage businesses are super strong and lay on top of that, the new product initiative, it's not an initiative, it's really how we operate. We're a product led organization leveraging our differentiated data and our cloud capabilities. You know the 14% vitality in the quality, that's great momentum for the second half in '24 and '25, meaning that we're seeing we can leverage our differentiated data assets, our product led culture and capabilities and cloud and put new solutions in market. And those new solutions are higher price points that are going to expand our margins going forward. So that's a real positive. And then the underlying macros, I think the diversity of Equifax plays into that. So is there going to be a soft landing? My personal view is there is. I think we're kind of already feeling it and seeing it with inflation down to 3%. That's going to head towards where the fed wants it and unemployment is so low, people are still working. That's a pretty good economic environment for all businesses, but importantly ours going forward. And then you lay on top of it the completion of the cloud from a kind of timing standpoint over the next year and change. And the cost benefits that you're seeing this year and margin benefits this year that carry into 2024, those are quite powerful in our ability to expand our free cash generation. And have \u2013 as we get into '24. \u201825 and '26, have significant excess free cash flow to return to shareholders at the right time. Correct. Yes, that's where we've seen it Jeff. In part of it was that customers came to us and were looking for lower pricing on the manual efforts that we do for them. I think you know we have an operation in Iowa where we do that. We opted not to chase price down because it's a low margin solution now for us, but an attractive one, and some of them moved that in-house and it was you know meaningful. Its 300 basis points of the mortgage out performance in the quarter. But no, it's isolated to that manual effort we were doing four customers. We've just seen less activity there and it's logical when you think about a mortgage originator that just has more people doing less mortgages, they can do some of that themselves. But we haven't seen the impact on the instant verification side, which is where as you know, where all our revenue and margin is. We didn't give totals, but we did talk about it as a level of decline right. So we said it impacted our out performance by about 300 basis points so. Yes, not that I would characterize as meaningful Jeff, but we don't see it in our marketplace, but we hear our so called competitors talking about their revenue growth and I don't know what the real numbers are that some of those smaller players have, but they are definitely getting revenue somewhere. We just don't feel it in our business but we continue to watch it. Oh man, how much time do we have, but I'll try to be precise. Yes, I know but first time I'd start with the 14%. When we set the 10% vitality goal, remember our long term run rate, pre-cloud and pre the 10% goal was 5% to 7%. And I think 5% to 7% is what most data analytics companies do and 5% to 7% is a big number. To have 5% to 7% of your revenue from new products introduced in the time frame, we picked three years. That's a pretty vibrant innovative company. We set a goal for 10% and since we set the goal we've been over achieving it and 14% in the quarter and 13% for the year. So I would start with that I'm energized about the broad based ability at Equifax across all of our business units to leverage our differentiated data, our cloud capabilities or bring new solutions to market. That's the company that you want to have as a partner if you're a customer. Someone who is innovating to bring new solutions, because remember, all of our products deliver ROI. We are not Coke versus Pepsi or doing Sprite versus Diet Coke. We're delivering a solution that's going to help our customer to originate more consumers, lower their losses, increase they're marketing hit rates you name it, we're delivering ROI. So what excites me, certainly all of the solutions in Workforce. That would be kind of number two for me beyond the 14%. Having Workforce Solutions, that I think it was 23% vitality in the quarter, and remember Workforce is the first business at Equifax to get into fully cloud native for over a year now. And they've really been able to unleash, kind of the pent-up capacity if you will to bring new solutions to market and they're doing it in every vertical. Mortgage 36, delivering a 36 month solution of historical data to our mortgage customers. To the earlier question from Jeff a few minutes ago, our so called startup competitors can't do that. They don't have the 630 million historical records. So uniquely we can deliver a 36 solution that's integral now to many mortgage originations going back three years. So that historical data is something that super energizes me. I'll jump to USIS. Our new mortgage credit file that includes the NC+ plus, 14 NC+ attributes. Really energizing to have multi data assets delivered. The mortgage credit file is, looked the same for 40 years. We're now making ours differentiated and because of the scale of the cell phone utility database that we have, our competitors can't do that. So only Equifax can have a differentiated mortgage credit file, super exciting. The solutions for talent that we already talked about, also super exciting. So we're really focused on our new product initiative. We think it's going to drive top line in margin expansion going forward, and you're seeing us outperform the 10%, which we think is a good thing for the future. Certainly mortgage, which we already talked about that. Mortgage 40% below, 45% below kind of historic normal market levels. That recovery which is going to happen at some point, whether it's '24, \u201825 or \u201826 and how it meters in, that's going to be good news for Equifax. So it's going to be very high incremental margin in EWS and USIS is that recovery takes place. You know at some point there'll be more stabilization in the hiring market. Once employers get more comfortable around the economy, I would expect there'd be less hiring freezes and you know some level of employment improvement going forward. So that you know is going to be a positive you know for Equifax. When the subprime market stabilizes, that's had an impact us on us over the last three quarters in USIS. That'll be you know positive for us going forward. Correct. 100%. It's just really our visibility around pipelines, government we talked a bunch about, that we can see just a visibility in that business and in the others, but we still have the same view of a no change in the macro. Yes, so what I've talked most about today and what our principle focus in is around using AI to really manage large data and multi data sets to deliver better performing scores, better performing models. You may remember we rolled out a solution called One Score in April that combines some of our differentiated data assets across USIS. We used AI modeling in that and that provides significant performance enhancement, and when you deliver a performance enhancement it's more valuable when you charge a higher price. So that's going to be our principle focus around AI and no, there's not a high cost in completing AI. There's actually a bunch of efficiencies from a DNA perspective of using AI because it's just faster. You can complete more work and we'll be more productive if you will in delivering these higher performing solutions. I thought where you were going was in our operation side, where we expect to use some of the AI capabilities to improve our call centers, our operating centers. That will clearly be a leverage point for us in 24 and beyond. But our \u2013 I believe our big leverage is going to be around having more sophisticated higher performing, products scores, models and solutions. Thanks Mark. Yes, and that one we are going to be obviously focused on maintaining our strong customer relationships. I don't know what Truework's revenue is. Maybe it's $15 million or something or $20 million. It's a fairly small player. It doesn't have really any scale differentiated data assets. We've got at the end of the quarter 161 million records. I don't even know what their record count is, but we certainly watch them. We just don't feel that they are having a meaningful impact on our business, but we certainly are keeping an eye on them. And then outside of EWS, I think as we talked earlier, both USIS and international were above our expectations in the quarter and we expect them to perform well in the second half also. Fairly low revenue. We have a solution that does much of that Toni. We just see it, that there's a ton of friction for the customer, whether it's a mortgage originator, an auto lender, and a lot of friction for the consumer. And remember, if you think about our data set, the 161 million records that we have today or 120 million SSNs, you know that's against 160 million non-form payroll. So in non-form there's 40 million people not in our data set that are out getting mortgages and doing other products. And then when you add pension and the self-employed individuals, there's another call it close to $100 million in total. So the solution that was announced, it's actually been in the market \u2013 I think Experian had that in the marketplace for quite some time. I'm not sure what kind of traction they're getting with it, but we just find that if there's an instant record available, it's always going to trump any of these friction filled processing, where the consumer has to put their user id and password in. In this example, the consumer would have to give there, in my case Equifax HR user id and password in order to get to my payroll records, in my sit, in my case, and most consumers that are employed in W-2 non-form payroll would have to provide those credentials if you will in order to get to that. That's against our company policy and every company policy. So there's just a ton of friction and then it's just the consumers required to do it. Where I believe there is value in some of these alternative solutions and as we talked earlier on the call, we have a manual verification team where we do manual for our customers. There's another version of what you're talking about, is in the records that we don't have. So think about the, call it $40 million non-form payroll, the $30 million to $40 million self-employed, the $20 million to $30 million pensioners. Those records, if they are not doing a solution with Equifax like our manual or our conventional solution or something like we described, it's being done manually by the company, whether it's a mortgage originator, auto lender, you pick your solution. So it's replacing that manual to really drive speed. That's where there's value in it, but just - it's very very hard to get a lot of penetration with these solutions because of the significant friction for the consumer. And my view and what we see in the market place is it won't replace instant records. I think you're nailing at Toni about the two elements. And so on the first one you talk about really new product rollouts. The ability to roll out new products, and remember when you think about the 14 for Equifax, remember there's a bifurcation of where the different businesses are. USIS is well below the 14, because they haven't completed the cloud yet. EWS is well above 14, because they completed the cloud and are really driving those new products, and international is slightly south of the 10 or the 14. So as the businesses complete the cloud, particularly USIS and international, we would expect them to move towards the 10%, which is going to be a good thing, it's going to drive new solution there. So that's clearly one of the benefit to the cloud is the ability to leverage those scale differentiated data assets to bring more new solutions to market, and allow us to deliver long term that 10% vitality goal. Your second point is an excellent one also, and in my view it's going to be more impactful in USIS and international. Although EWS is getting real benefits of being in a cloud environment and how they're able to operate their business. The always on stability is clearly a benefit for them. The bigger benefit for Workforce is the ability to scale their data assets. There's no way they could have doubled in the last five years their twin data records without the cloud, period. It just is no way and we've gone \u2013 I think in 2018 we had something like 300,000 employers contributing to the data set, last quarter was 2.8 million. It wouldn't have happened without the cloud. So that that's another benefit of the ability to manage data that's more Workforce oriented. On the benefits of always on and faster data transmission, we believe that that's going to result in market share games. And particularly in USIS and international, where their credit file business is typically a customer will have a primary and secondary as you know. And we would expect by being always on, we're going to be a more valuable partner and allow us to move where we're tertiary or secondary into those secondary and primary positions. And I mentioned in my comments that we have deal pipelines in USIS where customers are talking to us about moving our market position, because of our investment in the cloud. Now, when will that show up in USIS revenue? Likely in \u201824 and \u201825 and \u201826 as they get you know post cloud completion and the same thing should happen in international markets where you've got that same dynamic of a customer using us and one of the other guys. We're going to be a more valuable partner being always on. Yes, truly carry over the pricing comment was really for both businesses. EWS did their normal one-one price increase that's just carrying through. But so no incremental price increase, we have no intention to do that. We basically focus on doing annual price increase in all our businesses. As you may remember back in January or February in the earnings call, we talked about a larger price increase in USIS related to one of our partners who has a credit score and everyone knows who I'm talking about, its FICO, who put through a price increase in both Equifax and Experian deliver that price increase to the marketplace when they increase the price of their credit score. So that holds through in mortgage is what we're talking about, a fairly sizable pricing crease that we mark up to maintain our margins and there's no change in that, that's just rolling through the year. Yes, I think we talked about the big market macro of less hiring taking place in \u201820. It really started two, three quarters ago. It started in the second half of 2022 when you saw companies announcing hiring freezes and layoffs and that's carried through the second quarter. That's kind of the macro that's taking place. The real opportunity for us is that we have fairly low market share of using our instant data, whether it's employment or education, our new education solution, newer education solution, for background screen. So that's where we're rolling out new products and you're working to add new customers and get them to convert from doing manual employment verification to using our instant solution.\nQ \u2013 Ashish Sabadra:That's helpful. Thank you. Yes, I think as you know, there's a lot of political elements to that. That has somewhat been episodic as far as announcements and then legal challenges on it. If it happens, it would be in the second half. As you point out, it will put pressure on some of the balance sheets or operating statements, operating available income for some of those recipients. It does skew to subprime consumers. So to put more pressure on those that have outstanding student debt that's been on pause for a couple of years if that actually does get resumed. I personally think it'll be absorbable inside of the kind of economic environment that we have. What's positive for those impacted consumers is that there are individuals, most of them working. So they still have \u2013 in this employment environment they've got you know jobs and they'll have to adjust likely they're spending behavior. It may crimp their ability or desire to get new credit, but it should be a fairly small portion of the full population. I think all the business. John, I'll let you jump in, but as you know international, USIS and EWS are a part of the cloud and broader cost restructuring program that we increased by $10 million in the second half. So all the businesses, that's primarily second half oriented. There wasn't much in the first quarter of that cost program, there was some in the second, but it really picks up steam in the third and fourth so which is why we have to carry over benefit in 2024 that will be a good positive for us next year. Would you add anything on international specifically? George, are you talking about like in auto or background screening or government, what? Maybe quite simply is we're not. We are not seeing any impact of kind of in sourcing if you will income or employment verifications in non-mortgage. And the mortgage piece is really quite specifically around the manual operation that we have in Iowa. We saw some pressures around us reducing \u2013 requests from customers for us to reduce our pricing which would impact our margins, which are thinner if you will there than they are instant verifications, because they have capacity to do the manual verifications in house and we decided to let those move in house, but not on the instant side and not in the non-mortgage. As George, we've been talking about it for, I don't know four, five quarters. As rates were coming up, we're just seeing consumers spent more time shopping around for mortgages, and as you know, every time they click on mortgage originator website, that mortgage originator will generally before they spend much time responding they have to understand who that consumer is so they pull a credit file to see whether they are going to qualify. So that is clearly a change in behavior than call it the low interest rate environment we had in 1920 and \u201821 and the early parts of '22, where consumers were really just taking the first mortgage they clicked on, because it was lower than their existing mortgage and a refi or met their expectations. They are just more shopping in this higher interest rate environment, which does benefit USIS. And as you know George, the EWS is generally \u2013 there's multiple pulls by EWS. There is more polls on the credit file side. But EWS is generally in the closed mortgages where they see their activity when they get further into the pipeline versus that early shopping behavior. And this is just really a prequel that the mortgage originator is doing to see whether \u2013 you know how much effort they're going to put into it and really how can they respond to that consumer about what they might qualify for."

During the call today, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 1Q 2023 earnings conference call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full-year 2023 guidance. We hope you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk Factors may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K. We'll also be referring certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 10% constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth as we executed well against our Equifax 2025 strategic priorities and the $200 million spending plan we announced in February. Before I cover our strong results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and U.S. consumer. We continue to navigate a higher interest rate environment that has severely impacted the U.S. mortgage market. Mortgage originations were down 56% in 2022, and we expect them to be down about 32% this year. In the second half, we expect mortgage inquiries to be approaching an unprecedented 40% below 2015 to 2019 levels. The combined market impact in 2022 and 2023 is expected to reduce Equifax revenue by over $900 million, but the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and fast growing non-mortgage businesses allowed Equifax to deliver 20% non-mortgage constant dollar growth last year, and 4% total growth last year, and an expectation to deliver 8% non-mortgage and 4% total growth in 2023 at the mid-point of our guidance, more than offsetting the large negative impact from the unprecedented mortgage market decline. Broadly, consumers are still strong with unemployment at historically low levels and with modest increases in delinquencies. We're seeing some credit card and personal loan delinquency increases in subprime and more broadly DQs are now back to pre-pandemic levels, although they remain significantly below the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. Auto loan delinquency rates for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels as well as above the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. And as you know, delinquencies generally are manageable when people are working. While we have seen limited pockets of DQ increases, we continue to watch this important metric as we move through the rest of the year. Historically, as DQs increase, our customers will begin to reduce marketing and tighten originations. Gross hiring year-to-date through February was down about 6% slightly better than the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, and inflation remains at elevated levels, but has begun to moderate slightly given Fed actions but with inflation still well above Fed targets, we expect further rate increases. And we believe there has been some credit tightening at some customers with more impact in FinTech from both expectations of a slowing economy in the second half and capital issues impacting certain banks. And as you recall, our guidance assumed a slowdown in the second half. While we are operating in an uncertain and challenging economic environment, Equifax continues to deliver. The breadth and depth of Equifax's broad-based business model is allowing us to weather this, the unprecedented mortgage market decline and deliver revenue growth and margin expansion. Turning to Slide 4. Equifax had another strong quarter with non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth up 10%. First quarter reported revenue of $1.302 billion was down 4.5% and down 4.3% on an organic constant currency basis and above our expectations against an unprecedented 58% mortgage market decline in the quarter. Revenue was above the high-end of our February guidance from broad-based strength and execution across Equifax and continued strong new product rollouts. First quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $380 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.2% both in line with our expectations. Adjusting for the incremental stock-based compensation expense incurred in the quarter adjusted EBITDA margins would've been approximately 31%, which is the baseline of which we expect to grow to 36% in the fourth quarter from revenue growth and our $120 million cost savings plan. As a reminder, the bulk of the spending reduction benefit the second half and we have $50 million of carryover benefit in 2024 from our actions this year. Adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share was above our February guidance range of $1.30 or $1.40 per share from stronger than expected revenue growth. Our Equifax non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 80% of total revenue in the quarter, were strong with 10% constant currency and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth, with the 10% growth solidly inside our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. All BUs delivered stronger than expected non-mortgage growth, which is positive momentum for the rest of the year. Estimated U.S. mortgage market originations, which MBA forecasted to be down about 58% in the quarter were slightly weaker than the down 55% in our February framework. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 33% or 25 points better than the market with both total revenue and our mortgage outperformance stronger than we outlined in February. The stronger outperformance was driven by better U.S. credit inquiries from higher than expected consumer shopping and positive mix in workforce solutions driven by significant growth from our new mortgage 36 trended product. We continue to make significant progress driving completion of the Equifax data and technology transformation. At the end of the quarter, over 70% of Equifax is being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud, which will expand to 80% by year-end as we substantially complete the North America customer migrations to the Equifax Cloud. Our new Equifax Cloud infrastructure is delivering always on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated datasets, faster data delivery, better data quality, and industry-leading enterprise level security. We continue to be convinced that our Equifax Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. New product innovation leveraging the capabilities delivered by the Equifax Cloud is also executing at a very high-level. Our new product Vitality Index of 13% in the quarter is at record levels and 300 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal. And as you recall, in February, we reached the definitive agreement to acquire Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closings conditions, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. As we outlined in February, we're executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation benefits and a broader focus on operational improvements aided by our new cloud capabilities. The plan will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023, as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers and other broader spending controls. Total spending reductions from these 2023 actions are expected to be about $200 million with about $120 million reduction in expense or about $0.75 per share and $80 million reduction in capital spending. And we're tracking well to the plans we laid out in February, and we remain committed to meeting these cost improvement targets. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce spending by an incremental $50 million to over $250 million. And we're maintaining our 2023 full-year revenue guidance of $5.275 billion to $5.375 billion, and adjusted EPS guidance of $7.05 per share to $7.35 per share. Our guidance continues to assume a weakening U.S. and global economy in the second half. Given the slightly weaker U.S. mortgage market that we saw principally in March, we are now assuming U.S. mortgage market inquiries for 2023 to be down about 32% or 200 basis points weaker than we discussed in February. Given our strong and broad-based performance in the first quarter, our ability to continue to outperform underlying markets and execution on our plan 2023 spending reductions, we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance in a continued challenging mortgage market and expected slowing economy in the second half. We also continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of over 36% in the fourth quarter, which is a very important stepping off point for 2024. John will provide more detail on the overall mortgage market and our second quarter and full-year guidance shortly. Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage revenue performance delivering 10% constant dollar and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth. All three business units delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth in the quarter with workforce up 11%, international up 10% in constant currency, and USIS up 8%. This broad-based non-mortgage growth across the business units will be increasingly supported by completion of the Equifax Cloud and continued NPI growth across the businesses. First quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 10% was well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in U.S. hiring activity that impacted EWS' Talent Solutions and I-9 businesses, as well as the comparison off a very strong 25% non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth in first quarter last year. Turning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another very strong quarter with non-mortgage revenue growth up 11% and total revenue down 8% as expected from the 58% mortgage market decline. EWS had another strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 4 million records added to the TWN database ending the quarter with 156 million current records, up 15% and 117 million unique records, which was up 12%. This is a very positive sign, has historically the first quarter has lower net record growth as large retail and logistics companies reduce elevated holiday season staffing in the first quarter. And as a reminder, unique records represent individuals on the TWN database and current records represent current active jobs in the database. And in our case, we have almost 50 million individuals having more than one job in our dataset. 117 million unique individuals on TWN deliver high hit rates, including self-employed or 1099 employees and defined benefit pensioners we now cover just over 50% of the 220 million people in the U.S. with employment and income records that are relevant to TWN database and our customers. As I referenced last quarter, we're also beginning to onboard pension records with records from one major pension administrator and discussions with many more. And through our cloud tech transformation, we're executing -- expanding our capabilities to ingest unique 1099 based self-employment records. And as a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers from our employer services business relationships. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. And during the quarter, we signed agreements with three new payroll processors that will deliver records during the balance of 2023. And the TWN U.S. database now has 618 million total current and historical records from over 2.7 million employers. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporated current and historical records with about 50% of first quarter verification services revenue coming from products that include historical or trended records. Mortgage revenue was down 38% in the quarter, which was in line with our February guidance, but outperformed the overall mortgage market by 20 points when compared to the 58% decline in originations. These are very strong results when compared to EWS' 52% outperformance in the first quarter last year. In addition to strong record growth and the positive impact from price actions in the quarter, we also saw strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of our new mortgage 36 solution, which is a 36-month trended product. During the quarter, over 50% of TWN mortgage inquiries were for products including trended or historical information and all at higher price points. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce delivered revenue of $596 million, down 8% and in line with our expectations. Verification Services revenue of $456 million was down 11%, driven by the decline in mortgage revenue that I just referenced. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents about two-thirds of Verifier revenue delivered strong 16% growth in the quarter. We saw continued very strong growth in the government vertical, which is about 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, with revenue up 33% driven by strong growth with CMS at the state level, new products, and record additions. We expect this strong growth in our government vertical to continue throughout the year. Talent Solutions delivered strong 10% growth in the quarter despite the 6% decline in the overall hiring market. Talent Solutions volumes have remained consistent since the middle of the fourth quarter despite the declining hiring market. We outgrew the market decline by over 15 percentage points delivering 10% growth a very strong performance driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing. In the quarter, we launched new products targeted to staffing and hourly segments, designed to meet specific needs of background screeners and end market employers in these very high volume market segments. We're also seeing continued penetration of our new educational background solutions. We expect these new products to continue to drive talent growth throughout 2023. Consumer lending was down 1% in the quarter due to lower auto volumes with financial institutions and P loan declines with FinTech lenders. Employer Services revenue of $141 million was up 4% from growth in our I-9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact in U.S. hiring offset by a 9% decline in UC or unemployment claims driven by lower jobless claims. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we've not seen an increase in UC transactions yet. And as a reminder, first quarter Employer Services revenues are seasonally higher than other quarters due to higher Affordable Care Act and W2 volumes. Last month, Workforce Solutions launched the PeopleHQ portal, a new cloud native solution that brings together multiple best-in-class employer compliance services in a single unified online experience. PeopleHQ serves employers of all sizes and supports the total employee journey with enhance and connected people first experience leveraging the full suite of EWS Employer Solutions, powered by the Equifax Cloud and leveraging industry-leading security measures the PeopleHQ portal will have several EWS services including the work number verification service I-9 HQ, including I-9 Anywhere and I-9 Inspect and ACA HQ with best-in-class Affordable Care Act capabilities that help employers meet the needs of their employees while also reducing risk for penalties. PeopleHQ is another example of how EWS is leveraging our new cloud native capabilities to deliver new solutions to the market that will drive employer revenue and continued direct record growth. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 50.4% were up 370 basis points from the fourth quarter and in line with our February guidance and as expected above 50% due to first quarter record growth, new product introductions and pricing actions, more than offsetting the macro effect of lower volumes in mortgage and Talent Solutions, as well as the negative mix from seasonally higher Employer Services revenues. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in the quarter. Rudy and the EWS team delivered another strong quarter outperforming the mortgage and hiring markets and continued strong record growth that will drive revenue and margins in the future. Turning to Slide 8. USIS revenue of $422 million was down about 2.5% and much better than our expectations due to stronger mortgage and non-mortgage performance. USIS mortgage revenue was down 25% and was better than our expectations. Although estimated mortgage originations were 300 basis points weaker than our expectation at down an estimated 58%, USIS credit inquiries were stronger than we expected at down 44%. Credit inquiry performance continues to outperform originations, reflecting higher relative levels of consumer mortgage shopping behavior in this higher interest rate environment. Revenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 19%, driven principally by pricing actions and was also strong versus a net estimated originations at 33%. At $105 million, our mortgage revenue was about 25% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Total non-mortgage revenue of $317 million was up 8% in the quarter with organic growth of about 4%. The 8% growth was stronger than the mid-single-digit growth that we expected in our February guidance. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $261 million, which represented over 60% of total USIS revenue was up 8% with organic revenue growth of about 3%. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up 9% total and up over 3% organically. And during the quarter, online revenue had very strong double-digit growth in commercial, auto, identity and fraud, and insurance. And banking was up slightly in the quarter with growth at large financial institutions, although at slower pace than in the fourth quarter more than offset by declines in -- with smaller financial institutions and FinTechs. Commercial was up over 20% with continued strong growth from our differentiated commercial credit data, including financial, telco, utility, and industry trade lines and our new OneScore for commercial that we launched in the first quarter. Commercial is an increasing area of strength delivering above market growth in the risk segment and we should see continued strong performance as we complete their data and cloud transformation later this year. Financial Marketing Services our B2B offline business returned to growth with revenue of $48 million was up 4%, and in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in offline fraud insights and IXI wealth products was partially offset by lower pre-screen marketing revenue. Pre-screen revenue from larger customers slowed growth in the quarter, but we saw a significant weakness from smaller FIs and FinTechs. And we have not seen an increase in risk-based portfolio reviews yet. USIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $56 million in first quarter, up 8% from very good performances in our consumer direct and indirect channels. USIS is winning in the marketplace with strong momentum from new solutions and differentiated data in key verticals of identity and fraud, commercial and auto. We're also in active dialogues with U.S. customers about the competitive benefits of the Equifax Cloud with always on stability, faster data transmission, and Equifax Cloud enabled new solutions. USIS is on offense as they finalize their cloud transformation and are pivoting to selling cloud enabled -- new cloud enabled solutions. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.6% in the quarter and in line with our expectations. EBITDA margins were down sequentially due to negative mix from seasonally sequential growth in mortgage solutions, which drives higher royalties and data costs, as well as the normalization of annual employee incentive costs. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to the new Equifax cloud that are accelerating as we move through 2023. We expect USIS adjusted EBITDA margins to be about 34% in the second quarter up sequentially reflecting revenue growth and the accelerating benefit of our 2023 spending reduction plan. Last month we announced Todd Horvath joined Equifax as our USIS President. Todd has a proven track record of leading enterprise teams and financial services to drive growth and strong commercial relationship. And he brings more than 20 years of financial services management experience, a commitment to driving product and operational excellence and strong expertise in enterprise and cloud technologies to his role as the USIS President. I'm energized to welcome Todd to the Equifax leadership team and believe that his experience in transformation, innovation, and customer experience will proven valuable to taking USIS to the next year. Turning to Slide 9. International revenue was $284 million in the quarter, up 9% in constant currency and 8% organically and much better than our expectations from new products and pricing actions. We're seeing a broad-based execution from Lisa and our international team. Europe local currency revenue was down 4%, but stronger than expected. The decline was due to the expected 20% decline in our debt management business in the UK. As we discussed last year, our UK debt management business was very strong in the first half of 2022, as the UK government made large catch-up debt placements following their COVID debt collection moratoriums. As a result, we expect to see declines in that business in the first half of 2022. However, we do expect to see consistent sequential growth in our debt management business as we move through 2023. In the quarter, we secured an expanded budget allocation from the UK government, which will deliver higher volumes of debt placements during the year, and we expect debt management to return to revenue growth later this year. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was up 7% in the quarter, a very good performance and stronger than we expected. This strong performance was principally due to strong growth from consumer decisioning and analytical solutions. Asia-Pacific delivered very strong local currency revenue growth of 11% in which Australia delivered high-single-digit growth in the quarter. We also saw a very strong growth in our India business up over 40%. Latin America local currency revenue was up a very strong 32% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team, which we expect to continue in 2023. Canada local currency revenue was up 8% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer and identity and fraud was offset partially by lower mortgage volumes in Canada. And international adjusted EBITDA margins at 23.5% were better than our expectations due to the stronger revenue growth and good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans. Turning to Slide 10. New product introductions leveraging our differentiated data in the new Equifax Cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. Building off the momentum from 2022 where we launched over 100 new products and delivered a record Vitality Index of over 13%. In the first quarter, we launched over 30 new products and delivered 13% Vitality again. Our first quarter Vitality Index was again led by very strong performance in Workforce Solutions and in Latin America. And in the quarter, over 80% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver Vitality Index in 2023 at about 13%, which is well above our 10% long-term Vitality Index goal. This equates to over $700 million of revenue from new products introduced in the past three years during 2023. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top-line growth and margins. On the right side of the slide, we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. Leveraging our differentiated data, USIS launched OneScore, a new consumer credit scoring model that combines traditional Equifax credit history with telecommunications, payTV, and utility payment data on over 191 million consumers, as well as Equifax DataX and Teletrack specialty finance data on about 80 million consumers, including payment history from non-traditional banks and lenders, which will potentially increase credit scores by up to 25 points in the scorable population by more than 20%. These new solutions are testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud in driving innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities for them. Now, I'd like to turn over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter guidance. We're up to a strong start in 2023, building off the momentum from a strong 2022 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth and pricing. John?\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. Before I discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on first quarter 2023. First quarter corporate expense at $146 million was above our expectations, principally due to higher variable compensation with our strong first quarter results and cost related to executing the broader restructuring related to the $200 million spending reduction program. Items below operating income came in as we expected with interest expense of $58 million, depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related amortization of $89 million, and a tax rate of about 26.1%. Capital spending in the quarter was about $154 million and in line with our expectations. We expect capital spending in the second quarter to remain at level similar to 1Q 2023 and then sequentially decline in the third and fourth quarters as we complete significant U.S. and Canadian customer migrations to data fabric. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter, as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. As Mark mentioned, first quarter mortgage market originations were estimated by MBA at down almost 58%, which is about 300 basis points weaker than the down 55% for the first quarter that we discussed in February. As shown on Slide 11, however, first quarter credit inquiries were down 44% better than our February expectations. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate did decline from a high of 6.5% in the quarter to about 6.3% today. It appears the somewhat lower rates attracted people to begin the home buying process, but continued tight inventory and high home prices, limited closings and originations. As we look for the rest of 2023, our planning does not assume a fundamental improvement in the mortgage or housing markets. We're applying normal seasonal patterns to the current run rate of credit and TWN inquiries that we are seeing in late March and early April. On that basis for 2023, we are expecting mortgage market originations to decline about 32% versus 2022 or about a 200 basis point greater decline than we discussed in February. As we have discussed in the past, TWN inquiries are closely linked to originations. USIS credit inquiries despite the weaker overall originations market should still be down about 30% versus 2022 due to the better than expected credit inquiries in the first quarter and the expectation of continued greater than normal mortgage shopping that does not move to an origination. Looking at the second quarter, again applying seasonal patterns to the run rates we're seeing in late March and early April, mortgage market originations are assumed to be down about 38% and credit inquiries down about 33%. As we discussed in February sequentially as we move through the second half of 2023, a more normal pattern of mortgage activity would have mortgage originations in 3Q 2023 being about flat with 2Q 2023, and then declining in 4Q 2023 versus 3Q 2023. We expect that with these sequential patterns and the weaker overall originations in 2023 than we discussed in February, U.S. mortgage originations would be down slightly in the second half versus the first half and 4Q 2023 would be about flat year-to-year. Turning to Slide 12. As Mark referenced earlier, in the first quarter, we outperformed on revenue delivery and delivered well against our 2023 spending reduction plan that will deliver $200 million in spending reduction in 2023 versus 2022 levels, including workforce reduction, closure of data centers, and additional cost control measures. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins were slightly stronger than expected at 29.2%, adjusted for the negative timing of the impact higher stock-based compensation in the quarter versus fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins would've been about 31%. For 2Q, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approaching 32.5% at the mid-point of our guidance range. This sequential margin expansion is driven by both revenue growth as well as acceleration of the savings in the second half of 2023 related to our $200 million spending reduction plan. As revenue growth sequentially in the second half of 2023 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. Slide 13 provides our guidance for the second quarter of 2023. In 2Q 2023, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion, with non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 8% partially offset by mortgage revenue declines moderating to about down 14%, compared to down 33% in the first quarter. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by just over 100 basis points. 2Q 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to approach 32.5% up over 300 basis points sequentially given revenue growth, the 2023 cost actions and lower equity compensation expense. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are expected to be up sequentially from 1Q 2023 driven by workforce delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of over 51% in the quarter, as well as margin improvement in USIS from revenue growth and cost actions. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully, sequentially in 2Q 2023 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter. Business unit performance in the second quarter expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 1%, negatively impacted by the expected about 38% decline in mortgage market originations. Non-mortgage revenue will be up high-single-digits, overcoming year-over-year declines in U.S. hiring and customer specific weakness in consumer lending. We expect EWS non-mortgage growth to reaccelerate to double-digits in the third and fourth quarters. EBITDA margins are expected to be up over -- are expected to be over 51%, up over 100 basis points sequentially driven by sequential revenue growth and strong execution of 2023 cost actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 3% year-to-year. Non-mortgage revenue growth should be approximately at the level similar to the 8% we delivered in the first quarter, partially offset by a decline in mortgage revenue due to the expected 33% decline in mortgage credit inquiries. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34%, up sequentially due to revenue growth and strong execution on cost actions. International revenue is expected to be up about 6% in constant currency with EBITDA margins expected to be about 23%. Non-mortgage constant currency growth of 7% to 8% is down from the 10% we delivered in the first quarter. We do expect to return to 10% plus growth in 3Q and 4Q, principally driven by accelerating growth in EWS as well as stronger growth in international. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q 2023 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Slide 14 provides the specifics of our 2023 full-year guidance. As Mark mentioned, we are maintaining our full-year guidance despite the expected weaker U.S. mortgage originations and a more negative impact of foreign exchange. We expect total mortgage revenue to be down year-to-year at similar levels to our February guidance at down 8% or slightly more negative. As we discussed, we expect mortgage originations will be down 32% versus the down 30% we discussed in February. We do not expect this to impact USIS mortgage revenue, as we are seeing higher levels of shopping, which offset the decline in originations. In EWS, we expect an improved mix of higher value trended mortgage solutions to partially mitigate the impact of the originations decline. For non-mortgage constant currency revenue, we continue to expect constant currency growth at about the levels we discussed in February at up 8% or slightly better given our strong performance in NPI and stronger growth in international. These levels of growth, the strong start we had to the year, execution in NPI, delivery of our 2023 spending reductions in cloud transformation plan, allow us to deliver to our guidance despite the more negative impact of FX. We believe that our full-year guidance is centered at the mid-point of both our revenue and adjusted EPS ranges. As we discussed in February, we remain focused on delivering our mid-term goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins, market conditions are significantly different than we first discussed in November of 2021, our goal of achieving these goals in 2025. The U.S. mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down about 40% from the normal 2015 to 2019 average levels, we had discussed to deliver $7 billion in revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of 2021. However, a recovery in the mortgage market from the levels we are seeing in 2023 upon the order of two-thirds of the loss volume is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal. We are focused on driving above market growth and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed with our 2023 and 2024 spending reduction plans and as part of our data and technology cloud transformation, which are needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins as we exceed the $7 billion revenue level. We will continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion goal as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. Now, I would like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with above market performance delivering strong 10% non-mortgage constant currency dollar revenue growth, reflecting the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. At the business unit level, Workforce Solutions had another strong quarter powering our results delivering 11% non-mortgage revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%. As I mentioned earlier, EWS signed three new payroll processors with -- and with our TWN current records reaching 156 million, up 4 million records sequentially and up 15% versus last year. Workforce delivered another very strong quarter with a Vitality Index over 20% from innovative new products and solutions leveraging the new EFX Cloud while further penetrating the high growth talent and government verticals. USIS continued their momentum from the fourth quarter with B2B non-mortgage growth of 8% total and 3% organic in the quarter, driven by online B2B non-mortgage growth of 9% total and 3% organic as they accelerate customer migrations to their new Equifax Cloud. International delivered strong 9% local currency growth with strong growth in LATAM, Australia, Canada, India, and our European credit businesses. And our first quarter, Vitality Index up 13% continues to be well above our 10% long-term NPI framework as we delivered over 30 new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud in the quarter. And we made significant progress executing against our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation with over 70% of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud and we're laser-focused on completing our North America migration this year to become the only cloud native data analytics company. And we're executing against our spending reduction plans that will deliver $200 million of savings in 2023, with run rate savings of over $250 million in 2024 that will expand our margins to 36% and EPS to over $2 per share as we exit the year, which positions us for an uncertain economic environment while reducing the capital intensity of our business. And as mentioned earlier, given our strong performance in the quarter, our ability to continue to outperform our underlying markets and deliver on our plan 2023 spending reductions, we've reaffirmed our 2023 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the Equifax Cloud over the past four years to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We're energized by the early benefits of the Equifax Cloud. We're delivering on the cost benefits we outlined four years ago, and you're seeing our margins expand. The competitive benefits of being always on the faster data transmission and digital macro are positioning us for share gains. The power of a Single Data Fabric where all our data has moved from siloed environments to a single data environment is allowing us to deliver unique solutions like our new mortgage credit report leveraging NC Plus data, OneScore leveraging all our alternative -- all of our alternative data, and a wide array of trended solutions leveraging our historical data. NPIs leveraging our differentiated data and cloud capabilities are accelerating and well above our 10% long-term Vitality goal with over 13% Vitality last year and 13% in the first quarter. Even more encouraging is Workforce Solutions NPI results who completed most of their cloud work early last year and is delivering over 20% Vitality in 2023. This is exciting time for Equifax and I'm energized about our strong above market performance, but even more energized about the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets and our new Single Data Fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins, and higher free cash flow in the future. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Mark, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about what your regional bank exposure is and just broadly how you factored the credit tightening that we are hearing about into your guidance because it sounds like on a non-mortgage constant currency basis, you're actually raising the outlook a bit, which seems counter to those trends. So was just hoping you could help us parse those through.\nMark Begor: Yes. We -- maybe I'll start with FinTech. As you know, we have a FinTech business. Our position there is smaller than at least one of our competitors, and we've been seeing tightening in that space for a number of quarters. I think it started really almost a year ago with the FinTech tightening really from their balance sheet challenges. We haven't seen much impact, if you go to mid-size banks, we expect them to continue to originate. There'll be some tightening there as we outlined, and we believe that's factored into our second half guidance where we expect to see a slowdown in some of the originations. But as you might imagine, the bulk of our revenue comes from the larger FIs that haven't been impacted by this balance sheet impacts or balance sheet tightening from deposits.\nManav Patnaik: Got it.\nJohn Gamble: And in terms of full-year -- in terms of full-year, the slightly -- the comment you made about were slightly stronger given the adjustments in FX. What you're seeing is international's actually performing a little better, right? So in our 2023 guidance, we did take up our expectation for international growth by about 100 basis points.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then Mark, obviously, you've talked about your tech transformation a lot and you just mentioned the always on Single Data Fabric, et cetera, but with all the news around AI and ChatGPT and so forth in the media. I was just hoping you could talk about where you are with your capabilities there and the risks and opportunities you see.\nMark Begor: Yes. It's a great question, Manav. It's one that we've talked about before. And we've been working and deeply involved in AI on our data analytics team for a long time. You've heard us talk about NDT, which is one of our patented solutions around explainable AI that we're using both internally and with our customers, and it's embedded in our ignite solution. And our relationship with Google, as you know, we're on the Google Cloud brings very strong capabilities to us that we're leveraging to expand our AI capabilities. And as you point out, I think this is a big I would call it a macro meaning for the industry of using AI to really drive more predictability and manage more data going forward. And we believe we're uniquely positioned to really take advantage of the AI capabilities by having number one, all our data in the Single Data Fabric, which as you know is unique to Equifax. And then second being cloud native. As we complete the cloud over the coming quarters, principally in North America that's going to allow both Workforce Solutions and USIS to really leverage those AI capabilities to just bring new solutions and more solutions leveraging more data to our customers going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow-up on Manav's question, on some of -- some of the concerns of credit crunch and kind of some of the shifting in deposits, but just wanted to see if in March kind of at the peak of some of the volatility with the regional banks. Did you guys see any in disruption, whether it be. temporary or modest in volumes kind of when everything was happening with some of these regional banks or were you guys largely unimpacted given the heavier exposure to the money centers?\nMark Begor: Well, I would say even though, as you know, our mid-size banks, there was no impact that we could see or measure really in the -- in March or really in April so far from deposit tightening, you know what we mentioned that we've seen some tightening in some areas, FinTechs, for example number one, because of delinquency concerns in subprime consumers, which I would characterize as unrelated to the deposit and balance sheet issues that some of those FinTechs have been having. And broadly we haven't seen that impact. It's really been more just risk management from tightening around certain credit ban because of concerns around consumer exposure. And again is that you heard my comments earlier, broadly the consumers still quite healthy and broadly delinquencies are still very manageable and low versus kind of historic levels which is allowing our customers to continue to originate. But back in February, and again, today, we still are looking at the second half as being what we characterize as some level of slowdown, and that's reflected in our guidance and how we think about our ability to deliver in the second half. And that's reflected in our reaffirmation of the full-year guidance, we think that strength of the broader businesses and remember, there's a lot of Equifax businesses that are outside of financial services. When you think about Workforce Solutions government, Talent Solutions, our employer business, many of our identity and fraud businesses in USIS are not in financial services. So there's a diversity element, of course, we have an international business is quite large that's all a part of Equifax.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. As Mark mentioned in DDM, we did say in pre-screen, we are seeing some impact right from FinTech as well as smaller financial institutions. And that's really where we're seeing it in pre-screening and why pre-screen was weaker.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's really helpful color. And just as a follow-up on the Talent Solution side of the business, it seems like 1Q was at least a little better than 4Q on the revenue side of things. It seems like some of that is likely price, but just wanted to see if you guys, do you have any color? Was this predominantly pricing? Is there any seasonality? Because I guess it seems like some of the hiring data seems a little cautious from what we've seen. But just wanted to see if you could help us square the puts and takes of that sequential bump up in the Talent Solutions revenue.\nMark Begor: Yes. I think you point out the underlying market is declining. There's less hiring going on for sure. You have a combination of companies doing layoffs and when companies do layoffs, they generally tighten up headcount addition. So we're clearly seeing that that started in the fourth quarter and continued through the first quarter. Really, it's kind of a similar decline. And then what's offsetting that is remember, we have a large business here, but the TAM is huge. It's about a $5 billion TAM and we've got a -- almost a $400 million business here. So we have a lot of number one penetration opportunities. So even if the market's declining, we have the opportunity to add new customers or get more market share with existing customers, which are primarily background screeners. Number two, as you point out, every year we take up price generally in the first quarter. So that price benefit, that is in the results in the first quarter, and that's a positive. And you heard us talk about some of the new products which really is driving that penetration. We've rolled out a number of new products in the first quarter that are also benefiting the talent business. And then last would be record additions. As we add new records, we have more jobs on our database and those allow us to have higher hit rates, when background screens are completed. So the number of levers that workforce has in that vertical, and frankly in all those verticals allows them to outperform their underlying markets quite strongly and that's inherent in their business model.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi John, what's implied in the 2023 guide in terms of organic constant currency revenue growth on non-mortgage basis? So this is for 2023 versus the 8% that was in the first quarter.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So I don't think we gave an organic number for the full-year, right? But what we are expecting to see as we talked about is nice strength and strengthening in our total non-mortgage growth as we go through the rest of the third quarter and fourth quarter.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Could you just talk a little bit about that acceleration in EWS? You've already been pretty clear about the international momentum.\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So I think what EWS is continuing to see very good performance in government. We expect to continue to see that, that move forward as we go through the rest of the year. They're also seeing really nice progress in new product. So we're expecting to see good acceleration in NPI across --\nMark Begor: Record additions.\nJohn Gamble: Record additions as we go through the rest of the year, as well as they added three new payroll processors in the first quarter. And we expect to see accelerating growth in records as we go through the year. So I think all of those things will help us continue to drive higher performance in non-mortgage in EWS as we go through the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, thanks, and good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Mark, you mentioned trended data in EWS, which is pretty intriguing. Can you discuss a little bit kind of what the price differential is on some of those newer trended data products? And then sort of as a follow-up, can you also just refresh us on what percent of EWS inquiries go unfulfilled today either because you don't have the data or you don't have the records in the database, and how you think those trends move over time?\nMark Begor: Yes, yes. Two great questions. On the first one, that's a big part of not only EWS, but across Equifax, but EWS when they completed the cloud last year was really able to unleash a lot of the capabilities around leveraging their historical dataset. And I think as you know, we keep every record so we have over 600 million records. And if you think about mortgage or you think about auto or so many other verticals understanding how much someone has paid today is very valuable. But having the history of what they're paid and is that pay increasing? Is it decreasing? Is it staying the same? Or if you've got a employee an individual who's compensated with a sales commission on a quarterly basis or an annual basis, that won't be picked up in the snapshot today. So trended data is very, very valuable. And we talked about in the call that we launched in I think it was in the early in the fourth quarter, a new mortgage 36 product that gives 36 months' worth of history of employment leveraging our historical data. And that's become a very strong seller inside of the mortgage space. And that sells at really multiples meaning 2 to 3x what a snapshot would sell for are basic income and employment data sales for $40 to $50 to $60. The trended data will be multiples of that because it delivers so much more predictive information for our customers. And our customers are buying it. Same thing in other verticals around that historical data is very valuable in background screening, some employers are looking for last job worked for certain jobs. Other employers are maybe in a white collar role are looking for five years' worth of history. And we obviously sell that longer history at a higher price point versus just the snapshot. So that's a big growth player for us. And I think we talked on the comments earlier, the formal comments that Verifier revenue now is approaching 50% including historical records and that's up dramatically from a number of years ago. So that's driving workforce revenue and margins. And again, it's leveraging the cloud capabilities and our focus on new products to drive it going forward. Your second question on records, as I mentioned earlier, there's about 220 million working or employed individuals in the United States, including a 167 million, 168 million non-farm payroll, 20 million to 40 million gig or self-employed individuals. And remember, a 1099 self-employed employee or worker could be a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer, very high paid jobs or they're also are going to be a Uber driver. So there's a wide array of employees in that 20 million to 40 million. So we're going after those records. And then there's another 20 million to 30 million defined benefit pensioners in the U.S. and that's pension income is income that our customers want to use when someone who's retired or receiving pension income is going out to get a financial product, whether it's a mortgage and auto loan. So against the 220 million total income producing individuals in the United States we have about 117 million. So we're -- our hit rates are well north of 50%. But what the real opportunity is, as we continue to grow records and it's just a very unique lever for any business to have because as you know, we're already getting the inquiries to Workforce Solutions for every applicant that our customers have. And when we're not able to fulfill, they have to do it manually through using paper pay stubs and calling around to employers. So as we add new records during the quarter, we're able to monetize them instantly because we already have the inquiries or the orders coming to our database. So that's why we have such a big focus and a large team of workforce solutions people focused on all those different verticals to add records to Workforce Solutions. And when you think about records being up double-digit that translates into double-digit revenue, so it's a very powerful lever for the business.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Hey this one might be for John. Can you talk about the non -- the mortgage and non-mortgage organic Verifier revenue? I think that was given out in previous quarters, but I didn't see it on the slide. And then I have a follow-up.\nJohn Gamble: So again, what we talked about, I think in the quarter is we had very good growth in total. It was about 16% I think in Verifier and then 11% growth. We didn't give a specific organic number. Acquisitions weren't that substantial in EWS in the past year so that there's really not a significant impact from acquisitions. And really what we're expecting as we just talked about a minute ago to drive the growth as we go forward is really continued acceleration in growth in government and continued addition of records, benefits of new products, as well as additional pricing that should allow us to get, to drive back to total growth in the back half of the year that's above 10% as it was in the first quarter.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thanks. And then when you talked about the new payroll processors, obviously this is a significant effort on the company's part to go ahead and continue to add the records, but I didn't see the comment that those were exclusive like we have seen in previous quarters. Was that just left out or were some of them just not exclusive?\nMark Begor: No. The contracts that we're signing are and will continue to be exclusive going forward. That's our plan and these work.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start, it doesn't seem like from the deck there was any mention of the identity and fraud business in the quarter. Just wondering how -- how that's trending both in the first quarter and what your expectations are for progression as we move through the year there.\nMark Begor: Yes. It's still strong growth. We should have called it out. There was not intended to not do that. We've got a lot of good things happening at Equifax and we should have highlighted that one also, as you know, we acquired Talent, a couple years ago and we've added Midigator last year and those two businesses in United States and actually globally are performing very well and continuing to deliver that double-digit revenue. So they're a part of that USIS -- strong USIS performance. And as you know, identity is an area that is a priority focus for Equifax both around new products is around -- as also -- and also around M&A and the identity and fraud team are rolling out new solutions to really expand their capabilities, not only in count space, in the retail world, where e-commerce has been their focus. But as you know, we've got a large in expanding identity business in FI, insurance and telco, where we're bringing new solutions there also.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about mortgage growth in EWS. It looks to me like the outperformance relative to inquiry volumes has been narrowing or at least narrowed in the quarter. I'm just wondering if there's anything to read into that, is that a lower kind of normal level of outperformance to expect through the rest of the year? Or if you could just kind of unpack the 38% mortgage decline relative to the 44% decline in increase in the first quarter that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. I think the more relevant comparison really is against originations, right? Because USIS obviously ties very closely to credit inquiries, but EWS is much more closely tied to originations because EWS TWN data is not pulled as early in the cycle of a mortgage as credit is. So it's very closely tied to an origination. And the 20% outperformance relative to originations, we think was very strong and very consistent with our expectations. So we feel really good about the way they're performing. And again, it's all the things Mark's already referenced, strong record growth, good performance and pricing and especially in the last couple of quarters, they've done an outstanding job of rolling out mortgage 36, which is their new trended product, which has been very beneficial in which the rollout will complete here as we get through first quarter and into second quarter. So we feel really good about their outperformance against mortgage.\nMark Begor: They were also off a tough comp from last year.\nJohn Gamble: Very tough comp from last year.\nMark Begor: Very, very strong outperformance from some of the new products that were rolled out late in 2021 and into 2022. They had a very, very strong 2022 and we're pleased with their outperformance. We think it's very strong.\nAndrew Nicholas: Makes sense. Thank you. Didn't account for that new month? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research. Your line is now live.\nCraig Huber: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. First question, can you just give us a little more detail, if you would, in the U.S. for auto in your credit card business, how that did and maybe what your outlook is for the rest of the year?\nJohn Gamble: So I think we indicated that auto performed well, right? And we also indicated, I believe that that FI or banking right was about flat, right? And our credit card business was inside of FI.\nMark Begor: And I think we also said in the comments that what was driving the FI to flat was FinTech down, which has been under pressure from originations for a while. Some slowdown, but limited in the smaller banks and continued growth with the larger FIs. So there was kind of a balancing impact in there.\nCraig Huber: And my final question guys, your uses of free cash flows, your thoughts here changed. Do we expect anything different here than other than just potential debt paydown?\nMark Begor: Yes. We're still focused first and foremost on growing the company and expanding our EBITDA margins. And I think as you know, Craig as we complete the cloud, our CapEx will come down, it's down this year. It'll -- our plan is to take it down again next year. So that's going to expand our free cash flow. Certainly, our margins will continue to expand. And when we think about uses of free cash flow, no change, our 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A is a part of our capital allocation strategy. And then as you know, we've got Boa Vista in the pipeline to add to Equifax, which is actually a bit north of that 1 to 2 points of revenue growth. And then we've been very clear that in the future, as our margins move towards that 39% in 2025, our free cash flow will continue to expand and excess free cash flow beyond what we use for M&A and CapEx. We want to return to shareholders at the right time, through buyback and dividend. And that's certainly a part of our plan in the future.\nCraig Huber: Sorry.\nJohn Gamble: Very near-term, right? We're focused on reducing leverage and as we move through 2023 and early 2024, you'll see us focus on leverage reduction. And I think in the back half of the year, focus on integrations, obviously as we complete BVS and integrate the other acquisitions we've done over the next couple of years.\nCraig Huber: Sorry. Back on the first question for auto and credit card outlook for the second half of the year. Can you just touch on that a little bit further? Thank you very much.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So we didn't really give a forecast by segment, right? But I think what we did talk about is that embedded in our guidances and expectation is we'll see generally weakening markets as we go through the rest of this year. That's certainly true in the U.S. in the back half -- sorry, in the back half of this year in the U.S. but also in most of our international markets. We didn't give specific forecasts around auto and/or FI.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nKelsey Zhu: Thanks for taking my question. So LinkedIn is introducing an employment verification product. I was wondering does that impact how you think about EWS pricing or growth trajectory at all.\nMark Begor: We don't. There's a number of solutions out there from FinTechs and as you know experience got a business there too. The scale of our dataset, our ability to continue growing that dataset and the fact we get verified records directly from the source meaning the company's payroll records and the depth of the record also as you probably know we get over 50 attributes in every payroll record that includes name, social, date of birth, job title, which is very important for our employer vertical. But then all kinds of details on the payroll, gross pay, net pay, deductions, stock compensation, incentive compensation, sales compensation, hours worked, et cetera. So the depth of our database, the fact that it's current every pay period, and the scale of it really gives us a very strong position. And then last, I think as you know, we have system to system integrations that we've built in all of our verticals where as a part of their workflows, our customer's workflows, they hit our database. So we're hit first. Where solutions like you described or some of the FinTechs play in is where there's not a verification available from Workforce Solutions, and you have to go to another source, which is typically manual. And that's why we have a partnership with Yodlee, where we do bank transaction data and there's other solutions like that. But you've seen continued super strong growth from workforce because of the uniqueness and scale and depth of the dataset.\nKelsey Zhu: Got it. Super helpful. My second question is on consumer solutions. So the strong growth there, I was wondering, is that more driven by volume or market share gain?\nMark Begor: Yes. That's a -- that business is a direct-to-consumer business that where we sell credit monitoring solutions and other solutions like that. It's really the business has rolled out some new products. It's leveraging our new cloud capabilities and just having better performance in some of the success rate of landing new consumers that want to use our credit monitoring solutions in the marketplace. So we're pleased with that performance and having it return to growth, you may recall that it struggled a year ago, two years ago. And as we got into the cloud and leveraged those capabilities and rolled out the new products, we've had some better performance, which we're pleased with.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So I guess I had a different take on the Verifier Talent. I guess that the revenue dollar stepped up sequentially, but when I look at the year-over-year, I guess revenue plus 10, gross hiring minus 6, I think that's an industry metric. And then records plus 15, mathematically that seems like the story. But you're calling out several other, I guess, structural growth drivers or factors. I know you've gotten asked a lot about one specific situation referenced by another public company, but just if you can help me on the other structural growth drivers or if there's any other offsets to them we need to consider. Thank you.\nJohn Gamble: One thing I would change in your walk there, Jeff, I think you're hitting a lot of the right points is the record growth. Remember, in Talent, we use our historical records and current records growth is very important, but most of what we're leveraging is not records from the quarter in that business, it's records over the last year, two-year, three-year, four-year, five years. So that that isn't going to be quite as big an impact as far as higher hit rates as we add in essence what you're adding, you want to add is more jobs. New product rollouts as we talked they've rolled out a couple new products actually a number of new products over the last 12 months to 18 months. So those are benefiting kind of on a year-over-year basis as they're embedded in with our customers principally background screeners. And we rolled out a couple new ones in the quarter; one for the hourly workforce that we think is going to provide growth to us going forward. And then the other growth lever for that business to offset a declining market is just pure penetration. Remember, we're doing in rough kind of high-level math, 2 in 10 or 3 in 10 background screens are using our data. The others are still using the manual DPO kind of process. So that's an opportunity for the business. I don't know if that's helpful.\nJeff Meuler: It is helpful. Thank you. And then I'm just a 36% plus and $2 as a launching off point. I just want to make sure I'm thinking through the seasonality correctly. I guess in future years there is still some seasonally lower margin or EPS in Q1, but from timing of equity grants and other factors, but it's nowhere near as pronounced as it was in 2023 because there was a one-time catch-up in 2023 that impacted Q1. Just want to make sure I have that right. Thank you.\nMark Begor: So I think he's talking about the incentive compensation impact in the first quarter along with the equity compensation impact.\nJohn Gamble: So -- so specific to equity, no, the impact each year is probably relatively similar, right? Because it's just the fact that the grants that are executed in the given year based on the structure of the programs now currently end up being -- the expense ends up being taken in the first quarter. As Mark mentioned, in terms of the impact on our margins going from fourth to first of 20 -- fourth of 2022 to first of 2023, we did obviously have an incremental impact as we normalize cash incentive compensation, and that's not something that we should see each year going forward, but the equity incentive compensation, yes, that's something you'll see each year.\nMark Begor: But I think to your question, the cost out is quite substantial meaning our cost structure is going to be meaningfully lower as we exit the year in complete the restructurings that we're talking about. And I think we've also talked, I think on the last call, we expect to have number one carryover benefit because these cost outs happen throughout the year. So we're not at full run rate of those cost actions in the fourth quarter. So you get a benefit in 2024 that'll help our margins next year. And then we also expect to have further cloud savings in 2024 as we complete -- we're not fully complete with the cloud at the end of this year, so there'll be additional benefits from that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Can you help update us on your plans around your USIS product launch strategy now that you've finalized your tech transformation? I'm curious; we've seen some releases around recent product launches. Should we see those launches ramp more meaningfully this year? And when do you think we'll start to see a benefit to sales from these efforts?\nMark Begor: Yes, 100%. Just as a reminder, USIS is not complete with their cloud transformation, but they're in the final chapters. So we're going to complete that this year. We have a meaningful number of customers already on the USIS cloud, which is a big deal. And we are -- you are seeing an acceleration of new product rollouts in 2023 already from the USIS team, you may have seen our announcement, which I didn't talk about this morning of our -- we talked about in February of our new mortgage credit report, where we're adding our cell phone utility data to that, that's going to provide a meaningful lift in credit scores for consumers by the addition of that data. And we're the only ones that can do that. So that's going to be a very positive product for us in the mortgage space. I talked about this morning the new OneScore solution that combines our cell phone utility data, which is a very large data set for Equifax that only we have along with our Teletrack and DataX solutions on 80 million consumers in the U.S. So that's another new solution that will be additive to the credit file and differentiate USIS in the marketplace. So that's a brand new product that's out there. We also launched a new solution in our commercial business that's really driving that business growth. And that's one that's been in the marketplace, a little bit longer for a few months, but you're seeing very strong double-digit growth in our commercial business. And in that solution, we're combining our bank transaction data with -- along with our PayNet leasing trade line data, which driven -- which delivers very meaningful predictability lifts and performance lifts for our commercial customers. So big time, we have a -- you're already seeing it the early days of them rolling out their solutions. And I think you are seeing it in some of the revenue in the businesses. And that'll continue to show up as we complete the cloud in USIS later this year. The other lever that's going to be I think we've talked about is we expect to have competitive or market share gains from the stability meaning always on, as well as the data transmission benefits from the Equifax Cloud or USIS. So that's another lever, and we've been clear that we're in active dialogues with customers that are moving Equifax into preferred positions because of our investment in the cloud. And again, there's another USIS benefit. So those impacts on their revenue should show up as we move through 2023, but really kick in, in 2024 and 2025.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. That's helpful. And just as a housekeeping question, there was a $25 million adjustment related to M&A integration. Just curious, which -- what's that related to in particular is that including anything with Boa Vista or is it other past transactions?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So you're talking about the difference between our adjusted and unadjusted financials, no, we include M&A integration for a period of time outside of our adjusted EPS, and that's just the M&A integration related to the -- some of the transactions have been completed over the past 18 months.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I was hoping to ask about the margin ramp in the second half. I know you talked about the $200 million of expense savings with a bulk of that coming from OpEx. But I guess just how much of the margin expansion is in the bag, if you will, based on spending that's going away versus how much is based on scale or improvement in the business?\nJohn Gamble: Well, I'd say in the second half, there's a significant amount, obviously from spending reductions. And there's a lot of execution to do in order to generate those spending reductions. We feel confident that we're going to do it. But -- and we're executing very well through April on doing that, but we're focused on delivering those spending reductions and expect to do that. So it's a significant amount of the improvement in the second half. But we also do have some revenue ramp in the second half, right? We talked about some growth that we're expecting to see in EWS, specifically around their non-mortgage segment. We're expecting to see continued strong performance across international good performance in USIS even across non-mortgage. So we are expecting to see those improvements in revenue, which will also help drive margin enhancement. So it's really in both areas. Both are meaningful and there's execution necessary for both of them in order to deliver the 36% plus margins.\nMark Begor: Maybe just add on that, I'm not sure I'd use your term into bag, but I would say we have a high degree of confidence because we have real visibility around the cost reductions. Those are ones where we know when contractors are going to leave and when we're going to decommission data centers, that's all in our control. So that gives us a lot of confidence and the ability to execute against that if that makes sense.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And for a follow-up, wanted to ask about work number, there've been a few income and employment verification providers moving into the space. I guess how do you see the long-term playing out? Are there specific areas where maybe new competitors can compete in like current employment more recent employment versus like you're providing a lot of value with the historical and have the advantage there? So just I guess maybe long-term competitive wise how do you see the industry playing out?\nMark Begor: Yes. It's not lost on us. There's other players there. The -- our biggest competitor, the way we think about it is pay per pay stubs. Almost 50% of income and employment verifications are still done manually in the United States. The scale of our dataset obviously is a real advantage, and we continue to grow that being up double-digit in records in the quarter, adding three new payroll processors, as you know, we add records through our employer solutions business as we grow that business in UC or W-2 or all the other services we provide to directly to HR managers, so scale is clearly a real advantage to us. And as you also point out, increasingly, the historical records that we have from our decades in the business are super valuable with 50% of Verifier revenue coming from those historical records, that's very hard to get when you're a FinTech trying to get someone's bank account information that only has the net pay in it, getting that historical net pay is a data point, but it's generally not deep enough or broad enough what to use in a lot of the verifications that that we're using. So scale is a big deal for us. The depth of the dataset meaning having gross pay through all the deductions, all those details, and then the historical records. So we're focused on expanding. I think as you know, we've done I think five acquisitions in the last 24 months to strengthen our employer capabilities there. That's a big growth lever for us to add records, and we're continuing to add payroll partners with three new ones signed in the first quarter that'll come online. So we're clearly very, very focused on expanding the record set that we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Could you quantify your 2023 revenue and earnings guidance? How much you've included both from pricing actions at EWS and positive price mix from the shift to trended data particularly benefited by the new mortgage 36 product? And just as a follow-up, Mark, if you could give us a broader framework about how you think about pricing in the EWS business beyond this year in terms of how you think about balancing strong unit demand versus taking price? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes, David, I think, as you know for competitive reasons and commercial reasons, we don't disclose any of our price actions in any parts of the business. I think we've been clear that the majority of Equifax businesses take price up every year. We generally do it on 1/1, and we did that this year and we expect to do it next year and going forward. So no question that that's a part of our strategy. And when you think about price, and I know you do, you got to think about pure price, but also the impact of our new product initiatives, which generally are delivering differentiated solutions with more data and that more data drives more predictability and value for our customers and allows us to charge more for that. So new products are clearly a lever of growth for us. And again, you should also think about Workforce Solutions in particular of having multiple levers that I would say are all important. Certainly, pure prices, pure product growth is a real margin expander and revenue expander for workforce and the rest of Equifax. Record growth certainly drives very meaningfully our top-line and our bottom line at Workforce Solutions and is very unique. Our other businesses and most other data businesses in the industry already have all the records or have marginal ability to add to them. In our case there's 220 million working or income producing Americans in the U.S. and we've got 117 of them million. So there's a lot of growth and being up double-digit in the quarter is a big revenue growth. In Workforce, we also have big penetration opportunities. Remember most data businesses; your dataset is used on every transaction and every customer that's highly penetrated. So because they've been around for a long time, even in mortgage, in Workforce Solutions close to 40% of mortgages are done manually income and employment verification. And that was 55 a few years ago. So we've grown that 500 basis point. So a bunch of levers beyond price is what makes workforce so unique in its ability to outperform the underlying markets that it competes in. Your point on balance is right on you use the right word. We try to be very balanced in all of our businesses, including workforce around what we're doing on pure price in balance. How we look at it going forward is always going to be around the value we're delivering and the unique solutions that we have.\nDavid Togut: Great. And just a second part of that, if you would on contribution from the increasing growth of trended data. I think John; you indicated half of units in USIS were now trended data driven.\nMark Begor: I think that was workforce that we said that in verification, but it costs all of the Equifax businesses. This is not a new trend. But it's one where at workforce the cloud has really enabled them to really roll out a wide array of trended solutions. And we talked about in the call earlier, mortgage 36, which is 36 months of income and employment data on an individual allows the mortgage originator to more quickly get a full picture of that consumer and allow them to approve more loans, which is what they're trying to do. They spend $5,000 to $6,000 of origination costs. They want to make sure they're working with a consumer that can close and afford the loan that they're putting in front of them. So trended is a big deal, and those trended solutions all sell at higher price points than a snapshot of the data.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Your live is now live.\nSeth Weber: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the strength in the international margin in the quarter. Is there anything that you'd call out there either from a regional mix or I know you talked about introducing a bunch of new products? And I -- and the reason why I ask is because it looks like your second quarter margin guide comes is down a little bit sequentially versus the first quarter. And so I'm just trying to understand what's going on there. If it's maybe your cloud migration expenses are starting to ramp or anything you'd call out on international margin. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Sure. So margins obviously were good in the first quarter better than we expected. Not where we want them to be long term, but better than we expected and a lot of it was driven by the really good revenue performance, right? They had very good revenue performance in all regions and really very strong revenue performance for example, stronger than you'd normally expect to see in Asia Pacific. So that along with the stronger performance across all regions, I think gave them better margin performance than we had expected. It's -- we did indicate slightly weaker in the second quarter, and that's really just related to some of the movements in revenue. There is some incremental expense as they continue to move through migration and transformation. There's certainly expense there as you go in from the first to the second quarter. But generally speaking, I think what we're expecting to see is margin performance as we described in the second quarter, and then as we move through the rest of the year, improving margin performance in international.\nSeth Weber: Okay. Thank you. And then just I apologize if I missed this, but did you give kind of what your -- what kind of interest rate framework you guys are expecting for the back half of the year that's kind of embedded in your guidance just --\nMark Begor: We didn't. Yes. If I was able to do that, I'd be in a different job probably, but no, we just said we expect it to be higher inflation, I think the Feds telegraphed that and we expect it to be higher and that's why we put the slowdown in the second half of our guidance back in February and we're still sticking with that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. What does EWS business within non-EWS, where did you see the most change in volume growth going from 4Q to 1Q and how do volume trends need to change to achieve your full-year non-mortgage EWS outlook?\nMark Begor: George, you're breaking up. I don't know if you're on a cell phone or a speaker. I think your questions about EWS and I believe it's around non-mortgage growth, but I didn't hear the rest of it. Can you try again?\nGeorge Tong: Yes. Basically trying to see where we saw the most change in non-mortgage EWS growth going 4Q to 1Q and basically how those trends need to evolve to achieve your full-year non-mortgage EWS outlook.\nMark Begor: Yes. So I think it's around non-mortgage in what the drivers of that EWS in 2023. First, on kind of a growth lever basis, record growth is obviously going to be positive. They did a pricing action early in the year and all the verticals, so that's going to benefit through the year. New product rollouts you've seen have been quite active with their north of 20% Vitality. And then if you go into specific verticals, I think we've given pretty good guidance of where we think talent to be meaning we expect the market to be down, but we're going to outperform the underlying talent market. Government we expect to have very strong growth, meaning stronger than the long-term framework for Workforce Solutions. We've had some very strong success of growing that business at the state level in particular and using our data for social service delivery Appriss Insights, the business that we bought a couple years ago is performing well that's going to be a driver of growth in 2023 for non-mortgage. What would you add, John?\nJohn Gamble: No, I think you covered it well, right?\nMark Begor: Yes. Does that help, George?\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Yes. Yes, that's helpful. And then on the mortgage, you outperformed your mortgage inquiries guidance in 1Q by about 10 points, but you maintained your full-year guidance for mortgage inquiries. Can you talk a little bit about your thinking there?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So mortgage inquiries we're not quite 10 points better in the first quarter, but they certainly were better. And what we do is we took -- we take a look at our current run rates. So as we took a look at late April -- sorry, late March and early April, we took a look at the level of inquiry volumes we were seeing, and we just run a normal year against those. We normalize them for seasonality for the year. And then based on that, what it showed us is we think we're going to come in assuming no meaningful change in the Morgan -- overall mortgage market dynamics. We'd come in at about down 30%. So that that's how we take a look, and that's how we try to measure the market. As Mark said, it's really hard to forecast interest rates or what's going to happen broadly. So we try to use our current experience and then normal seasonal patterns to determine a full-year. And based on what we're seeing in late March and early April, we think that leads to about down 30% for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. So first, just a housekeeping question on mortgage revenue. Just want to clarify that you are still expecting mortgage revenues to be down 8%. I know you've tweaked a little bit how you're thinking about this seasonal patterns around inquiries origination, but just want to clarify that that that overall revenue expectation.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. That's what we said. We said mortgage down 8% or maybe slightly more negative than that. And it's really driven by the fact that we're not seeing as we just to the last question seeing a change in inquiry volume for USIS despite the fact that originations are weaker, right? So that not a big impact on USIS of weaker originations and -- but the weaker originations do impact EWS and we're expecting that they'll be able to principally offset or at least partially offset a portion of the negative impact of lower originations by better mix. And it's specifically around mortgage 36 and increasingly more trended products. So that's how we got to down 8% or maybe slightly more negative.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood. And then there's been as you know, we talked about this couple quarters ago regarding the FHFA change around the credit score models, which is now being implemented in 1Q 2024. I'm curious what you're hearing from lenders and how you expect that to play out next year?\nMark Begor: Yes. We're not hearing much. As we've said many times and as when that was announced I think the industry is still trying to figure out how to implement or if they implement this. There's still discussions going with the regulators about the merits of that change and what meaning does it make sense? The three credit reports actually provide more access to credit. So that's a dialogue that's still happening. But whatever impact it'll be, it'll take some time to be implemented. Even with the so-called first quarter implementation, the mortgage originators can still pull three credit files. It's not mandatory to pull two, it's mandatory to pull three today. Now it'll be mandatory to pull two or more going forward. So the implementation will likely be delayed. And then I think as you know, we've also proactively not aligned with this, but the timing was great, rolled out our new mortgage credit file that has the cell phone utility data elements in it that's going to really drive the value of our file versus our competitors. It's something they can't do because of the scale of our cell phone utility database. So we're trying to position our file as being more valuable in going forward. And then maybe one last point, as you know they also -- what is also mandated is to go from one credit score being the FICO score to be two credit scores FICO and Vantage. And that's a good guy for us and our competitors, two scores is going to allow us to have a revenue increase versus one. And I think the thinking there is it's going to -- there's enough differences between the two scores, just like there are between the three credit files that the two scores will drive access to credit and drive predictability and approvals.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Understood. If I may just ask John a quick question on cash. I know you don't guide to cash flow, but can you give us -- and you mentioned CapEx, but can you give us sort of some of the other factors that we should be thinking about as we model our own cash flows?\nJohn Gamble: Well, obviously, you covered earnings and capital spending, right? Obviously, working capital is something that we continue to focus on. Generally speaking, as you look at the year, right, our working capital tends to be much more negative in the first quarter, like you saw this year, like you've seen every year because of the fact that we pay out benefit programs in the first quarter, our compensation programs and also we make our 401(k) match, right? So you tend to see a negative impact on our cash flow in the first quarter like you did this year, like you did last year. And then our cash flow tends to accelerate as we move through the year. And we're expecting to continue to make working capital improvements as we move through the rest of this year, so.\nMark Begor: And if you go back to our guide to exiting the year at 36% EBITDA margins, that obviously is generating a lot more free cash flow as we exit the year. I don't know whether you're modeling the year or longer-term, but that 36% stepping off point for the end of the year into 2024, and we've also -- we haven't given actual guidance, but we've used the words that we expect CapEx to come down again next year. And of course with our 39% EBITDA margin goal for 2025 there's a lot of cash flow that'll be generated from the step from now to 36% and then 36% to 39%. And we talked earlier on the call about how we think about capital allocation. As I mentioned earlier, CapEx will come down and I think we've given guidance before John of about 7% of revenue being our long-term CapEx investment in the company, which will be more focused on new products going forward versus the cloud transformation. We also have in our long-term framework to add 1% to 2% of revenue from bolt-on M&A. So that'll be a element of our free cash utilization. But as you get out to 2024 and 2025, there'll be excess free cash flow. That'll be quite meaningful that we intend to return to shareholders through dividend and buyback at the right time.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor for any further or closing comments.\nTrevor Burns: Yes. Thanks for everybody's time today. And please follow-up if any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Before I discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on first quarter 2023. First quarter corporate expense at $146 million was above our expectations, principally due to higher variable compensation with our strong first quarter results and cost related to executing the broader restructuring related to the $200 million spending reduction program. Items below operating income came in as we expected with interest expense of $58 million, depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related amortization of $89 million, and a tax rate of about 26.1%. Capital spending in the quarter was about $154 million and in line with our expectations. We expect capital spending in the second quarter to remain at level similar to 1Q 2023 and then sequentially decline in the third and fourth quarters as we complete significant U.S. and Canadian customer migrations to data fabric. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter, as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. As Mark mentioned, first quarter mortgage market originations were estimated by MBA at down almost 58%, which is about 300 basis points weaker than the down 55% for the first quarter that we discussed in February. As shown on Slide 11, however, first quarter credit inquiries were down 44% better than our February expectations. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate did decline from a high of 6.5% in the quarter to about 6.3% today. It appears the somewhat lower rates attracted people to begin the home buying process, but continued tight inventory and high home prices, limited closings and originations. As we look for the rest of 2023, our planning does not assume a fundamental improvement in the mortgage or housing markets. We're applying normal seasonal patterns to the current run rate of credit and TWN inquiries that we are seeing in late March and early April. On that basis for 2023, we are expecting mortgage market originations to decline about 32% versus 2022 or about a 200 basis point greater decline than we discussed in February. As we have discussed in the past, TWN inquiries are closely linked to originations. USIS credit inquiries despite the weaker overall originations market should still be down about 30% versus 2022 due to the better than expected credit inquiries in the first quarter and the expectation of continued greater than normal mortgage shopping that does not move to an origination. Looking at the second quarter, again applying seasonal patterns to the run rates we're seeing in late March and early April, mortgage market originations are assumed to be down about 38% and credit inquiries down about 33%. As we discussed in February sequentially as we move through the second half of 2023, a more normal pattern of mortgage activity would have mortgage originations in 3Q 2023 being about flat with 2Q 2023, and then declining in 4Q 2023 versus 3Q 2023. We expect that with these sequential patterns and the weaker overall originations in 2023 than we discussed in February, U.S. mortgage originations would be down slightly in the second half versus the first half and 4Q 2023 would be about flat year-to-year. Turning to Slide 12. As Mark referenced earlier, in the first quarter, we outperformed on revenue delivery and delivered well against our 2023 spending reduction plan that will deliver $200 million in spending reduction in 2023 versus 2022 levels, including workforce reduction, closure of data centers, and additional cost control measures. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins were slightly stronger than expected at 29.2%, adjusted for the negative timing of the impact higher stock-based compensation in the quarter versus fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins would've been about 31%. For 2Q, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approaching 32.5% at the mid-point of our guidance range. This sequential margin expansion is driven by both revenue growth as well as acceleration of the savings in the second half of 2023 related to our $200 million spending reduction plan. As revenue growth sequentially in the second half of 2023 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. Slide 13 provides our guidance for the second quarter of 2023. In 2Q 2023, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion, with non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 8% partially offset by mortgage revenue declines moderating to about down 14%, compared to down 33% in the first quarter. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by just over 100 basis points. 2Q 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to approach 32.5% up over 300 basis points sequentially given revenue growth, the 2023 cost actions and lower equity compensation expense. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are expected to be up sequentially from 1Q 2023 driven by workforce delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of over 51% in the quarter, as well as margin improvement in USIS from revenue growth and cost actions. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully, sequentially in 2Q 2023 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter. Business unit performance in the second quarter expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 1%, negatively impacted by the expected about 38% decline in mortgage market originations. Non-mortgage revenue will be up high-single-digits, overcoming year-over-year declines in U.S. hiring and customer specific weakness in consumer lending. We expect EWS non-mortgage growth to reaccelerate to double-digits in the third and fourth quarters. EBITDA margins are expected to be up over -- are expected to be over 51%, up over 100 basis points sequentially driven by sequential revenue growth and strong execution of 2023 cost actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 3% year-to-year. Non-mortgage revenue growth should be approximately at the level similar to the 8% we delivered in the first quarter, partially offset by a decline in mortgage revenue due to the expected 33% decline in mortgage credit inquiries. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34%, up sequentially due to revenue growth and strong execution on cost actions. International revenue is expected to be up about 6% in constant currency with EBITDA margins expected to be about 23%. Non-mortgage constant currency growth of 7% to 8% is down from the 10% we delivered in the first quarter. We do expect to return to 10% plus growth in 3Q and 4Q, principally driven by accelerating growth in EWS as well as stronger growth in international. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q 2023 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Slide 14 provides the specifics of our 2023 full-year guidance. As Mark mentioned, we are maintaining our full-year guidance despite the expected weaker U.S. mortgage originations and a more negative impact of foreign exchange. We expect total mortgage revenue to be down year-to-year at similar levels to our February guidance at down 8% or slightly more negative. As we discussed, we expect mortgage originations will be down 32% versus the down 30% we discussed in February. We do not expect this to impact USIS mortgage revenue, as we are seeing higher levels of shopping, which offset the decline in originations. In EWS, we expect an improved mix of higher value trended mortgage solutions to partially mitigate the impact of the originations decline. For non-mortgage constant currency revenue, we continue to expect constant currency growth at about the levels we discussed in February at up 8% or slightly better given our strong performance in NPI and stronger growth in international. These levels of growth, the strong start we had to the year, execution in NPI, delivery of our 2023 spending reductions in cloud transformation plan, allow us to deliver to our guidance despite the more negative impact of FX. We believe that our full-year guidance is centered at the mid-point of both our revenue and adjusted EPS ranges. As we discussed in February, we remain focused on delivering our mid-term goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins, market conditions are significantly different than we first discussed in November of 2021, our goal of achieving these goals in 2025. The U.S. mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down about 40% from the normal 2015 to 2019 average levels, we had discussed to deliver $7 billion in revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of 2021. However, a recovery in the mortgage market from the levels we are seeing in 2023 upon the order of two-thirds of the loss volume is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal. We are focused on driving above market growth and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed with our 2023 and 2024 spending reduction plans and as part of our data and technology cloud transformation, which are needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins as we exceed the $7 billion revenue level. We will continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion goal as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. Now, I would like to turn it back over to Mark. And in terms of full-year -- in terms of full-year, the slightly -- the comment you made about were slightly stronger given the adjustments in FX. What you're seeing is international's actually performing a little better, right? So in our 2023 guidance, we did take up our expectation for international growth by about 100 basis points. Yes. As Mark mentioned in DDM, we did say in pre-screen, we are seeing some impact right from FinTech as well as smaller financial institutions. And that's really where we're seeing it in pre-screening and why pre-screen was weaker. Yes. So I don't think we gave an organic number for the full-year, right? But what we are expecting to see as we talked about is nice strength and strengthening in our total non-mortgage growth as we go through the rest of the third quarter and fourth quarter. Sure. So I think what EWS is continuing to see very good performance in government. We expect to continue to see that, that move forward as we go through the rest of the year. They're also seeing really nice progress in new product. So we're expecting to see good acceleration in NPI across -- Record additions as we go through the rest of the year, as well as they added three new payroll processors in the first quarter. And we expect to see accelerating growth in records as we go through the year. So I think all of those things will help us continue to drive higher performance in non-mortgage in EWS as we go through the rest of the year. So again, what we talked about, I think in the quarter is we had very good growth in total. It was about 16% I think in Verifier and then 11% growth. We didn't give a specific organic number. Acquisitions weren't that substantial in EWS in the past year so that there's really not a significant impact from acquisitions. And really what we're expecting as we just talked about a minute ago to drive the growth as we go forward is really continued acceleration in growth in government and continued addition of records, benefits of new products, as well as additional pricing that should allow us to get, to drive back to total growth in the back half of the year that's above 10% as it was in the first quarter. Yes. I think the more relevant comparison really is against originations, right? Because USIS obviously ties very closely to credit inquiries, but EWS is much more closely tied to originations because EWS TWN data is not pulled as early in the cycle of a mortgage as credit is. So it's very closely tied to an origination. And the 20% outperformance relative to originations, we think was very strong and very consistent with our expectations. So we feel really good about the way they're performing. And again, it's all the things Mark's already referenced, strong record growth, good performance and pricing and especially in the last couple of quarters, they've done an outstanding job of rolling out mortgage 36, which is their new trended product, which has been very beneficial in which the rollout will complete here as we get through first quarter and into second quarter. So we feel really good about their outperformance against mortgage. Very tough comp from last year. So I think we indicated that auto performed well, right? And we also indicated, I believe that that FI or banking right was about flat, right? And our credit card business was inside of FI. Very near-term, right? We're focused on reducing leverage and as we move through 2023 and early 2024, you'll see us focus on leverage reduction. And I think in the back half of the year, focus on integrations, obviously as we complete BVS and integrate the other acquisitions we've done over the next couple of years. Yes. So we didn't really give a forecast by segment, right? But I think what we did talk about is that embedded in our guidances and expectation is we'll see generally weakening markets as we go through the rest of this year. That's certainly true in the U.S. in the back half -- sorry, in the back half of this year in the U.S. but also in most of our international markets. We didn't give specific forecasts around auto and/or FI. One thing I would change in your walk there, Jeff, I think you're hitting a lot of the right points is the record growth. Remember, in Talent, we use our historical records and current records growth is very important, but most of what we're leveraging is not records from the quarter in that business, it's records over the last year, two-year, three-year, four-year, five years. So that that isn't going to be quite as big an impact as far as higher hit rates as we add in essence what you're adding, you want to add is more jobs. New product rollouts as we talked they've rolled out a couple new products actually a number of new products over the last 12 months to 18 months. So those are benefiting kind of on a year-over-year basis as they're embedded in with our customers principally background screeners. And we rolled out a couple new ones in the quarter; one for the hourly workforce that we think is going to provide growth to us going forward. And then the other growth lever for that business to offset a declining market is just pure penetration. Remember, we're doing in rough kind of high-level math, 2 in 10 or 3 in 10 background screens are using our data. The others are still using the manual DPO kind of process. So that's an opportunity for the business. I don't know if that's helpful. So -- so specific to equity, no, the impact each year is probably relatively similar, right? Because it's just the fact that the grants that are executed in the given year based on the structure of the programs now currently end up being -- the expense ends up being taken in the first quarter. As Mark mentioned, in terms of the impact on our margins going from fourth to first of 20 -- fourth of 2022 to first of 2023, we did obviously have an incremental impact as we normalize cash incentive compensation, and that's not something that we should see each year going forward, but the equity incentive compensation, yes, that's something you'll see each year. Yes. So you're talking about the difference between our adjusted and unadjusted financials, no, we include M&A integration for a period of time outside of our adjusted EPS, and that's just the M&A integration related to the -- some of the transactions have been completed over the past 18 months. Well, I'd say in the second half, there's a significant amount, obviously from spending reductions. And there's a lot of execution to do in order to generate those spending reductions. We feel confident that we're going to do it. But -- and we're executing very well through April on doing that, but we're focused on delivering those spending reductions and expect to do that. So it's a significant amount of the improvement in the second half. But we also do have some revenue ramp in the second half, right? We talked about some growth that we're expecting to see in EWS, specifically around their non-mortgage segment. We're expecting to see continued strong performance across international good performance in USIS even across non-mortgage. So we are expecting to see those improvements in revenue, which will also help drive margin enhancement. So it's really in both areas. Both are meaningful and there's execution necessary for both of them in order to deliver the 36% plus margins. No, I think you covered it well, right? Yes. So mortgage inquiries we're not quite 10 points better in the first quarter, but they certainly were better. And what we do is we took -- we take a look at our current run rates. So as we took a look at late April -- sorry, late March and early April, we took a look at the level of inquiry volumes we were seeing, and we just run a normal year against those. We normalize them for seasonality for the year. And then based on that, what it showed us is we think we're going to come in assuming no meaningful change in the Morgan -- overall mortgage market dynamics. We'd come in at about down 30%. So that that's how we take a look, and that's how we try to measure the market. As Mark said, it's really hard to forecast interest rates or what's going to happen broadly. So we try to use our current experience and then normal seasonal patterns to determine a full-year. And based on what we're seeing in late March and early April, we think that leads to about down 30% for the year. Yes. That's what we said. We said mortgage down 8% or maybe slightly more negative than that. And it's really driven by the fact that we're not seeing as we just to the last question seeing a change in inquiry volume for USIS despite the fact that originations are weaker, right? So that not a big impact on USIS of weaker originations and -- but the weaker originations do impact EWS and we're expecting that they'll be able to principally offset or at least partially offset a portion of the negative impact of lower originations by better mix. And it's specifically around mortgage 36 and increasingly more trended products. So that's how we got to down 8% or maybe slightly more negative. Well, obviously, you covered earnings and capital spending, right? Obviously, working capital is something that we continue to focus on. Generally speaking, as you look at the year, right, our working capital tends to be much more negative in the first quarter, like you saw this year, like you've seen every year because of the fact that we pay out benefit programs in the first quarter, our compensation programs and also we make our 401(k) match, right? So you tend to see a negative impact on our cash flow in the first quarter like you did this year, like you did last year. And then our cash flow tends to accelerate as we move through the year. And we're expecting to continue to make working capital improvements as we move through the rest of this year, so."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 10% constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth as we executed well against our Equifax 2025 strategic priorities and the $200 million spending plan we announced in February. Before I cover our strong results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and U.S. consumer. We continue to navigate a higher interest rate environment that has severely impacted the U.S. mortgage market. Mortgage originations were down 56% in 2022, and we expect them to be down about 32% this year. In the second half, we expect mortgage inquiries to be approaching an unprecedented 40% below 2015 to 2019 levels. The combined market impact in 2022 and 2023 is expected to reduce Equifax revenue by over $900 million, but the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and fast growing non-mortgage businesses allowed Equifax to deliver 20% non-mortgage constant dollar growth last year, and 4% total growth last year, and an expectation to deliver 8% non-mortgage and 4% total growth in 2023 at the mid-point of our guidance, more than offsetting the large negative impact from the unprecedented mortgage market decline. Broadly, consumers are still strong with unemployment at historically low levels and with modest increases in delinquencies. We're seeing some credit card and personal loan delinquency increases in subprime and more broadly DQs are now back to pre-pandemic levels, although they remain significantly below the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. Auto loan delinquency rates for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels as well as above the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. And as you know, delinquencies generally are manageable when people are working. While we have seen limited pockets of DQ increases, we continue to watch this important metric as we move through the rest of the year. Historically, as DQs increase, our customers will begin to reduce marketing and tighten originations. Gross hiring year-to-date through February was down about 6% slightly better than the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, and inflation remains at elevated levels, but has begun to moderate slightly given Fed actions but with inflation still well above Fed targets, we expect further rate increases. And we believe there has been some credit tightening at some customers with more impact in FinTech from both expectations of a slowing economy in the second half and capital issues impacting certain banks. And as you recall, our guidance assumed a slowdown in the second half. While we are operating in an uncertain and challenging economic environment, Equifax continues to deliver. The breadth and depth of Equifax's broad-based business model is allowing us to weather this, the unprecedented mortgage market decline and deliver revenue growth and margin expansion. Turning to Slide 4. Equifax had another strong quarter with non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth up 10%. First quarter reported revenue of $1.302 billion was down 4.5% and down 4.3% on an organic constant currency basis and above our expectations against an unprecedented 58% mortgage market decline in the quarter. Revenue was above the high-end of our February guidance from broad-based strength and execution across Equifax and continued strong new product rollouts. First quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $380 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.2% both in line with our expectations. Adjusting for the incremental stock-based compensation expense incurred in the quarter adjusted EBITDA margins would've been approximately 31%, which is the baseline of which we expect to grow to 36% in the fourth quarter from revenue growth and our $120 million cost savings plan. As a reminder, the bulk of the spending reduction benefit the second half and we have $50 million of carryover benefit in 2024 from our actions this year. Adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share was above our February guidance range of $1.30 or $1.40 per share from stronger than expected revenue growth. Our Equifax non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 80% of total revenue in the quarter, were strong with 10% constant currency and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth, with the 10% growth solidly inside our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. All BUs delivered stronger than expected non-mortgage growth, which is positive momentum for the rest of the year. Estimated U.S. mortgage market originations, which MBA forecasted to be down about 58% in the quarter were slightly weaker than the down 55% in our February framework. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 33% or 25 points better than the market with both total revenue and our mortgage outperformance stronger than we outlined in February. The stronger outperformance was driven by better U.S. credit inquiries from higher than expected consumer shopping and positive mix in workforce solutions driven by significant growth from our new mortgage 36 trended product. We continue to make significant progress driving completion of the Equifax data and technology transformation. At the end of the quarter, over 70% of Equifax is being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud, which will expand to 80% by year-end as we substantially complete the North America customer migrations to the Equifax Cloud. Our new Equifax Cloud infrastructure is delivering always on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated datasets, faster data delivery, better data quality, and industry-leading enterprise level security. We continue to be convinced that our Equifax Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. New product innovation leveraging the capabilities delivered by the Equifax Cloud is also executing at a very high-level. Our new product Vitality Index of 13% in the quarter is at record levels and 300 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal. And as you recall, in February, we reached the definitive agreement to acquire Boa Vista Servic\u0327os, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closings conditions, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. As we outlined in February, we're executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation benefits and a broader focus on operational improvements aided by our new cloud capabilities. The plan will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023, as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers and other broader spending controls. Total spending reductions from these 2023 actions are expected to be about $200 million with about $120 million reduction in expense or about $0.75 per share and $80 million reduction in capital spending. And we're tracking well to the plans we laid out in February, and we remain committed to meeting these cost improvement targets. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce spending by an incremental $50 million to over $250 million. And we're maintaining our 2023 full-year revenue guidance of $5.275 billion to $5.375 billion, and adjusted EPS guidance of $7.05 per share to $7.35 per share. Our guidance continues to assume a weakening U.S. and global economy in the second half. Given the slightly weaker U.S. mortgage market that we saw principally in March, we are now assuming U.S. mortgage market inquiries for 2023 to be down about 32% or 200 basis points weaker than we discussed in February. Given our strong and broad-based performance in the first quarter, our ability to continue to outperform underlying markets and execution on our plan 2023 spending reductions, we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance in a continued challenging mortgage market and expected slowing economy in the second half. We also continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of over 36% in the fourth quarter, which is a very important stepping off point for 2024. John will provide more detail on the overall mortgage market and our second quarter and full-year guidance shortly. Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage revenue performance delivering 10% constant dollar and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth. All three business units delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth in the quarter with workforce up 11%, international up 10% in constant currency, and USIS up 8%. This broad-based non-mortgage growth across the business units will be increasingly supported by completion of the Equifax Cloud and continued NPI growth across the businesses. First quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 10% was well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in U.S. hiring activity that impacted EWS' Talent Solutions and I-9 businesses, as well as the comparison off a very strong 25% non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth in first quarter last year. Turning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another very strong quarter with non-mortgage revenue growth up 11% and total revenue down 8% as expected from the 58% mortgage market decline. EWS had another strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 4 million records added to the TWN database ending the quarter with 156 million current records, up 15% and 117 million unique records, which was up 12%. This is a very positive sign, has historically the first quarter has lower net record growth as large retail and logistics companies reduce elevated holiday season staffing in the first quarter. And as a reminder, unique records represent individuals on the TWN database and current records represent current active jobs in the database. And in our case, we have almost 50 million individuals having more than one job in our dataset. 117 million unique individuals on TWN deliver high hit rates, including self-employed or 1099 employees and defined benefit pensioners we now cover just over 50% of the 220 million people in the U.S. with employment and income records that are relevant to TWN database and our customers. As I referenced last quarter, we're also beginning to onboard pension records with records from one major pension administrator and discussions with many more. And through our cloud tech transformation, we're executing -- expanding our capabilities to ingest unique 1099 based self-employment records. And as a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers from our employer services business relationships. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. And during the quarter, we signed agreements with three new payroll processors that will deliver records during the balance of 2023. And the TWN U.S. database now has 618 million total current and historical records from over 2.7 million employers. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporated current and historical records with about 50% of first quarter verification services revenue coming from products that include historical or trended records. Mortgage revenue was down 38% in the quarter, which was in line with our February guidance, but outperformed the overall mortgage market by 20 points when compared to the 58% decline in originations. These are very strong results when compared to EWS' 52% outperformance in the first quarter last year. In addition to strong record growth and the positive impact from price actions in the quarter, we also saw strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of our new mortgage 36 solution, which is a 36-month trended product. During the quarter, over 50% of TWN mortgage inquiries were for products including trended or historical information and all at higher price points. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce delivered revenue of $596 million, down 8% and in line with our expectations. Verification Services revenue of $456 million was down 11%, driven by the decline in mortgage revenue that I just referenced. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents about two-thirds of Verifier revenue delivered strong 16% growth in the quarter. We saw continued very strong growth in the government vertical, which is about 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, with revenue up 33% driven by strong growth with CMS at the state level, new products, and record additions. We expect this strong growth in our government vertical to continue throughout the year. Talent Solutions delivered strong 10% growth in the quarter despite the 6% decline in the overall hiring market. Talent Solutions volumes have remained consistent since the middle of the fourth quarter despite the declining hiring market. We outgrew the market decline by over 15 percentage points delivering 10% growth a very strong performance driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing. In the quarter, we launched new products targeted to staffing and hourly segments, designed to meet specific needs of background screeners and end market employers in these very high volume market segments. We're also seeing continued penetration of our new educational background solutions. We expect these new products to continue to drive talent growth throughout 2023. Consumer lending was down 1% in the quarter due to lower auto volumes with financial institutions and P loan declines with FinTech lenders. Employer Services revenue of $141 million was up 4% from growth in our I-9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact in U.S. hiring offset by a 9% decline in UC or unemployment claims driven by lower jobless claims. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we've not seen an increase in UC transactions yet. And as a reminder, first quarter Employer Services revenues are seasonally higher than other quarters due to higher Affordable Care Act and W2 volumes. Last month, Workforce Solutions launched the PeopleHQ portal, a new cloud native solution that brings together multiple best-in-class employer compliance services in a single unified online experience. PeopleHQ serves employers of all sizes and supports the total employee journey with enhance and connected people first experience leveraging the full suite of EWS Employer Solutions, powered by the Equifax Cloud and leveraging industry-leading security measures the PeopleHQ portal will have several EWS services including the work number verification service I-9 HQ, including I-9 Anywhere and I-9 Inspect and ACA HQ with best-in-class Affordable Care Act capabilities that help employers meet the needs of their employees while also reducing risk for penalties. PeopleHQ is another example of how EWS is leveraging our new cloud native capabilities to deliver new solutions to the market that will drive employer revenue and continued direct record growth. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 50.4% were up 370 basis points from the fourth quarter and in line with our February guidance and as expected above 50% due to first quarter record growth, new product introductions and pricing actions, more than offsetting the macro effect of lower volumes in mortgage and Talent Solutions, as well as the negative mix from seasonally higher Employer Services revenues. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in the quarter. Rudy and the EWS team delivered another strong quarter outperforming the mortgage and hiring markets and continued strong record growth that will drive revenue and margins in the future. Turning to Slide 8. USIS revenue of $422 million was down about 2.5% and much better than our expectations due to stronger mortgage and non-mortgage performance. USIS mortgage revenue was down 25% and was better than our expectations. Although estimated mortgage originations were 300 basis points weaker than our expectation at down an estimated 58%, USIS credit inquiries were stronger than we expected at down 44%. Credit inquiry performance continues to outperform originations, reflecting higher relative levels of consumer mortgage shopping behavior in this higher interest rate environment. Revenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 19%, driven principally by pricing actions and was also strong versus a net estimated originations at 33%. At $105 million, our mortgage revenue was about 25% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Total non-mortgage revenue of $317 million was up 8% in the quarter with organic growth of about 4%. The 8% growth was stronger than the mid-single-digit growth that we expected in our February guidance. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $261 million, which represented over 60% of total USIS revenue was up 8% with organic revenue growth of about 3%. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up 9% total and up over 3% organically. And during the quarter, online revenue had very strong double-digit growth in commercial, auto, identity and fraud, and insurance. And banking was up slightly in the quarter with growth at large financial institutions, although at slower pace than in the fourth quarter more than offset by declines in -- with smaller financial institutions and FinTechs. Commercial was up over 20% with continued strong growth from our differentiated commercial credit data, including financial, telco, utility, and industry trade lines and our new OneScore for commercial that we launched in the first quarter. Commercial is an increasing area of strength delivering above market growth in the risk segment and we should see continued strong performance as we complete their data and cloud transformation later this year. Financial Marketing Services our B2B offline business returned to growth with revenue of $48 million was up 4%, and in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in offline fraud insights and IXI wealth products was partially offset by lower pre-screen marketing revenue. Pre-screen revenue from larger customers slowed growth in the quarter, but we saw a significant weakness from smaller FIs and FinTechs. And we have not seen an increase in risk-based portfolio reviews yet. USIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $56 million in first quarter, up 8% from very good performances in our consumer direct and indirect channels. USIS is winning in the marketplace with strong momentum from new solutions and differentiated data in key verticals of identity and fraud, commercial and auto. We're also in active dialogues with U.S. customers about the competitive benefits of the Equifax Cloud with always on stability, faster data transmission, and Equifax Cloud enabled new solutions. USIS is on offense as they finalize their cloud transformation and are pivoting to selling cloud enabled -- new cloud enabled solutions. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.6% in the quarter and in line with our expectations. EBITDA margins were down sequentially due to negative mix from seasonally sequential growth in mortgage solutions, which drives higher royalties and data costs, as well as the normalization of annual employee incentive costs. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to the new Equifax cloud that are accelerating as we move through 2023. We expect USIS adjusted EBITDA margins to be about 34% in the second quarter up sequentially reflecting revenue growth and the accelerating benefit of our 2023 spending reduction plan. Last month we announced Todd Horvath joined Equifax as our USIS President. Todd has a proven track record of leading enterprise teams and financial services to drive growth and strong commercial relationship. And he brings more than 20 years of financial services management experience, a commitment to driving product and operational excellence and strong expertise in enterprise and cloud technologies to his role as the USIS President. I'm energized to welcome Todd to the Equifax leadership team and believe that his experience in transformation, innovation, and customer experience will proven valuable to taking USIS to the next year. Turning to Slide 9. International revenue was $284 million in the quarter, up 9% in constant currency and 8% organically and much better than our expectations from new products and pricing actions. We're seeing a broad-based execution from Lisa and our international team. Europe local currency revenue was down 4%, but stronger than expected. The decline was due to the expected 20% decline in our debt management business in the UK. As we discussed last year, our UK debt management business was very strong in the first half of 2022, as the UK government made large catch-up debt placements following their COVID debt collection moratoriums. As a result, we expect to see declines in that business in the first half of 2022. However, we do expect to see consistent sequential growth in our debt management business as we move through 2023. In the quarter, we secured an expanded budget allocation from the UK government, which will deliver higher volumes of debt placements during the year, and we expect debt management to return to revenue growth later this year. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was up 7% in the quarter, a very good performance and stronger than we expected. This strong performance was principally due to strong growth from consumer decisioning and analytical solutions. Asia-Pacific delivered very strong local currency revenue growth of 11% in which Australia delivered high-single-digit growth in the quarter. We also saw a very strong growth in our India business up over 40%. Latin America local currency revenue was up a very strong 32% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team, which we expect to continue in 2023. Canada local currency revenue was up 8% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer and identity and fraud was offset partially by lower mortgage volumes in Canada. And international adjusted EBITDA margins at 23.5% were better than our expectations due to the stronger revenue growth and good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans. Turning to Slide 10. New product introductions leveraging our differentiated data in the new Equifax Cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. Building off the momentum from 2022 where we launched over 100 new products and delivered a record Vitality Index of over 13%. In the first quarter, we launched over 30 new products and delivered 13% Vitality again. Our first quarter Vitality Index was again led by very strong performance in Workforce Solutions and in Latin America. And in the quarter, over 80% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver Vitality Index in 2023 at about 13%, which is well above our 10% long-term Vitality Index goal. This equates to over $700 million of revenue from new products introduced in the past three years during 2023. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top-line growth and margins. On the right side of the slide, we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. Leveraging our differentiated data, USIS launched OneScore, a new consumer credit scoring model that combines traditional Equifax credit history with telecommunications, payTV, and utility payment data on over 191 million consumers, as well as Equifax DataX and Teletrack specialty finance data on about 80 million consumers, including payment history from non-traditional banks and lenders, which will potentially increase credit scores by up to 25 points in the scorable population by more than 20%. These new solutions are testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud in driving innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities for them. Now, I'd like to turn over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter guidance. We're up to a strong start in 2023, building off the momentum from a strong 2022 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth and pricing. John? Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with above market performance delivering strong 10% non-mortgage constant currency dollar revenue growth, reflecting the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. At the business unit level, Workforce Solutions had another strong quarter powering our results delivering 11% non-mortgage revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%. As I mentioned earlier, EWS signed three new payroll processors with -- and with our TWN current records reaching 156 million, up 4 million records sequentially and up 15% versus last year. Workforce delivered another very strong quarter with a Vitality Index over 20% from innovative new products and solutions leveraging the new EFX Cloud while further penetrating the high growth talent and government verticals. USIS continued their momentum from the fourth quarter with B2B non-mortgage growth of 8% total and 3% organic in the quarter, driven by online B2B non-mortgage growth of 9% total and 3% organic as they accelerate customer migrations to their new Equifax Cloud. International delivered strong 9% local currency growth with strong growth in LATAM, Australia, Canada, India, and our European credit businesses. And our first quarter, Vitality Index up 13% continues to be well above our 10% long-term NPI framework as we delivered over 30 new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud in the quarter. And we made significant progress executing against our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation with over 70% of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud and we're laser-focused on completing our North America migration this year to become the only cloud native data analytics company. And we're executing against our spending reduction plans that will deliver $200 million of savings in 2023, with run rate savings of over $250 million in 2024 that will expand our margins to 36% and EPS to over $2 per share as we exit the year, which positions us for an uncertain economic environment while reducing the capital intensity of our business. And as mentioned earlier, given our strong performance in the quarter, our ability to continue to outperform our underlying markets and deliver on our plan 2023 spending reductions, we've reaffirmed our 2023 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the Equifax Cloud over the past four years to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We're energized by the early benefits of the Equifax Cloud. We're delivering on the cost benefits we outlined four years ago, and you're seeing our margins expand. The competitive benefits of being always on the faster data transmission and digital macro are positioning us for share gains. The power of a Single Data Fabric where all our data has moved from siloed environments to a single data environment is allowing us to deliver unique solutions like our new mortgage credit report leveraging NC Plus data, OneScore leveraging all our alternative -- all of our alternative data, and a wide array of trended solutions leveraging our historical data. NPIs leveraging our differentiated data and cloud capabilities are accelerating and well above our 10% long-term Vitality goal with over 13% Vitality last year and 13% in the first quarter. Even more encouraging is Workforce Solutions NPI results who completed most of their cloud work early last year and is delivering over 20% Vitality in 2023. This is exciting time for Equifax and I'm energized about our strong above market performance, but even more energized about the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets and our new Single Data Fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins, and higher free cash flow in the future. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes. We -- maybe I'll start with FinTech. As you know, we have a FinTech business. Our position there is smaller than at least one of our competitors, and we've been seeing tightening in that space for a number of quarters. I think it started really almost a year ago with the FinTech tightening really from their balance sheet challenges. We haven't seen much impact, if you go to mid-size banks, we expect them to continue to originate. There'll be some tightening there as we outlined, and we believe that's factored into our second half guidance where we expect to see a slowdown in some of the originations. But as you might imagine, the bulk of our revenue comes from the larger FIs that haven't been impacted by this balance sheet impacts or balance sheet tightening from deposits. Yes. It's a great question, Manav. It's one that we've talked about before. And we've been working and deeply involved in AI on our data analytics team for a long time. You've heard us talk about NDT, which is one of our patented solutions around explainable AI that we're using both internally and with our customers, and it's embedded in our ignite solution. And our relationship with Google, as you know, we're on the Google Cloud brings very strong capabilities to us that we're leveraging to expand our AI capabilities. And as you point out, I think this is a big I would call it a macro meaning for the industry of using AI to really drive more predictability and manage more data going forward. And we believe we're uniquely positioned to really take advantage of the AI capabilities by having number one, all our data in the Single Data Fabric, which as you know is unique to Equifax. And then second being cloud native. As we complete the cloud over the coming quarters, principally in North America that's going to allow both Workforce Solutions and USIS to really leverage those AI capabilities to just bring new solutions and more solutions leveraging more data to our customers going forward. Well, I would say even though, as you know, our mid-size banks, there was no impact that we could see or measure really in the -- in March or really in April so far from deposit tightening, you know what we mentioned that we've seen some tightening in some areas, FinTechs, for example number one, because of delinquency concerns in subprime consumers, which I would characterize as unrelated to the deposit and balance sheet issues that some of those FinTechs have been having. And broadly we haven't seen that impact. It's really been more just risk management from tightening around certain credit ban because of concerns around consumer exposure. And again is that you heard my comments earlier, broadly the consumers still quite healthy and broadly delinquencies are still very manageable and low versus kind of historic levels which is allowing our customers to continue to originate. But back in February, and again, today, we still are looking at the second half as being what we characterize as some level of slowdown, and that's reflected in our guidance and how we think about our ability to deliver in the second half. And that's reflected in our reaffirmation of the full-year guidance, we think that strength of the broader businesses and remember, there's a lot of Equifax businesses that are outside of financial services. When you think about Workforce Solutions government, Talent Solutions, our employer business, many of our identity and fraud businesses in USIS are not in financial services. So there's a diversity element, of course, we have an international business is quite large that's all a part of Equifax. Yes. I think you point out the underlying market is declining. There's less hiring going on for sure. You have a combination of companies doing layoffs and when companies do layoffs, they generally tighten up headcount addition. So we're clearly seeing that that started in the fourth quarter and continued through the first quarter. Really, it's kind of a similar decline. And then what's offsetting that is remember, we have a large business here, but the TAM is huge. It's about a $5 billion TAM and we've got a -- almost a $400 million business here. So we have a lot of number one penetration opportunities. So even if the market's declining, we have the opportunity to add new customers or get more market share with existing customers, which are primarily background screeners. Number two, as you point out, every year we take up price generally in the first quarter. So that price benefit, that is in the results in the first quarter, and that's a positive. And you heard us talk about some of the new products which really is driving that penetration. We've rolled out a number of new products in the first quarter that are also benefiting the talent business. And then last would be record additions. As we add new records, we have more jobs on our database and those allow us to have higher hit rates, when background screens are completed. So the number of levers that workforce has in that vertical, and frankly in all those verticals allows them to outperform their underlying markets quite strongly and that's inherent in their business model. Record additions. Yes, yes. Two great questions. On the first one, that's a big part of not only EWS, but across Equifax, but EWS when they completed the cloud last year was really able to unleash a lot of the capabilities around leveraging their historical dataset. And I think as you know, we keep every record so we have over 600 million records. And if you think about mortgage or you think about auto or so many other verticals understanding how much someone has paid today is very valuable. But having the history of what they're paid and is that pay increasing? Is it decreasing? Is it staying the same? Or if you've got a employee an individual who's compensated with a sales commission on a quarterly basis or an annual basis, that won't be picked up in the snapshot today. So trended data is very, very valuable. And we talked about in the call that we launched in I think it was in the early in the fourth quarter, a new mortgage 36 product that gives 36 months' worth of history of employment leveraging our historical data. And that's become a very strong seller inside of the mortgage space. And that sells at really multiples meaning 2 to 3x what a snapshot would sell for are basic income and employment data sales for $40 to $50 to $60. The trended data will be multiples of that because it delivers so much more predictive information for our customers. And our customers are buying it. Same thing in other verticals around that historical data is very valuable in background screening, some employers are looking for last job worked for certain jobs. Other employers are maybe in a white collar role are looking for five years' worth of history. And we obviously sell that longer history at a higher price point versus just the snapshot. So that's a big growth player for us. And I think we talked on the comments earlier, the formal comments that Verifier revenue now is approaching 50% including historical records and that's up dramatically from a number of years ago. So that's driving workforce revenue and margins. And again, it's leveraging the cloud capabilities and our focus on new products to drive it going forward. Your second question on records, as I mentioned earlier, there's about 220 million working or employed individuals in the United States, including a 167 million, 168 million non-farm payroll, 20 million to 40 million gig or self-employed individuals. And remember, a 1099 self-employed employee or worker could be a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer, very high paid jobs or they're also are going to be a Uber driver. So there's a wide array of employees in that 20 million to 40 million. So we're going after those records. And then there's another 20 million to 30 million defined benefit pensioners in the U.S. and that's pension income is income that our customers want to use when someone who's retired or receiving pension income is going out to get a financial product, whether it's a mortgage and auto loan. So against the 220 million total income producing individuals in the United States we have about 117 million. So we're -- our hit rates are well north of 50%. But what the real opportunity is, as we continue to grow records and it's just a very unique lever for any business to have because as you know, we're already getting the inquiries to Workforce Solutions for every applicant that our customers have. And when we're not able to fulfill, they have to do it manually through using paper pay stubs and calling around to employers. So as we add new records during the quarter, we're able to monetize them instantly because we already have the inquiries or the orders coming to our database. So that's why we have such a big focus and a large team of workforce solutions people focused on all those different verticals to add records to Workforce Solutions. And when you think about records being up double-digit that translates into double-digit revenue, so it's a very powerful lever for the business. No. The contracts that we're signing are and will continue to be exclusive going forward. That's our plan and these work. Yes. It's still strong growth. We should have called it out. There was not intended to not do that. We've got a lot of good things happening at Equifax and we should have highlighted that one also, as you know, we acquired Talent, a couple years ago and we've added Midigator last year and those two businesses in United States and actually globally are performing very well and continuing to deliver that double-digit revenue. So they're a part of that USIS -- strong USIS performance. And as you know, identity is an area that is a priority focus for Equifax both around new products is around -- as also -- and also around M&A and the identity and fraud team are rolling out new solutions to really expand their capabilities, not only in count space, in the retail world, where e-commerce has been their focus. But as you know, we've got a large in expanding identity business in FI, insurance and telco, where we're bringing new solutions there also. They were also off a tough comp from last year. Very, very strong outperformance from some of the new products that were rolled out late in 2021 and into 2022. They had a very, very strong 2022 and we're pleased with their outperformance. We think it's very strong. And I think we also said in the comments that what was driving the FI to flat was FinTech down, which has been under pressure from originations for a while. Some slowdown, but limited in the smaller banks and continued growth with the larger FIs. So there was kind of a balancing impact in there. Yes. We're still focused first and foremost on growing the company and expanding our EBITDA margins. And I think as you know, Craig as we complete the cloud, our CapEx will come down, it's down this year. It'll -- our plan is to take it down again next year. So that's going to expand our free cash flow. Certainly, our margins will continue to expand. And when we think about uses of free cash flow, no change, our 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A is a part of our capital allocation strategy. And then as you know, we've got Boa Vista in the pipeline to add to Equifax, which is actually a bit north of that 1 to 2 points of revenue growth. And then we've been very clear that in the future, as our margins move towards that 39% in 2025, our free cash flow will continue to expand and excess free cash flow beyond what we use for M&A and CapEx. We want to return to shareholders at the right time, through buyback and dividend. And that's certainly a part of our plan in the future. We don't. There's a number of solutions out there from FinTechs and as you know experience got a business there too. The scale of our dataset, our ability to continue growing that dataset and the fact we get verified records directly from the source meaning the company's payroll records and the depth of the record also as you probably know we get over 50 attributes in every payroll record that includes name, social, date of birth, job title, which is very important for our employer vertical. But then all kinds of details on the payroll, gross pay, net pay, deductions, stock compensation, incentive compensation, sales compensation, hours worked, et cetera. So the depth of our database, the fact that it's current every pay period, and the scale of it really gives us a very strong position. And then last, I think as you know, we have system to system integrations that we've built in all of our verticals where as a part of their workflows, our customer's workflows, they hit our database. So we're hit first. Where solutions like you described or some of the FinTechs play in is where there's not a verification available from Workforce Solutions, and you have to go to another source, which is typically manual. And that's why we have a partnership with Yodlee, where we do bank transaction data and there's other solutions like that. But you've seen continued super strong growth from workforce because of the uniqueness and scale and depth of the dataset. Yes. That's a -- that business is a direct-to-consumer business that where we sell credit monitoring solutions and other solutions like that. It's really the business has rolled out some new products. It's leveraging our new cloud capabilities and just having better performance in some of the success rate of landing new consumers that want to use our credit monitoring solutions in the marketplace. So we're pleased with that performance and having it return to growth, you may recall that it struggled a year ago, two years ago. And as we got into the cloud and leveraged those capabilities and rolled out the new products, we've had some better performance, which we're pleased with. So I think he's talking about the incentive compensation impact in the first quarter along with the equity compensation impact. But I think to your question, the cost out is quite substantial meaning our cost structure is going to be meaningfully lower as we exit the year in complete the restructurings that we're talking about. And I think we've also talked, I think on the last call, we expect to have number one carryover benefit because these cost outs happen throughout the year. So we're not at full run rate of those cost actions in the fourth quarter. So you get a benefit in 2024 that'll help our margins next year. And then we also expect to have further cloud savings in 2024 as we complete -- we're not fully complete with the cloud at the end of this year, so there'll be additional benefits from that. Yes, 100%. Just as a reminder, USIS is not complete with their cloud transformation, but they're in the final chapters. So we're going to complete that this year. We have a meaningful number of customers already on the USIS cloud, which is a big deal. And we are -- you are seeing an acceleration of new product rollouts in 2023 already from the USIS team, you may have seen our announcement, which I didn't talk about this morning of our -- we talked about in February of our new mortgage credit report, where we're adding our cell phone utility data to that, that's going to provide a meaningful lift in credit scores for consumers by the addition of that data. And we're the only ones that can do that. So that's going to be a very positive product for us in the mortgage space. I talked about this morning the new OneScore solution that combines our cell phone utility data, which is a very large data set for Equifax that only we have along with our Teletrack and DataX solutions on 80 million consumers in the U.S. So that's another new solution that will be additive to the credit file and differentiate USIS in the marketplace. So that's a brand new product that's out there. We also launched a new solution in our commercial business that's really driving that business growth. And that's one that's been in the marketplace, a little bit longer for a few months, but you're seeing very strong double-digit growth in our commercial business. And in that solution, we're combining our bank transaction data with -- along with our PayNet leasing trade line data, which driven -- which delivers very meaningful predictability lifts and performance lifts for our commercial customers. So big time, we have a -- you're already seeing it the early days of them rolling out their solutions. And I think you are seeing it in some of the revenue in the businesses. And that'll continue to show up as we complete the cloud in USIS later this year. The other lever that's going to be I think we've talked about is we expect to have competitive or market share gains from the stability meaning always on, as well as the data transmission benefits from the Equifax Cloud or USIS. So that's another lever, and we've been clear that we're in active dialogues with customers that are moving Equifax into preferred positions because of our investment in the cloud. And again, there's another USIS benefit. So those impacts on their revenue should show up as we move through 2023, but really kick in, in 2024 and 2025. Maybe just add on that, I'm not sure I'd use your term into bag, but I would say we have a high degree of confidence because we have real visibility around the cost reductions. Those are ones where we know when contractors are going to leave and when we're going to decommission data centers, that's all in our control. So that gives us a lot of confidence and the ability to execute against that if that makes sense. Yes. It's not lost on us. There's other players there. The -- our biggest competitor, the way we think about it is pay per pay stubs. Almost 50% of income and employment verifications are still done manually in the United States. The scale of our dataset obviously is a real advantage, and we continue to grow that being up double-digit in records in the quarter, adding three new payroll processors, as you know, we add records through our employer solutions business as we grow that business in UC or W-2 or all the other services we provide to directly to HR managers, so scale is clearly a real advantage to us. And as you also point out, increasingly, the historical records that we have from our decades in the business are super valuable with 50% of Verifier revenue coming from those historical records, that's very hard to get when you're a FinTech trying to get someone's bank account information that only has the net pay in it, getting that historical net pay is a data point, but it's generally not deep enough or broad enough what to use in a lot of the verifications that that we're using. So scale is a big deal for us. The depth of the dataset meaning having gross pay through all the deductions, all those details, and then the historical records. So we're focused on expanding. I think as you know, we've done I think five acquisitions in the last 24 months to strengthen our employer capabilities there. That's a big growth lever for us to add records, and we're continuing to add payroll partners with three new ones signed in the first quarter that'll come online. So we're clearly very, very focused on expanding the record set that we have. Yes, David, I think, as you know for competitive reasons and commercial reasons, we don't disclose any of our price actions in any parts of the business. I think we've been clear that the majority of Equifax businesses take price up every year. We generally do it on 1/1, and we did that this year and we expect to do it next year and going forward. So no question that that's a part of our strategy. And when you think about price, and I know you do, you got to think about pure price, but also the impact of our new product initiatives, which generally are delivering differentiated solutions with more data and that more data drives more predictability and value for our customers and allows us to charge more for that. So new products are clearly a lever of growth for us. And again, you should also think about Workforce Solutions in particular of having multiple levers that I would say are all important. Certainly, pure prices, pure product growth is a real margin expander and revenue expander for workforce and the rest of Equifax. Record growth certainly drives very meaningfully our top-line and our bottom line at Workforce Solutions and is very unique. Our other businesses and most other data businesses in the industry already have all the records or have marginal ability to add to them. In our case there's 220 million working or income producing Americans in the U.S. and we've got 117 of them million. So there's a lot of growth and being up double-digit in the quarter is a big revenue growth. In Workforce, we also have big penetration opportunities. Remember most data businesses; your dataset is used on every transaction and every customer that's highly penetrated. So because they've been around for a long time, even in mortgage, in Workforce Solutions close to 40% of mortgages are done manually income and employment verification. And that was 55 a few years ago. So we've grown that 500 basis point. So a bunch of levers beyond price is what makes workforce so unique in its ability to outperform the underlying markets that it competes in. Your point on balance is right on you use the right word. We try to be very balanced in all of our businesses, including workforce around what we're doing on pure price in balance. How we look at it going forward is always going to be around the value we're delivering and the unique solutions that we have. I think that was workforce that we said that in verification, but it costs all of the Equifax businesses. This is not a new trend. But it's one where at workforce the cloud has really enabled them to really roll out a wide array of trended solutions. And we talked about in the call earlier, mortgage 36, which is 36 months of income and employment data on an individual allows the mortgage originator to more quickly get a full picture of that consumer and allow them to approve more loans, which is what they're trying to do. They spend $5,000 to $6,000 of origination costs. They want to make sure they're working with a consumer that can close and afford the loan that they're putting in front of them. So trended is a big deal, and those trended solutions all sell at higher price points than a snapshot of the data. Sure. So margins obviously were good in the first quarter better than we expected. Not where we want them to be long term, but better than we expected and a lot of it was driven by the really good revenue performance, right? They had very good revenue performance in all regions and really very strong revenue performance for example, stronger than you'd normally expect to see in Asia Pacific. So that along with the stronger performance across all regions, I think gave them better margin performance than we had expected. It's -- we did indicate slightly weaker in the second quarter, and that's really just related to some of the movements in revenue. There is some incremental expense as they continue to move through migration and transformation. There's certainly expense there as you go in from the first to the second quarter. But generally speaking, I think what we're expecting to see is margin performance as we described in the second quarter, and then as we move through the rest of the year, improving margin performance in international. We didn't. Yes. If I was able to do that, I'd be in a different job probably, but no, we just said we expect it to be higher inflation, I think the Feds telegraphed that and we expect it to be higher and that's why we put the slowdown in the second half of our guidance back in February and we're still sticking with that. George, you're breaking up. I don't know if you're on a cell phone or a speaker. I think your questions about EWS and I believe it's around non-mortgage growth, but I didn't hear the rest of it. Can you try again? Yes. So I think it's around non-mortgage in what the drivers of that EWS in 2023. First, on kind of a growth lever basis, record growth is obviously going to be positive. They did a pricing action early in the year and all the verticals, so that's going to benefit through the year. New product rollouts you've seen have been quite active with their north of 20% Vitality. And then if you go into specific verticals, I think we've given pretty good guidance of where we think talent to be meaning we expect the market to be down, but we're going to outperform the underlying talent market. Government we expect to have very strong growth, meaning stronger than the long-term framework for Workforce Solutions. We've had some very strong success of growing that business at the state level in particular and using our data for social service delivery Appriss Insights, the business that we bought a couple years ago is performing well that's going to be a driver of growth in 2023 for non-mortgage. What would you add, John? Yes. Does that help, George? Yes. We're not hearing much. As we've said many times and as when that was announced I think the industry is still trying to figure out how to implement or if they implement this. There's still discussions going with the regulators about the merits of that change and what meaning does it make sense? The three credit reports actually provide more access to credit. So that's a dialogue that's still happening. But whatever impact it'll be, it'll take some time to be implemented. Even with the so-called first quarter implementation, the mortgage originators can still pull three credit files. It's not mandatory to pull two, it's mandatory to pull three today. Now it'll be mandatory to pull two or more going forward. So the implementation will likely be delayed. And then I think as you know, we've also proactively not aligned with this, but the timing was great, rolled out our new mortgage credit file that has the cell phone utility data elements in it that's going to really drive the value of our file versus our competitors. It's something they can't do because of the scale of our cell phone utility database. So we're trying to position our file as being more valuable in going forward. And then maybe one last point, as you know they also -- what is also mandated is to go from one credit score being the FICO score to be two credit scores FICO and Vantage. And that's a good guy for us and our competitors, two scores is going to allow us to have a revenue increase versus one. And I think the thinking there is it's going to -- there's enough differences between the two scores, just like there are between the three credit files that the two scores will drive access to credit and drive predictability and approvals. And if you go back to our guide to exiting the year at 36% EBITDA margins, that obviously is generating a lot more free cash flow as we exit the year. I don't know whether you're modeling the year or longer-term, but that 36% stepping off point for the end of the year into 2024, and we've also -- we haven't given actual guidance, but we've used the words that we expect CapEx to come down again next year. And of course with our 39% EBITDA margin goal for 2025 there's a lot of cash flow that'll be generated from the step from now to 36% and then 36% to 39%. And we talked earlier on the call about how we think about capital allocation. As I mentioned earlier, CapEx will come down and I think we've given guidance before John of about 7% of revenue being our long-term CapEx investment in the company, which will be more focused on new products going forward versus the cloud transformation. We also have in our long-term framework to add 1% to 2% of revenue from bolt-on M&A. So that'll be a element of our free cash utilization. But as you get out to 2024 and 2025, there'll be excess free cash flow. That'll be quite meaningful that we intend to return to shareholders through dividend and buyback at the right time."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Trevor Burns, SVP, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 3Q 2024 earnings conference call. Also, we will making uncertainty forward-looking statements including fourth quarter and full year 2024 guidance as well as certain 2025 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, included in adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included in our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR websites. In the third quarter, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge for cost reduction actions aligned with the completion of the migration of significant data exchanges and applications in the United States and Canada in certain countries in Latin America to the Equifax Cloud as well as cost taxes to streamline our workforce globally. These charges totaled $42 million and are expected to be -- and expected to deliver ongoing savings when completed in early 2025 of over $70 million a year. We expect to generate greater savings as we complete cloud migration in Europe, the remainder of Latin America and Brazil and Australia and New Zealand, principally over '25 and '26. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor : Thanks, Trevor and good morning. Before I cover our strong third quarter results, I want to update you on the strong progress of our cloud transformation. In the quarter, USIS completed the migration onto the cloud data fabric of the remaining customers and services for their consumer credit and telco and utilities exchanges, which is a huge milestone. Along with EWS, the work number exchange, which we completed migrating to the Equifax Cloud over two years ago, we now have our three largest data exchanges in the new Equifax Cloud. As of the end of September, we have about 80% of Equifax revenue in the Equifax Cloud and expect to approach 90% of our revenue in the Equifax Cloud by year-end. The cloud migrations have been a huge effort across Equifax over the past four plus years, requiring a ton of focus by the entire Equifax team. We expect to have a significant competitive advantage as we fully deploy our new cloud capabilities and pivot from building to leveraging the cloud in 2025 and beyond that will allow us to fully focus on customers' growth, innovation, new products and AI. Leaving the USIS consumer and telco and utility migrations to the Equifax Cloud allowed us to begin decommissioning legacy on-prem systems and software in USIS in the third quarter supporting our goal of cloud spending reductions in 2024, which expand our operating margins and are lowering the capital intensity of our businesses -- our business in 2025 and beyond. In the third quarter, we also made substantial progress in our international technology transformation activities with Canada completing migration of all customers off of their consumer and commercial credit exchanges onto the new EFX Cloud Data Fabric. This is another big accomplishment for the international team with cloud migrations in Argentina, Chile and the Dominican Republic completed earlier in the year, adding to Canada's completion a few weeks ago. Our international cloud migration efforts will continue in '25 and '26, resulting in additional cloud savings as those migrations are completed. It is energizing to be approaching the finish line of our cloud transformation. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivoted from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. Turning to Slide 4. We had a strong third quarter with reported revenue of $1.42 billion, up 9% and at the top end of our July guidance. With organic constant dollar revenue up 10%, which is at the top end of our long-term growth framework. Adjusted EBITDA margins at just under 33% were in line with our expectations and adjusted EPS of $1.85 per share was the top end of our July guidance. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represent about 80% of total revenue in the quarter had strong 10% constant currency revenue growth which was in line with our expectations. Non-mortgage organic constant currency revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. The strong non-mortgage performance was driven by 9% growth in EWS and with very strong 19% non-mortgage growth in EWS Verifier, led by very strong 29% growth in government and talent that was up over 9% in EWS. USIS non-mortgage revenue growth of almost 5% was stronger than our expectations, principally from our consumer business and financial marketing services, our off-line batch business. International delivered just under 18% constant dollar revenue growth and strong 12% organic growth, led by continued strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 17% in the quarter and above our July guidance. U.S. mortgage revenue was 20% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. In late September, as mortgage rates declined to just over 6%, we saw modest mortgage inquiry activity increases. We believe this improvement was likely led by mortgage refi activity off the lower mortgage rates. New home purchase activity appears to have remained at the lower levels we've been seeing throughout 2024, reflecting continued low home inventory levels elevated home prices impacting affordability and prospective homebuyers waiting for further mortgage rate reductions. As mortgage rates increased in early October to over 6.6%, we have seen mortgage activity reduced to levels closer to what we saw in July and August. John will cover our expectations for mortgage activity in the fourth quarter shortly, but we continue to believe that activity will improve towards 2015 and 2019 levels as mortgage rates come down in the future. In the third quarter, the growth in mortgage revenue was driven principally by USIS where mortgage revenue was up a strong 36% and slightly above our expectations. This strong growth was again driven by the benefit of strong vendor pricing actions and the performance of our new mortgage pre-qual products. The lower mortgage rates we saw in late September did drive a small increase in mortgage application activity, which benefited USIS in the quarter. EWS mortgage revenue returned to growth with revenue up 4% and was also slightly better than our expectations. As a reminder, EWS mortgage inquiry volumes lagged USIS credit inventory volumes as credit is pulled earlier in the mortgage application cycle than income and employment, which is typically pulled in the middle and of course, the closing of the mortgage application. USIS typically sees the benefits of mortgage shopping behavior earlier and to a greater extent than EWS. As a result, EWS did not see the same level of incremental inquiry volume as USIS did from the slight increase in mortgage activity that occurred in late September. EWS mortgage revenue exceeded twin inquiry volume by about 9.5% in the quarter, up a very strong 300 basis points sequentially from second quarter, principally from strong twin record growth. Equifax had another strong quarter of new product innovation with a VI or Vitality Index of 13%, above our 10% guidance for the year and our long-term framework of 10% Vitality. We saw strong broad based new product rollouts with double-digit growth in EWS and International and a VI of 9% in USIS, which was up 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. We expect our NPI revenue to grow -- revenue growth to remain strong and are increasing our 2024 Vitality Index guidance to 11%, up 100 basis points from our prior framework for 2024, as we further leverage our new EFX Cloud capabilities in EFX.AI to drive new products into the marketplace. Turning to Slide 5. Workforce Solutions revenue was up about 7.5% and slightly below our July guidance, principally due to lower-than-expected employer services revenue. Non-mortgage verification services revenue, again, delivered very strong 19% growth, which was in line with our expectations. Government had another outstanding quarter with very strong 29% revenue growth from continued penetration in their large $5 billion government TAM. Government revenue grew sequentially from strong growth in state penetration and insights incarceration data solutions. We expect continued strong sequential growth -- sequential government revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. Growth rates in the fourth quarter are expected to continue to show strong double-digit performance, but will be lower than third quarter levels, principally due to comping against very strong growth we saw last year. We expect our government vertical to continue to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the future and outgrow both Equifax and EWS. Talent Solutions revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter. Talent Solutions continues to benefit from their new total verified data hub, which includes trended employment data as well as insights incarceration, education and licensing and credentialing data. Based on data through August, EWS Talent Solutions outperformed the BLS white-collar hiring markets by approximately 18 percentage points from additions of records, the rollouts of new products and penetration into the talent vertical during the quarter. We did see somewhat weaker volumes late in September, which we have assumed will continue and is expected to impact talent revenue growth in the fourth quarter. EWS mortgage revenue was up 4% in the quarter and slightly better than our July guidance. Twin inquiries in the third quarter were down about 5.5% and slightly better than our July guidance. Total EWS mortgage revenue outperformed Twin inquiries by about 9.5% and again over 300 points sequentially from strong record growth during the quarter. We expect strong growth in twin records to benefit mortgage and our other EWS verticals again in the fourth quarter. EWS consumer lending revenue was up 16% from strong double-digit growth in P loans and high single-digit growth in debt management and auto. Employer Services revenue was down 19% in the quarter and weaker than we expected. Compared to last year, employer declined principally from lower ERC revenues and to a lesser extent, lower I-9 and onboarding revenues as the slower white-collar hiring we saw in late September impacting talent solutions also impacted our onboarding business. There was also some onetime post-COVID related project revenue that benefited onboarding in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter I-9 and onboarding revenue was consistent with the first and second quarters, and we expect fourth quarter employer revenue to be down mid-single digits as the ERC comparisons mitigate. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 51.6% and were slightly above our expectations and continued to be very strong, reflecting strong Verifier revenue growth and continued strong cost controls. Turning to Slide 6. The EWS government team continued their very strong performance in the quarter with revenue up 29%. The government team continued to focus on penetration of our unique VOI and VOE solutions for social services at both the federal level and across the state agencies. In the quarter, the EWS government team signed an extension to their SSA redetermination contract to provide income and employment data for individuals applying for or currently receiving social security disability income and supplemental security income benefits with a potential contract value of about $500 million over the next five years. EWS services support program integrity for the SSA as well as reducing the administrative burden for consumers seeking these important services. Chad and the government team are on offense driving penetration in the big $5 billion government TAM. Turning to Slide 7. EWS had another outstanding quarter of new record additions. A few weeks ago, we announced a new strategic partnership with Workday to provide verification services to Workday's large customer base. Later in the fourth quarter, we'll begin rolling out the free value-added EWS income and employment verification services to Workday's U.S. customers and expect to onboard a sizable number of new records through 2025 from this new strategic relationship. Also in the quarter, we signed agreements with five additional new strategic partners that will contribute over 5 million records collectively to the twin database in the future. Through September, EWS has executed 12 strategic partnerships during 2024 and since the beginning of 2021, EWS has completed 45 strategic partnership agreements. We expect these five new partnerships signed during the quarter to come online and begin generating revenue late in the fourth quarter and substantially in the early parts of 2025. In the third quarter, EWS added 2 million active records to the twin database, ending the quarter with $182 million active records, up a strong 12% on 134 million unique individuals. EWS now has 3.8 million companies contributing income and employment records to the twin database every pay period, a very strong 40% CAGR since 2020. Total records are now over $700 million and up 11% in the quarter, supporting our trended or historical solutions with about half of Verifier revenue from products, including historical records. At 134 million unique active records, we have plenty of room to grow the twin database towards the TAM of 225 million income producing Americans. Turning to Slide 8. USIS achieved a major milestone in the third quarter, completing the migration to the new Equifax Data Cloud Fabric of both the U.S. consumer credit and our cell phone utility databases. This big milestone makes U.S. consumer credit, telco and utility data fully available across our new data fabric for use in advanced AI based solutions to enhance our identity and fraud solutions and to accelerate our only Equifax solutions leveraging both EWS and USIS data assets. It also allows our U.S. commercial product and technology teams to fully shift their focus to delivering these new advanced Equifax solutions to customers that will drive new product rollouts and top line growth for Equifax. USIS revenue was up 12% in the quarter and well above the July guidance of up 8.5% and their long-term revenue growth framework of 6% to 8%, despite the continuation of some weakness in the FI and auto end markets. This was driven by both strong performance in non-mortgage revenue as well as stronger mortgage revenue, reflecting the slight increase in mortgage activity that we saw in late September. Total non-mortgage revenue was up 5% in the quarter and was also well above our July guidance of over 2% growth for USIS. We saw strong double-digit growth in Consumer Solutions and Financial Marketing Services which were offset by a less than 1% decline in USIS B2B online revenue from softer consumer and end market demand, which importantly was up about 300 basis points sequentially. We USIS B2B online saw double-digit growth in insurance and commercial, high single-digit growth in telco and low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in banking and auto offset by declines in third-party bureau sales and identity and fraud. We expect third-party bureau sales to be about flat in the fourth quarter as we lap the weakness that started in late 2023. Identity and Fraud revenue was also down and weaker than our expectations, principally due to weakness in chargeback management volumes. Payment and transactional identity revenue grew in the quarter from penetration in large strategic accounts identity and fraud is starting to launch their new Kount 360 solutions platform and products, which will help strengthen growth in 2025, as these solutions take hold in the marketplace. Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business was up a very strong 14% in the quarter, reflecting substantial new wins and customer expansion across banking services and payments verticals and as well as continued strong growth in prescreen marketing and our unique IXI wealth data. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 17%, and from strong double-digit growth in our consumer direct channel and from strong customer acquisition trends. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow mid-single-digits as we start comping against very strong D2C growth last year. USIS mortgage revenue was up a very strong 36% and better than our July guidance. Mortgage credit inquiries were up 1% and were also better than our July guidance of down 7%, principally due to the slight increase in mortgage activity that we saw in late September. This was the first quarter of mortgage credit inquiry growth since the first quarter of 2021, which is a big milestone and reinforces for us that the mortgage market is clearly bottomed and poised for recovery in the future. Consistent with the first half, the strong pricing environment along with the strength in our new mortgage pre-qual products also drove the very strong mortgage revenue growth. At $137 million, mortgage revenue was just under 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 33.9% in the quarter, up 70 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations from higher-than-expected revenue growth, offset by higher technology costs to complete cloud customer migration activities. With the USIS consumer and our cell phone utility and data cloud transformation is complete, Chad and the USIS team are clearly focused on offense and growth. Turning to Slide 9. International revenue was a very strong 18% in constant currency and up a strong 12% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BVS due to continued very strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Europe local currency revenue was up a very strong 9% in the quarter with continued strong 7% growth in our credit and data businesses and 12% growth in our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue was up 58%, principally due to the acquisition of Boa Vista with very strong organic growth of 31%, led by 28% Vitality Index from new products in the region during the quarter. And as a reminder, we closed the BVS acquisition in August last year. Canada delivered 1% growth in the quarter, which was below our expectations from a softer economy. I previously mentioned that Canada completed their consumer and commercial credit exchange customer migrations to data fabric a few weeks ago. And similar to the U.S., we expect to see accelerating NPI and revenue growth going forward from the Canadian team. Asia-Pacific revenue returned to growth up 2% as expected. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.7% and were up 210 basis points sequentially from strong revenue growth and good cost execution. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to make very strong progress driving innovation with 30 new products launched in the quarter that delivered a 13% vitality from broad based performances across all of our business units. EWS had very strong third quarter with Vitality Index of 16%, expanding solutions in the government vertical as well as incorporating incarceration education into new talent solutions products. USIS saw continued sequential improvement with a Vitality Index of 9%, up 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. We expect USIS to continue to show strong vitality improvement from the cloud completion as they leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation in new products as well as free up their product and technology resources that previously were working on cloud transformation in key verticals such as identity and fraud, commercial and our new mortgage pre-qual products. International also had strong 11% vitality in the quarter with a strong focus on identity and fraud solutions. We expect strong double-digit vitality in the fourth quarter, leveraging our Equifax Cloud capability to drive new product rollouts and we're raising our full year Vitality Index guidance from 10% to about 11%, reflecting the strong innovation performance across all our businesses so far in 2024. AI and ML are changing the way we develop our new products in our single data fabric and build higher performing model scores and products for our customers. We are accelerating the pace at which we are developing new EFX models and scores using our advanced AI and ML capabilities in areas such as identity and fraud and consumer loan affordability, it will drive higher performance and predictability. In the quarter, 100% of our new models and scores were built using Equifax AI and machine learning, which is up from about 89% last quarter and ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. We're clearly on offense deploying our proprietary EFX AI capabilities that will drive higher performing model scores and products for our customers. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and to provide our fourth quarter framework. Our fourth quarter guidance builds on our strong third quarter performance from new products, penetration, record growth and pricing.\nJohn Gamble : Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 11. As Mark discussed, we started to see an improvement in the run rate of USIS credit inquiries in late September as mortgage rates declined to just over 6%. We believe the improvement principally reflected higher refinance activity in late September. New home purchase activity does not appear to have increased meaningfully at this point, likely reflecting continued low home inventory levels, home prices at near all-time highs and respective homebuyers waiting for further mortgage rate reductions. As a reminder, the normal mix of mortgage originations and defined as the average over the 2015 to 2019 period is about 55% purchase and 45% refinance. In the first two weeks of October, we have seen mortgage inquiry volumes for both credit and twin slow versus September as mortgage rates have increased to above 6.5%. The run rate over the last two weeks of both credit and twin inquiries is relatively consistent with the expectations we had when we provided guidance in July. Consistent with our practice in 2024 and the last several years, our guidance for credit inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two to four weeks, modified to reflect normal seasonal pattern. This effectively assumes market conditions will continue for the quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be up about 9% versus 4Q '23 and down 16% sequentially. Calendar year '24 mortgage credit inquiries are expected to be down about 7%. For the fourth quarter, we expect USIS mortgage revenue to be up over 4% and much stronger than the underlying mortgage market, reflecting both strong performance in mortgage pre-qual products as well as vendor pricing actions. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries in the fourth quarter to be up about 6% versus 4Q '23 and down about 12% sequentially. For the full year, TWN inquiries are expected to be down about 11%. We expect EWS mortgage revenue to be up over 16% in the fourth quarter and much stronger than the underlying TWN inquiries, again, principally reflecting strong record growth in 2024 and as well as annual mortgage pricing that occurs early in the first quarter each year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically seasonally the lowest quarter of the year for both credit and TWN inquiries. For perspective, as we look to 2025, carrying these current run rates with normal seasonality TWN '25, mortgage credit inquiries would grow versus 2024, up just over 5% for the year and also just over 5% in the first quarter of 2025. Slide 12 provides the details of our 4Q '24 guidance. In 4Q '24, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.438 billion and $1.458 billion, up about 9% at the midpoint. Organic constant dollar revenue growth at the midpoint is about 10% and at the high end of our long-term financial framework. At the midpoint, mortgage revenue is expected to be up almost 30% and non-mortgage constant dollar revenue up over 7%. Equifax 4Q '24 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 35.5% at the midpoint of our guidance. The sequential increase in EBITDA margins reflects revenue growth and cost management across Equifax, including the decommissioning of USIS legacy consumer and telco and utility systems and Canada legacy consumer and commercial systems. This is our first ever quarter with EBITDA over $500 million. This would be a very strong performance. Adjusted EPS in 4Q '24 is expected to be $2.08 to $2.18 per share, up 18% versus 4Q '23 at the midpoint. The midpoint of our fourth quarter revenue guidance is about $15 million below the levels implied by the guidance we provided in July. The primary driver is lower revenue in EWS and in the employer business driven by lower revenue and onboarding as well as ERC. And this is consistent with the factors that impacted the third quarter and also the slower U.S. hiring Mark referenced earlier that is impacting both onboarding and talent solutions. We believe we are centered at the midpoint of our guidance. Business unit performance in the fourth quarter is expected to be as follows: Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 10%. Non-mortgage revenue should be up about 8% year-to-year. Verifier non-mortgage revenue growth will continue to show strong double-digit growth, although below the levels we saw in the third quarter. Verifier non-mortgage growth will again be driven by strong growth in government and talent. Government revenue growth is expected to grow sequentially and year-to-year. However, year-to-year growth will be below the levels we have seen year-to-date in 2024, as we lap very strong 4Q '23 revenue growth in government. Both Verifier mortgage and non-mortgage revenue growth should benefit from the continued strong growth in TWN records we are seeing throughout 2024. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up slightly from the third quarter at about 52%. USIS revenue is expected to be up over 10% year-to-year. Non-mortgage revenue should be up about 3% year-to-year, slightly lower than the third quarter, principally due to lower growth in USIS D2C and as they begin to lap periods of strong growth that started in 4Q '23 and financial marketing services, which is expected to be about flat in the year-to-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be over 38%, up very strong sequentially as USIS decommissions legacy consumer and telco and utility systems. International revenue is expected to be up over 9% in constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be over 32%, up very strong sequentially, reflecting both revenue growth and good cost control. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full year guidance. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10%, with organic constant currency growth of 8% and within our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 12.5% despite the 7% decline in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue is expected to grow almost 10% with organic growth of over 7%, led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services business and in international. This is within our long-term framework. FX is about 180 basis points negative to revenue growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.30 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be 32.4%. Adjusted EPS and EBITDA are both expected to grow 9% in 2024, all at the midpoint of our guidance. Capital expenditures in the third quarter are $123 million, down $8 million sequentially. We expect fourth quarter capital expenditures to be just over $105 million, as USIS has completed customer migrations to the U.S. consumer data fabric and Canada has completed customer migrations to their consumer and commercial data fabric. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be about $485 million, which is a year-to-year reduction of about $100 million. As we accelerate our cloud migrations, we are seeing increasing levels of depreciation and amortization. In 2024, D&A, excluding acquisition amortization, is expected to be about $410 million, up about $50 million versus 2023. In 2025, we expect D&A to increase slightly above the $50 million increase we saw in 2024. As of the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.8x, and we expect to further reduce leverage in the fourth quarter. We believe this leverage is nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. Turning to Slide 14. And as we discussed in July, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the mortgage market recovers towards historic norms that presents -- represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax in 2025 and beyond at current product pricing, TWN records contracted and products. We expect this opportunity to increase as we enter 2025 from pricing actions, TWN records and new products. At current mortgage gross margins, this over $1 billion of incremental mortgage revenue would deliver on the order of $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L as the mortgage market returns to normal levels in 2025 and beyond. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 15. An important part of our long-term financial framework is delivering strong free cash flow and returning cash to shareholders. We're adding a new cash conversion goal for our long-term framework of 95% or greater, with cash conversion defined as free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income. During the cloud technology transformation over the last four years, we saw elevated cloud capital expenditures which impacted our free cash flow and cash conversion. Our cash conversion ratio is expected to improve significantly in 2024 to about 80% and as we reduce CapEx and drive higher relative levels of free cash flow. We expect our free cash flow to accelerate in 2025 post our cloud investments as CapEx reduces to 6% to 7% of revenue, supporting cash conversion of over 95%, while strong margin expansion and growth in net income from our underlying operating leverage and cloud cost savings. This strong cash generation positions Equifax to continue to invest in growth with CapEx and bolt-on M&A and begin returning excess free cash flow to shareholders from dividend growth and share repurchases in 2025 and beyond. It's energizing to be approaching this important milestone for our investors as we complete the new Equifax Cloud. Turning to Slide 16. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax Cloud differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric leveraging Equifax.AI and machine learning and market leading businesses will deliver higher revenue growth, expanded margins and accelerating free cash flow. In the middle of Slide 16, we've added the new cash conversion metric to our long-term growth framework. And our long-term growth framework, as you know, is made up of strong revenue growth of 7% to 10% and is led by very strong 13% -- 15% EWS revenue growth. EWS is clearly our largest and fastest-growing business led by strong double-digit non-mortgage verification services revenue growth from our government and talent solutions verticals. As a part of our long-term financial framework, we expect to add 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A aligned around strengthening the core of Equifax. Our bolt-on M&A strategy will continue to be focused on strengthening Workforce Solutions adding differentiated data assets across Equifax and growing in the big $20 billion identity and fraud space. As John covered a few minutes ago, the pace of mortgage market recovery will add to our revenue growth as the market returns to normal 2015 to 2019 levels in 2025 and beyond. The mortgage market recovery will also drive our margins and free cash flow from the very high incremental margins from this incremental revenue that we expect to come into Equifax's P&L in 2025 and beyond. We expect operating leverage off our strong 8% to 12% revenue growth to generate 50 basis points of annual EBITDA margin expansion and very strong cash conversion of 95% and above. As margins improve, CapEx declined to 6% to 7% of revenue with the completion of the Equifax Cloud transformation and leverage continues to progress towards 2.5 turns by year-end. We expect our free cash flow to accelerate and that will enable us to start returning cash to shareholders in 2025 and beyond through growing the dividend in a multiyear share buyback program. We are energized to be pivoting from building the Equifax Cloud over the past four years to leveraging our new industry leading cloud and EFX.AI capabilities to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow. Wrapping up on Slide 17. Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 11% constant dollar revenue growth, which was at the upper end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework work, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model, strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities, the resiliency of the U.S. consumer and the strength of our customers. Our very strong 19% EWS non-mortgage Verifier revenue growth, 12% EWS active record growth, strong 13% broad based Vitality Index give us momentum as we enter the fourth quarter and move towards 2025. And as we talked earlier, we took another big step in the quarter towards cloud completion with 80% of our revenue now in the Equifax Cloud, which will enhance our competitiveness, drive innovation and new product development. Entering 2025 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud is a really big milestone, so the team can move towards fully focusing on innovation, new products powered by EFX.AI, customers and growth. I'm energized now more than ever about the future of the new Equifax that will deliver strong 8% to 12% revenue growth, 50 basis points of margin expansion lower capital intensity and expanding free cash flow to invest in Equifax and add bolt-on M&A. And in the future, growing our dividend and positioning to start a multiyear stock buyback program in 2025 and beyond. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Manav Patnaik of Barclays.\nManav Patnaik : I just had a question around kind of the guidance philosophy. So in the prior years, every time you had lowered guidance, I guess, it was mainly due to the mortgage weakness, so we all got wrong but there were some other non-mortgage areas that were weak. And this year, even though mortgage is getting better, you're still lowering guidance. So I'm just curious, is there something about the philosophy in not being conservative? Or is it execution? I was just hoping you could help us clear that up.\nMark Begor : Yes, Manav. So there's no change in our philosophy. Our goal is to be super transparent with you and our investors about what we're seeing in the marketplace and what the growth levers are and where we're taking the company. We work to provide guidance that we know how to meet and beat. That's our -- no change in that goal. I've been here six years. And I think as you point out the mortgage decline in '22 and '23 was really quite unusual. But if you look around that, I think we've been pretty consistent about meeting and beating. And if you look through our non-mortgage performance during that '22 and '23 time frame, we think we were pretty consistent. With regards to the third quarter, I think -- I don't think that's your question. I think it's more around the fourth quarter. And we highlighted in our earlier comments that there is some volatility in the marketplace that we're certainly dealing with in some of our verticals. We're really pleased with our third quarter performance. We're pleased with the guidance that we have for the fourth quarter, which is super strong. And as you point out, it's slightly below the guidance that we had last quarter. principally from the EWS employer business. I think we've talked for the last couple of quarters about the impact of the employee retention credits that were really stopped by the IRS earlier this year. We thought there'd be some activity there. There's none. So that's obviously impacting that business inside of Workforce Solutions. And then we also talked over the last couple of quarters about the change the federal government made around work opportunity tax credit and the state's response to getting that in place, we thought the states would be responding a little bit quicker. They haven't, which is pushing some of that revenue likely out of the fourth quarter and into 2025, it's not going to go away. And then to a lesser degree, I think we talked about -- I won't touch mortgage because I don't think that's your point. I'll touch non-mortgage. We talked about some of the slowdowns we saw the background screeners late in September. That was unexpected on our part. I think you've seen a number of corporations across the United States announcing layoffs, whether Boeing is 10% or companies like that. But I think coming into the election, it feels like companies are being a little more prudent about new hiring which is we saw in the background screening volumes late in the month. These are, from my perspective, fairly small impacts when you look at the strong performance in the third quarter and the strong guide we have for the fourth quarter, as John pointed out, in the fourth quarter, we're going to be in the neighborhood of $500 million EBITDA and over $2 a share, which we've never done before. So I think that's strong performance earlier in the year. I think some questioned our ability to deliver the kind of performance we've laid out in the fourth quarter, both from a top line and a margin expansion. I think we're in that direction, admittedly a bit below that but still very, very strong numbers. But just really to the point of your question, no change in our philosophy. We want to put out numbers that are super transparent. We're going to give you what's behind those numbers. And our goal is to have numbers that we can meet and beat. And that has never changed and it won't change in the future.\nManav Patnaik : Okay. Fair enough. And just on the tech transformation, I think we're all looking forward to the benefits that can provide to USIS. Can you give us some maybe early signs or examples of what maybe you did with tech transformations in other divisions that give you confidence that we should see some outperformance outside of just the macros on the USIS side?\nMark Begor : Yes. it's a great question. We talked about in the last quarter, we did this much on this call, but it's obvious that USIS was clearly impacted in '23 and in the -- really through the third quarter in many regards around all the effort they had to put in the cloud transformation. Canada is in the same boat. These are big, big projects, very intrusive with our customers. The good news is it's done. What we're really encouraged by when we think about USIS, even with that in the second quarter and third quarter, you saw their vitality go up, meaning they were able to start taking advantage of being in the cloud to start moving forward on innovation in new products. That's going to benefit USIS in the fourth quarter, but really principally in 2025. And as you know, they increased their vitality in the second quarter, 100 bps and then again in the third quarter, 100 bps. So we would expect them to move towards that 10% vitality as we get into 2025 and which is really going to be a positive. The cost savings, John already talked about, you saw the charge we took that was expected. That's -- we're executing that, and that's a real positive for our margins, which we've committed to and we're executing on. And the other benefit is two other benefits actually, we'll start to see now that they're in the cloud, as those share gains that we expect to have, we have the close in flight. Those will start showing up in the P&L, some in the fourth quarter, but I think principally in 2025 of being always on and being a cloud-native provider. And then the last one is one that we'll talk more about in February during our fourth quarter call and in 2025 is what we're internally calling only Equifax initiative where we're focused on solutions that combine TWM, our income and employment data with the credit file to make our credit file more valuable. When we talked on the last call about new solutions that we're piloting in the marketplace as we speak around a flag on our credit file that someone's working for mortgage shopping to make our mortgage shopping credit file never valuable, a flag on our auto credit file, same thing that someone is working. That will differentiate our credit file. We think it will drive share gains with our credit file. It should make our credit file more valuable. And I think as you know, we're also adding to our credit file solutions, including our differentiated data from DataX, Teletrack and NCTUE, our cell phone utility data. And these are all solutions only Equifax can do. Our competitors don't have these data assets, so we can strengthen the underlying credit file, which arguably can be commoditized in some solutions and make our product more differentiated. Those are the things that you're going to see going forward. It's what we've been talking about for four years. The good news is now is we can actually execute on it because we're in the cloud with USIS. And I can't really reinforce enough about the impact of the distraction. You could say over the last four years, but your question is around USIS really over the last 18 months, 24 months, of all the efforts that went into complete is really massive technology transformation. The good news is it's done. So that whole team now can take all their energy and effort it was balanced between growing the company, rolling out new products, executing our AI solutions and doing the cloud migrations to just focus on growth. And that gives us a lot of energy as we look to the fourth quarter and then as we move into 2025.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous Research.\nKelsey Zhu : Have you sized the incremental record additions from the Workday partnership? And can you talk a little bit more about the time line for those new records to come online? Is it more towards kind of Q1, Q2 next year? Or is it towards second half of next year?\nMark Begor : Yes. So maybe a couple of points on that. I'll respond to your specific Workday question, but maybe just make it a little bit wider because Workday is one of many partners we added during the quarter. I think we added a total of six in the quarter. Workday, obviously, a very significant one, a very strategic partnership, but all six of them are. I think we sized that we expect from the other $5 million to something like 5 million records coming on over the coming quarters. It takes time to make those integrations. They're super complex for really our partners side. You've seen very record growth. We're up 12% in the quarter. So you can see that we're executing. We talked about the sizable number of partners we added this year as well as last year and over the last couple of years. And with every partner we have is they add new clients and they're all growing their business every quarter, if you think about an HR software company or payroll processor, when those new clients come on board, they're typically boarded to TWN. So there's growth that's happening with one of our clients. Most of our clients have records going back to clients we added even two, three, four years ago that we haven't fully deployed into Equifax, meaning we're working with them through their technologies through the different databases they have, they're typically not a single tech stack to bring those records in. So we have a lot of opportunity both with current new partners use Workday and the others we added this quarter as well as those we've had over the last couple of three years to add records. And Workday specifically, we haven't sized that except to say it's sizable. I think it's well known that they're a very big company and a big partner, and we're super excited to have that move on board. We expect some records to come on in the fourth quarter, but really the substantial growth from Workday and the other partners we added in the third quarter and those that we expect to add in the fourth quarter to come on in 2020. And I think the other point to remind everyone on the call about, as you know, we talk -- tend to talk a lot about our partner record additions, but we also have a very sizable direct record approach where our employer business is adding new clients. And when we bring those new clients on, we offer that free value added evasive income and employment verification and those become records that become a part of Equifax. And one last reminder, and I think you're seeing the benefits of that in December last year, we changed the organize in EWS. So we have one leader and one team that is solely focused on record additions from HR software companies from payroll processors for 1,099 records and pension records, so really the whole gamut. So we've got a very large focus because you're seeing that pay off. We're really pleased that record additions to 12% are way outgrowing our long-term framework for record additions, which are more in the single-digit range is admittedly, we've been doing that for five plus years. So we've had a lot of really positive momentum there. And I think you know the power of adding a record. The day we add a record, we monetize it across all of our verticals because we're already getting inquiries for that record because our customers send us every query. And then the breadth of our ability to monetize is just scale so substantially from even three, four, five years ago when you go across the spectrum from, call it, higher income consumers, mid-market consumers that are doing mortgages and through auto and auto and P loans and cards and then go to the other end of the spectrum, those that are going after social services at the federal and state level is a very -- there's over 100 million people a year that are getting social services and we've got a big opportunity to grow there. You've seen the growth in Workforce Solutions government vertical that's been, obviously, impacted positively by record additions. So records are a big focus of ours, and we see a lot of momentum going forward. We still have a lot of records to go after with the 225 million working Americans, there's close to 100 million of records we don't have yet. So that's why we added resources and people to keep growing this valuable data set.\nKelsey Zhu : Also curious to hear a little more about what's driving the reacceleration of growth in consumer lending vertical within Workforce Solutions, especially because of against the backdrop of a pretty soft end market. So just curious, is it really to new product launches? Is it the pricing? Is it increased customer penetration? Yes, I appreciate your thoughts on this.\nMark Begor : Yes, it's really the value of the data set. When you think about consumer lending and I'll use P loans, you could use auto, the value of someone's credit score is super important. It's really, as you know, is a reflection of their past payment behavior of other loans they have and it's really a prediction where they keep paying going forward. So very valuable. When you add to that someone's ability to pay, which means their income and their employment, meaning they're working. Because remember, if you pull a credit report, you have no idea if that individual is actually working today. Did they lose their job last week? Did they retire? What's changing? So the combination of income in employment from EWS with the credit file is very, very valuable. And we have increasing numbers of our customers. As you point out, we roll out new products as well as we drive penetration of customers understanding the value of pulling the credit report with income and employment, they can approve more consumers and approve more consumers with lower loss rates. So that's a really strong combination and very positive for our customers. So that's what we're really seeing in the outgrowth of the underlying market. As you point out, there is in some of those verticals, some end user, meaning consumer demand pressures primarily because of higher APRs, particularly in bigger ticket transactions, think about P loans or cards, we have a solution between -- by combining credit with income and employment that allows our customers to approve more of those applicants with a higher degree of confidence around their ability to repay the loan when you add the income and employment data to it.\nJohn Gamble : Those segments are also benefiting substantially just by record growth, right? So since records are up over 10% that drives their hit rates higher, so it's a direct benefit to those segments.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas : I wanted to first ask on SSNs really good order. And I'm just curious if there's anything for us to read into that. It sounds like it was primarily batch. Is that kind of customers thinking about being more aggressive with marketing is that portfolio review? Just help me understand if there's anything to read into that strength?\nJohn Gamble : Sure. It was a very strong quarter. And stronger than we expect to see when we gave guidance part of it was because we signed -- we executed a couple of large transactions with new customers in the payments industry. And we think that's very important to us, not just in the fact that it delivered a strong quarter, but also because we think it's an ongoing revenue source, not just in batch but increasingly in our mind. So we're very excited about the fact that we signed those partnerships and delivered revenue in the quarter, but also we think it bodes very well for us across the payments industry as we continue to grow the use of our data in payments.\nAndrew Nicholas : So it doesn't sound like anything major sort of like a macro read-through perspective, more often?\nJohn Gamble : No, not a read through at all. It was really just great execution by the team on winning new customers and delivering in period.\nAndrew Nicholas : And then maybe changing gears a little bit on the mortgage business and the mortgage business within EWS in particular. If I heard you correct, John, you said you expect 16% growth in mortgage there in the fourth quarter on 6% growth in inquiries, 10% outperformance, certainly better than what you saw in the first half, but I think a little bit lower than what you had messaged earlier this year. So just curious about the puts and takes there, what if anything, has changed in terms of record growth relative to your expectations, pricing, new product development, anything like that, that would help bridge that gap?\nJohn Gamble : Look, I think the big thing we were talking about as we started the year, we were expecting very good progression in terms of the outperformance with EWS mortgage that would happen as we went through the year. And I think we saw it consistently every quarter. We saw improvements in second, third and now we would expect to be stronger in the fourth than we were in the third. So we feel very good about that progression. And again, it is driven by records. So record growth has been extremely strong. And given the partnerships that were signed this quarter, and I'm sure more they'll be signed in the fourth quarter. And then boarding those partnerships, we would expect to see very good record growth again next year. So I think overall, a really nice job by the team in driving that number back into the long-term framework that we expect, which is around 10%, right? That's kind of a level we talked about 10% to slightly above 10% as the long-term growth algorithm or the way we should outperform the mortgage market at EWS, and I think we're back to delivering in that level.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. We'll move on to the next question. Our next question is coming from Surinder Thind of Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind : Following up on the mortgage question here. Any color on how important the mix is in terms of the revenue recovery when we think about the $1.1 billion in terms of purchase versus refinance? Do we have to kind of get back to the historical average? Or are there other considerations that we should be thinking of?\nMark Begor : Yes, that really assumes historical averages in that 2015 to '19 level. As you know, purchase is generally a very large part of the underlying market and it was in that 2015 to '19 level. That's super depressed now. As we pointed out, there's a lack of inventory. People are sitting on those lower interest rate loans and not upgrading from the condo to the three bedroom home with the yard that should. We believe that's going to loosen up and there'll be more activity on the purchase side. And then we should see both a combination of rate refi and cash-out refis as rates come down. We saw just that blip, I would call it, for a couple of weeks until the 10-year went up, where I think John mentioned in his comments that the bulk of that increase was rate refi. So you can see just a very small think about 20, 25, 30 basis points change, some consumers that had taken out mortgages, say, a year or two years ago, at higher rates, and now are looking at picking up that rate arbitrage. So there's clearly pent-up demand that as rates come down, gives us still a lot of confidence in the framework of that $1.1 billion plus of kind of tailwind in the mortgage market. And I think as John said in his comments, just as a reminder, we'll reset that number in February next year, but the $1.1 billion is based off today's pricing, meaning 2024, \u201824 product mix, \u201824 record hit rates. That will be a higher number likely when we get to 2025 and kind of reset what that opportunity is going forward in 25, 26, 27 as the market moves back with rate declines.\nSurinder Thind : And then as a follow-on to that I believe in the prepared comments, you mentioned that additional pricing benefits in 2025. And any color you can provide there in terms of the strength of the pricing benefits that you expect maybe next year relative to what we've got -- what we saw this year?\nMark Begor : Yes, it's really early for that. We're not providing any '25 guidance. We tried to give you some kind of what we're seeing that we would expect to happen where we maybe have some confidence in it for next year. But I think it's too early on that. Just as a reminder, we will be doing increases on January 1. And we'll give some visibility to that when we have our February call and we laid out a framework for 2025, but you should expect price increases for EWS and from USIS as we've done over the last number of years. We think that there's a lot of value in the solutions we deliver. And you should expect and we plan to increase prices.\nSurinder Thind : Just as a clarification, I think is the commentary that you'll try and do pricing consistent with historical without talking about guidance. Is that the idea that pricing?\nMark Begor : I think we're trying not to give any framework on what the level of pricing is, but just reinforcing that there will be price increases as this customary in our industry, given the value of the data we have. And we'll give you real clarity on that when we get to February and our 2025 guidance.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company.\nKyle Peterson : Just wanted to see if you guys had any color I know on kind of some of the thoughts on purchase mortgage still being pretty subdued kind of partially due to rates and pursuing prices and affordability. Do you guys have any thoughts on how much rates would need to fall before purchase starts to improve? I know I know some of the inventory and home price issues are a little tougher to piece together. But at least on the rate side, I guess how much do you guys think rates need to fall before there would be some relief at least from that end of the market.\nMark Begor : That's a tough one. As you know, we've never -- I'll say it in our lifetime, maybe it's a little shorter than that. But we haven't seen in 20 years a rate increase at this pace and at this level ever. So the shock of the where mortgage rates have gone from the, call it, super low levels during COVID timeframe to where they are today is unprecedented. So I think it's hard to correlate that back. I think what we saw in late August is just a great indicator of even a very small change in rates down, stimulated the market. In this case, our view principally in refi but there's clearly some purchase activity. There's purchase activity even at these higher rates. People are buying homes at either variable or a 30 year fix rates. It's just that there isn't a lot of inventory. The real question, I think, is when will it stimulate those that are, call it, 3% or 4% mortgages that want to upgrade to a larger home. That's a normal part of the housing economy. And when -- how -- what's the gap have to be from where they are today at call it 3% to 4% versus 6% plus, is it 50 bps? Is it 100 bps? It's clearly lower. And I think we'll see that as it goes forward, we'll be super transparent with you. But I think you should be encouraged that when rates come down, the market responds pretty quickly, which we saw in late September, yes.\nKyle Peterson : And I guess just a follow-up on capital return. You guys can tease the potential for buybacks and dividends -- potential dividend increase in 2025. How do you guys think about priority and balanced between the two whether it's the firms you guys kind of want to do some of both. I know it's been a while since you guys have raised the dividend. But yes, just some more thoughts on how you guys are thinking about capital return and what the relative priority is?\nMark Begor : Yes. And no change to how we've communicated since I've been here. We've always been working towards a goal to return cash to shareholders. And as you know, the last four, five years, we've invested really substantial parts of our excess free cash flow in CapEx with the cloud transformation, we're getting at the finish line on that. So that's really good news. And our CapEx is going to come down meaningfully, which will free up more cash for available to return to shareholders. We've also, as you know, as a part of our long-term framework, plan to continue a bolt-on M&A strategy, very disciplined on the financial returns and very disciplined around the strategic swim lanes that we're focused on, whether it's differentiated data, strengthening EWS or growing in identity and fraud. And I think as you know, we've done a sizable amount of bolt-on acquisitions, while we were doing the cloud. And we would expect to continue to do those bolt-ons. Most recently, we did Boa Vista last August. We're continuing to build a pipeline of strategic and financially attractive acquisitions, but we try to frame for you that we would expect over the long term to have 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from that bolt-on M&A. So you think about 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually, that's $50 million to $100 million, Boa Vista delivered north of that. But in that kind of a range, and if you think about the cash required for buying the kind of companies that would be financially attractive to us that fit that $50 million to $100 million of revenue, obviously, at attractive margins and returns that's somewhere in the $500 million a year roughly of capital or cash bolt-on M&A. And your model, I'm sure looks like ours, when we get into 25,26, 27 our free cash flow really accelerates well in excess of what we would use for CapEx. It's 6% to 7%, that's south of $500 million. if you think about $500 million on the average, some years, it will be lower. Some years, it might be a bit higher on bolt-on M&A, there's substantial excess free cash flow to grow the dividend and buyback -- we've talked on the last call and we've talked, I think, on most of our earnings calls and when we're out with investors, when we think about returning cash to shareholders, we believe growing the dividend in a consistent way is a great way to return cash to shareholders and very disciplined. We frame that and this isn't -- we haven't made decisions, but we framed that in the direction of growing the dividend in line with our earnings growth. I think that's where we're working towards at the right time to do that. And then the excess free cash flow, which is meaningful, we would do in a buyback. And we'd be in the market kind of every day with that and use the buyback as another mechanism to return cash to shareholders. This has been our strategy since I joined Equifax is to complete the cloud transformation. We're getting towards that stage at 80% now and 90% by year-end and then bring CapEx down, bring our margins up off of the strong revenue growth rate we had that excess free cash flow to return to shareholders. And I think you caught in our comments earlier this morning, we shared with investors that we've added to our long-term framework structure, which is how we run the company and how we measure our teams a cash conversion metric. That's always been in our plan to do that. We thought it was the right time now to put that into our long-term framework. And I think it shows to you the discipline that we're going to have in running the company to generate that excess free cash flow to invest in Equifax, but as importantly to return cash to shareholders. And we look forward to getting to the stage to do that as we move into 2020.\nJohn Gamble : And just as a reminder, free cash flow is strengthening and very strong but also we're delevering. So we had to not only execute what Mark's talking about through free cash flow we generate, but also we'll have significant leverage available to us. given the substantial growth we're seeing in EBITDA.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh of UBS.\nKevin McVeigh : I just want to circle back to the mortgage revenue opportunity. It's been pretty consistent in framing $1 billion plus, but that's based on kind of current pricing more to your point penetration and TWN records, things like that. if I go back, right, to kind of the '15 to '19 time period, you had 71 million records as opposed to 182 million today. So what I'm trying to understand is, is there any way to think about kind of what your yield is to get to that number today as opposed to what the inquiry or interest rate number has to be? So I guess said another way, you've got a lot more product and higher records, things like that. So do you need the same level of interest rate to kind of drive that revenue? Or is there any way to think about that aspect of it?\nMark Begor : Yes, that's a tough one. We've worked hard to try to model that. It's just so unprecedented what's happened in the last three years with rates we've never seen it before. And we've picked you can agree or disagree with what we've been using, but we pick 2015 to '19 as being a normal level. But if you go back like a decade, go back the last time there was really a kind of an unusual mortgage environment was '07, '08, '09 during the global financial crisis, and that was more an underwriting crisis from a consumer mortgage standpoint versus a rate on. And I think it's just -- it's been very consistent. There's just so much scale in the United States of consumers that want to move from an apartment to that first condo that apartment to a home. They want to upgrade their home and then there's a flip side when consumers age out and they start retiring, they sell their big home, they buy a smaller home on the mortgages with all that. So it's just such a large market, and we've never seen a 50% decline. So we've tried to just lay out that's the anomaly in the market. Our view is that as rates come down, we'll move into that $1.2 billion of market opportunity, as we pointed out, will be a larger number next year. And we're just convinced that it's going to happen over time, which will be additive to our P&L and our framework. In our long-term framework, of 8% to 12% revenue growth, we really just have GDP in there. And think about a couple of points of market expansion underlies our 8% to 12%. And we've also been very clear that there's going to be very high incremental margins as that mortgage market comes back, meaning we're not going to reinvest those dollars in more people. We have the right cost structure in Equifax today grow our business and really to make the right investments. So as that market tailwind flows into our P&L, we would expect it to be incremental, which obviously will drive our top line but also our margins and our free cash flow and give us more free cash to return to shareholders.\nKevin McVeigh : And then just real quick on the ERTC, ERC rather. What percentage of the revenue was at today? And where was that? Maybe at peak? Just trying to dimensionalize what that headwind has been?\nMark Begor : John can jump in on that. Equifax quite small, but in the employer vertical, it was a large number and now it's going down to nothing.\nJohn Gamble : But you can just give you orders of magnitude right now, ERC is think on the order of $1 million a quarter. And it was probably in the order of 10-ish, maybe a little higher $1 million per quarter as you go back two and three quarters, right, even the third quarter last year. So that's the type of change you're talking about. And in an employer business that's $95 million a quarter. Obviously, that can be a significant change.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Scott Wurtzel of Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel : Just wanted to ask on the government vertical. I know we've talked about sort of the penetration story in terms of the amount of state local federal agencies that are out there. But I guess I would love to kind of hear your thoughts on when we look at sort of the different buckets of benefits of security, SNAP, ACA, Medicaid like where you kind of see most sort of white space for penetration over the near to medium-term here?\nMark Begor : Yes, it's a great question. Thanks for bringing it up. A 29% growth, you're the first analysts to bring up that vertical. So we appreciate that. And as a reminder, government is moving to be our largest vertical in Workforce Solutions. And as you know, you've got that large $5 billion TAM against around a little bit, roughly an $800 million run rate business now. I wouldn't think about specific services. I'd really think about the TAM itself and the biggest opportunity in the TAM is penetration at the states and the state agencies. An agency deploys typically not a state. And if you think about, call it, $800 million versus $5 billion that $4 billion plus of potential revenue for us in the government vertical, are social service verifications that are still being done manually. So that's really the focus. We've been adding resources and people. We're investing in new products and technology to enable our ability to penetrate those states. There's -- when you meet with a director of an agency at a state there's -- they all want to use it because it's accurate. It adds productivity to them. They're always challenged with how do we deliver the specific services, whether it's food stamps or health support how do we deliver that more quickly. And as you know, the federal government that pays for the bulk of those social services requires the states to verify eligibility. And that's where we come in, eligibility is around income and verifying the source of that income, which is the employment. So for us, the big opportunity is really at the state level. As you now know, we have some large federal contracts. Last year, we extended our CMS contract, which was a big $1 billion plus contract extension. We announced \u2013 we shared in this call that we just extended our SSA contract, which is $500 million over five years. So you see the scale of those federal contracts. But the opportunity to continue to drive that strong double-digit growth in government going forward is really penetration in the states. That's the bulk of that $4 billion untapped TAM. And as I said, more people more feet on the street. We have Equifax people, Workforce Solutions people that live at the state capitals that work with each of those agencies. We're working with partners. We're adding on new products. As you know, we have more data now incarceration data from our APRs Insights acquisitions is used in that vertical. We're working to put those data elements together in a single transaction. Today, they're all delivered individually. So there's just a lot of opportunities and the scale of the workforce allows us to invest in that. And I think as we said, in many calls that we expect the government vertical over the long-term to outgrow the 13% to 15% growth in Workforce Solutions. We just think there's so much opportunity for us because of the value it delivers at all of the agencies at the state level.\nScott Wurtzel : And just as a follow-up on the mortgage side. I guess when looking at some industry data, it looks like maybe the gap between sort of USIS mortgage inquiries versus some of the application data in terms of kind of maybe widened during the quarter. I'm just wondering if there were anything to sort of call out with that? Was it due to maybe mix dynamics between purchase and refi? Any information on that would be helpful.\nJohn Gamble : No, I don't think there's anything specific, right? I think it continues to be. We still think we have the same penetration and share that we have consistently. Obviously, with hard inquiries, it's still required to pull a tribunal. So I'm not sure what you're specifically looking at, but no, we don't see any changes that are meaningful in hard inquiries in the industry.\nMark Begor : And I think as you saw, we expected that to happen. We told you in July, we thought it would happen, but you saw the outperformance from record growth that really moved up positively in EWS. So that's -- we were pleased with that.\nJohn Gamble : Pre-quals continues to be a big part of our business. And obviously, that's something that is shared amongst the three players. So sure could move between those. But overall, we're happy with the way the business is performing.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jason Haas of Wells Fargo.\nJason Haas : Maybe sort going back to talent verifications. I'm curious if you have any insight into which industries you're seeing that slowdown in hiring. Then I'm also curious if you're seeing any increase in competition or any more in-sourcing by some of the large background screeners.\nMark Begor : Yes. I think we -- what we heard from the background screening customer base that we have is that they saw some slowdowns kind of in mid late September in white-collar. Even though we had a good quarter, there were some slowdowns there. So we took that run rate rolling forward. And I think you've seen enough layoffs over the last announcements over the last month or two from different companies that perhaps tightening up, you're waiting to see where the election goes and what's going to happen in Washington. So I don't think it's anything different than that, John.\nJohn Gamble : No. And we haven't really seen any movements in share. We continue to work well with our partners, and we just think it's a matter of we happen to be focused in white-collar and you've seen some slowdown in white-collar specifically in September.\nJason Haas : And then as a follow-up question, I was curious if we look at the EWS mortgage increase versus USIS, they're still under pacing. My understanding is that the function of people shopping around by not closing. So I'm curious what's your expectation for when that gap closes looks like what you said maybe probably a little bit of a narrower in fourth quarter. Does that -- do you expect that would converge in next year, sometime next year?\nMark Begor : We actually don't. If you go back to really in history, there's always been more mortgage pulls for the credit file than income and employment. On average, we get five plus credit file polls, a closed loan, where there's two to three income and employment pulls per closed loan. So that hasn't changed. We don't expect that to change. What did change as rates went up, was there was a consumer behavior of just more shopping to try to find another 25 bps off on the loan, meaning they're going to multiple mortgage originators for either their refi or for their purchase loan and every time they go to a different originator, there's a credit file fold. That's a shopping process because the originator wants to figure out is someone that has the credit score that would support the kind of loan they're going to pull. They typically don't pull income and employment there. Now we're trying to innovate to help that shopping process. And I think you heard us talk earlier on this call in July also. That we're piloting in the marketplace in Equifax credit file with an income and employment flag on it to really indicate that this consumer not only has this credit score, but they also are working today, you don't know that in the shopping process if you're an originator. We think that should advantage our credit file, which should drive some credit file share. And in the shopping process, where three credit reports are universally pulled in the application process in shopping, many originators pull three, some pull two, simple one. So we want to differentiate ourselves in the shopping process on the credit file side. But no, we don't expect them to converge. And as John said earlier, I think on an earlier question, they've been fairly consistent in '24 and '23.\nJohn Gamble : Earlier this year, we had thought perhaps shopping might start to slow. And when we gave guidance back in February, what we indicated that we thought we might see that start to narrow or shopping might slow or said another way, the percentage of applications that are initiated would actually result in a loan but we just haven't seen it happen, right? And so the pattern that we've seen over the past two to three years just continues to occur. And so I think as Mark said, we -- at this point, our expectation is it will just continue to occur.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jeff Meuler of Baird.\nJeff Meuler : I just want to circle back to the Q4 guidance. I get it, $15 million is not that great in the grand scale of Equifax. But if I also consider the 9 point better mortgage market assumption, which impacts almost 20% of your revenue run rate, it does seem like a fairly sizable adjustment. So just, I guess, any other callouts of size beyond the industry gross hiring volumes? And maybe if I could just hit it head on, like, was there any sort of sizable client loss or meaningful reduction in client relationships that also contribute just so we don't have to wonder about.\nMark Begor : Yes, you don't have to wonder about that. Go ahead, John, and I'll jump into.\nJohn Gamble : First, on mortgage, right? The difference in the -- change in guide in the implied guide in the fourth quarter from back in July to the actual guide now, the change in mortgage isn't very substantial at all, right? What you're talking about is credit inquiries. I'm not quite sure it's 9 points. I think that's an estimate that you're providing. But yes, credit increase are slightly stronger and that's making USIS revenue slightly stronger, but that read through for the question we just got doesn't really apply to EWS because of the fact that what we're seeing is shopping behavior not closing behavior. So the impact on our mortgage revenue between the guidance we provided in October and the implied guide back from July is really relatively small, right? So that's why what we're talking about here is specifically related to non-mortgage revenue. And as Mark said in his remarks and I reiterated the biggest trucker is employer, right? And also, there is some impact from talent because we saw weakness in talent in September that we carried through in our run rates in terms of our guidance. But the biggest driver is employer and that's really the driver, but mortgage wasn't a substantial improvement in the guidance in October relative to the expectations in July.\nJeff Meuler : And then sorry to get the weeds on this. I get the typical methodology in terms of run rating forward recent mortgage. But just given the volatility in the last few weeks, I want to know what period specifically you're run rating forward because you're calling out the late September improvement. And then I think you said subsequently it reduced back to maybe like July, August levels in October. So just what period are you extrapolating forward given the recent.\nMark Begor : Yes, Jeff, no change in how we do it. We always do it through like early this week, right? So we're kind of in the mid-October. So this is no change from last quarter to the quarter before that, whether it's mortgage or any other parts of our business. But to your point, mortgage or in this case, we saw the hiring impact late in September that continued in October, same with the impact of mortgage. So we try to use the most current run rates we typically use the last -- we'll look at how is it the last week. How is it the last two weeks, how is it the last three weeks, four weeks, something like that and try to see where are those trends? Is it stronger in the last week than the last weeks. Is it weaker in the last week and try to put that together and use our best estimate around where that -- we think that trend is and use that for the current quarter guidance. That's no change, right? John.\nJohn Gamble : No change at all. What we've seen in October, right, is obviously inquiries came down and they kind of stabilized in October, right? So that's kind of the basis that we're using going forward.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer.\nOwen Lau : Could you please add more color on insurance and commercial vertical? It grew double-digit and looks pretty strong there. What are you seeing there?\nMark Begor : Yes. John, you can jump in, too. So the commercial vertical is our small business -- data business that is had -- if you look at '22 and '23, actually '21, '22 and '23, that business was up very strong, high singles and for many quarters, double digit. We had some execution issues earlier this year, but it's not back to that similar levels, which we're really pleased with. We would expect that business to grow at the high end of the USIS 6 to 8 range over the long term because of the unique data that we have. And remember, we made the PayNet acquisition with the leasing trade lines. We're onboarding now merchant data to enhance the picture around small businesses and obviously bringing in the entrepreneur from our consumer data set. So we think that's a business that will continue to have positive growth going forward, and we're pleased to see it back in that range where we expect it to be.\nJohn Gamble : Insurance for us is relatively small in the broader scheme of USIS, but we did see nice growth, and it was principally online. So we just saw higher online transaction volume across the insurance vertical.\nOwen Lau : And then going back to your cloud migration, could you please give us an update on how we should think about incremental top line revenue contribution in 2025 and maybe 26%. Any time line of product launches you can share over the next few quarters or so?\nMark Begor : Yes. We talked earlier, you're seeing already some of the impacts of the cloud transformation. If you go back, our long-term framework for Vitality is 10%. We increased it from 5 to 7 pre-cloud. We've been delivering north of that 10% for the last couple of years, including in 2020 4. As you know, we increased the guide for this year. And we think that's directly attributable to our cloud investments, the benefits from the cloud investments are focused on innovation products as well as our focus on AI. So that innovation, we think, is a very good metric around the benefits of cloud. We think we'll also see share gains in USIS in some of our international markets as we complete the cloud and deliver always on stability and move into either secondary or primary positions when we're below that today. So that should get into the P&L. And specifically, I think maybe your question is around USIS since we talked about the USIS cloud completion. We would expect their vitality, which has been increasing this year from 8% in third quarter -- second quarter into 9% and the third, you had to move towards that $10 million. And we would expect to allow them to deliver solidly inside of that 6% to 8% long-term framework going forward.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber : You talked about a long-term outlook for your vitality index at 10%. I think you said you're 11% right now. Can you give us some examples that you're quite positive with new products out there today, but particularly outside the U.S., I'd like to hear something you have already touched on today. That's my first question.\nMark Begor : Yes. That's a -- there's a lot of them. I guess you're asking me to tell you something we're excited. But I think broadly, you should be excited and we are too about vitality. International vitality is still below 10%, but I think it was 9% in the quarter. So very, very strong. We would expect them to move towards that trend, as they complete cloud like in Canada in some of the other markets. So that's a real positive. We've got some identity solutions in the marketplace internationally and in the U.S. that we're excited about, some new solutions using alternative data that it has real traction that adds to the credit file that we think are quite positive. We talked about earlier on this call, some of the solutions we're doing here in the U.S. between EWS and USIS that are really unique that we think will benefit both USIS and EWS using the income flag on some of our credit files, which we think is very positive. We've rolled out in the U.S. someone score solutions that combine our cell phone utility data as well as our other alternative data that's having big lifts in performance. It differentiates really our score using our credit file and other alternative data versus our competitors. So we're excited about that. Did you add anything, John?\nJohn Gamble : I think we have some USIS solutions on the FMS side where we have customers usually Ignite to generate analytics that they can use to improve marketing campaigns and conversion, all of those driven by fabric.\nCraig Huber : My other question, if I could. When you think about costs for next year, I know you want to give formal guidance at this stage when we think about costs for next year given all the cost savings initiatives you guys have put in place here. You're going to be at 90% through the cloud transformation at the end of this year. And so for the cost next year that you guys can control and assuming the economy holds together, mortgage rates come down as you're talking about and stuff. I'm assuming you have a very strong flow-through down to the EBITDA line if you have strong revenue growth here. But I'm curious on your cost side, do you have to step up any investment spending next year? I mean how should we just broadly think about your cost outlook for next year in your two main segments?\nMark Begor : I think you saw we took a charge this quarter that was planned to execute the cloud cost savings, principally from USIS and some of that from Canada that will benefit the fourth quarter, but that also benefits 2025. So that benefit is a positive. As you point out, we're at 90% cloud complete, which is a big milestone at year-end but we still have 10% to go. So as we complete those last pieces of the cloud, there'll be additional decommissioning of the legacy infrastructure for that tail of our cloud completion. So that's going to benefit '25 and '26. And John, you also not cost, but it's -- depreciation, you talked about being higher next year because we're bringing on more of the new platforms into our operating mode and starting to depreciate those. So we framed for you that depreciation will be up next year. But I think you said it's -- we're kind of peaking in depreciation in 2025 with CapEx coming down.\nJohn Gamble : And in terms of -- you mentioned investment, right? So investment is actually coming down on capital. So we've talked about the fact that we're moving down substantially on capital spending in 2024 versus 2023. You'll probably see us continue to drive down as a percentage of revenue, our capital spending in 2025 relative to 2024 as we move toward our 6% to 7% long-term framework. And as you know, investment spend in terms of capital expense move together. So we don't see an increase in investment spend that would be expense because we're continuing to bring down our investments and spend as capital.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan : My first question actually picks up on the last part of the last one. You mentioned the 6% to 7% CapEx in the long-term framework. This year, obviously, a really big move with USIS going on to the cloud there. So a lot of I imagine a lot of spend being spent on that. So I guess, should we see a big step down in '21 on the CapEx side or should we expect the move towards the 6% to 7% to be more gradual since you still have 10% of revenue left and maybe there are some other things that you're working on? And maybe just a follow-up, what's the next step in the technology plan from here now that you have most of this done.\nMark Begor : Yes. So a couple of different questions there, Tony. First, we're not intending to give '25 guidance this year, but we're happy to give some kind of indication. So I think we said we expect CapEx to come down next year again. You use the term big -- it's hard to find big. You may think about differently than I do, but CapEx, we will bring CapEx down next year as we move closer to cloud completion. What's left to be done is outside the U.S., principally Australia, a few Latin American countries. We're partially through on U.K. We'll finish a lot of the U.K. next year. Spain will be done by year-end. So it's really those kind of elements so you should expect to see a reduction in CapEx as a percent of revenue again in 2016, as we get kind of that next stage. We framed the 6% to 7% over the long-term is what we expect to do. And as a reminder, as we move into kind of a post cloud environment, that CapEx is increasingly used for innovation in new products versus cloud transformation or maintaining legacy infrastructure. So we think we're going to be advantaged in having what I would call growth as we move into '25, '26, '27 versus kind of building cloud CapEx we've had for the last number of years, which we think will be a positive.\nJohn Gamble : In terms of the benefit to cash conversion, I think certainly as we get into 2026, you're going to see depreciation probably likely be higher than capital spending. So again, helps cash conversion significantly.\nToni Kaplan : And this one sort of touched on a few times, but just hoping you could give any sort of update on like green shoots that will make you more optimistic in the consumer credit environment about 2025, if you're seeing any, if you're not, that's fine, too. But just anything that makes you more or less optimistic about 2025 with regard to consumer credit?\nMark Begor: I think we talked about consumer credit, some end market consumer demand softening like in auto, but it's still okay. It's not like it's depressed. You go back to two years ago, we had the fintech kind of was really impacted. That's now normalized, I think it's a positive, meaning and we're growing in fintech. So as we -- with cloud and new products going forward. So when I think about green shoots, from where we sit, 2025 feels like certainly the first half of '25 going to be much like we're seeing today. I think the green shoot really would be in rate reductions. We talk a ton around the impact of rate reductions in mortgage, but rate reductions in auto for auto loans are going to be helpful to that end market, in my view, and in P loan, lesser degree in cards, consumers tend to be less sensitive to rates and cards because most consumers don't think they're going to revolve with a credit card. But when you're taking out a P loan, you're taking out an installment loan when you're buying a car on credit and those rates are higher, too. So if there is any potential green shoots that we haven't seen yet, is does the Fed take rates down? Does the 10-year come down? And does that not only benefit mortgage but also benefit a couple of the other end-user markets.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra : I have two clarifying questions. First one was on that $70 million savings in 2025 from cost actions. Just wondering, is that all OpEx? Or does it also have CapEx saving and does that include all the cloud savings? So that's my first question.\nJohn Gamble : Yes. So the $70 million is total spending savings, so it would have some CapEx as well.\nAshish Sabadra : That's helpful color. And then maybe just a clarification on the inquiries for 2025 expectation for a 5% growth. I was just wondering, is that largely just based on as Mark explained, the near-term dynamic? Or are you also baking in the Fed rate cuts going in 2025 or those could be incremental upside?\nJohn Gamble : Yes. So we weren't trying to give that as an expectation for 2025. We were just trying to provide it as a piece of information. But if you take the current run rate we're seeing now in the first half of October, and you just assume that they don't really change and then apply seasonality to them for 2025 that we would end up with inventories up something over 5% in 2025 and inquiry something up over 5% in the first quarter. We weren't trying to indicate that was guidance from us in any way. We were just trying to give people perspective on what the current run rates would look like. We know you and many investors have their own perspectives on what the mortgage market is going to do and how it will change over the rest of the year. And we weren't trying to indicate we expect it to be flat. It's just -- that's where it is right now.\nMark Begor: And we don't forecast rate changes. We never have. We try to find for you what the impact of a potential rate change could be like in mortgage, but we don't forecast rate changes. That's just not our guidance philosophy.\nOperator: The next question is coming from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong : Mark, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing broadly with consumer credit health, particularly across prime and subprime consumers, data seems to suggest that delinquency rates are continuing to go up year-over-year across lending categories.\nMark Begor : Yes. I think it's still, in our view, a pretty good market. That's what our customers are saying. There's -- I don't think there's any alarm, George from our customers around where delinquencies have gone. I think most of our customers believe with the low unemployment or high employment rates, meaning consumers working that even with delinquencies up that's manageable and they're generally at delinquency rates that are inside of how our customers think about growing their business. So we haven't seen that impact -- we haven't seen delinquencies be a reason that people are tightening up outside of subprime. Subprime that's already happened. Subprime tightened up a couple of years ago. But from our perspective, if employment is going to stay at this fairly low level, we don't see that impacting our volumes in the fourth quarter in the early parts of 2025 unless there's a change in the employment levels -- and unemployment goes up.\nGeorge Tong : And then, John, can you talk about the puts and takes with your updated EBITDA margin outlook for the year, 32.4% at the midpoint compared to 32.6% previously.\nJohn Gamble : Yes. So obviously, we gave our revised guidance for the full year. We gave a for the first time for the fourth quarter. And I think what you're just seeing is the -- is a very strong improvement in EBITDA margin in 4Q versus 3Q, which we're very happy with, a 4Q adjusted EPS and an EBITDA dollar level, which are at record levels, as we said in the call, and Marc reiterated over $500 million in EBITDA in the fourth quarter. So I think what you're seeing is very strong delivery in the fourth quarter. A lot of the improvement in EBITDA driven by cost reductions and actions that are being taken now that we've completed cloud transformation -- sorry, customer migrations on the consumer side in USIS and then obviously, Canada as well. So we feel good about the improvements we're talking about, about the higher margins we're talking about in the fourth quarter and we think that bodes well for next year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Andrew Stein of FT Partners.\nAndrew Stein: So my first question, I just wanted to shift to the international segment. I realize the Boa Vista acquisition lapped its one year marker in , I guess, and LATAM had a really strong quarter. So can you help us understand the run rate organic growth trends between Boa Vista and LATAM ex Brazil? And then what is Boa Vista\u2019s market share now compared to the 15% at the time of acquisition. I'm just wondering what opportunities you have to gain market share over the next year.\nMark Begor : Yes. So we're still excited -- very excited about Boa Vista. As you know, we just lapped the one year mark of ownership of the business. We're still in the thick of integrating the business and bringing our new products and technology down there. Serasa Experian has a very strong business that they've executed very well on. But the feedback we're getting from all the big banks and customers there is that they welcome a global competitor and that's where we're going to. We're pleased with the performance of Boa Vista through 2024, and we expect it to be continued strong and we do expect some share gains going forward. It's too early to see that in the business after just 12 months. And we haven't really fully deployed a lot of the Equifax technology of Ignite and interconnect, but those are getting in place as we exit the year and into 2025. So we'd expect some more traction there going forward. Latin America had a very good quarter. We're performing well in that market, really in all geographies, all the countries that we participate in and really big focus by that team as well as the international team on innovation and new products, which is really helping their effectiveness in the marketplace.\nAndrew Stein: And then just a follow-up on the international margin expansion. That was also a really strong this quarter. And just wondering if you could help us understand the remaining potential for margin expansion in LATAM and Europe as the cloud transformation is completed for those segments?\nJohn Gamble : Yes. We're expecting, obviously, very good margin expansion again in the fourth quarter. And then we're expecting them to continue to grow margins as we get into 2025. Part of it obviously driven by continued good revenue growth, organic revenue growth in international with again very high variable margins. And they do -- and we do have more opportunities, as Mark talked about, because we're completing cloud transformation in the U.K. in 2025. You'll see it more in Australia, New Zealand in terms of 2026 and pieces as we go through 2025 in Latin America. So we expect to see that be beneficial to margins in Latin America as we go through 2025. But again, just a general trend of improving margins in LATAM -- sorry, in international as we look over the next several years.\nMark Begor : And John, we also -- we just completed Canada two weeks ago or 10 days ago. So those benefits will roll into the fourth quarter and into 2025 and then we complete Spain later this year in a couple of other Latin American countries. So that cloud completion, as you point out, which is principally that 10% we have left to go is going to benefit principally international because that's where the work of the cloud complete is going to take place.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Burns for closing comments.\nTrevor Burns: Yes. Thanks, everybody, for your time today and if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to myself or Molly and look forward to interacting with everybody throughout the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 11. As Mark discussed, we started to see an improvement in the run rate of USIS credit inquiries in late September as mortgage rates declined to just over 6%. We believe the improvement principally reflected higher refinance activity in late September. New home purchase activity does not appear to have increased meaningfully at this point, likely reflecting continued low home inventory levels, home prices at near all-time highs and respective homebuyers waiting for further mortgage rate reductions. As a reminder, the normal mix of mortgage originations and defined as the average over the 2015 to 2019 period is about 55% purchase and 45% refinance. In the first two weeks of October, we have seen mortgage inquiry volumes for both credit and twin slow versus September as mortgage rates have increased to above 6.5%. The run rate over the last two weeks of both credit and twin inquiries is relatively consistent with the expectations we had when we provided guidance in July. Consistent with our practice in 2024 and the last several years, our guidance for credit inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two to four weeks, modified to reflect normal seasonal pattern. This effectively assumes market conditions will continue for the quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be up about 9% versus 4Q '23 and down 16% sequentially. Calendar year '24 mortgage credit inquiries are expected to be down about 7%. For the fourth quarter, we expect USIS mortgage revenue to be up over 4% and much stronger than the underlying mortgage market, reflecting both strong performance in mortgage pre-qual products as well as vendor pricing actions. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries in the fourth quarter to be up about 6% versus 4Q '23 and down about 12% sequentially. For the full year, TWN inquiries are expected to be down about 11%. We expect EWS mortgage revenue to be up over 16% in the fourth quarter and much stronger than the underlying TWN inquiries, again, principally reflecting strong record growth in 2024 and as well as annual mortgage pricing that occurs early in the first quarter each year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically seasonally the lowest quarter of the year for both credit and TWN inquiries. For perspective, as we look to 2025, carrying these current run rates with normal seasonality TWN '25, mortgage credit inquiries would grow versus 2024, up just over 5% for the year and also just over 5% in the first quarter of 2025. Slide 12 provides the details of our 4Q '24 guidance. In 4Q '24, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.438 billion and $1.458 billion, up about 9% at the midpoint. Organic constant dollar revenue growth at the midpoint is about 10% and at the high end of our long-term financial framework. At the midpoint, mortgage revenue is expected to be up almost 30% and non-mortgage constant dollar revenue up over 7%. Equifax 4Q '24 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 35.5% at the midpoint of our guidance. The sequential increase in EBITDA margins reflects revenue growth and cost management across Equifax, including the decommissioning of USIS legacy consumer and telco and utility systems and Canada legacy consumer and commercial systems. This is our first ever quarter with EBITDA over $500 million. This would be a very strong performance. Adjusted EPS in 4Q '24 is expected to be $2.08 to $2.18 per share, up 18% versus 4Q '23 at the midpoint. The midpoint of our fourth quarter revenue guidance is about $15 million below the levels implied by the guidance we provided in July. The primary driver is lower revenue in EWS and in the employer business driven by lower revenue and onboarding as well as ERC. And this is consistent with the factors that impacted the third quarter and also the slower U.S. hiring Mark referenced earlier that is impacting both onboarding and talent solutions. We believe we are centered at the midpoint of our guidance. Business unit performance in the fourth quarter is expected to be as follows: Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 10%. Non-mortgage revenue should be up about 8% year-to-year. Verifier non-mortgage revenue growth will continue to show strong double-digit growth, although below the levels we saw in the third quarter. Verifier non-mortgage growth will again be driven by strong growth in government and talent. Government revenue growth is expected to grow sequentially and year-to-year. However, year-to-year growth will be below the levels we have seen year-to-date in 2024, as we lap very strong 4Q '23 revenue growth in government. Both Verifier mortgage and non-mortgage revenue growth should benefit from the continued strong growth in TWN records we are seeing throughout 2024. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up slightly from the third quarter at about 52%. USIS revenue is expected to be up over 10% year-to-year. Non-mortgage revenue should be up about 3% year-to-year, slightly lower than the third quarter, principally due to lower growth in USIS D2C and as they begin to lap periods of strong growth that started in 4Q '23 and financial marketing services, which is expected to be about flat in the year-to-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be over 38%, up very strong sequentially as USIS decommissions legacy consumer and telco and utility systems. International revenue is expected to be up over 9% in constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be over 32%, up very strong sequentially, reflecting both revenue growth and good cost control. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full year guidance. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10%, with organic constant currency growth of 8% and within our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 12.5% despite the 7% decline in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue is expected to grow almost 10% with organic growth of over 7%, led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services business and in international. This is within our long-term framework. FX is about 180 basis points negative to revenue growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.30 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be 32.4%. Adjusted EPS and EBITDA are both expected to grow 9% in 2024, all at the midpoint of our guidance. Capital expenditures in the third quarter are $123 million, down $8 million sequentially. We expect fourth quarter capital expenditures to be just over $105 million, as USIS has completed customer migrations to the U.S. consumer data fabric and Canada has completed customer migrations to their consumer and commercial data fabric. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be about $485 million, which is a year-to-year reduction of about $100 million. As we accelerate our cloud migrations, we are seeing increasing levels of depreciation and amortization. In 2024, D&A, excluding acquisition amortization, is expected to be about $410 million, up about $50 million versus 2023. In 2025, we expect D&A to increase slightly above the $50 million increase we saw in 2024. As of the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.8x, and we expect to further reduce leverage in the fourth quarter. We believe this leverage is nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. Turning to Slide 14. And as we discussed in July, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the mortgage market recovers towards historic norms that presents -- represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax in 2025 and beyond at current product pricing, TWN records contracted and products. We expect this opportunity to increase as we enter 2025 from pricing actions, TWN records and new products. At current mortgage gross margins, this over $1 billion of incremental mortgage revenue would deliver on the order of $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L as the mortgage market returns to normal levels in 2025 and beyond. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Those segments are also benefiting substantially just by record growth, right? So since records are up over 10% that drives their hit rates higher, so it's a direct benefit to those segments. Sure. It was a very strong quarter. And stronger than we expect to see when we gave guidance part of it was because we signed -- we executed a couple of large transactions with new customers in the payments industry. And we think that's very important to us, not just in the fact that it delivered a strong quarter, but also because we think it's an ongoing revenue source, not just in batch but increasingly in our mind. So we're very excited about the fact that we signed those partnerships and delivered revenue in the quarter, but also we think it bodes very well for us across the payments industry as we continue to grow the use of our data in payments. No, not a read through at all. It was really just great execution by the team on winning new customers and delivering in period. Look, I think the big thing we were talking about as we started the year, we were expecting very good progression in terms of the outperformance with EWS mortgage that would happen as we went through the year. And I think we saw it consistently every quarter. We saw improvements in second, third and now we would expect to be stronger in the fourth than we were in the third. So we feel very good about that progression. And again, it is driven by records. So record growth has been extremely strong. And given the partnerships that were signed this quarter, and I'm sure more they'll be signed in the fourth quarter. And then boarding those partnerships, we would expect to see very good record growth again next year. So I think overall, a really nice job by the team in driving that number back into the long-term framework that we expect, which is around 10%, right? That's kind of a level we talked about 10% to slightly above 10% as the long-term growth algorithm or the way we should outperform the mortgage market at EWS, and I think we're back to delivering in that level. And just as a reminder, free cash flow is strengthening and very strong but also we're delevering. So we had to not only execute what Mark's talking about through free cash flow we generate, but also we'll have significant leverage available to us. given the substantial growth we're seeing in EBITDA. But you can just give you orders of magnitude right now, ERC is think on the order of $1 million a quarter. And it was probably in the order of 10-ish, maybe a little higher $1 million per quarter as you go back two and three quarters, right, even the third quarter last year. So that's the type of change you're talking about. And in an employer business that's $95 million a quarter. Obviously, that can be a significant change. No, I don't think there's anything specific, right? I think it continues to be. We still think we have the same penetration and share that we have consistently. Obviously, with hard inquiries, it's still required to pull a tribunal. So I'm not sure what you're specifically looking at, but no, we don't see any changes that are meaningful in hard inquiries in the industry. Pre-quals continues to be a big part of our business. And obviously, that's something that is shared amongst the three players. So sure could move between those. But overall, we're happy with the way the business is performing. No. And we haven't really seen any movements in share. We continue to work well with our partners, and we just think it's a matter of we happen to be focused in white-collar and you've seen some slowdown in white-collar specifically in September. Earlier this year, we had thought perhaps shopping might start to slow. And when we gave guidance back in February, what we indicated that we thought we might see that start to narrow or shopping might slow or said another way, the percentage of applications that are initiated would actually result in a loan but we just haven't seen it happen, right? And so the pattern that we've seen over the past two to three years just continues to occur. And so I think as Mark said, we -- at this point, our expectation is it will just continue to occur. First, on mortgage, right? The difference in the -- change in guide in the implied guide in the fourth quarter from back in July to the actual guide now, the change in mortgage isn't very substantial at all, right? What you're talking about is credit inquiries. I'm not quite sure it's 9 points. I think that's an estimate that you're providing. But yes, credit increase are slightly stronger and that's making USIS revenue slightly stronger, but that read through for the question we just got doesn't really apply to EWS because of the fact that what we're seeing is shopping behavior not closing behavior. So the impact on our mortgage revenue between the guidance we provided in October and the implied guide back from July is really relatively small, right? So that's why what we're talking about here is specifically related to non-mortgage revenue. And as Mark said in his remarks and I reiterated the biggest trucker is employer, right? And also, there is some impact from talent because we saw weakness in talent in September that we carried through in our run rates in terms of our guidance. But the biggest driver is employer and that's really the driver, but mortgage wasn't a substantial improvement in the guidance in October relative to the expectations in July. No change at all. What we've seen in October, right, is obviously inquiries came down and they kind of stabilized in October, right? So that's kind of the basis that we're using going forward. Insurance for us is relatively small in the broader scheme of USIS, but we did see nice growth, and it was principally online. So we just saw higher online transaction volume across the insurance vertical. I think we have some USIS solutions on the FMS side where we have customers usually Ignite to generate analytics that they can use to improve marketing campaigns and conversion, all of those driven by fabric. And in terms of -- you mentioned investment, right? So investment is actually coming down on capital. So we've talked about the fact that we're moving down substantially on capital spending in 2024 versus 2023. You'll probably see us continue to drive down as a percentage of revenue, our capital spending in 2025 relative to 2024 as we move toward our 6% to 7% long-term framework. And as you know, investment spend in terms of capital expense move together. So we don't see an increase in investment spend that would be expense because we're continuing to bring down our investments and spend as capital. In terms of the benefit to cash conversion, I think certainly as we get into 2026, you're going to see depreciation probably likely be higher than capital spending. So again, helps cash conversion significantly. Yes. So the $70 million is total spending savings, so it would have some CapEx as well. Yes. So we weren't trying to give that as an expectation for 2025. We were just trying to provide it as a piece of information. But if you take the current run rate we're seeing now in the first half of October, and you just assume that they don't really change and then apply seasonality to them for 2025 that we would end up with inventories up something over 5% in 2025 and inquiry something up over 5% in the first quarter. We weren't trying to indicate that was guidance from us in any way. We were just trying to give people perspective on what the current run rates would look like. We know you and many investors have their own perspectives on what the mortgage market is going to do and how it will change over the rest of the year. And we weren't trying to indicate we expect it to be flat. It's just -- that's where it is right now. Yes. So obviously, we gave our revised guidance for the full year. We gave a for the first time for the fourth quarter. And I think what you're just seeing is the -- is a very strong improvement in EBITDA margin in 4Q versus 3Q, which we're very happy with, a 4Q adjusted EPS and an EBITDA dollar level, which are at record levels, as we said in the call, and Marc reiterated over $500 million in EBITDA in the fourth quarter. So I think what you're seeing is very strong delivery in the fourth quarter. A lot of the improvement in EBITDA driven by cost reductions and actions that are being taken now that we've completed cloud transformation -- sorry, customer migrations on the consumer side in USIS and then obviously, Canada as well. So we feel good about the improvements we're talking about, about the higher margins we're talking about in the fourth quarter and we think that bodes well for next year. Yes. We're expecting, obviously, very good margin expansion again in the fourth quarter. And then we're expecting them to continue to grow margins as we get into 2025. Part of it obviously driven by continued good revenue growth, organic revenue growth in international with again very high variable margins. And they do -- and we do have more opportunities, as Mark talked about, because we're completing cloud transformation in the U.K. in 2025. You'll see it more in Australia, New Zealand in terms of 2026 and pieces as we go through 2025 in Latin America. So we expect to see that be beneficial to margins in Latin America as we go through 2025. But again, just a general trend of improving margins in LATAM -- sorry, in international as we look over the next several years."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thanks, Trevor and good morning. Before I cover our strong third quarter results, I want to update you on the strong progress of our cloud transformation. In the quarter, USIS completed the migration onto the cloud data fabric of the remaining customers and services for their consumer credit and telco and utilities exchanges, which is a huge milestone. Along with EWS, the work number exchange, which we completed migrating to the Equifax Cloud over two years ago, we now have our three largest data exchanges in the new Equifax Cloud. As of the end of September, we have about 80% of Equifax revenue in the Equifax Cloud and expect to approach 90% of our revenue in the Equifax Cloud by year-end. The cloud migrations have been a huge effort across Equifax over the past four plus years, requiring a ton of focus by the entire Equifax team. We expect to have a significant competitive advantage as we fully deploy our new cloud capabilities and pivot from building to leveraging the cloud in 2025 and beyond that will allow us to fully focus on customers' growth, innovation, new products and AI. Leaving the USIS consumer and telco and utility migrations to the Equifax Cloud allowed us to begin decommissioning legacy on-prem systems and software in USIS in the third quarter supporting our goal of cloud spending reductions in 2024, which expand our operating margins and are lowering the capital intensity of our businesses -- our business in 2025 and beyond. In the third quarter, we also made substantial progress in our international technology transformation activities with Canada completing migration of all customers off of their consumer and commercial credit exchanges onto the new EFX Cloud Data Fabric. This is another big accomplishment for the international team with cloud migrations in Argentina, Chile and the Dominican Republic completed earlier in the year, adding to Canada's completion a few weeks ago. Our international cloud migration efforts will continue in '25 and '26, resulting in additional cloud savings as those migrations are completed. It is energizing to be approaching the finish line of our cloud transformation. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivoted from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. Turning to Slide 4. We had a strong third quarter with reported revenue of $1.42 billion, up 9% and at the top end of our July guidance. With organic constant dollar revenue up 10%, which is at the top end of our long-term growth framework. Adjusted EBITDA margins at just under 33% were in line with our expectations and adjusted EPS of $1.85 per share was the top end of our July guidance. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represent about 80% of total revenue in the quarter had strong 10% constant currency revenue growth which was in line with our expectations. Non-mortgage organic constant currency revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. The strong non-mortgage performance was driven by 9% growth in EWS and with very strong 19% non-mortgage growth in EWS Verifier, led by very strong 29% growth in government and talent that was up over 9% in EWS. USIS non-mortgage revenue growth of almost 5% was stronger than our expectations, principally from our consumer business and financial marketing services, our off-line batch business. International delivered just under 18% constant dollar revenue growth and strong 12% organic growth, led by continued strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 17% in the quarter and above our July guidance. U.S. mortgage revenue was 20% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. In late September, as mortgage rates declined to just over 6%, we saw modest mortgage inquiry activity increases. We believe this improvement was likely led by mortgage refi activity off the lower mortgage rates. New home purchase activity appears to have remained at the lower levels we've been seeing throughout 2024, reflecting continued low home inventory levels elevated home prices impacting affordability and prospective homebuyers waiting for further mortgage rate reductions. As mortgage rates increased in early October to over 6.6%, we have seen mortgage activity reduced to levels closer to what we saw in July and August. John will cover our expectations for mortgage activity in the fourth quarter shortly, but we continue to believe that activity will improve towards 2015 and 2019 levels as mortgage rates come down in the future. In the third quarter, the growth in mortgage revenue was driven principally by USIS where mortgage revenue was up a strong 36% and slightly above our expectations. This strong growth was again driven by the benefit of strong vendor pricing actions and the performance of our new mortgage pre-qual products. The lower mortgage rates we saw in late September did drive a small increase in mortgage application activity, which benefited USIS in the quarter. EWS mortgage revenue returned to growth with revenue up 4% and was also slightly better than our expectations. As a reminder, EWS mortgage inquiry volumes lagged USIS credit inventory volumes as credit is pulled earlier in the mortgage application cycle than income and employment, which is typically pulled in the middle and of course, the closing of the mortgage application. USIS typically sees the benefits of mortgage shopping behavior earlier and to a greater extent than EWS. As a result, EWS did not see the same level of incremental inquiry volume as USIS did from the slight increase in mortgage activity that occurred in late September. EWS mortgage revenue exceeded twin inquiry volume by about 9.5% in the quarter, up a very strong 300 basis points sequentially from second quarter, principally from strong twin record growth. Equifax had another strong quarter of new product innovation with a VI or Vitality Index of 13%, above our 10% guidance for the year and our long-term framework of 10% Vitality. We saw strong broad based new product rollouts with double-digit growth in EWS and International and a VI of 9% in USIS, which was up 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. We expect our NPI revenue to grow -- revenue growth to remain strong and are increasing our 2024 Vitality Index guidance to 11%, up 100 basis points from our prior framework for 2024, as we further leverage our new EFX Cloud capabilities in EFX.AI to drive new products into the marketplace. Turning to Slide 5. Workforce Solutions revenue was up about 7.5% and slightly below our July guidance, principally due to lower-than-expected employer services revenue. Non-mortgage verification services revenue, again, delivered very strong 19% growth, which was in line with our expectations. Government had another outstanding quarter with very strong 29% revenue growth from continued penetration in their large $5 billion government TAM. Government revenue grew sequentially from strong growth in state penetration and insights incarceration data solutions. We expect continued strong sequential growth -- sequential government revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. Growth rates in the fourth quarter are expected to continue to show strong double-digit performance, but will be lower than third quarter levels, principally due to comping against very strong growth we saw last year. We expect our government vertical to continue to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the future and outgrow both Equifax and EWS. Talent Solutions revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter. Talent Solutions continues to benefit from their new total verified data hub, which includes trended employment data as well as insights incarceration, education and licensing and credentialing data. Based on data through August, EWS Talent Solutions outperformed the BLS white-collar hiring markets by approximately 18 percentage points from additions of records, the rollouts of new products and penetration into the talent vertical during the quarter. We did see somewhat weaker volumes late in September, which we have assumed will continue and is expected to impact talent revenue growth in the fourth quarter. EWS mortgage revenue was up 4% in the quarter and slightly better than our July guidance. Twin inquiries in the third quarter were down about 5.5% and slightly better than our July guidance. Total EWS mortgage revenue outperformed Twin inquiries by about 9.5% and again over 300 points sequentially from strong record growth during the quarter. We expect strong growth in twin records to benefit mortgage and our other EWS verticals again in the fourth quarter. EWS consumer lending revenue was up 16% from strong double-digit growth in P loans and high single-digit growth in debt management and auto. Employer Services revenue was down 19% in the quarter and weaker than we expected. Compared to last year, employer declined principally from lower ERC revenues and to a lesser extent, lower I-9 and onboarding revenues as the slower white-collar hiring we saw in late September impacting talent solutions also impacted our onboarding business. There was also some onetime post-COVID related project revenue that benefited onboarding in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter I-9 and onboarding revenue was consistent with the first and second quarters, and we expect fourth quarter employer revenue to be down mid-single digits as the ERC comparisons mitigate. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 51.6% and were slightly above our expectations and continued to be very strong, reflecting strong Verifier revenue growth and continued strong cost controls. Turning to Slide 6. The EWS government team continued their very strong performance in the quarter with revenue up 29%. The government team continued to focus on penetration of our unique VOI and VOE solutions for social services at both the federal level and across the state agencies. In the quarter, the EWS government team signed an extension to their SSA redetermination contract to provide income and employment data for individuals applying for or currently receiving social security disability income and supplemental security income benefits with a potential contract value of about $500 million over the next five years. EWS services support program integrity for the SSA as well as reducing the administrative burden for consumers seeking these important services. Chad and the government team are on offense driving penetration in the big $5 billion government TAM. Turning to Slide 7. EWS had another outstanding quarter of new record additions. A few weeks ago, we announced a new strategic partnership with Workday to provide verification services to Workday's large customer base. Later in the fourth quarter, we'll begin rolling out the free value-added EWS income and employment verification services to Workday's U.S. customers and expect to onboard a sizable number of new records through 2025 from this new strategic relationship. Also in the quarter, we signed agreements with five additional new strategic partners that will contribute over 5 million records collectively to the twin database in the future. Through September, EWS has executed 12 strategic partnerships during 2024 and since the beginning of 2021, EWS has completed 45 strategic partnership agreements. We expect these five new partnerships signed during the quarter to come online and begin generating revenue late in the fourth quarter and substantially in the early parts of 2025. In the third quarter, EWS added 2 million active records to the twin database, ending the quarter with $182 million active records, up a strong 12% on 134 million unique individuals. EWS now has 3.8 million companies contributing income and employment records to the twin database every pay period, a very strong 40% CAGR since 2020. Total records are now over $700 million and up 11% in the quarter, supporting our trended or historical solutions with about half of Verifier revenue from products, including historical records. At 134 million unique active records, we have plenty of room to grow the twin database towards the TAM of 225 million income producing Americans. Turning to Slide 8. USIS achieved a major milestone in the third quarter, completing the migration to the new Equifax Data Cloud Fabric of both the U.S. consumer credit and our cell phone utility databases. This big milestone makes U.S. consumer credit, telco and utility data fully available across our new data fabric for use in advanced AI based solutions to enhance our identity and fraud solutions and to accelerate our only Equifax solutions leveraging both EWS and USIS data assets. It also allows our U.S. commercial product and technology teams to fully shift their focus to delivering these new advanced Equifax solutions to customers that will drive new product rollouts and top line growth for Equifax. USIS revenue was up 12% in the quarter and well above the July guidance of up 8.5% and their long-term revenue growth framework of 6% to 8%, despite the continuation of some weakness in the FI and auto end markets. This was driven by both strong performance in non-mortgage revenue as well as stronger mortgage revenue, reflecting the slight increase in mortgage activity that we saw in late September. Total non-mortgage revenue was up 5% in the quarter and was also well above our July guidance of over 2% growth for USIS. We saw strong double-digit growth in Consumer Solutions and Financial Marketing Services which were offset by a less than 1% decline in USIS B2B online revenue from softer consumer and end market demand, which importantly was up about 300 basis points sequentially. We USIS B2B online saw double-digit growth in insurance and commercial, high single-digit growth in telco and low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in banking and auto offset by declines in third-party bureau sales and identity and fraud. We expect third-party bureau sales to be about flat in the fourth quarter as we lap the weakness that started in late 2023. Identity and Fraud revenue was also down and weaker than our expectations, principally due to weakness in chargeback management volumes. Payment and transactional identity revenue grew in the quarter from penetration in large strategic accounts identity and fraud is starting to launch their new Kount 360 solutions platform and products, which will help strengthen growth in 2025, as these solutions take hold in the marketplace. Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business was up a very strong 14% in the quarter, reflecting substantial new wins and customer expansion across banking services and payments verticals and as well as continued strong growth in prescreen marketing and our unique IXI wealth data. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 17%, and from strong double-digit growth in our consumer direct channel and from strong customer acquisition trends. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow mid-single-digits as we start comping against very strong D2C growth last year. USIS mortgage revenue was up a very strong 36% and better than our July guidance. Mortgage credit inquiries were up 1% and were also better than our July guidance of down 7%, principally due to the slight increase in mortgage activity that we saw in late September. This was the first quarter of mortgage credit inquiry growth since the first quarter of 2021, which is a big milestone and reinforces for us that the mortgage market is clearly bottomed and poised for recovery in the future. Consistent with the first half, the strong pricing environment along with the strength in our new mortgage pre-qual products also drove the very strong mortgage revenue growth. At $137 million, mortgage revenue was just under 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 33.9% in the quarter, up 70 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations from higher-than-expected revenue growth, offset by higher technology costs to complete cloud customer migration activities. With the USIS consumer and our cell phone utility and data cloud transformation is complete, Chad and the USIS team are clearly focused on offense and growth. Turning to Slide 9. International revenue was a very strong 18% in constant currency and up a strong 12% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BVS due to continued very strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Europe local currency revenue was up a very strong 9% in the quarter with continued strong 7% growth in our credit and data businesses and 12% growth in our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue was up 58%, principally due to the acquisition of Boa Vista with very strong organic growth of 31%, led by 28% Vitality Index from new products in the region during the quarter. And as a reminder, we closed the BVS acquisition in August last year. Canada delivered 1% growth in the quarter, which was below our expectations from a softer economy. I previously mentioned that Canada completed their consumer and commercial credit exchange customer migrations to data fabric a few weeks ago. And similar to the U.S., we expect to see accelerating NPI and revenue growth going forward from the Canadian team. Asia-Pacific revenue returned to growth up 2% as expected. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.7% and were up 210 basis points sequentially from strong revenue growth and good cost execution. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to make very strong progress driving innovation with 30 new products launched in the quarter that delivered a 13% vitality from broad based performances across all of our business units. EWS had very strong third quarter with Vitality Index of 16%, expanding solutions in the government vertical as well as incorporating incarceration education into new talent solutions products. USIS saw continued sequential improvement with a Vitality Index of 9%, up 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. We expect USIS to continue to show strong vitality improvement from the cloud completion as they leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation in new products as well as free up their product and technology resources that previously were working on cloud transformation in key verticals such as identity and fraud, commercial and our new mortgage pre-qual products. International also had strong 11% vitality in the quarter with a strong focus on identity and fraud solutions. We expect strong double-digit vitality in the fourth quarter, leveraging our Equifax Cloud capability to drive new product rollouts and we're raising our full year Vitality Index guidance from 10% to about 11%, reflecting the strong innovation performance across all our businesses so far in 2024. AI and ML are changing the way we develop our new products in our single data fabric and build higher performing model scores and products for our customers. We are accelerating the pace at which we are developing new EFX models and scores using our advanced AI and ML capabilities in areas such as identity and fraud and consumer loan affordability, it will drive higher performance and predictability. In the quarter, 100% of our new models and scores were built using Equifax AI and machine learning, which is up from about 89% last quarter and ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. We're clearly on offense deploying our proprietary EFX AI capabilities that will drive higher performing model scores and products for our customers. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and to provide our fourth quarter framework. Our fourth quarter guidance builds on our strong third quarter performance from new products, penetration, record growth and pricing. Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 15. An important part of our long-term financial framework is delivering strong free cash flow and returning cash to shareholders. We're adding a new cash conversion goal for our long-term framework of 95% or greater, with cash conversion defined as free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income. During the cloud technology transformation over the last four years, we saw elevated cloud capital expenditures which impacted our free cash flow and cash conversion. Our cash conversion ratio is expected to improve significantly in 2024 to about 80% and as we reduce CapEx and drive higher relative levels of free cash flow. We expect our free cash flow to accelerate in 2025 post our cloud investments as CapEx reduces to 6% to 7% of revenue, supporting cash conversion of over 95%, while strong margin expansion and growth in net income from our underlying operating leverage and cloud cost savings. This strong cash generation positions Equifax to continue to invest in growth with CapEx and bolt-on M&A and begin returning excess free cash flow to shareholders from dividend growth and share repurchases in 2025 and beyond. It's energizing to be approaching this important milestone for our investors as we complete the new Equifax Cloud. Turning to Slide 16. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax Cloud differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric leveraging Equifax.AI and machine learning and market leading businesses will deliver higher revenue growth, expanded margins and accelerating free cash flow. In the middle of Slide 16, we've added the new cash conversion metric to our long-term growth framework. And our long-term growth framework, as you know, is made up of strong revenue growth of 7% to 10% and is led by very strong 13% -- 15% EWS revenue growth. EWS is clearly our largest and fastest-growing business led by strong double-digit non-mortgage verification services revenue growth from our government and talent solutions verticals. As a part of our long-term financial framework, we expect to add 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A aligned around strengthening the core of Equifax. Our bolt-on M&A strategy will continue to be focused on strengthening Workforce Solutions adding differentiated data assets across Equifax and growing in the big $20 billion identity and fraud space. As John covered a few minutes ago, the pace of mortgage market recovery will add to our revenue growth as the market returns to normal 2015 to 2019 levels in 2025 and beyond. The mortgage market recovery will also drive our margins and free cash flow from the very high incremental margins from this incremental revenue that we expect to come into Equifax's P&L in 2025 and beyond. We expect operating leverage off our strong 8% to 12% revenue growth to generate 50 basis points of annual EBITDA margin expansion and very strong cash conversion of 95% and above. As margins improve, CapEx declined to 6% to 7% of revenue with the completion of the Equifax Cloud transformation and leverage continues to progress towards 2.5 turns by year-end. We expect our free cash flow to accelerate and that will enable us to start returning cash to shareholders in 2025 and beyond through growing the dividend in a multiyear share buyback program. We are energized to be pivoting from building the Equifax Cloud over the past four years to leveraging our new industry leading cloud and EFX.AI capabilities to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow. Wrapping up on Slide 17. Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 11% constant dollar revenue growth, which was at the upper end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework work, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model, strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities, the resiliency of the U.S. consumer and the strength of our customers. Our very strong 19% EWS non-mortgage Verifier revenue growth, 12% EWS active record growth, strong 13% broad based Vitality Index give us momentum as we enter the fourth quarter and move towards 2025. And as we talked earlier, we took another big step in the quarter towards cloud completion with 80% of our revenue now in the Equifax Cloud, which will enhance our competitiveness, drive innovation and new product development. Entering 2025 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud is a really big milestone, so the team can move towards fully focusing on innovation, new products powered by EFX.AI, customers and growth. I'm energized now more than ever about the future of the new Equifax that will deliver strong 8% to 12% revenue growth, 50 basis points of margin expansion lower capital intensity and expanding free cash flow to invest in Equifax and add bolt-on M&A. And in the future, growing our dividend and positioning to start a multiyear stock buyback program in 2025 and beyond. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes, Manav. So there's no change in our philosophy. Our goal is to be super transparent with you and our investors about what we're seeing in the marketplace and what the growth levers are and where we're taking the company. We work to provide guidance that we know how to meet and beat. That's our -- no change in that goal. I've been here six years. And I think as you point out the mortgage decline in '22 and '23 was really quite unusual. But if you look around that, I think we've been pretty consistent about meeting and beating. And if you look through our non-mortgage performance during that '22 and '23 time frame, we think we were pretty consistent. With regards to the third quarter, I think -- I don't think that's your question. I think it's more around the fourth quarter. And we highlighted in our earlier comments that there is some volatility in the marketplace that we're certainly dealing with in some of our verticals. We're really pleased with our third quarter performance. We're pleased with the guidance that we have for the fourth quarter, which is super strong. And as you point out, it's slightly below the guidance that we had last quarter. principally from the EWS employer business. I think we've talked for the last couple of quarters about the impact of the employee retention credits that were really stopped by the IRS earlier this year. We thought there'd be some activity there. There's none. So that's obviously impacting that business inside of Workforce Solutions. And then we also talked over the last couple of quarters about the change the federal government made around work opportunity tax credit and the state's response to getting that in place, we thought the states would be responding a little bit quicker. They haven't, which is pushing some of that revenue likely out of the fourth quarter and into 2025, it's not going to go away. And then to a lesser degree, I think we talked about -- I won't touch mortgage because I don't think that's your point. I'll touch non-mortgage. We talked about some of the slowdowns we saw the background screeners late in September. That was unexpected on our part. I think you've seen a number of corporations across the United States announcing layoffs, whether Boeing is 10% or companies like that. But I think coming into the election, it feels like companies are being a little more prudent about new hiring which is we saw in the background screening volumes late in the month. These are, from my perspective, fairly small impacts when you look at the strong performance in the third quarter and the strong guide we have for the fourth quarter, as John pointed out, in the fourth quarter, we're going to be in the neighborhood of $500 million EBITDA and over $2 a share, which we've never done before. So I think that's strong performance earlier in the year. I think some questioned our ability to deliver the kind of performance we've laid out in the fourth quarter, both from a top line and a margin expansion. I think we're in that direction, admittedly a bit below that but still very, very strong numbers. But just really to the point of your question, no change in our philosophy. We want to put out numbers that are super transparent. We're going to give you what's behind those numbers. And our goal is to have numbers that we can meet and beat. And that has never changed and it won't change in the future. Yes. it's a great question. We talked about in the last quarter, we did this much on this call, but it's obvious that USIS was clearly impacted in '23 and in the -- really through the third quarter in many regards around all the effort they had to put in the cloud transformation. Canada is in the same boat. These are big, big projects, very intrusive with our customers. The good news is it's done. What we're really encouraged by when we think about USIS, even with that in the second quarter and third quarter, you saw their vitality go up, meaning they were able to start taking advantage of being in the cloud to start moving forward on innovation in new products. That's going to benefit USIS in the fourth quarter, but really principally in 2025. And as you know, they increased their vitality in the second quarter, 100 bps and then again in the third quarter, 100 bps. So we would expect them to move towards that 10% vitality as we get into 2025 and which is really going to be a positive. The cost savings, John already talked about, you saw the charge we took that was expected. That's -- we're executing that, and that's a real positive for our margins, which we've committed to and we're executing on. And the other benefit is two other benefits actually, we'll start to see now that they're in the cloud, as those share gains that we expect to have, we have the close in flight. Those will start showing up in the P&L, some in the fourth quarter, but I think principally in 2025 of being always on and being a cloud-native provider. And then the last one is one that we'll talk more about in February during our fourth quarter call and in 2025 is what we're internally calling only Equifax initiative where we're focused on solutions that combine TWM, our income and employment data with the credit file to make our credit file more valuable. When we talked on the last call about new solutions that we're piloting in the marketplace as we speak around a flag on our credit file that someone's working for mortgage shopping to make our mortgage shopping credit file never valuable, a flag on our auto credit file, same thing that someone is working. That will differentiate our credit file. We think it will drive share gains with our credit file. It should make our credit file more valuable. And I think as you know, we're also adding to our credit file solutions, including our differentiated data from DataX, Teletrack and NCTUE, our cell phone utility data. And these are all solutions only Equifax can do. Our competitors don't have these data assets, so we can strengthen the underlying credit file, which arguably can be commoditized in some solutions and make our product more differentiated. Those are the things that you're going to see going forward. It's what we've been talking about for four years. The good news is now is we can actually execute on it because we're in the cloud with USIS. And I can't really reinforce enough about the impact of the distraction. You could say over the last four years, but your question is around USIS really over the last 18 months, 24 months, of all the efforts that went into complete is really massive technology transformation. The good news is it's done. So that whole team now can take all their energy and effort it was balanced between growing the company, rolling out new products, executing our AI solutions and doing the cloud migrations to just focus on growth. And that gives us a lot of energy as we look to the fourth quarter and then as we move into 2025. Yes. So maybe a couple of points on that. I'll respond to your specific Workday question, but maybe just make it a little bit wider because Workday is one of many partners we added during the quarter. I think we added a total of six in the quarter. Workday, obviously, a very significant one, a very strategic partnership, but all six of them are. I think we sized that we expect from the other $5 million to something like 5 million records coming on over the coming quarters. It takes time to make those integrations. They're super complex for really our partners side. You've seen very record growth. We're up 12% in the quarter. So you can see that we're executing. We talked about the sizable number of partners we added this year as well as last year and over the last couple of years. And with every partner we have is they add new clients and they're all growing their business every quarter, if you think about an HR software company or payroll processor, when those new clients come on board, they're typically boarded to TWN. So there's growth that's happening with one of our clients. Most of our clients have records going back to clients we added even two, three, four years ago that we haven't fully deployed into Equifax, meaning we're working with them through their technologies through the different databases they have, they're typically not a single tech stack to bring those records in. So we have a lot of opportunity both with current new partners use Workday and the others we added this quarter as well as those we've had over the last couple of three years to add records. And Workday specifically, we haven't sized that except to say it's sizable. I think it's well known that they're a very big company and a big partner, and we're super excited to have that move on board. We expect some records to come on in the fourth quarter, but really the substantial growth from Workday and the other partners we added in the third quarter and those that we expect to add in the fourth quarter to come on in 2020. And I think the other point to remind everyone on the call about, as you know, we talk -- tend to talk a lot about our partner record additions, but we also have a very sizable direct record approach where our employer business is adding new clients. And when we bring those new clients on, we offer that free value added evasive income and employment verification and those become records that become a part of Equifax. And one last reminder, and I think you're seeing the benefits of that in December last year, we changed the organize in EWS. So we have one leader and one team that is solely focused on record additions from HR software companies from payroll processors for 1,099 records and pension records, so really the whole gamut. So we've got a very large focus because you're seeing that pay off. We're really pleased that record additions to 12% are way outgrowing our long-term framework for record additions, which are more in the single-digit range is admittedly, we've been doing that for five plus years. So we've had a lot of really positive momentum there. And I think you know the power of adding a record. The day we add a record, we monetize it across all of our verticals because we're already getting inquiries for that record because our customers send us every query. And then the breadth of our ability to monetize is just scale so substantially from even three, four, five years ago when you go across the spectrum from, call it, higher income consumers, mid-market consumers that are doing mortgages and through auto and auto and P loans and cards and then go to the other end of the spectrum, those that are going after social services at the federal and state level is a very -- there's over 100 million people a year that are getting social services and we've got a big opportunity to grow there. You've seen the growth in Workforce Solutions government vertical that's been, obviously, impacted positively by record additions. So records are a big focus of ours, and we see a lot of momentum going forward. We still have a lot of records to go after with the 225 million working Americans, there's close to 100 million of records we don't have yet. So that's why we added resources and people to keep growing this valuable data set. Yes, it's really the value of the data set. When you think about consumer lending and I'll use P loans, you could use auto, the value of someone's credit score is super important. It's really, as you know, is a reflection of their past payment behavior of other loans they have and it's really a prediction where they keep paying going forward. So very valuable. When you add to that someone's ability to pay, which means their income and their employment, meaning they're working. Because remember, if you pull a credit report, you have no idea if that individual is actually working today. Did they lose their job last week? Did they retire? What's changing? So the combination of income in employment from EWS with the credit file is very, very valuable. And we have increasing numbers of our customers. As you point out, we roll out new products as well as we drive penetration of customers understanding the value of pulling the credit report with income and employment, they can approve more consumers and approve more consumers with lower loss rates. So that's a really strong combination and very positive for our customers. So that's what we're really seeing in the outgrowth of the underlying market. As you point out, there is in some of those verticals, some end user, meaning consumer demand pressures primarily because of higher APRs, particularly in bigger ticket transactions, think about P loans or cards, we have a solution between -- by combining credit with income and employment that allows our customers to approve more of those applicants with a higher degree of confidence around their ability to repay the loan when you add the income and employment data to it. Yes, that really assumes historical averages in that 2015 to '19 level. As you know, purchase is generally a very large part of the underlying market and it was in that 2015 to '19 level. That's super depressed now. As we pointed out, there's a lack of inventory. People are sitting on those lower interest rate loans and not upgrading from the condo to the three bedroom home with the yard that should. We believe that's going to loosen up and there'll be more activity on the purchase side. And then we should see both a combination of rate refi and cash-out refis as rates come down. We saw just that blip, I would call it, for a couple of weeks until the 10-year went up, where I think John mentioned in his comments that the bulk of that increase was rate refi. So you can see just a very small think about 20, 25, 30 basis points change, some consumers that had taken out mortgages, say, a year or two years ago, at higher rates, and now are looking at picking up that rate arbitrage. So there's clearly pent-up demand that as rates come down, gives us still a lot of confidence in the framework of that $1.1 billion plus of kind of tailwind in the mortgage market. And I think as John said in his comments, just as a reminder, we'll reset that number in February next year, but the $1.1 billion is based off today's pricing, meaning 2024, \u201824 product mix, \u201824 record hit rates. That will be a higher number likely when we get to 2025 and kind of reset what that opportunity is going forward in 25, 26, 27 as the market moves back with rate declines. Yes, it's really early for that. We're not providing any '25 guidance. We tried to give you some kind of what we're seeing that we would expect to happen where we maybe have some confidence in it for next year. But I think it's too early on that. Just as a reminder, we will be doing increases on January 1. And we'll give some visibility to that when we have our February call and we laid out a framework for 2025, but you should expect price increases for EWS and from USIS as we've done over the last number of years. We think that there's a lot of value in the solutions we deliver. And you should expect and we plan to increase prices. I think we're trying not to give any framework on what the level of pricing is, but just reinforcing that there will be price increases as this customary in our industry, given the value of the data we have. And we'll give you real clarity on that when we get to February and our 2025 guidance. That's a tough one. As you know, we've never -- I'll say it in our lifetime, maybe it's a little shorter than that. But we haven't seen in 20 years a rate increase at this pace and at this level ever. So the shock of the where mortgage rates have gone from the, call it, super low levels during COVID timeframe to where they are today is unprecedented. So I think it's hard to correlate that back. I think what we saw in late August is just a great indicator of even a very small change in rates down, stimulated the market. In this case, our view principally in refi but there's clearly some purchase activity. There's purchase activity even at these higher rates. People are buying homes at either variable or a 30 year fix rates. It's just that there isn't a lot of inventory. The real question, I think, is when will it stimulate those that are, call it, 3% or 4% mortgages that want to upgrade to a larger home. That's a normal part of the housing economy. And when -- how -- what's the gap have to be from where they are today at call it 3% to 4% versus 6% plus, is it 50 bps? Is it 100 bps? It's clearly lower. And I think we'll see that as it goes forward, we'll be super transparent with you. But I think you should be encouraged that when rates come down, the market responds pretty quickly, which we saw in late September, yes. Yes. And no change to how we've communicated since I've been here. We've always been working towards a goal to return cash to shareholders. And as you know, the last four, five years, we've invested really substantial parts of our excess free cash flow in CapEx with the cloud transformation, we're getting at the finish line on that. So that's really good news. And our CapEx is going to come down meaningfully, which will free up more cash for available to return to shareholders. We've also, as you know, as a part of our long-term framework, plan to continue a bolt-on M&A strategy, very disciplined on the financial returns and very disciplined around the strategic swim lanes that we're focused on, whether it's differentiated data, strengthening EWS or growing in identity and fraud. And I think as you know, we've done a sizable amount of bolt-on acquisitions, while we were doing the cloud. And we would expect to continue to do those bolt-ons. Most recently, we did Boa Vista last August. We're continuing to build a pipeline of strategic and financially attractive acquisitions, but we try to frame for you that we would expect over the long term to have 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from that bolt-on M&A. So you think about 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually, that's $50 million to $100 million, Boa Vista delivered north of that. But in that kind of a range, and if you think about the cash required for buying the kind of companies that would be financially attractive to us that fit that $50 million to $100 million of revenue, obviously, at attractive margins and returns that's somewhere in the $500 million a year roughly of capital or cash bolt-on M&A. And your model, I'm sure looks like ours, when we get into 25,26, 27 our free cash flow really accelerates well in excess of what we would use for CapEx. It's 6% to 7%, that's south of $500 million. if you think about $500 million on the average, some years, it will be lower. Some years, it might be a bit higher on bolt-on M&A, there's substantial excess free cash flow to grow the dividend and buyback -- we've talked on the last call and we've talked, I think, on most of our earnings calls and when we're out with investors, when we think about returning cash to shareholders, we believe growing the dividend in a consistent way is a great way to return cash to shareholders and very disciplined. We frame that and this isn't -- we haven't made decisions, but we framed that in the direction of growing the dividend in line with our earnings growth. I think that's where we're working towards at the right time to do that. And then the excess free cash flow, which is meaningful, we would do in a buyback. And we'd be in the market kind of every day with that and use the buyback as another mechanism to return cash to shareholders. This has been our strategy since I joined Equifax is to complete the cloud transformation. We're getting towards that stage at 80% now and 90% by year-end and then bring CapEx down, bring our margins up off of the strong revenue growth rate we had that excess free cash flow to return to shareholders. And I think you caught in our comments earlier this morning, we shared with investors that we've added to our long-term framework structure, which is how we run the company and how we measure our teams a cash conversion metric. That's always been in our plan to do that. We thought it was the right time now to put that into our long-term framework. And I think it shows to you the discipline that we're going to have in running the company to generate that excess free cash flow to invest in Equifax, but as importantly to return cash to shareholders. And we look forward to getting to the stage to do that as we move into 2020. Yes, that's a tough one. We've worked hard to try to model that. It's just so unprecedented what's happened in the last three years with rates we've never seen it before. And we've picked you can agree or disagree with what we've been using, but we pick 2015 to '19 as being a normal level. But if you go back like a decade, go back the last time there was really a kind of an unusual mortgage environment was '07, '08, '09 during the global financial crisis, and that was more an underwriting crisis from a consumer mortgage standpoint versus a rate on. And I think it's just -- it's been very consistent. There's just so much scale in the United States of consumers that want to move from an apartment to that first condo that apartment to a home. They want to upgrade their home and then there's a flip side when consumers age out and they start retiring, they sell their big home, they buy a smaller home on the mortgages with all that. So it's just such a large market, and we've never seen a 50% decline. So we've tried to just lay out that's the anomaly in the market. Our view is that as rates come down, we'll move into that $1.2 billion of market opportunity, as we pointed out, will be a larger number next year. And we're just convinced that it's going to happen over time, which will be additive to our P&L and our framework. In our long-term framework, of 8% to 12% revenue growth, we really just have GDP in there. And think about a couple of points of market expansion underlies our 8% to 12%. And we've also been very clear that there's going to be very high incremental margins as that mortgage market comes back, meaning we're not going to reinvest those dollars in more people. We have the right cost structure in Equifax today grow our business and really to make the right investments. So as that market tailwind flows into our P&L, we would expect it to be incremental, which obviously will drive our top line but also our margins and our free cash flow and give us more free cash to return to shareholders. John can jump in on that. Equifax quite small, but in the employer vertical, it was a large number and now it's going down to nothing. Yes, it's a great question. Thanks for bringing it up. A 29% growth, you're the first analysts to bring up that vertical. So we appreciate that. And as a reminder, government is moving to be our largest vertical in Workforce Solutions. And as you know, you've got that large $5 billion TAM against around a little bit, roughly an $800 million run rate business now. I wouldn't think about specific services. I'd really think about the TAM itself and the biggest opportunity in the TAM is penetration at the states and the state agencies. An agency deploys typically not a state. And if you think about, call it, $800 million versus $5 billion that $4 billion plus of potential revenue for us in the government vertical, are social service verifications that are still being done manually. So that's really the focus. We've been adding resources and people. We're investing in new products and technology to enable our ability to penetrate those states. There's -- when you meet with a director of an agency at a state there's -- they all want to use it because it's accurate. It adds productivity to them. They're always challenged with how do we deliver the specific services, whether it's food stamps or health support how do we deliver that more quickly. And as you know, the federal government that pays for the bulk of those social services requires the states to verify eligibility. And that's where we come in, eligibility is around income and verifying the source of that income, which is the employment. So for us, the big opportunity is really at the state level. As you now know, we have some large federal contracts. Last year, we extended our CMS contract, which was a big $1 billion plus contract extension. We announced \u2013 we shared in this call that we just extended our SSA contract, which is $500 million over five years. So you see the scale of those federal contracts. But the opportunity to continue to drive that strong double-digit growth in government going forward is really penetration in the states. That's the bulk of that $4 billion untapped TAM. And as I said, more people more feet on the street. We have Equifax people, Workforce Solutions people that live at the state capitals that work with each of those agencies. We're working with partners. We're adding on new products. As you know, we have more data now incarceration data from our APRs Insights acquisitions is used in that vertical. We're working to put those data elements together in a single transaction. Today, they're all delivered individually. So there's just a lot of opportunities and the scale of the workforce allows us to invest in that. And I think as we said, in many calls that we expect the government vertical over the long-term to outgrow the 13% to 15% growth in Workforce Solutions. We just think there's so much opportunity for us because of the value it delivers at all of the agencies at the state level. And I think as you saw, we expected that to happen. We told you in July, we thought it would happen, but you saw the outperformance from record growth that really moved up positively in EWS. So that's -- we were pleased with that. Yes. I think we -- what we heard from the background screening customer base that we have is that they saw some slowdowns kind of in mid late September in white-collar. Even though we had a good quarter, there were some slowdowns there. So we took that run rate rolling forward. And I think you've seen enough layoffs over the last announcements over the last month or two from different companies that perhaps tightening up, you're waiting to see where the election goes and what's going to happen in Washington. So I don't think it's anything different than that, John. We actually don't. If you go back to really in history, there's always been more mortgage pulls for the credit file than income and employment. On average, we get five plus credit file polls, a closed loan, where there's two to three income and employment pulls per closed loan. So that hasn't changed. We don't expect that to change. What did change as rates went up, was there was a consumer behavior of just more shopping to try to find another 25 bps off on the loan, meaning they're going to multiple mortgage originators for either their refi or for their purchase loan and every time they go to a different originator, there's a credit file fold. That's a shopping process because the originator wants to figure out is someone that has the credit score that would support the kind of loan they're going to pull. They typically don't pull income and employment there. Now we're trying to innovate to help that shopping process. And I think you heard us talk earlier on this call in July also. That we're piloting in the marketplace in Equifax credit file with an income and employment flag on it to really indicate that this consumer not only has this credit score, but they also are working today, you don't know that in the shopping process if you're an originator. We think that should advantage our credit file, which should drive some credit file share. And in the shopping process, where three credit reports are universally pulled in the application process in shopping, many originators pull three, some pull two, simple one. So we want to differentiate ourselves in the shopping process on the credit file side. But no, we don't expect them to converge. And as John said earlier, I think on an earlier question, they've been fairly consistent in '24 and '23. Yes, you don't have to wonder about that. Go ahead, John, and I'll jump into. Yes, Jeff, no change in how we do it. We always do it through like early this week, right? So we're kind of in the mid-October. So this is no change from last quarter to the quarter before that, whether it's mortgage or any other parts of our business. But to your point, mortgage or in this case, we saw the hiring impact late in September that continued in October, same with the impact of mortgage. So we try to use the most current run rates we typically use the last -- we'll look at how is it the last week. How is it the last two weeks, how is it the last three weeks, four weeks, something like that and try to see where are those trends? Is it stronger in the last week than the last weeks. Is it weaker in the last week and try to put that together and use our best estimate around where that -- we think that trend is and use that for the current quarter guidance. That's no change, right? John. Yes. John, you can jump in, too. So the commercial vertical is our small business -- data business that is had -- if you look at '22 and '23, actually '21, '22 and '23, that business was up very strong, high singles and for many quarters, double digit. We had some execution issues earlier this year, but it's not back to that similar levels, which we're really pleased with. We would expect that business to grow at the high end of the USIS 6 to 8 range over the long term because of the unique data that we have. And remember, we made the PayNet acquisition with the leasing trade lines. We're onboarding now merchant data to enhance the picture around small businesses and obviously bringing in the entrepreneur from our consumer data set. So we think that's a business that will continue to have positive growth going forward, and we're pleased to see it back in that range where we expect it to be. Yes. We talked earlier, you're seeing already some of the impacts of the cloud transformation. If you go back, our long-term framework for Vitality is 10%. We increased it from 5 to 7 pre-cloud. We've been delivering north of that 10% for the last couple of years, including in 2020 4. As you know, we increased the guide for this year. And we think that's directly attributable to our cloud investments, the benefits from the cloud investments are focused on innovation products as well as our focus on AI. So that innovation, we think, is a very good metric around the benefits of cloud. We think we'll also see share gains in USIS in some of our international markets as we complete the cloud and deliver always on stability and move into either secondary or primary positions when we're below that today. So that should get into the P&L. And specifically, I think maybe your question is around USIS since we talked about the USIS cloud completion. We would expect their vitality, which has been increasing this year from 8% in third quarter -- second quarter into 9% and the third, you had to move towards that $10 million. And we would expect to allow them to deliver solidly inside of that 6% to 8% long-term framework going forward. Yes. That's a -- there's a lot of them. I guess you're asking me to tell you something we're excited. But I think broadly, you should be excited and we are too about vitality. International vitality is still below 10%, but I think it was 9% in the quarter. So very, very strong. We would expect them to move towards that trend, as they complete cloud like in Canada in some of the other markets. So that's a real positive. We've got some identity solutions in the marketplace internationally and in the U.S. that we're excited about, some new solutions using alternative data that it has real traction that adds to the credit file that we think are quite positive. We talked about earlier on this call, some of the solutions we're doing here in the U.S. between EWS and USIS that are really unique that we think will benefit both USIS and EWS using the income flag on some of our credit files, which we think is very positive. We've rolled out in the U.S. someone score solutions that combine our cell phone utility data as well as our other alternative data that's having big lifts in performance. It differentiates really our score using our credit file and other alternative data versus our competitors. So we're excited about that. Did you add anything, John? I think you saw we took a charge this quarter that was planned to execute the cloud cost savings, principally from USIS and some of that from Canada that will benefit the fourth quarter, but that also benefits 2025. So that benefit is a positive. As you point out, we're at 90% cloud complete, which is a big milestone at year-end but we still have 10% to go. So as we complete those last pieces of the cloud, there'll be additional decommissioning of the legacy infrastructure for that tail of our cloud completion. So that's going to benefit '25 and '26. And John, you also not cost, but it's -- depreciation, you talked about being higher next year because we're bringing on more of the new platforms into our operating mode and starting to depreciate those. So we framed for you that depreciation will be up next year. But I think you said it's -- we're kind of peaking in depreciation in 2025 with CapEx coming down. Yes. So a couple of different questions there, Tony. First, we're not intending to give '25 guidance this year, but we're happy to give some kind of indication. So I think we said we expect CapEx to come down next year again. You use the term big -- it's hard to find big. You may think about differently than I do, but CapEx, we will bring CapEx down next year as we move closer to cloud completion. What's left to be done is outside the U.S., principally Australia, a few Latin American countries. We're partially through on U.K. We'll finish a lot of the U.K. next year. Spain will be done by year-end. So it's really those kind of elements so you should expect to see a reduction in CapEx as a percent of revenue again in 2016, as we get kind of that next stage. We framed the 6% to 7% over the long-term is what we expect to do. And as a reminder, as we move into kind of a post cloud environment, that CapEx is increasingly used for innovation in new products versus cloud transformation or maintaining legacy infrastructure. So we think we're going to be advantaged in having what I would call growth as we move into '25, '26, '27 versus kind of building cloud CapEx we've had for the last number of years, which we think will be a positive. I think we talked about consumer credit, some end market consumer demand softening like in auto, but it's still okay. It's not like it's depressed. You go back to two years ago, we had the fintech kind of was really impacted. That's now normalized, I think it's a positive, meaning and we're growing in fintech. So as we -- with cloud and new products going forward. So when I think about green shoots, from where we sit, 2025 feels like certainly the first half of '25 going to be much like we're seeing today. I think the green shoot really would be in rate reductions. We talk a ton around the impact of rate reductions in mortgage, but rate reductions in auto for auto loans are going to be helpful to that end market, in my view, and in P loan, lesser degree in cards, consumers tend to be less sensitive to rates and cards because most consumers don't think they're going to revolve with a credit card. But when you're taking out a P loan, you're taking out an installment loan when you're buying a car on credit and those rates are higher, too. So if there is any potential green shoots that we haven't seen yet, is does the Fed take rates down? Does the 10-year come down? And does that not only benefit mortgage but also benefit a couple of the other end-user markets. And we don't forecast rate changes. We never have. We try to find for you what the impact of a potential rate change could be like in mortgage, but we don't forecast rate changes. That's just not our guidance philosophy. Yes. I think it's still, in our view, a pretty good market. That's what our customers are saying. There's -- I don't think there's any alarm, George from our customers around where delinquencies have gone. I think most of our customers believe with the low unemployment or high employment rates, meaning consumers working that even with delinquencies up that's manageable and they're generally at delinquency rates that are inside of how our customers think about growing their business. So we haven't seen that impact -- we haven't seen delinquencies be a reason that people are tightening up outside of subprime. Subprime that's already happened. Subprime tightened up a couple of years ago. But from our perspective, if employment is going to stay at this fairly low level, we don't see that impacting our volumes in the fourth quarter in the early parts of 2025 unless there's a change in the employment levels -- and unemployment goes up. Yes. So we're still excited -- very excited about Boa Vista. As you know, we just lapped the one year mark of ownership of the business. We're still in the thick of integrating the business and bringing our new products and technology down there. Serasa Experian has a very strong business that they've executed very well on. But the feedback we're getting from all the big banks and customers there is that they welcome a global competitor and that's where we're going to. We're pleased with the performance of Boa Vista through 2024, and we expect it to be continued strong and we do expect some share gains going forward. It's too early to see that in the business after just 12 months. And we haven't really fully deployed a lot of the Equifax technology of Ignite and interconnect, but those are getting in place as we exit the year and into 2025. So we'd expect some more traction there going forward. Latin America had a very good quarter. We're performing well in that market, really in all geographies, all the countries that we participate in and really big focus by that team as well as the international team on innovation and new products, which is really helping their effectiveness in the marketplace. And John, we also -- we just completed Canada two weeks ago or 10 days ago. So those benefits will roll into the fourth quarter and into 2025 and then we complete Spain later this year in a couple of other Latin American countries. So that cloud completion, as you point out, which is principally that 10% we have left to go is going to benefit principally international because that's where the work of the cloud complete is going to take place."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Trevor.\nTrevor Burns: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our Investor Relations website. During the call, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 2Q 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full year 2024 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Before I cover our strong second quarter results, I want to update you on the significant progress in our cloud transformation. Over the next several weeks, USIS will complete the migration on to the cloud data fabric of all customers and services for their consumer credit and telco and utilities exchanges, which is a huge milestone for Equifax. Along with the EWS Work Number Exchange, which we completed migrating to the Equifax Cloud over two years ago, we will have our three largest data exchanges in the new Equifax Cloud. As of the end of July, we expect over 80% of Equifax revenue will be in the Equifax Cloud, with about 90% of our revenue in the cloud by year-end. The cloud migrations have been a huge effort across Equifax over the four plus -- the past four-plus years. We expect to have a significant competitive advantage as we pivot from building to leveraging the cloud that will allow us to fully focus on growth, innovation, new products, and AI going forward. Completing the USIS cloud and expanding EFX.AI, along with continued expansion of our differentiated data assets, will accelerate innovation and new products at USIS that will drive our top and bottom line. We now have streamlined access to our proprietary data through the data fabric, which will accelerate new product development. We also expect to reduce product development times, resulting in faster time to market for our new solutions. USIS has already begun to see their New Product Vitality Index accelerate. USIS is deploying Equifax proprietary Explainable AI, along with Google Vertex AI across Ignite, our global analytics platform, and Interconnect, our global decisioning platform. For USIS, Vertex AI enables faster and more predictive model development on our Ignite platform. The USIS cloud will deliver always on stability and faster data transmission that will give Equifax a competitive advantage in today's digital market, driving share gains. We're also driving faster data ingestion and analytics with greater processing power with the new Equifax Cloud. And most importantly, completing the cloud is going to free up the USIS team to fully focus on growth and expanding innovation, new products, data sets and markets. With both USIS and EWS in the cloud, we'll also be able to begin development of new products that integrate TWN income and employment data with USIS credit data solutions for mortgage, auto, cards, and P loans that only Equifax can deliver. Completing the USIS consumer and telco and utility migrations to the Equifax Cloud allows us to start decommissioning legacy on-prem systems in the third quarter, supporting our goal of spending reductions in 2024 that will improve operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. In the second quarter, we also made substantial progress on our international cloud transformation activities. Canada is expected to complete their consumer credit exchange customer migrations to data fabric next month. Europe continues to make significant progress with the goal of completing Spain's consumer credit exchange migration to the data fabric and decommissioning of their legacy systems by year-end, and the U.K. is on schedule to complete cloud migrations and decommissioning in the first-half of 2025. And in Latin America, we've completed the Argentina and Chile cloud migrations and expect to make substantial progress on several additional Latin American countries in the second-half of this year. It's energizing to be approaching the finish line of our cloud transformation. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. Now, turning to slide four, we had a strong second quarter, with reported revenue just over $1.43 billion, up 9% and just over the top end of our April guidance. Adjusted EBITDA margins at 32% were in line with our expectations, and adjusted EPS at $1.82 per share was well above the high end of our April guidance. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represents about 80% of total Equifax revenue in the quarter, had strong 13% current constant currency revenue growth, which is above the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. Non-mortgage organic constant currency revenue growth was at 9% in the quarter and also at the top end of our 7% to 10% organic revenue growth framework. This performance was driven by 20% non-mortgage growth in EWS Verifier, led by strong 30% growth in government and talent that was up over 13%. International delivered 28% constant dollar revenue growth and strong 12% organic growth, led by strong growth in Latin America and Europe. USIS non-mortgage revenue growth of 1% was in line with last quarter and somewhat weaker than our expectations. We expect to see accelerating growth in USIS non-mortgage revenue as we complete the US consumer cloud migration later this month. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 4% in the quarter. The growth in mortgage revenue was driven by USIS, where mortgage revenue was up a strong 27% and consistent with our expectations. The strong growth in USIS mortgage reflects the continued benefit from strong vendor pass-through pricing actions and performance in our new mortgage pre-qual products. EWS mortgage revenue was down just under 12% and also consistent with our expectations. Equifax also had another strong quarter of new product innovation with a Vitality Index of almost 13%, above our 10% frame for 2024 guidance and our long-term 10% vitality framework. The vitality was up 350 basis points sequentially from broad-based execution across all of our business units, and EWS was particularly strong with a 17% vitality. Turning to slide five, Workforce Solutions revenue was up 5% and well above our expectations. Non-mortgage verification services revenue delivered very strong 20% growth, up 500 basis points sequentially and well above our expectations. Government had another outstanding quarter, with very strong 30% revenue growth from continued growth in penetration in their big $5 billion TAM. Government revenue grew sequentially from strong growth in state revenues despite the substantial completion at the end of March of post-COVID CMS initial redeterminations. We expect continued strong government growth over the medium and long-term in Workforce Solutions. Talent solutions revenue was up a strong 13% in the quarter, up 17 percentage points sequentially and well above our expectations. Talent solutions volumes improved sequentially and we saw very strong growth in our insights incarceration data products in the talent vertical. Based on data through May, EWS talent solutions outperformed the BLS white-collar hiring markets by approximately 19 percentage points from new records, new products, and penetration into the vertical. EWS mortgage revenue was down just under 12% and in line with our April guidance. TWN inquires in the second quarter were down 18% and consistent with the down 19% we discussed with you in April. TWN inquiries continue to be weaker than USIS credit inquiries as buyers continue to have difficulty completing home purchases. EWS total mortgage revenue outperformed TWN inquiries by over 6%. We expect EWS mortgage revenue to benefit significantly in the third and fourth quarters from the significant growth in TWN records already delivered late in the second quarter and from planned additions in the third quarter and fourth quarter. EWS consumer lending revenue was up 8% from strong double-digit growth in P loans and debt management and high-single digit growth in auto. Employer services revenue was down 11%, principally from lower ERC revenue. Excluding ERC, revenue was lower than expected at down 2% due to lower WOTC revenue as we talked about in April, partially offset by positive ACA revenue growth. We expect employer revenue to return to growth in the fourth quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 53% were up 170 basis points sequentially and continue to be very strong from non-mortgage verifier revenue growth and good cost execution, while we continue to invest in new products, expand in high-growth verticals like government and talent, and grow our TWN records. Before moving on to USIS, I want to acknowledge the significant contribution of Rudy Ploder made to EWS and Equifax over the last 20-years. Under Rudy's leadership, EWS revenue grew from about $900 million in 2019 to $2.3 billion last year and has positioned EWS for strong above market growth, leveraging the Equifax Cloud. We're super energized to have Chad Borton, who joined us in May, leading Workforce Solutions. Chad's broad financial service experience, proven executive leadership, customer focus, and regulatory depth will be a big asset for EWS as they continue to drive above market growth. Turning to slide six, we continue to see very strong revenue growth in our EWS government vertical with 30% growth in the quarter and above our expectations. On the left side of the slide, we provided some of the federal agencies we are supporting with EWS digital income employment and incarceration data that accelerate the time to delivery needed -- to deliver needed social service benefits to over 90 million Americans and help government agencies ensure program integrity, a win-win for all parties. And in the middle of the slide, you see the substantial progress our EWS government vertical has made in a short time frame, penetrating that $5 billion TAM with a three-year CAGR of over 50%. We expect EWS government to continue to make significant progress in the government vertical from additional sales resources to federal and individual state capital level, strong record growth; new product rollouts; leveraging our differentiated incarcerated data -- incarceration data; and system-to-system integrations enabled by our cloud-native technology that makes our solutions easier to consume. EWS continues to help federal, state, and local government agencies improve the consumer experience and their own operating efficiency from the application and authentication phases to redetermination and recovery processes. The strength of the EWS government vertical was again clear in the quarter and we expect strong future revenue growth in this business in '25 and beyond. Turning to slide seven, EWS had another strong quarter of new record additions, signing agreements with four new strategic partners that will contribute over 3 million records collectively to the TWN database. Our continued success in expanding partnerships is a testament to EWS\u2019 ability to deliver the highest levels of client service from technology, data security and accuracy, and operational excellence for our partners and their end customers. We expect these new partnerships to come online and begin generating revenue for Workforce Solutions in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, EWS added 8 million active records to the TWN database, ending the quarter with 180 million active records, up a strong 12% on 132 million unique individuals. Total records are now 695 million and were up 10% versus last year. At 132 million unique individuals, we have plenty of room to grow the TWN database towards the TAM of 225 million income-producing Americans. EWS is also making very good progress building a pipeline of pension and 1099 contributors, as well as with HR software companies in partnerships and they expect to close partnerships in the second-half of the year as we continue focus on expanding the TWN database. Turning to slide eight, USIS revenue was up 7%, solidly within our long-term revenue growth framework of 6% to 8%. USIS mortgage revenue grew 27% and was in line with our April guidance. Mortgage credit inquiries, while continuing to be down significantly year-over-year at down 13%, were largely in line with our April guidance. Despite the modest reduction in mortgage rates we've seen over the last several weeks, we have not seen an improvement in mortgage market inquiries, likely due to continued low new home inventory levels. Consistent with the first quarter, the strong pricing environment, along with the strength of our pre-qual products drove the very strong mortgage revenue growth and outperformance. At $143 million, mortgage revenue was about 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Total non-mortgage revenue at up 1% was below our expectation of 2% growth. We saw strong growth in consumer solutions and financial marketing services, which were partially offset by a decline in USIS B2B online revenue. We believe growth in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the U.S. team's broad-based focus on completing customer cloud migrations, which likely dampened some of the new business activity we were expecting. USIS online B2B non-mortgage revenue was down about 4% and below our expectations. Consistent with trends from the first quarter, we saw a continuation of tight credit conditions, which impacted the auto market, as well as the broader FI vertical. Auto was also impacted by a software supplier system outage that we all read about. USIS saw double-digit declines in third-party bureau sales and a lesser extent low-single-digit declines in telco and auto. These declines were partially offset by growth in the broader FI market and in insurance. ID and fraud was also below our expectations, as was auto. Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business, was up 7%. Marketing revenue was up 4%, primarily due to growth in pre-screen marketing. Our pre-screen quarterly trends have been fairly consistent, with growth coming from large FIs and fintechs, offset by declines in mid-sized banks and credit unions. USIS is seeing growing demand for our suite of Ignite solutions, including Ignite for Prospecting. Fraud revenue was up a very strong 15% from new business wins. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 13% from strong double-digit growth in consumer direct channel and high-single digit growth in our indirect channel. We expect mid-single digit growth in our D2C business in the second-half of this year against strong comps from last year. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 33.2% in the quarter and below our expectations, reflecting its lower-than-expected revenue growth. In USIS, the significant efforts across the business to complete the cloud transformation clearly had an impact on USIS customer engagement and non-mortgage revenue growth in the first-half. As USIS consumer cloud migration is completed in the next few weeks, the USIS team will now be able to fully focus on customer engagement and growth and we expect USIS non-mortgage revenue to see improved growth in the second-half of this year and, of course, in '25 and beyond. Turning to slide nine, international revenue was up a very strong 28% in constant currency and up a strong 12% in organic constant currency in the quarter, excluding the impact of BVS and well above the 20% growth we guided to in April due to continued very strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Europe local currency revenue was up a very strong 12% in the quarter, with continued strong 6% growth in our credit and data businesses and from very strong 23% growth in our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue was up 124%, principally due to the acquisition of Boa Vista, with very strong organic growth of 30%. Latin America organic revenue growth was driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Paraguay and Central America. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We continue to make good progress on the Brazil integration. Equifax Interconnect solution was launched for small business and medium businesses in the second quarter in Brazil with full feature release to service larger clients in the second-half. The first apps of Ignite have also been launched. Identity and fraud solutions, including count and mitigator, are now available for Brazilian customers, and Brazil is driving accelerated negative data acquisition to add to their database. The team is making excellent progress on driving growth and integrating with Equifax. Canada delivered 6% growth in the quarter. As I previously mentioned, we expect Canada to complete their consumer credit exchange customer migrations to the new Equifax Cloud in the next few weeks. And similar to USIS, we are expecting to see accelerated new product rollouts and growth going forward from the Canadian team. In Asia Pacific, revenue was down about 2%, as expected, better than the down 10% in the first quarter. We expect Asia Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second-half. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.6% were above our expectations and up 130 basis points sequentially, given their strong revenue growth performance. Turning to slide 10, we continue to make very strong progress driving innovation, with over 30 new products launched in the quarter that delivered a 12.5% Vitality Index, which was up 350 basis points sequentially and was driven by broad-based performance across all of our business units. EWS had a strong second quarter with Vitality Index of 17%, up 700 basis points sequentially. And we expect EWS VI to remain strong in the second-half with new product introductions focused on incarceration data, mortgage pre-qual or shopping behavior and I-9 and onboarding solutions. USIS saw continued sequential improvement with a Vitality Index of 8%, up 100 basis points sequentially. We expect USIS to continue to show strong VI performance from cloud completion as they leverage our new cloud-native infrastructure for innovation and new products in identity and fraud, commercial, and our new mortgage pre-qual products. International also had strong 11% VI in the quarter, up 200 basis points sequentially. We expect strong Equifax double-digit VI in the second-half, leveraging our Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts with a full-year VI for Equifax of over 10%. EFX.AI is one of our key EFX2026 strategic priorities, enabled by our new Equifax Cloud. We're energized to have a new AI leader onboard who will drive our strategic vision and execution in Explainable EFX.AI. We are accelerating the pace at which we are developing new Equifax models and scores using AI and ML in areas such as identity and fraud and consumer loan affordability that drive performance and predictability of our solutions. In the second quarter, 89% of our new models and scores were built using AI and ML, which is up 400 basis points sequentially and ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. Before I turn it over to John, I wanted to provide a few comments on our full-year 2024 guidance. We're maintaining our 2024 guidance midpoint with revenue of $5.72 billion, up 8.6% and adjusted EPS of $7.35 a share, up 9.5%. This guidance implies a strong second-half for Equifax, with revenue at the midpoint of $2.9 billion, up over 9.5%, and adjusted EPS of $4.03 per share, up 13%. Consistent with our practice, this framework assumes mortgage market activity consistent with the levels we saw in June and early July, resulting in a estimated full-year USIS credit inquiries at down 11% and consistent with our April guidance. As you know, we're using current trends to forecast mortgage market activity and have not seen a strengthening in the mortgage market activity despite the recent modest decline in rates and have not reflected the impact of any Fed rate cuts in the second-half. Delivering this level of performance in the second-half against the U.S. mortgage market that continues at the levels we saw in the first-half, we believe, is very strong Equifax performance. It reflects constant dollar non-mortgage growth of about 10%, again led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services businesses and with strong continued growth -- organic growth in international and improving non-mortgage growth in USIS despite the continuation of the tight credit markets we saw in the first quarter and second quarter in the U.S., leading to some weakening in the auto market and also impacting the broader FI market. While we expect a continued weak mortgage market, we expect to grow mortgage revenue by 18% in the second-half. Of course, we continue to expect significant future mortgage market improvements as rates come down and mortgage market activity returns to normal 2015 to '19 levels. As we've shared previously, we expect to flow the $1.1 billion mortgage revenue recovery through to EBITDA as mortgage market activity improves at our very high mortgage market gross margins. And we're continuing to deliver expanded EBITDA margin growth, principally in the fourth quarter as we complete the transformation of our US consumer businesses and our businesses in Canada, Spain, Chile, and Argentina. Now, I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and to provide our third quarter framework. Our third quarter guidance builds on our strong second quarter performance from new products, penetration, record growth, and pricing.\nJohn Gamble: Thanks, Mark. Turning to slide 11, consistent with our practice from the first-half of 2024 and the last several years, our guidance for credit inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two weeks to four weeks, modified to reflect normal seasonal patterns. We have seen 30-year mortgage rates just under 7% for the last five weeks. However, we have not seen meaningful improvement in the run rate of either credit or TWN inquiries, although we continue to expect mortgage market activity to improve as rates come down in the future. Our guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 7% in 3Q24 and 11% in calendar year '24, which for the full-year is consistent with our April guidance. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries in the third quarter to be down over 7%, and for the full year, down approaching 14%. Second-half TWN inquiries are down about consistent with the decline in credit inquiries, reflecting an expected normalization of the mortgage shopping we saw in the first-half of the year as interest rates remain stable or begin to decline. As a reminder, and as we discussed in April, we expect the level of U.S. mortgage revenue outperformance to moderate as we move through 2024, as we start to lap the growth in new mortgage pre-qual products. We expect 3Q USIS mortgage revenue outperformance to be over 30%, down from the 40% in the second quarter, with full-year USIS mortgage outperformance expected to be about 40%. We expect TWN revenue mortgage outperformance in the second-half to increase sequentially from the new records we boarded in the second quarter. Slide 12 provides the details of our 3Q \u201824 guidance. In 3Q \u201824, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.425 billion and $1.445 billion, with revenue up about 9% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should be up about 10%. Mortgage revenue in the third quarter is expected to be up over 12%. Mortgage revenue will be just under 20% of total revenue. FX is negative to revenue about 2%. Business unit performance in the third quarter is expected to be as follows. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 8%, with non-mortgage revenue up about 10%. Non-mortgage verifier revenue should again be very strong in the third quarter, with growth slightly under the 20% we saw in the second quarter, again, driven by government and talent solutions. EWS mortgage revenue should return to growth and be up slightly in the third quarter. Both verifier mortgage and non-mortgage revenue growth benefit from the strong growth in TWN records we are seeing throughout 2024. And employer services revenue is expected to decline over 15% in the quarter, principally due to declines in ERC. We expect employer services to return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 51.5%, down about 100 basis points sequentially, principally from product mix. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 8.5% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of over 2% should be up from the up 1% we saw this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up about 34%, up sequentially about 100 basis points as USIS begins decommissioning legacy consumer and telco and utility systems. International revenue is expected to be up about 18% in constant currency, which includes the benefit of the acquisition of BVS that was completed August of 2023. Revenue is expected to be up about 12% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 28%, reflecting revenue growth. Equifax 3Q \u201824 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be under 33% at the midpoint of our guidance, with a sequential increase reflecting revenue growth and the early stages of decommissioning of legacy consumer and telco and utility assets. Adjusted EPS in 3Q \u201824 is expected to be $1.75 to $1.85 per share, up 2% versus 3Q \u201823 at the midpoint. As of the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.0 times, with a goal by year-end 2024 of about 2.5 times. We believe this leverage is nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases, as well as continue to do bolt-on acquisitions in 2025 and beyond. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full-year guidance, which is overall unchanged from the full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance we provided in April and is centered at the midpoint. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5%, with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% at the middle of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 10%, despite the over 10% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10%, with organic growth of about 8%, led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services business, with continued strong organic growth in international and improving non-mortgage growth in USIS. This is within our long-term framework. FX is about 180 basis points negative to revenue. As Mark discussed earlier, we are maintaining the midpoint of adjusted EPS at $7.35 per share. EBITDA margins, however, are expected to be 32.6%, down from the over 33% we discussed earlier this year. As Mark discussed, we are making very good progress on cloud migrations. However, they are completing up to a quarter later than we had planned. As a result, our cloud cost savings are lower due to timing in 2024, which negatively impacts EBITDA. Partially offsetting this impact is lower depreciation. As these effects are timing of completion, they only impact 2024 and do not impact the cost savings we expect to achieve in 2025 and beyond. Full-year BU guidance is principally consistent with what was shared in April, with the exception of the impact on USIS and international EBITDA margins per my previous discussion. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 7%, with non-mortgage revenue up about 10%. Non-mortgage verifier revenue should be up over 15%, driven by government and talent solutions. EWS mortgage revenue should be down 3% for the year. EWS margins are expected to be about 52%. USIS revenue is expected to be up 9% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of about 2% is expected to be up from the 1% we saw in the first-half of 2024. USIS EBITDA margin should be about 34%, down about 50 basis points from our April guidance. And international revenue is expected to be up over 15% in constant-currency, which includes the benefit of the acquisition of BVS. Revenue is expected to be up about 10% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to approach 27.5%, down from 28% in our April guidance. Using the midpoint of our 3Q \u201824 and fiscal year '24 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS, the implied 4Q \u201824 midpoint for revenue is $1.465 billion, up 10% year-to-year and $30 million sequentially. And for adjusted EPS is $2.23 per share, up over 20% year-to-year. The improvement in adjusted EPS in 4Q \u201824 sequentially from 3Q \u201824 is certainly substantial and requires strong execution. The drivers of this improvement are expected to be as follows. About half of the improvement is driven by the sequential revenue growth at our very high variable margins. Revenue mix also should drive improved margins as non-mortgage revenue grows strongly sequentially and mortgage revenue declines sequentially. Mortgage has much lower margins relative to non-mortgage, principally due to much higher royalties and purchased data file costs in mortgage. Cost and expense reductions drive about a quarter of the improvement. These cost reductions are principally due to completion of cloud migrations in North America and Europe, resulting in lower COGS and also lower development expense. In addition to the cost benefit from completion of cloud migrations, we continue to execute fixed cost and expense reductions, which will also benefit 4Q \u201824. Items below operating profit, principally taxes, represent on the order of 20% of the improvement. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be about $485 million, which is a year-to-year reduction of about $100 million. This is up from our April guidance, reflecting the timing of completion of the migrations to the Equifax Cloud that I just referenced. In the first-half of 2024, CapEx was $256 million, down almost $50 million year-to-year. We expect capital expenditures in the second-half to decline further as the tech transformation activities I previously discussed complete. Turning to slide 14, and as we discussed in April, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the mortgage market recovers toward its historic norms, that represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax in 2025 and beyond, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our high mortgage margins, this over $1 billion of mortgage revenue would deliver on the order of $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Wrapping up on slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 11% constant currency revenue growth, which was at the upper end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX2026 strategic priorities. Our very strong 20% EWS non-mortgage verifier revenue growth, 12% EWS active record growth, and strong 12.5% broad-based VI give us momentum as we enter the second-half of 2024. A big priority for 2024 is to complete our North America cloud transformation, as well as significant portions of our global markets, which will enhance our competitiveness, drive margin expansion, reduce our capital intensity, expand our free cash flow for bolt-on M&A, dividend growth, and share repurchases. Completing the USIS consumer cloud migrations in the next few weeks is a significant milestone for Equifax. We continue to expect CapEx to decrease in 2024 by about $100 million to under 8.5% of revenue with further reductions in 2025, allowing us to move towards our long-term CapEx goal of 6% to 7% of revenue as we exit next year. Entering 2025 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud is a big milestone, so the Equifax team can move towards fully focusing on growth. Another significant EFX2026 strategic priority is to drive innovation through our investments in EFX.AI. AI and machine learning are changing the way we develop new products in our single data fabric, the way we -- and allowing us to build higher performing models, scores, and products, ingest and cleanse data, and operate our consumer care centers more effectively. We're on offense at Equifax with EFX.AI. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We're convinced that our new Equifax Cloud, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, leveraging EFX.AI and machine learning, and market-leading businesses will deliver higher revenue growth, expanded margins, and accelerated free cash flow that will enable us to start returning cash to shareholders in 2025 and beyond. We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50-plus-basis points of margin expansion annually on average over a cycle. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to thank Sam McKinstry on the Investor Relations team for his significant contributions over the past four years. Good news, Sam's staying with Equifax and is taking a position within the USIS business to further his career in finance. He's been a real asset to the IR team and the investor community. And joining the Investor Relations team from Equifax is Molly Clegg, and we welcome Molly to the IR team. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations on getting close to this tech transformation ending. My first question was on that, which is, how much of the cost savings, I guess, have you baked into the third quarter, fourth quarter, and I guess, more importantly, just a run rate of what we should think this is now going to help in 2025 just on its own?\nJohn Gamble: Yes, I don't think we're going to get into 2025 guidance, but in terms of third quarter and fourth quarter, we've baked in the cost savings related to the North American consumer businesses completing transformation in the third quarter and beginning their decommissioning, and we've done the same thing with regard to Spain and some other movements we've talked about in Mark's script in the fourth quarter. So when I talk about...\nMark Begor: The savings are really in the fourth quarter and then we'll get the annualization of that next year.\nJohn Gamble: Absolutely. As we talked about in the bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, a significant portion of those savings, as Mark said, really gets in the fourth quarter, because the transformations and the completion of the transformations and beginning to be decommissionings don't start until later in the third quarter.\nMark Begor: And Manav, I think, as you know -- I appreciate you pointing it out, this has been a long road. We started this five years ago and to be close to this finish line with 80% of our rev in the cloud in the next month or two and 90% in the fourth quarter, it's really a huge milestone. It's been a huge effort by the entire organization to run the company over the last number of years, but also do the cloud work. And we're super energized to really be pivoting to leveraging that cloud in the second-half as we complete USIS in Canada in the next couple of weeks and then really go into 2025 in a very, very strong position.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, fine. And then just broadly, I think just from the first-half results, it looks like there's a lot of pluses and minuses across the segments. I was just curious in terms of the way you set the second-half guidance. Like, where would you say you've perhaps left some room for error or being conservative on it?\nMark Begor: Yes. We try to be balanced. I think you know that. We want to put forecast out that we know how to meet and we feel a lot of confidence in the forecast we put out. I think John and I in our prepared comments talked about some of the positives we have. We've had some challenges, you always do in a business. I think we highlighted USIS has seen some softening in the first quarter in some of their end markets and also in the second quarter. Mortgage hasn't really come back, and short of rate cuts, we don't expect that to happen in our guide. We've seen some impacts likely from the big focus in the first-half in USIS and cloud transformation. We expect those to obviously mitigate so the commercial team can be fully focused on just commercial conversations versus also commercial and cloud. EWS is performing exceptionally well. You look at the government performance, talent had a very strong quarter. Obviously, we talked about employer impacted by WOTC and some other kind of macros that will solve themselves, but likely later in the year, that will benefit 2025. But putting that all together and -- maybe just finishing with international, strong momentum there and all the businesses performing above our expectations. When we put that all together, we felt like we had the right framework in holding the year in the second-half.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, there. First, I would just want to confirm that second quarter revenue percentage for mortgage was 20%, I know the word about was used? And then the second question is, I want to focus just more on the third quarter guide, and Mark, I know you really talked about the second-half there. And I want to focus specifically on USIS. I surely heard you highlighting that the cloud migration, let's call it, multitasking will be behind us the end of this month for USIS, so revenue acceleration there into August? And then I also heard the comment about CDK, which was a drag to auto revenues and auto dealers in the second quarter. That also seems behind us. So, what other kind of maybe drags have you assumed on USIS in the third quarter guide? Because the third quarter revenue guide for USIS, to me, looks a little conservative. And did you change any assumptions about the health of the U.S. consumer outside of mortgage when thinking about that third quarter USIS guide?\nJohn Gamble: Andrew, to your specific question, it's -- 21% was the exact number.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you.\nMark Begor: And to your question on USIS, I think we -- in our prepared comments, Andrew, I know you heard them. We've seen some softening in some of the end markets in USIS late in the first quarter, certainly continued in the second quarter. You talked about the CDK impact obviously, you know, was a negative late in the second quarter. That's obviously behind us. But the end market softening, for example, in auto, while mortgages have been impacted by higher rates, we're seeing some impact in auto where the payments for new and used cars are very high with the higher rates that are being charged. And we've seen some impact in just consumer demand for loans in auto. And then a broader, I would call it slight softening in second quarter. And we carried that forward in the second-half. So that's reflected in the USIS guide. I don't know if you'd add anything else John?\nJohn Gamble: No, Mark's already talked quite a bit about the distraction from transformation that does recover in the third quarter. We start to come out of that right, but again we're just finishing transformation in the quarter. So you're not going to see a lot of benefit in the third quarter. You don't start to see that till fourth quarter and really next year. You are starting to see NPI improvements in USIS. But again, those are not going to really accelerate until you get to the fourth quarter and next year.\nAndrew Steinerman: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to start off with EWS verification -- or verification in EWS broadly into the back half and thinking about the sequential trend from 3Q and what's implied into the fourth quarter. Especially for 4Q, there seems to be some implied material acceleration. And recognizing that the mortgage market has somewhat stabilized and the benefits from that, can you just walk us through the building blocks to kind of what gets you to the trends in 3Q and what's implied for 4Q and where you're seeing the biggest tailwinds?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So just as an overarching statement, right? It's important to remember that EWS verifier is benefiting in the second-half, really significantly related to record additions, right? They've done an outstanding job with adding new partners. We had a significant partner come online very late in the quarter. And we -- as Mark said, we added four more. We added a substantial number in the first-half. Those records are coming online, and that drives a substantial amount of revenue in the second-half.\nMark Begor: And maybe adding to the records point, John, is that we have real visibility as we are in July now and in the third quarter and as we look out to the fourth quarter of meaningful record additions that we're working on, and we haven't closed those yet, so we haven't added them into our discussions with you. But -- and as you know, records, when we add them, when they come online, they turn into revenue that day, because we're already getting the inquiries. That's the beauty of the of the system we have. Sorry, John. Go ahead.\nJohn Gamble: No problem. And as you get into fourth quarter, obviously, what you're seeing from third quarter to fourth quarter is there's some traditional strength generally from third quarter to fourth quarter in talent, right? Just because of seasonal hiring in I-9, because of seasonal hiring where we do onboarding for companies. We generally see some strength in banking and card, around CLIs. And then importantly, in CMS, ACA sign-ups start in the fourth quarter. So we generally see nice growth in government going into the fourth quarter. And then you layer on top of that the strength in records, and that's what gives us confidence that we're going to see good performance as we go through the back half of the year in verifier non-mortgage. Mortgage, we've talked about, I think that's been covered. And employer, what we're seeing is, as we get into the fourth quarter, the significant impact of ERC that we saw through the first nine months of the year, we wrap around the decline that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. So employer revenue on a year-over-year basis, the growth rate will be substantially better. As we said, we expect to be flat to slightly up relative to the declines that we've been seeing, and that's principally driven by the fact that we saw a big decline in ERC in the fourth quarter of '23. So, I'd say that's why we feel good about the way EWS is trending and the opportunities to drive the revenue growth we're talking about.\nHeather Balsky: Got it. Thank you. And I know you've gotten questions about where there might be a little bit of caution in the guidance and room for upside. There's been a couple of surprises the past few quarters, the WOTC, the transition taking a little bit longer. Do you feel like for the back half, you've given yourself some room for some things that might occur like that, some of the stuff that may be kind of out of your control?\nMark Begor: Yes, we're always trying to do that, as you know, and it's often not easy. Like, the WOTC change that took -- went in place last year, we just thought would be implemented by the states more quickly. Government bureaucracies sometimes move at different paces. But we think we have good visibility. We talked earlier about the records. That's one where we have high visibility on. We know who we've signed, we know when they're coming on. We have kind of those schedules. So that gives you a lot of visibility. We -- do what you would suggest or would think we do is, we handicap different macro elements and try to put our best forecast together. And I think, as you know, on mortgage, while there's maybe increased talk about a rate cut in September, we don't have that in our forecast. We wouldn't put it in our forecast. That's not our process. If that happens, that's going to be good news for the second-half. But outside of our forecast and -- as you know, we expect rates over the medium term, call it, into '25 and '26 to come down, and that's going to be a real tailwind for us on the mortgage side. So yes, we've put pluses and minuses that we think we know about into the forecast, and that's why we put it in front of you.\nJohn Gamble: And as Mark referenced and we talked about in the script, right, I mean, obviously, we know third quarter to fourth quarter requires a lot of execution. But we have a lot of confidence in the way the teams are executing right now and it's around completing the transformations. We think we have very good visibility into how that's going to complete and the timing.\nHeather Balsky: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nKelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on talent. Obviously, we've seen really strong growth this quarter. I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about the new products you've introduced year-to-date, how much they have contributed to growth, as well as kind of upcoming product pipeline and how you expect them to contribute to growth.\nMark Begor: Yes. And in talent, you have to add to it also the penetration. Remember, that's a large TAM that we have a big position in, but there's a lot of runway for growth of just converting manual -- let's use just employment verification processes. As you know, we have incarceration, we have education data and other data elements, like medical credentialing data. But just the penetration is just a huge opportunity just like government. The -- when you've got a $450 million, $500 million kind of run rate business in talent, operating in a $3 billion-plus TAM, there's just a lot of penetration opportunity. Product is a big lever also. We've got a lot of focus around new products on incarceration, on education, on different depths of employment data. We rolled out an hourly solution for hourly background screens that don't require as much employment history. So, there's a big focus there. And I know the team is working on the next chapter of combining those data elements with our goal being to have a single transaction to deliver all the data that's required for a background screen, which would include employment history, would include incarceration, education, et cetera. We signed and announced a new partnership on education that goes beyond college degrees and into high school and vocational schools. So, that's another depth of element that's a part of our second-half focus on talent.\nJohn Gamble: And in the second quarter, we saw very nice growth out of the insights portfolio -- incarceration, as Mark referenced, helping us drive the talent growth rate. So that was a nice growth area for us in the second quarter.\nKelsey Zhu: Got it. Super helpful. And then my second question is on government. We also saw really strong growth this quarter. How much of that is driven by the CMS contract extension? And are there any one-off factors that contributed to growth this quarter? And how should we think about a sustainable growth rate going forward?\nMark Begor: Yes, that's a heavy question. Let me take a few parts of that. When you think about government, I think, John and I both mentioned in our comments, the biggest driver in government is penetration into that big $5 billion TAM. That's really at the state agency level. And as you know, we've continued to add resources in our government team in -- at the states in order to drive that penetration. And remember, you've got multiple agencies that are using our data, and in most cases, are not using our data, they're still doing it manually, whether it's for healthcare benefits, food support, rent support, childcare support, education support, income support, there's about a dozen different social services. And I think you know the scale of the U.S. consumer base that -- or household base that receives these services. It's about 90 million Americans receiving those services. And when you think about our business, call it, roughly $800 million run rate today against that $5 billion TAM, you've got over a $4 billion really manual processing of principally income verification that we're penetrating into. So, state penetration is a big driver and we think about that as very sustainable. There's not -- there's no one-offs in there. You get embedded in their workflows and then you become a part of that process. As you point out, we did expand -- extend our CMS contract last September. So, we're still taking the benefit of the price increase that was built in there. And as you know, that's a five-year contract with annual escalators. So that's one with a lot of visibility. So there's not any kind of one-offs in there. Anything else you'd add, John? In government -- you can tell we're quite energized. Government, last quarter and now again this quarter, is the largest vertical in Workforce Solutions and it's the business with, we think, the largest runway. Your question about the long-term growth rate, it's obviously outgrowing. In the last three years, it's had a 50% CAGR. It was up 30% in the quarter, I think 35% last quarter. So it's had very strong above kind of framework growth for Workforce Solutions, in the 13% to 15% total growth. We've been clear that we expect government to outgrow our 13% to 15% framework for EWS over the long-term. So that's clearly a business that we have a lot of confidence in and we're investing a lot in because of the opportunity there. We haven't given any guidance for '25. We'll do that as we get through this year, but we've been clear that we expect it to grow faster than the rest of Equifax and faster than the rest of EWS.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. And in terms of 2024, just looking at sequential trends, right, I think the sequential trends we're seeing in the second quarter were good and strong. And third quarter and fourth quarter, I think, are very consistent with what we've seen in the past. And specifically, the -- as we referenced, the growth we're expecting into the fourth quarter is heavily driven by CMS and the fact that ACA starts in the fourth quarter, and every year, we see a pop in revenue from that agreement with CMS, in 4Q and then again in 1Q.\nKelsey Zhu: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nFaiza Alwy: [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Faiza, your line is now live.\nJohn Gamble: Faiza, we can't hear you.\nMark Begor: Yes, we got you now, I think.\nFaiza Alwy: Oh, is this okay?\nMark Begor: Yes. That's better, yes.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Okay. Sorry about that. So, wanted to ask about the USIS acceleration that you're expecting on the revenue line just from cloud completion. Talk a little bit about your confidence in that, maybe what type of new products [Technical Difficulty] talked about potential market share gains. So, just give us a bit more color and confidence around that acceleration.\nMark Begor: Yeah. And as John said earlier in one of the questions, we expect to see some benefits perhaps later in the year, but that's really going to be in '25, '26, and '27. There's no question that there's been some distraction for that team. This has been our most complex cloud transformation of the 40-year-old kind of consumer credit -- we call it, ACRO platform that we had. To be finishing it in the next couple of weeks is just a huge accomplishment and it's just taken so much bandwidth from the team to complete that. So, kind of the focus of the team is one positive that we'll have in the second-half, but you should think about that really benefiting as we get into '25 and beyond. You point out a number of really important levers. We believe the always-on stability, the ability to roll out new products more quickly just make us a more valuable partner to our customers. And we do expect to have share gains going forward. We've got some of those in flight and a lot of conversations going on. The feedback from our customers, that we've moved 99% of our customers to the cloud -- I think it's even higher than 99% as I speak today, has been outstanding. The performance, the speed, acceleration of moving the data, just the feedback is super positive. And as you know, that's one of the reasons we invested this substantial amount of money in the cloud four-plus-years ago was we believed it was going to give us a stronger competitive position with our customers. So you -- and we should start to see those benefits really in '25, but the momentum -- there should be some good guys as we get into the second-half on that. New products is another big deal. As you know, their vitality has been below our 10% goal for a number of years as they've been working on the cloud transformation. We've seen some positive acceleration in the quarter. I think there were 8% vitality and up 100 bps, which is positive. So, the team is starting to create some bandwidth for new products. And you'll see new products, really, from every element of USIS, a lot of stuff coming out from identity and compliance, which we're excited about, a lot of risk-based solutions, data combination solutions, given we have such really unique data in USIS versus our competitors, particularly in the alternative data with NC+, DataX, and Teletrack. So, a lot of traction there. Some products in marketing, leveraging our IXI wealth data have been coming out. And then the last one I'd comment on is -- I used it in my comments -- I mentioned in my comments is, with the cloud complete in EWS and now the cloud complete in USIS, we've got a big focus on delivering products that really combine TWN, our income and employment data, with the credit file. We think there's a lot of opportunities to put a flag on the credit file, for example, in mortgage, auto, P loans, so when one of our customers is pulling a credit file, they'll know that there is a individual there that's also working. That adds to the underwriting capabilities of that consumer and adds to the value of our credit file and our solution. And we're really energized about those kind of solutions that combine USIS and EWS products that will benefit both businesses, but we think make our credit file more valuable, which should drive credit file share. So that's a second-half focus on the product side, likely a 2025 implementation. So we're really energized around the always-on stability that will drive our competitive advantage, and then as you point out, the ability to roll out more new products, leveraging the USIS data, but then also bridging between USIS and EWS going forward.\nJohn Gamble: The only thing I'd add is, we're also seeing nice growth in the use of Ignite in pre-screening and Ignite by our customers. That's important, because that's also the platform in which we're deploying our proprietary and then also Vertex AI. So we're making that available to our customers, and it allows us to expand and -- expand the use that we have substantially. So we feel very, very good about the fact that we're seeing accelerating adoption of Ignite in the marketplace with our customers using it directly and with us developing products internally.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much. And then my second question is on EWS mortgage side. Obviously, we've had a lot of conversations over the last few quarters, even years about TWN inquiries versus outperformance. So, just give us the lay of the land in terms of how you're thinking about outperformance from here. And then I know you talked about TWN inquiries sort of stabilizing maybe or being more in line with the credit inquiries. And I'm sure you saw the HMDA data came out last week. I'm just curious if you reflected on that, and any incremental thoughts around just EWS mortgage?\nJohn Gamble: Just in terms of how we expect EWS mortgage to perform relative to inquiries, right, as we talked about, a lot of our improvement in the second-half is driven again by records, right? So, Mark talked a lot about the fact that we've done a really nice job of adding new partners, and we're adding a significant number of records, a lot of them boarded late in the second quarter. So we are expecting to see revenue benefits in EWS from record additions, from the records that were added at the end of the second quarter and also the record we're going to add throughout the rest of this year. And that's really the big driver.\nMark Begor: Yes, I'll just add again. I mentioned it earlier -- in one of the earlier comments. I think you know this, but record additions, we already have the inquiries coming. When we add the records, they turn into revenue. So it's such a powerful lever for us. And as you know, we've had really strong momentum there on records and we've signaled we have strong momentum in the second-half, and also good visibility. We don't have to do anything else, but get the records in our data set and they become revenue, because we already had the inquiries coming in from our customers. We just have higher hit rates.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. We're also looking -- we're also expecting some benefits from new products. I think we've mentioned that in the past, some marketing products that we're trying to put in place earlier in the approval funnel. So, we're going to continue to work on NPI in EWS mortgage, but the big driver certainly in the second-half of 2024 is driven by the strong performance and records in the first-half of 2024, as well as what we expect to continue to do in the rest of this year.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. I'd like to start with a question just about the innovation cycle. When we think about all of the commentary that you've kind of provided, is the idea that we should be entering a period, especially within USIS, of accelerated innovation? And how quickly will those products come out? And then should we expect, what I would call, well above normal in the near term or -- help us work us through that cycle, I guess?\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a great question. As I commented on the last question, they've clearly been dampened with all the focus on completing the cloud. We were really energized with the momentum that they even had in the second quarter in the midst of a very heavy quarter of cloud migrations that their vitality was up 100 bps to 8%. They've been below our 10% goal for five years or six years, pick the time frame, when we increased that goal from 5% to 7% to 10% for Equifax. And we expect USIS to move to that 10% as we get into '25 and the latter part of '25, meaning they've got really good momentum there. I rattled off a whole bunch of solutions that they're working on and that they expect to roll out in the second-half. These new products take time and they were clearly hampered by the cloud transformation, and we expect that with the cloud completion in the next couple of weeks to see some increased focus. And then as I mentioned on the other -- the last question, we're also -- have a big focus. We actually have a dedicated leader and team working on the EWS, USIS products, meaning the product combinations, which we've never done before, and we think will be quite powerful and kind of only Equifax solutions that we can bring to market. We've got a dedicated team in USIS and they're going to be really putting the pedal to the metal as we finish the year. To your question about when you'll see a lot of the benefit, I think that acceleration will happen in 2025 versus the second-half, but you're going to see a positive momentum of products coming out. They may not be revenue in the fourth quarter, but they'll turn into revenue in '25 and beyond.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. And on the implied 4Q margins, it sounds like there is a tax benefit in there as well. If we adjust that out, is that the right run rate for the firm on a go-forward basis from beyond 4Q?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So, in terms of 2025 EBITDA margins, we'll give you guidance on that as we get into 2025. But as we've been talking about, and Mark talked about the fact that we expect, on a long-term model, 50 basis points of improvement per year. And we do expect to see nice improvement in margins as we get into 2025. In terms of an exact level, we'll talk more about that as we get into next year.\nMark Begor: And maybe I'd just add, John. I think we're all watching to see when the Fed's going to change rates, and we believe the positive impact that'll have on mortgage activity, we've been very clear that as that starts rolling in, that's going to be accretive to our margins in a very positive way, meaning it's going to drop through in very high incremental EBITDA levels, 70-plus, when that happens in -- likely in '25 and beyond as rates move down to some more normal level.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of talk about record count. Obviously, a really strong number, both year-over-year and sequentially. I just kind of wanted to ask about the Gig/1099 and pension opportunity there. And more specifically, how chunky or how big can those kind of record adds be on a one-by-one basis? And part of why I ask is I'm just trying to figure out if it's maybe more expensive from like a sales staffing perspective to acquire those deals, or if they can be comparable to some of the HR technology, software and payroll relationships that you've fostered over the years.\nMark Begor: Yes, it's a whole range, as you might imagine. Use pension -- there are pension administrators that manage to find benefit pension payments, almost like a payroll processor for companies. We've signed one or two of those kind of relationships. So you think about those like a payroll processor. Those can be, call it, more chunky, meaning larger. We have direct kind of relationships around pension records and just a long runway in pension. And then there's a lot of pension records, as you might imagine, in federal, state and local government organizations, fire departments, police departments, government agencies, still have defined benefit pensions, most corporations do not, like the vast majority, but some of the legacy corporations still have that. So that's how we're going after pension, we have a dedicated group -- first off, we have a dedicated leader that works for -- our EWS leader that all they work on is records. And you may remember that's a change we made in December, to put a full-time dedicated leader. At the time, he had other tasks in EWS, and we just saw an opportunity to really continue to drive records. So, we asked him to fully focus on records. So, there's a dedicated team on pension and we have a dedicated team on 1099. We have a dedicated team on, call it, W2 or non-farm payroll partnerships, which would be payroll processors, HR software companies and others like that. And then also, remember that half of our records come from our direct relationships that we get through our employer business. So that's another important focus of ours, is we're continuing to invest in new products and capabilities to have those direct record relationships. On 1099, kind of we have a dedicated team. It's a different path that's going to some of the big Gig operators. But remember, 1099, income-producing Americans include doctors, dentists, lawyers that are self-employed and very high income. So you've got to go to like tax prep services that do their quarterly estimated taxes as a way to get some indication of their income. So, lots of different avenues that, I would say your question about, are some chunky and some more granular, the answer is, yes, it's a mix of all of the above across really all three kind of areas for focus on records. The positive we have is our scale, so we can focus on really going after those in so many different places. And we've got a big focus on it for the obvious reason because of the benefit we get. We're already receiving the inquiries. So, as we add records, we're able to translate those into revenue and give higher hit rates for our customers, which is what they're after.\nAndrew Nicholas: Very helpful. Thank you. And then for a very quick follow-up for John, I believe. On the -- you've talked about the outperformance in mortgage for EWS. Maybe kind of underlying that, is the expectation that the EWS inquiry number more closely tracks kind of the overall mortgage inquiry number in the back half, or is your expectation that that gap persists as, I guess, mortgage lenders and buyers don't get all the way through to the final stages of the purchase process?\nJohn Gamble: Now, in the second-half, we've assumed it narrows and that they tend to trend -- they're going to trend together. Now, again, that's based on our expectation. It's also based on the trends we're seeing today, right? So, as we just run out the trends for the rest of the year and apply seasonality, separately, it looks like the movement in USIS credit inquiries and in TWN inquiries, should move on a percentage basis year-on-year similarly, right? So we'll have to see, right? I mean, we have been surprised in the past, where sometimes the shopping behavior continues longer than we expect. But right now, it looks like it's starting to narrow and we can also see it analytically.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good morning. So, just when you had an Investor Day a few years ago, there was going to be kind of like an outsized margin expansion period after the cloud transition was complete. I just -- what's the current thinking on flowing through the tech transformation savings into margin versus any change in thinking on reinvesting that to, I guess, best harvest the increased revenue opportunity from the cloud transition?\nMark Begor: Yes, no change, Jeff. We're going to flow that through. We're investing and we have been, and you've followed us for a long time, you know as well. While we were doing the cloud and putting outsized investment in our tech transformation for the obvious long-term strategic reasons and competitive reasons, we've been making the right investments in '21, '22, '23, '24, in new products and other resources, commercial resources, et cetera. So we're investing the right amount to grow Equifax today, and those incremental savings from the cloud will flow through to expand our margins. Same way that we've talked about is, when the mortgage market returns, we'll let that flow through. We're not going to reinvest that. We're investing the right amounts to grow Equifax at 8% to 12% and deliver that 50 bps of kind of what I'll call ongoing operating leverage from running the company. So, as we have like mortgage market recovery or, as you point out, the cloud cost savings, those are going to flow through and they're going to allow us to not only expand our margins, but as John pointed out, with our leverage coming down, we're getting closer to that stage, which we've been after for, as you know, quite some time to start returning cash to shareholders.\nJeff Meuler : Got it. And then when you were describing, I think it was OIS, you mentioned the ID and fraud softness this quarter. So, I'm guessing that's Kount and Midigator, correct me if I'm wrong. But what drove that? How quickly can it recover and how is international doing for Kount and Midigator?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So if we take a look at Kount and Midigator together, what we saw actually was, let's call it, the fraud part -- portion of the business performed better. We continue to see growth. We saw a little bit of weakness in chargeback management, which is, let's call, the Midigator part of the business, right? So we're expecting -- we've launched a lot of new products and platforms now in Kount, right? Kount 360 is now live. We're expecting to see that platform take hold. So we're expecting to see improved performance as we move through the rest of this year around Kount. And then around chargeback management, as we integrate chargeback management into the Kount 360 platform, we would expect to see some improvement there as well. So -- but I'd say that what we're seeing -- and it's a good news on the margin front, because the fraud business has better margins. We're seeing a little bit of performance in fraud, and given the launch of new products, our expectation is that the area will see improved performance first as we go through the rest of the year.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions here. Just wanted to go back first to the Vitality Index in EWS, and pretty notable sequential acceleration there. It seems like there was a decent amount of contribution there from talent, but just wondering if there were any other kind of notable positive outliers there that were contributing to the sequential acceleration in growth. Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yeah. As you know, EWS has been really outperforming our 10% kind of vitality goal for, gosh, almost three years now, principally after they completed the cloud, and it was a real step-up. So they've had -- really broad-based in all their verticals, focused on innovation and new products. You point out talent, where they've rolled out some products and they've got more in the pipeline. And so, there was clearly some benefit there from products that were put in place late last year and in the first-half of this year. Mortgage has got products that they've rolled out. So there's probably some benefit there. We -- while we lapped Mortgage 36, they've got some other solutions that they're bringing in. Employer, we've got a new I-9 solution called I-9 Virtual that's in the marketplace. So, that vertical is focused on new products. And government is also -- got some focus there. So we've been quite energized about EWS, call it, above framework, ability to execute on innovation. We'd expect them, over time, to move back towards the 10%, but they've been well above it for the last three years. And as we talked about, international had a good quarter on innovation and so did USIS in -- even in the midst of their cloud work.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up on the international side, I mean, one of your peers recently had called out some headwinds to growth in Brazil during the past quarter as a result of some flooding. And just wondering if you guys had any impact from that at all in second quarter here.\nJohn Gamble: We did. We have the -- it's -- it was in Brazil, right? And there's -- there was a substantial flooding in the South of Brazil and it certainly impacted our business, although our Brazil business has actually performed fairly consistently with the plans we put in place when we started the year. So...\nMark Begor: Yes. No, we're pleased. We're pleased with Boa Vista's performance. We talked about a bunch of the solutions that we're bringing there now that should benefit the second-half in '25 as we complete the integration. We're just lapping -- getting close to lapping the 12-month mark from acquiring the business, but we're well down the path on integration and rolling in our new products and bringing in our platforms, like Ignite and Interconnect and some of the other new product solutions. So, we're quite optimistic about our Boa Vista acquisition and the opportunity for growth going forward.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Thanks, and good morning, guys. I wanted to start off on the records growth. It seems really strong there. Just want to see if you guys could unpack kind of what drove kind of some of the new additions. I know you guys have been talking about Gig and such, as well as some of these HR software partnerships. So, I guess, like if you kind of rank order what some of the bigger contributors were to the net new records this quarter, that'd be really helpful.\nMark Begor: Yes. I would say, similar to earlier question, it's broad-based. I think you're seeing the benefits of having a fully dedicated team and leader reporting to the leader of EWS, reporting into Chad. Joe Muchnick is the leader who's driving that. And I think we made that change in December and you've seen just the ability to just drive more of those strategic partnerships, which has really been quite positive. It is broad-based. We add records from individual relationships when we're doing employer solutions like I-9, UC, WOTC and other things with them. We've -- as we point out, we added four new partnerships in the quarter. We see a pipeline of those, and those partnerships are with pension administrators, they're with HR software companies, as you point out, and they're with the traditional payroll processors. And remember, when you think about the TAM, if you will, for records, there's roughly, the way we think about it, 225 million working Americans. We're north of 132 million individuals in our data set. Just a long runway for growth going forward. And we've clearly, gosh, over the last three years, five years, six years, seven years been outgrowing our framework for records over the long-term, which is kind of three points, four points of record growth per year is what we think about over the long-term. But there's just been a lot of momentum, given our focus and resources we've been putting on it.\nKyle Peterson: That's really helpful. And I just wanted to follow-up on auto, some of the moving pieces that you guys have seen there. I know you guys called out kind of the CDK issue. It seems like that's, I guess, largely resolved itself, but I guess, should we...\nMark Begor: Yes.\nKyle Peterson: Think of that as kind of a late 2Q, maybe first week or so of 3Q impact? And I guess, if so, how are you guys thinking about auto, ex that impact for the -- at least for the balance of the year?\nMark Begor: Yes. I think we tried to highlight that we've seen really for the last, call it, couple of quarters some impact from higher interest rates on auto loans dampening some of the auto credit underwriting. So -- and I would say, we don't expect that to change in the second-half and we've reflected that in our framework until rates come down.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Mark, I just want to get a little beat on the overall consumer credit environment. I mean, it sounds from your comments that there's some deterioration sequentially. And what I'm trying to understand, is it deterioration from the bank side of things? Is it deterioration from the consumers just saying, hey, I can't afford some of the loans? And what are you seeing over there? And some of the financial and marketing area, the area that has portfolio review, are you seeing some impact over there with the growth in revenue moving up to 7%? If you could just give us a little bit of color? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Begor: Yes. I think there's been some slight softening of, I would call it, consumer demand. Like, the consumer is still strong, outside of the subprime consumer, which we know has been impacted by inflation, which -- while it's coming down on a two-year basis, what they're buying is still a bigger part of their disposable income, whether it's groceries or fuel, it's clearly impacted the subprime consumer. It's really around the rates. We saw it in mortgage, obviously. Mortgage, we've seen the impact of higher rates really impacting the mortgage market meaningfully over the last couple of years. And I think in the last six months, we've seen that flow to a less -- much lesser degree, but obviously, a negative impact in auto where you've got payments on a car with the higher rates are just substantially higher than they were a couple of years ago, and that's impacting some level of auto purchases. I think you've seen the inventories by the car dealers increase, which is probably an indicator of consumer demand there because of higher rates. And until we see some reduction in rates, I would expect that auto would be somewhat dampened. It's a -- it's probably the one that we've seen the most of. Outside of that, I think the other verticals are kind of continuing to move along. It's not a customer impact. Our customers are still strong. Our customers are still focused on growing their businesses. I think it's more of an end user demand on the consumer side.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thanks. And then you made a comment about the impact to margins, the reason margin guidance was lowered was just the timing of the cutover and some of the transition, but shouldn't impact 2025 outlook. Just trying to understand if things go out a quarter, why doesn't that snowball into 2025? Why wouldn't I kind of think about that as a 2025 number, also being kind of a quarter behind?\nMark Begor: Yeah. So I think John commented that we're at the finish line with a lot of these transformations. But when we move all our customers, there's a couple of months of overlap before we shut down the legacy infrastructure as we complete decommissioning those infrastructures. And that's still in our run rate, meaning we're still paying for those duplicate infrastructures, the new cloud and the legacy infrastructure. That will come out of '24. So we'll have full run rate in 2025, but it's delayed a couple of months because of some of the final work we're doing to complete, principally USIS, and I would say, yes, Canada is the other one that we're a few weeks behind and that pushes out those savings. So we have less benefit in '24, but we get the full benefit in '25.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nOwen Lau: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So, going back to Mark's earlier comments about rate cut, the market currently expects the rate -- to cut rate by, I think, 50 basis points to 75 basis points this year, and it may even start in September. Let's say, if the Fed cuts by 50 basis point, how much incremental benefit do you think Equifax can capture? And how do you think about all these for this year? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes, that's a tough one to actually put a point estimate on there. It's obviously going to be good news when the Fed cut rate -- cuts rates, principally in our mortgage vertical. I think you saw the chart in the deck that inquiries are down 50% from what we would call normal levels. We would expect that activity to recover as rates come down and you've got the kind of the macro challenges of consumers -- homeowners, better term, in a home at a 3% or 4% mortgage and likely want to upgrade or change, but are waiting to see rates come down from kind of the high-6s or that kind of range before they make that move. So, there's not a lot of inventory on the market. We would expect that to be positive going forward. And we've tried to frame for you that if you look at where we are today versus what we characterize as normal, that's $1.1 billion of incremental revenue, which is a huge number that -- we would expect, over time, that activity to go back towards normal. We'll see how it goes and, of course, how does the Fed move rates. The interest rates in the United States from the Fed are the highest, I think, pretty much in the globe today and they're 25-year high for the United States. It's -- we all believe, or we certainly believe that they will come down over time and then we'll have a big positive from the mortgage market recovery that we've been clear that will flow through our P&L and drive our margin expansion and free cash generation substantially as that comes back into our financials.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That's helpful. And then I remember, last quarter, talent revenue was down 4% and you saw some recovery in March and continued in April. In the second quarter, it was up 13%. Was it because of some pent-up demand from January or February, or high market has actually improved that you see the growth will be more sustainable? Thanks.\nMark Begor: I think the biggest driver -- John, you can jump in also, in talent is just continued penetration in that TAM, meaning customer wins, getting to top of waterfall, meaning they're using our solution first, kind of position some of the new products. What would you add on that, John, for talent?\nJohn Gamble: Well, we also saw really nice performance in some Insights products...\nMark Begor: Yes.\nJohn Gamble: Meaning incarceration that's used in background checks, and we also started to see some growth around some education products. So, generally speaking, as we talked about last quarter, January and February are very weak in terms of hiring. What we saw was weaker-than-normal and then we saw a recovery in March and we got a little better performance in the second quarter because of that recovery also in our normal income and employment products, but also because we saw nice performance from some of the other products that we use that support the talent market.\nOwen Lau: All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. Can you discuss, if you would, your AI spending here? I'm just curious, the dollars you're spending on that and going forward here, are you doing that within the context of, say, your normal technology budget, putting aside the cloud and stuff, within -- inside your normal technology budget here or it's just displacing other spending that you normally would do on the technology side\u2026\nMark Begor: No, no, there's..\nCraig Huber: Incremental.\nMark Begor: Yes.\nCraig Huber: That it's actually hurting margins?\nMark Begor: Yes. And it's -- well, I don't know. We don't -- I don't think about it's hurting our margins, but we're investing for obvious reasons in what we believe is a very important growth lever for us of enhancing our scores, models, and products using AI and ML. This isn't new at Equifax, but we've been consistently increasing our focus and spend around resources and capabilities for AI. The tech transformation provides a big lever there with our own AI capabilities and then leveraging that with Google's Vertex AI. So, being in the cloud is a big positive for us. And then we've been investing in more resources and people. I mentioned that we brought on a really strong leader from the industry -- it was actually from one of our customers, that we're excited to have in the business to lead AI and ML for us. You've seen the use of AI expanding. We had a goal of 80% of our models and scores this year to be using our new AI and ML. And I think we're at 89% in the quarter, so north of our goal, which is a good thing. As we move forward, we will move to 100%, right? That's where we're heading. So this is a big lever, and it's one of the pillars of our EFX 2026 strategic priorities, is to really leverage. And what it's going to deliver for our customers is just higher-performing solutions. They're going to be more predictable. They'll help them drive higher approval rates at lower losses, or higher identity validations in our identity businesses. We're super energized and the ability to have all of our data in a single data fabric and to have the Equifax cloud substantially complete as we finish up in the next number of weeks in the USIS, that gives us big, big opportunities to really take our product capabilities and really charge them with AI and ML. So we're super-excited about this as a priority going forward.\nJohn Gamble: And when you think about spending, like a significant amount of our capital spending is around getting data into fabric to make it available easily across all of our businesses, which dramatically accelerates AI and ML. So, compare our spending to what other companies talk about in AI and ML, you would probably need to include a bunch of the transformation spending we're doing, because we're doing data normalization in a way that other companies have to do, but we're doing it as part of our ongoing process improvements. So we're spending substantially on AI and ML.\nCraig Huber: And then my follow-up question, please. On credit cards, you just touched on your outlook there for the rest of the year-on a year-over-year basis. Just refresh us what happened again in the first quarter and second quarter there.\nMark Begor: Yes, no change in the second-half from the first quarter. As you know, there's a small portion of the credit card space that's in subprime that's went through a cycle in, really, '22 and '23, where there was some dampening there because of credit risk exposure with the subprime consumer. That's flattened out, meaning they're kind of at a run rate level. So, that is behind us. And then in the prime/near-prime, it's still a good business for us and we don't see any real changes there.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. Banking and lending, we said, has been growing kind of mid-single-digits, a little higher in the first, a little lower in a second. But that's what it's looked like in the first-half. So we think relatively good performance there.\nCraig Huber: You expect it to continue like that in the second-half, you're saying?\nMark Begor: We do. Again, you go from -- kind of take second-half, take 2025, the consumer is strong, they're working. If you think about prime/near-prime consumers, they're -- have -- they have wage growth and they have balance sheet growth from the equity markets. We've all seen the spending behavior from, broadly, the U.S. consumer base kind of post-COVID is very strong. So, that's a good outlook, and our customers are strong. They have strong balance sheets and these are important businesses for them that they want to keep growing. So they're spending money on marketing and they want to originate. And then for us, if we can continue to deliver differentiated solutions that help them grow their businesses faster, that's going to be a good thing for USIS in the card space and along the rest of FI.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to the mortgage outperformance in Verifier. I think it was just slightly lower than last quarter, and I know you had expected it to be up slightly. Could you just give a little bit more color on what's going on there? Is there a mix component like last quarter that was unfavorable? Just any sort of drivers that maybe led to a little bit of a worse expectation?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. Toni, we would characterize it as much consistent with the guidance we gave, right? Slight up to slight down is pretty close to the same thing. So we think we were very consistent with the guidance we gave. I can't point to anything specific, right, as to why there would be a small variances between where it came in and what we said. But overall, it was fairly consistent with what we expected, which is what gives us some comfort that as we go through into the second-half of the year that we're going to see the improved performance that we expect because, again, we talked about it multiple times because of records, right? So we feel good about that.\nToni Kaplan: Okay. Great. And then I wanted to ask another on International, just very strong organic growth this quarter. It looked like LATAM was really the standout there with 30% organic growth. Have you seen share gains there? Or is it still a little bit too early? And just how are you thinking about LATAM for the rest of the year?\nMark Begor: Yes. In LATAM, the principal driver in there is outside of Brazil. Brazil had a good quarter, and we do expect over the medium and long-term to continue to grow that business well, but it's still early days in Brazil. But strong performance in really most of the markets in Latin America, driven by new products and innovation, Argentina, Chile, a lot of the markets where we have strong leadership positions in those markets. But if you go across the rest of International, U.K. CRA was very strong. U.K. debt management was very strong. Those are growing kind of above market in U.K., particularly CRA, had another very good quarter and likely some share gains in that market. Canada was just above mid-single-digits, which was a very good performance. Australia, below where we would like them to be, but we expect them to recover as it moves forward. But product -- new products, a very positive driver across International as they're driving innovation.\nJohn Gamble: And we -- gave full-year guidance. So again, I think we gave a perspective on where we expect the year to come in. We expect International to perform well. We expect LATAM to perform well, not quite as strong as the second quarter, but still the rest of the year should be good.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to an earlier point, which was in the USIS nonmortgage business, you saw a continuation of tight credit conditions that impacted the auto market and...\nMark Begor: That's not what I said, George. But go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Yes. I guess how are you thinking about the broader credit conditions in the second-half of the year?\nMark Begor: Just to clarify, I did not say that there were tight credit conditions in auto. There are in subprime, but that's old news, right? That happened a year ago, two years ago, in '22 and '23, as I think you know. What I talked about was our view that the high rates in auto are impacting end-user demand for financing automobiles, meaning buying automobiles in the last couple of quarters. And it's really a follow-on of what we see in mortgage. The payment levels now for a new car for someone who's financing it are substantially higher than they were a couple of years ago. So we think that's impacted consumer demand, not credit underwriting. So just to clarify that. And I'm sorry, the second-half of your question was what?\nGeorge Tong: In the second-half of the year, how are you thinking about broader credit conditions, not just in auto, but just broadly.\nMark Begor: Yes. So from a credit conditions, we see the consumer continuing to be strong. Employment is high, unemployment is low. That's always a positive for underwriting when the consumers are working. Broadly, credit scores are still strong. I think we've talked before with you and others about the impact of subprime, but that's kind of flattened out from the declines we saw in '22 and '23. And another thing that we think a lot about on credit conditions is the strength of your customers, meaning other financial institutions, and they're broadly very strong. So those elements are very good. The one area -- two areas, obviously, we're seeing impact on consumer demand because of rates is clearly mortgage has been substantial, which we've talked at length about, and then we're seeing some impact in auto.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And then in EWS non-mortgage, a lot of the growth is linked from record additions and volumes. Can you talk a bit about how much pricing is contributing to growth, particularly in Verifications?\nMark Begor: Yes. As you know, we have four really principal levers in EWS, records is one. And as you point out, it's been very strong, which we're pleased with. Price is one. As you know, we don't disclose price but it's one lever. You should think about, George, that we have substantial benefits from penetration, meaning penetrating into new verticals. I think we've talked about that in Government and Talent and others. And then product is a big deal, bringing new solutions that deliver more value to our customers, meaning whether it's multiple data solutions or more historical data, those are generally at a different higher price point because they're bringing more value. But those four levers over the long-term, we think about as being equally weighted in the 13% to 15% and then add some market on top of that, meaning market growth. That's how you get to the 13% to 15%. So we're really energized to have those strong levers. When you think about EWS, clearly, the records -- ability to add records is very unique to that business and most data businesses. So it's a lever that we don't have in other businesses. I would argue penetration is also one that we don't have in other businesses. We don't compete with manual in other businesses. We generally compete with competitors like TU and Experian competing with manual is one that gives us the opportunity to add real value from a productivity standpoint, as well as the speed and accuracy standpoint of instant data that comes from EWS.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nMark Begor: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor Burns for any further closing comments.\nTrevor Burns: Yes. Thanks, everybody, for their time today. And if you have any follow-up questions, just reach out to me -- Look forward to catching up throughout the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Turning to slide 11, consistent with our practice from the first-half of 2024 and the last several years, our guidance for credit inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two weeks to four weeks, modified to reflect normal seasonal patterns. We have seen 30-year mortgage rates just under 7% for the last five weeks. However, we have not seen meaningful improvement in the run rate of either credit or TWN inquiries, although we continue to expect mortgage market activity to improve as rates come down in the future. Our guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 7% in 3Q24 and 11% in calendar year '24, which for the full-year is consistent with our April guidance. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries in the third quarter to be down over 7%, and for the full year, down approaching 14%. Second-half TWN inquiries are down about consistent with the decline in credit inquiries, reflecting an expected normalization of the mortgage shopping we saw in the first-half of the year as interest rates remain stable or begin to decline. As a reminder, and as we discussed in April, we expect the level of U.S. mortgage revenue outperformance to moderate as we move through 2024, as we start to lap the growth in new mortgage pre-qual products. We expect 3Q USIS mortgage revenue outperformance to be over 30%, down from the 40% in the second quarter, with full-year USIS mortgage outperformance expected to be about 40%. We expect TWN revenue mortgage outperformance in the second-half to increase sequentially from the new records we boarded in the second quarter. Slide 12 provides the details of our 3Q \u201824 guidance. In 3Q \u201824, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.425 billion and $1.445 billion, with revenue up about 9% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should be up about 10%. Mortgage revenue in the third quarter is expected to be up over 12%. Mortgage revenue will be just under 20% of total revenue. FX is negative to revenue about 2%. Business unit performance in the third quarter is expected to be as follows. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 8%, with non-mortgage revenue up about 10%. Non-mortgage verifier revenue should again be very strong in the third quarter, with growth slightly under the 20% we saw in the second quarter, again, driven by government and talent solutions. EWS mortgage revenue should return to growth and be up slightly in the third quarter. Both verifier mortgage and non-mortgage revenue growth benefit from the strong growth in TWN records we are seeing throughout 2024. And employer services revenue is expected to decline over 15% in the quarter, principally due to declines in ERC. We expect employer services to return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 51.5%, down about 100 basis points sequentially, principally from product mix. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 8.5% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of over 2% should be up from the up 1% we saw this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up about 34%, up sequentially about 100 basis points as USIS begins decommissioning legacy consumer and telco and utility systems. International revenue is expected to be up about 18% in constant currency, which includes the benefit of the acquisition of BVS that was completed August of 2023. Revenue is expected to be up about 12% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 28%, reflecting revenue growth. Equifax 3Q \u201824 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be under 33% at the midpoint of our guidance, with a sequential increase reflecting revenue growth and the early stages of decommissioning of legacy consumer and telco and utility assets. Adjusted EPS in 3Q \u201824 is expected to be $1.75 to $1.85 per share, up 2% versus 3Q \u201823 at the midpoint. As of the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.0 times, with a goal by year-end 2024 of about 2.5 times. We believe this leverage is nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases, as well as continue to do bolt-on acquisitions in 2025 and beyond. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full-year guidance, which is overall unchanged from the full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance we provided in April and is centered at the midpoint. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5%, with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% at the middle of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 10%, despite the over 10% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10%, with organic growth of about 8%, led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services business, with continued strong organic growth in international and improving non-mortgage growth in USIS. This is within our long-term framework. FX is about 180 basis points negative to revenue. As Mark discussed earlier, we are maintaining the midpoint of adjusted EPS at $7.35 per share. EBITDA margins, however, are expected to be 32.6%, down from the over 33% we discussed earlier this year. As Mark discussed, we are making very good progress on cloud migrations. However, they are completing up to a quarter later than we had planned. As a result, our cloud cost savings are lower due to timing in 2024, which negatively impacts EBITDA. Partially offsetting this impact is lower depreciation. As these effects are timing of completion, they only impact 2024 and do not impact the cost savings we expect to achieve in 2025 and beyond. Full-year BU guidance is principally consistent with what was shared in April, with the exception of the impact on USIS and international EBITDA margins per my previous discussion. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 7%, with non-mortgage revenue up about 10%. Non-mortgage verifier revenue should be up over 15%, driven by government and talent solutions. EWS mortgage revenue should be down 3% for the year. EWS margins are expected to be about 52%. USIS revenue is expected to be up 9% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of about 2% is expected to be up from the 1% we saw in the first-half of 2024. USIS EBITDA margin should be about 34%, down about 50 basis points from our April guidance. And international revenue is expected to be up over 15% in constant-currency, which includes the benefit of the acquisition of BVS. Revenue is expected to be up about 10% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to approach 27.5%, down from 28% in our April guidance. Using the midpoint of our 3Q \u201824 and fiscal year '24 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS, the implied 4Q \u201824 midpoint for revenue is $1.465 billion, up 10% year-to-year and $30 million sequentially. And for adjusted EPS is $2.23 per share, up over 20% year-to-year. The improvement in adjusted EPS in 4Q \u201824 sequentially from 3Q \u201824 is certainly substantial and requires strong execution. The drivers of this improvement are expected to be as follows. About half of the improvement is driven by the sequential revenue growth at our very high variable margins. Revenue mix also should drive improved margins as non-mortgage revenue grows strongly sequentially and mortgage revenue declines sequentially. Mortgage has much lower margins relative to non-mortgage, principally due to much higher royalties and purchased data file costs in mortgage. Cost and expense reductions drive about a quarter of the improvement. These cost reductions are principally due to completion of cloud migrations in North America and Europe, resulting in lower COGS and also lower development expense. In addition to the cost benefit from completion of cloud migrations, we continue to execute fixed cost and expense reductions, which will also benefit 4Q \u201824. Items below operating profit, principally taxes, represent on the order of 20% of the improvement. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be about $485 million, which is a year-to-year reduction of about $100 million. This is up from our April guidance, reflecting the timing of completion of the migrations to the Equifax Cloud that I just referenced. In the first-half of 2024, CapEx was $256 million, down almost $50 million year-to-year. We expect capital expenditures in the second-half to decline further as the tech transformation activities I previously discussed complete. Turning to slide 14, and as we discussed in April, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the mortgage market recovers toward its historic norms, that represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax in 2025 and beyond, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our high mortgage margins, this over $1 billion of mortgage revenue would deliver on the order of $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Yes, I don't think we're going to get into 2025 guidance, but in terms of third quarter and fourth quarter, we've baked in the cost savings related to the North American consumer businesses completing transformation in the third quarter and beginning their decommissioning, and we've done the same thing with regard to Spain and some other movements we've talked about in Mark's script in the fourth quarter. So when I talk about... Absolutely. As we talked about in the bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, a significant portion of those savings, as Mark said, really gets in the fourth quarter, because the transformations and the completion of the transformations and beginning to be decommissionings don't start until later in the third quarter. Andrew, to your specific question, it's -- 21% was the exact number. No, Mark's already talked quite a bit about the distraction from transformation that does recover in the third quarter. We start to come out of that right, but again we're just finishing transformation in the quarter. So you're not going to see a lot of benefit in the third quarter. You don't start to see that till fourth quarter and really next year. You are starting to see NPI improvements in USIS. But again, those are not going to really accelerate until you get to the fourth quarter and next year. Yes. So just as an overarching statement, right? It's important to remember that EWS verifier is benefiting in the second-half, really significantly related to record additions, right? They've done an outstanding job with adding new partners. We had a significant partner come online very late in the quarter. And we -- as Mark said, we added four more. We added a substantial number in the first-half. Those records are coming online, and that drives a substantial amount of revenue in the second-half. No problem. And as you get into fourth quarter, obviously, what you're seeing from third quarter to fourth quarter is there's some traditional strength generally from third quarter to fourth quarter in talent, right? Just because of seasonal hiring in I-9, because of seasonal hiring where we do onboarding for companies. We generally see some strength in banking and card, around CLIs. And then importantly, in CMS, ACA sign-ups start in the fourth quarter. So we generally see nice growth in government going into the fourth quarter. And then you layer on top of that the strength in records, and that's what gives us confidence that we're going to see good performance as we go through the back half of the year in verifier non-mortgage. Mortgage, we've talked about, I think that's been covered. And employer, what we're seeing is, as we get into the fourth quarter, the significant impact of ERC that we saw through the first nine months of the year, we wrap around the decline that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. So employer revenue on a year-over-year basis, the growth rate will be substantially better. As we said, we expect to be flat to slightly up relative to the declines that we've been seeing, and that's principally driven by the fact that we saw a big decline in ERC in the fourth quarter of '23. So, I'd say that's why we feel good about the way EWS is trending and the opportunities to drive the revenue growth we're talking about. And as Mark referenced and we talked about in the script, right, I mean, obviously, we know third quarter to fourth quarter requires a lot of execution. But we have a lot of confidence in the way the teams are executing right now and it's around completing the transformations. We think we have very good visibility into how that's going to complete and the timing. And in the second quarter, we saw very nice growth out of the insights portfolio -- incarceration, as Mark referenced, helping us drive the talent growth rate. So that was a nice growth area for us in the second quarter. Yes. And in terms of 2024, just looking at sequential trends, right, I think the sequential trends we're seeing in the second quarter were good and strong. And third quarter and fourth quarter, I think, are very consistent with what we've seen in the past. And specifically, the -- as we referenced, the growth we're expecting into the fourth quarter is heavily driven by CMS and the fact that ACA starts in the fourth quarter, and every year, we see a pop in revenue from that agreement with CMS, in 4Q and then again in 1Q. Faiza, we can't hear you. The only thing I'd add is, we're also seeing nice growth in the use of Ignite in pre-screening and Ignite by our customers. That's important, because that's also the platform in which we're deploying our proprietary and then also Vertex AI. So we're making that available to our customers, and it allows us to expand and -- expand the use that we have substantially. So we feel very, very good about the fact that we're seeing accelerating adoption of Ignite in the marketplace with our customers using it directly and with us developing products internally. Just in terms of how we expect EWS mortgage to perform relative to inquiries, right, as we talked about, a lot of our improvement in the second-half is driven again by records, right? So, Mark talked a lot about the fact that we've done a really nice job of adding new partners, and we're adding a significant number of records, a lot of them boarded late in the second quarter. So we are expecting to see revenue benefits in EWS from record additions, from the records that were added at the end of the second quarter and also the record we're going to add throughout the rest of this year. And that's really the big driver. Yes. We're also looking -- we're also expecting some benefits from new products. I think we've mentioned that in the past, some marketing products that we're trying to put in place earlier in the approval funnel. So, we're going to continue to work on NPI in EWS mortgage, but the big driver certainly in the second-half of 2024 is driven by the strong performance and records in the first-half of 2024, as well as what we expect to continue to do in the rest of this year. Yes. So, in terms of 2025 EBITDA margins, we'll give you guidance on that as we get into 2025. But as we've been talking about, and Mark talked about the fact that we expect, on a long-term model, 50 basis points of improvement per year. And we do expect to see nice improvement in margins as we get into 2025. In terms of an exact level, we'll talk more about that as we get into next year. Now, in the second-half, we've assumed it narrows and that they tend to trend -- they're going to trend together. Now, again, that's based on our expectation. It's also based on the trends we're seeing today, right? So, as we just run out the trends for the rest of the year and apply seasonality, separately, it looks like the movement in USIS credit inquiries and in TWN inquiries, should move on a percentage basis year-on-year similarly, right? So we'll have to see, right? I mean, we have been surprised in the past, where sometimes the shopping behavior continues longer than we expect. But right now, it looks like it's starting to narrow and we can also see it analytically. Yes. So if we take a look at Kount and Midigator together, what we saw actually was, let's call it, the fraud part -- portion of the business performed better. We continue to see growth. We saw a little bit of weakness in chargeback management, which is, let's call, the Midigator part of the business, right? So we're expecting -- we've launched a lot of new products and platforms now in Kount, right? Kount 360 is now live. We're expecting to see that platform take hold. So we're expecting to see improved performance as we move through the rest of this year around Kount. And then around chargeback management, as we integrate chargeback management into the Kount 360 platform, we would expect to see some improvement there as well. So -- but I'd say that what we're seeing -- and it's a good news on the margin front, because the fraud business has better margins. We're seeing a little bit of performance in fraud, and given the launch of new products, our expectation is that the area will see improved performance first as we go through the rest of the year. We did. We have the -- it's -- it was in Brazil, right? And there's -- there was a substantial flooding in the South of Brazil and it certainly impacted our business, although our Brazil business has actually performed fairly consistently with the plans we put in place when we started the year. So... Well, we also saw really nice performance in some Insights products... Meaning incarceration that's used in background checks, and we also started to see some growth around some education products. So, generally speaking, as we talked about last quarter, January and February are very weak in terms of hiring. What we saw was weaker-than-normal and then we saw a recovery in March and we got a little better performance in the second quarter because of that recovery also in our normal income and employment products, but also because we saw nice performance from some of the other products that we use that support the talent market. And when you think about spending, like a significant amount of our capital spending is around getting data into fabric to make it available easily across all of our businesses, which dramatically accelerates AI and ML. So, compare our spending to what other companies talk about in AI and ML, you would probably need to include a bunch of the transformation spending we're doing, because we're doing data normalization in a way that other companies have to do, but we're doing it as part of our ongoing process improvements. So we're spending substantially on AI and ML. Yes. Banking and lending, we said, has been growing kind of mid-single-digits, a little higher in the first, a little lower in a second. But that's what it's looked like in the first-half. So we think relatively good performance there. Yes. Toni, we would characterize it as much consistent with the guidance we gave, right? Slight up to slight down is pretty close to the same thing. So we think we were very consistent with the guidance we gave. I can't point to anything specific, right, as to why there would be a small variances between where it came in and what we said. But overall, it was fairly consistent with what we expected, which is what gives us some comfort that as we go through into the second-half of the year that we're going to see the improved performance that we expect because, again, we talked about it multiple times because of records, right? So we feel good about that. And we -- gave full-year guidance. So again, I think we gave a perspective on where we expect the year to come in. We expect International to perform well. We expect LATAM to perform well, not quite as strong as the second quarter, but still the rest of the year should be good."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Before I cover our strong second quarter results, I want to update you on the significant progress in our cloud transformation. Over the next several weeks, USIS will complete the migration on to the cloud data fabric of all customers and services for their consumer credit and telco and utilities exchanges, which is a huge milestone for Equifax. Along with the EWS Work Number Exchange, which we completed migrating to the Equifax Cloud over two years ago, we will have our three largest data exchanges in the new Equifax Cloud. As of the end of July, we expect over 80% of Equifax revenue will be in the Equifax Cloud, with about 90% of our revenue in the cloud by year-end. The cloud migrations have been a huge effort across Equifax over the four plus -- the past four-plus years. We expect to have a significant competitive advantage as we pivot from building to leveraging the cloud that will allow us to fully focus on growth, innovation, new products, and AI going forward. Completing the USIS cloud and expanding EFX.AI, along with continued expansion of our differentiated data assets, will accelerate innovation and new products at USIS that will drive our top and bottom line. We now have streamlined access to our proprietary data through the data fabric, which will accelerate new product development. We also expect to reduce product development times, resulting in faster time to market for our new solutions. USIS has already begun to see their New Product Vitality Index accelerate. USIS is deploying Equifax proprietary Explainable AI, along with Google Vertex AI across Ignite, our global analytics platform, and Interconnect, our global decisioning platform. For USIS, Vertex AI enables faster and more predictive model development on our Ignite platform. The USIS cloud will deliver always on stability and faster data transmission that will give Equifax a competitive advantage in today's digital market, driving share gains. We're also driving faster data ingestion and analytics with greater processing power with the new Equifax Cloud. And most importantly, completing the cloud is going to free up the USIS team to fully focus on growth and expanding innovation, new products, data sets and markets. With both USIS and EWS in the cloud, we'll also be able to begin development of new products that integrate TWN income and employment data with USIS credit data solutions for mortgage, auto, cards, and P loans that only Equifax can deliver. Completing the USIS consumer and telco and utility migrations to the Equifax Cloud allows us to start decommissioning legacy on-prem systems in the third quarter, supporting our goal of spending reductions in 2024 that will improve operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. In the second quarter, we also made substantial progress on our international cloud transformation activities. Canada is expected to complete their consumer credit exchange customer migrations to data fabric next month. Europe continues to make significant progress with the goal of completing Spain's consumer credit exchange migration to the data fabric and decommissioning of their legacy systems by year-end, and the U.K. is on schedule to complete cloud migrations and decommissioning in the first-half of 2025. And in Latin America, we've completed the Argentina and Chile cloud migrations and expect to make substantial progress on several additional Latin American countries in the second-half of this year. It's energizing to be approaching the finish line of our cloud transformation. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. Now, turning to slide four, we had a strong second quarter, with reported revenue just over $1.43 billion, up 9% and just over the top end of our April guidance. Adjusted EBITDA margins at 32% were in line with our expectations, and adjusted EPS at $1.82 per share was well above the high end of our April guidance. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represents about 80% of total Equifax revenue in the quarter, had strong 13% current constant currency revenue growth, which is above the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. Non-mortgage organic constant currency revenue growth was at 9% in the quarter and also at the top end of our 7% to 10% organic revenue growth framework. This performance was driven by 20% non-mortgage growth in EWS Verifier, led by strong 30% growth in government and talent that was up over 13%. International delivered 28% constant dollar revenue growth and strong 12% organic growth, led by strong growth in Latin America and Europe. USIS non-mortgage revenue growth of 1% was in line with last quarter and somewhat weaker than our expectations. We expect to see accelerating growth in USIS non-mortgage revenue as we complete the US consumer cloud migration later this month. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 4% in the quarter. The growth in mortgage revenue was driven by USIS, where mortgage revenue was up a strong 27% and consistent with our expectations. The strong growth in USIS mortgage reflects the continued benefit from strong vendor pass-through pricing actions and performance in our new mortgage pre-qual products. EWS mortgage revenue was down just under 12% and also consistent with our expectations. Equifax also had another strong quarter of new product innovation with a Vitality Index of almost 13%, above our 10% frame for 2024 guidance and our long-term 10% vitality framework. The vitality was up 350 basis points sequentially from broad-based execution across all of our business units, and EWS was particularly strong with a 17% vitality. Turning to slide five, Workforce Solutions revenue was up 5% and well above our expectations. Non-mortgage verification services revenue delivered very strong 20% growth, up 500 basis points sequentially and well above our expectations. Government had another outstanding quarter, with very strong 30% revenue growth from continued growth in penetration in their big $5 billion TAM. Government revenue grew sequentially from strong growth in state revenues despite the substantial completion at the end of March of post-COVID CMS initial redeterminations. We expect continued strong government growth over the medium and long-term in Workforce Solutions. Talent solutions revenue was up a strong 13% in the quarter, up 17 percentage points sequentially and well above our expectations. Talent solutions volumes improved sequentially and we saw very strong growth in our insights incarceration data products in the talent vertical. Based on data through May, EWS talent solutions outperformed the BLS white-collar hiring markets by approximately 19 percentage points from new records, new products, and penetration into the vertical. EWS mortgage revenue was down just under 12% and in line with our April guidance. TWN inquires in the second quarter were down 18% and consistent with the down 19% we discussed with you in April. TWN inquiries continue to be weaker than USIS credit inquiries as buyers continue to have difficulty completing home purchases. EWS total mortgage revenue outperformed TWN inquiries by over 6%. We expect EWS mortgage revenue to benefit significantly in the third and fourth quarters from the significant growth in TWN records already delivered late in the second quarter and from planned additions in the third quarter and fourth quarter. EWS consumer lending revenue was up 8% from strong double-digit growth in P loans and debt management and high-single digit growth in auto. Employer services revenue was down 11%, principally from lower ERC revenue. Excluding ERC, revenue was lower than expected at down 2% due to lower WOTC revenue as we talked about in April, partially offset by positive ACA revenue growth. We expect employer revenue to return to growth in the fourth quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 53% were up 170 basis points sequentially and continue to be very strong from non-mortgage verifier revenue growth and good cost execution, while we continue to invest in new products, expand in high-growth verticals like government and talent, and grow our TWN records. Before moving on to USIS, I want to acknowledge the significant contribution of Rudy Ploder made to EWS and Equifax over the last 20-years. Under Rudy's leadership, EWS revenue grew from about $900 million in 2019 to $2.3 billion last year and has positioned EWS for strong above market growth, leveraging the Equifax Cloud. We're super energized to have Chad Borton, who joined us in May, leading Workforce Solutions. Chad's broad financial service experience, proven executive leadership, customer focus, and regulatory depth will be a big asset for EWS as they continue to drive above market growth. Turning to slide six, we continue to see very strong revenue growth in our EWS government vertical with 30% growth in the quarter and above our expectations. On the left side of the slide, we provided some of the federal agencies we are supporting with EWS digital income employment and incarceration data that accelerate the time to delivery needed -- to deliver needed social service benefits to over 90 million Americans and help government agencies ensure program integrity, a win-win for all parties. And in the middle of the slide, you see the substantial progress our EWS government vertical has made in a short time frame, penetrating that $5 billion TAM with a three-year CAGR of over 50%. We expect EWS government to continue to make significant progress in the government vertical from additional sales resources to federal and individual state capital level, strong record growth; new product rollouts; leveraging our differentiated incarcerated data -- incarceration data; and system-to-system integrations enabled by our cloud-native technology that makes our solutions easier to consume. EWS continues to help federal, state, and local government agencies improve the consumer experience and their own operating efficiency from the application and authentication phases to redetermination and recovery processes. The strength of the EWS government vertical was again clear in the quarter and we expect strong future revenue growth in this business in '25 and beyond. Turning to slide seven, EWS had another strong quarter of new record additions, signing agreements with four new strategic partners that will contribute over 3 million records collectively to the TWN database. Our continued success in expanding partnerships is a testament to EWS' ability to deliver the highest levels of client service from technology, data security and accuracy, and operational excellence for our partners and their end customers. We expect these new partnerships to come online and begin generating revenue for Workforce Solutions in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, EWS added 8 million active records to the TWN database, ending the quarter with 180 million active records, up a strong 12% on 132 million unique individuals. Total records are now 695 million and were up 10% versus last year. At 132 million unique individuals, we have plenty of room to grow the TWN database towards the TAM of 225 million income-producing Americans. EWS is also making very good progress building a pipeline of pension and 1099 contributors, as well as with HR software companies in partnerships and they expect to close partnerships in the second-half of the year as we continue focus on expanding the TWN database. Turning to slide eight, USIS revenue was up 7%, solidly within our long-term revenue growth framework of 6% to 8%. USIS mortgage revenue grew 27% and was in line with our April guidance. Mortgage credit inquiries, while continuing to be down significantly year-over-year at down 13%, were largely in line with our April guidance. Despite the modest reduction in mortgage rates we've seen over the last several weeks, we have not seen an improvement in mortgage market inquiries, likely due to continued low new home inventory levels. Consistent with the first quarter, the strong pricing environment, along with the strength of our pre-qual products drove the very strong mortgage revenue growth and outperformance. At $143 million, mortgage revenue was about 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Total non-mortgage revenue at up 1% was below our expectation of 2% growth. We saw strong growth in consumer solutions and financial marketing services, which were partially offset by a decline in USIS B2B online revenue. We believe growth in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the U.S. team's broad-based focus on completing customer cloud migrations, which likely dampened some of the new business activity we were expecting. USIS online B2B non-mortgage revenue was down about 4% and below our expectations. Consistent with trends from the first quarter, we saw a continuation of tight credit conditions, which impacted the auto market, as well as the broader FI vertical. Auto was also impacted by a software supplier system outage that we all read about. USIS saw double-digit declines in third-party bureau sales and a lesser extent low-single-digit declines in telco and auto. These declines were partially offset by growth in the broader FI market and in insurance. ID and fraud was also below our expectations, as was auto. Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business, was up 7%. Marketing revenue was up 4%, primarily due to growth in pre-screen marketing. Our pre-screen quarterly trends have been fairly consistent, with growth coming from large FIs and fintechs, offset by declines in mid-sized banks and credit unions. USIS is seeing growing demand for our suite of Ignite solutions, including Ignite for Prospecting. Fraud revenue was up a very strong 15% from new business wins. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 13% from strong double-digit growth in consumer direct channel and high-single digit growth in our indirect channel. We expect mid-single digit growth in our D2C business in the second-half of this year against strong comps from last year. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 33.2% in the quarter and below our expectations, reflecting its lower-than-expected revenue growth. In USIS, the significant efforts across the business to complete the cloud transformation clearly had an impact on USIS customer engagement and non-mortgage revenue growth in the first-half. As USIS consumer cloud migration is completed in the next few weeks, the USIS team will now be able to fully focus on customer engagement and growth and we expect USIS non-mortgage revenue to see improved growth in the second-half of this year and, of course, in '25 and beyond. Turning to slide nine, international revenue was up a very strong 28% in constant currency and up a strong 12% in organic constant currency in the quarter, excluding the impact of BVS and well above the 20% growth we guided to in April due to continued very strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Europe local currency revenue was up a very strong 12% in the quarter, with continued strong 6% growth in our credit and data businesses and from very strong 23% growth in our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue was up 124%, principally due to the acquisition of Boa Vista, with very strong organic growth of 30%. Latin America organic revenue growth was driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Paraguay and Central America. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We continue to make good progress on the Brazil integration. Equifax Interconnect solution was launched for small business and medium businesses in the second quarter in Brazil with full feature release to service larger clients in the second-half. The first apps of Ignite have also been launched. Identity and fraud solutions, including count and mitigator, are now available for Brazilian customers, and Brazil is driving accelerated negative data acquisition to add to their database. The team is making excellent progress on driving growth and integrating with Equifax. Canada delivered 6% growth in the quarter. As I previously mentioned, we expect Canada to complete their consumer credit exchange customer migrations to the new Equifax Cloud in the next few weeks. And similar to USIS, we are expecting to see accelerated new product rollouts and growth going forward from the Canadian team. In Asia Pacific, revenue was down about 2%, as expected, better than the down 10% in the first quarter. We expect Asia Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second-half. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.6% were above our expectations and up 130 basis points sequentially, given their strong revenue growth performance. Turning to slide 10, we continue to make very strong progress driving innovation, with over 30 new products launched in the quarter that delivered a 12.5% Vitality Index, which was up 350 basis points sequentially and was driven by broad-based performance across all of our business units. EWS had a strong second quarter with Vitality Index of 17%, up 700 basis points sequentially. And we expect EWS VI to remain strong in the second-half with new product introductions focused on incarceration data, mortgage pre-qual or shopping behavior and I-9 and onboarding solutions. USIS saw continued sequential improvement with a Vitality Index of 8%, up 100 basis points sequentially. We expect USIS to continue to show strong VI performance from cloud completion as they leverage our new cloud-native infrastructure for innovation and new products in identity and fraud, commercial, and our new mortgage pre-qual products. International also had strong 11% VI in the quarter, up 200 basis points sequentially. We expect strong Equifax double-digit VI in the second-half, leveraging our Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts with a full-year VI for Equifax of over 10%. EFX.AI is one of our key EFX2026 strategic priorities, enabled by our new Equifax Cloud. We're energized to have a new AI leader onboard who will drive our strategic vision and execution in Explainable EFX.AI. We are accelerating the pace at which we are developing new Equifax models and scores using AI and ML in areas such as identity and fraud and consumer loan affordability that drive performance and predictability of our solutions. In the second quarter, 89% of our new models and scores were built using AI and ML, which is up 400 basis points sequentially and ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. Before I turn it over to John, I wanted to provide a few comments on our full-year 2024 guidance. We're maintaining our 2024 guidance midpoint with revenue of $5.72 billion, up 8.6% and adjusted EPS of $7.35 a share, up 9.5%. This guidance implies a strong second-half for Equifax, with revenue at the midpoint of $2.9 billion, up over 9.5%, and adjusted EPS of $4.03 per share, up 13%. Consistent with our practice, this framework assumes mortgage market activity consistent with the levels we saw in June and early July, resulting in a estimated full-year USIS credit inquiries at down 11% and consistent with our April guidance. As you know, we're using current trends to forecast mortgage market activity and have not seen a strengthening in the mortgage market activity despite the recent modest decline in rates and have not reflected the impact of any Fed rate cuts in the second-half. Delivering this level of performance in the second-half against the U.S. mortgage market that continues at the levels we saw in the first-half, we believe, is very strong Equifax performance. It reflects constant dollar non-mortgage growth of about 10%, again led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services businesses and with strong continued growth -- organic growth in international and improving non-mortgage growth in USIS despite the continuation of the tight credit markets we saw in the first quarter and second quarter in the U.S., leading to some weakening in the auto market and also impacting the broader FI market. While we expect a continued weak mortgage market, we expect to grow mortgage revenue by 18% in the second-half. Of course, we continue to expect significant future mortgage market improvements as rates come down and mortgage market activity returns to normal 2015 to '19 levels. As we've shared previously, we expect to flow the $1.1 billion mortgage revenue recovery through to EBITDA as mortgage market activity improves at our very high mortgage market gross margins. And we're continuing to deliver expanded EBITDA margin growth, principally in the fourth quarter as we complete the transformation of our US consumer businesses and our businesses in Canada, Spain, Chile, and Argentina. Now, I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and to provide our third quarter framework. Our third quarter guidance builds on our strong second quarter performance from new products, penetration, record growth, and pricing. Thanks, John. Wrapping up on slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 11% constant currency revenue growth, which was at the upper end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX2026 strategic priorities. Our very strong 20% EWS non-mortgage verifier revenue growth, 12% EWS active record growth, and strong 12.5% broad-based VI give us momentum as we enter the second-half of 2024. A big priority for 2024 is to complete our North America cloud transformation, as well as significant portions of our global markets, which will enhance our competitiveness, drive margin expansion, reduce our capital intensity, expand our free cash flow for bolt-on M&A, dividend growth, and share repurchases. Completing the USIS consumer cloud migrations in the next few weeks is a significant milestone for Equifax. We continue to expect CapEx to decrease in 2024 by about $100 million to under 8.5% of revenue with further reductions in 2025, allowing us to move towards our long-term CapEx goal of 6% to 7% of revenue as we exit next year. Entering 2025 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud is a big milestone, so the Equifax team can move towards fully focusing on growth. Another significant EFX2026 strategic priority is to drive innovation through our investments in EFX.AI. AI and machine learning are changing the way we develop new products in our single data fabric, the way we -- and allowing us to build higher performing models, scores, and products, ingest and cleanse data, and operate our consumer care centers more effectively. We're on offense at Equifax with EFX.AI. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We're convinced that our new Equifax Cloud, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, leveraging EFX.AI and machine learning, and market-leading businesses will deliver higher revenue growth, expanded margins, and accelerated free cash flow that will enable us to start returning cash to shareholders in 2025 and beyond. We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50-plus-basis points of margin expansion annually on average over a cycle. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to thank Sam McKinstry on the Investor Relations team for his significant contributions over the past four years. Good news, Sam's staying with Equifax and is taking a position within the USIS business to further his career in finance. He's been a real asset to the IR team and the investor community. And joining the Investor Relations team from Equifax is Molly Clegg, and we welcome Molly to the IR team. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions. The savings are really in the fourth quarter and then we'll get the annualization of that next year. And Manav, I think, as you know -- I appreciate you pointing it out, this has been a long road. We started this five years ago and to be close to this finish line with 80% of our rev in the cloud in the next month or two and 90% in the fourth quarter, it's really a huge milestone. It's been a huge effort by the entire organization to run the company over the last number of years, but also do the cloud work. And we're super energized to really be pivoting to leveraging that cloud in the second-half as we complete USIS in Canada in the next couple of weeks and then really go into 2025 in a very, very strong position. Yes. We try to be balanced. I think you know that. We want to put forecast out that we know how to meet and we feel a lot of confidence in the forecast we put out. I think John and I in our prepared comments talked about some of the positives we have. We've had some challenges, you always do in a business. I think we highlighted USIS has seen some softening in the first quarter in some of their end markets and also in the second quarter. Mortgage hasn't really come back, and short of rate cuts, we don't expect that to happen in our guide. We've seen some impacts likely from the big focus in the first-half in USIS and cloud transformation. We expect those to obviously mitigate so the commercial team can be fully focused on just commercial conversations versus also commercial and cloud. EWS is performing exceptionally well. You look at the government performance, talent had a very strong quarter. Obviously, we talked about employer impacted by WOTC and some other kind of macros that will solve themselves, but likely later in the year, that will benefit 2025. But putting that all together and -- maybe just finishing with international, strong momentum there and all the businesses performing above our expectations. When we put that all together, we felt like we had the right framework in holding the year in the second-half. And to your question on USIS, I think we -- in our prepared comments, Andrew, I know you heard them. We've seen some softening in some of the end markets in USIS late in the first quarter, certainly continued in the second quarter. You talked about the CDK impact obviously, you know, was a negative late in the second quarter. That's obviously behind us. But the end market softening, for example, in auto, while mortgages have been impacted by higher rates, we're seeing some impact in auto where the payments for new and used cars are very high with the higher rates that are being charged. And we've seen some impact in just consumer demand for loans in auto. And then a broader, I would call it slight softening in second quarter. And we carried that forward in the second-half. So that's reflected in the USIS guide. I don't know if you'd add anything else John? And maybe adding to the records point, John, is that we have real visibility as we are in July now and in the third quarter and as we look out to the fourth quarter of meaningful record additions that we're working on, and we haven't closed those yet, so we haven't added them into our discussions with you. But -- and as you know, records, when we add them, when they come online, they turn into revenue that day, because we're already getting the inquiries. That's the beauty of the of the system we have. Sorry, John. Go ahead. Yes, we're always trying to do that, as you know, and it's often not easy. Like, the WOTC change that took -- went in place last year, we just thought would be implemented by the states more quickly. Government bureaucracies sometimes move at different paces. But we think we have good visibility. We talked earlier about the records. That's one where we have high visibility on. We know who we've signed, we know when they're coming on. We have kind of those schedules. So that gives you a lot of visibility. We -- do what you would suggest or would think we do is, we handicap different macro elements and try to put our best forecast together. And I think, as you know, on mortgage, while there's maybe increased talk about a rate cut in September, we don't have that in our forecast. We wouldn't put it in our forecast. That's not our process. If that happens, that's going to be good news for the second-half. But outside of our forecast and -- as you know, we expect rates over the medium term, call it, into '25 and '26 to come down, and that's going to be a real tailwind for us on the mortgage side. So yes, we've put pluses and minuses that we think we know about into the forecast, and that's why we put it in front of you. Yes. And in talent, you have to add to it also the penetration. Remember, that's a large TAM that we have a big position in, but there's a lot of runway for growth of just converting manual -- let's use just employment verification processes. As you know, we have incarceration, we have education data and other data elements, like medical credentialing data. But just the penetration is just a huge opportunity just like government. The -- when you've got a $450 million, $500 million kind of run rate business in talent, operating in a $3 billion-plus TAM, there's just a lot of penetration opportunity. Product is a big lever also. We've got a lot of focus around new products on incarceration, on education, on different depths of employment data. We rolled out an hourly solution for hourly background screens that don't require as much employment history. So, there's a big focus there. And I know the team is working on the next chapter of combining those data elements with our goal being to have a single transaction to deliver all the data that's required for a background screen, which would include employment history, would include incarceration, education, et cetera. We signed and announced a new partnership on education that goes beyond college degrees and into high school and vocational schools. So, that's another depth of element that's a part of our second-half focus on talent. Yes, that's a heavy question. Let me take a few parts of that. When you think about government, I think, John and I both mentioned in our comments, the biggest driver in government is penetration into that big $5 billion TAM. That's really at the state agency level. And as you know, we've continued to add resources in our government team in -- at the states in order to drive that penetration. And remember, you've got multiple agencies that are using our data, and in most cases, are not using our data, they're still doing it manually, whether it's for healthcare benefits, food support, rent support, childcare support, education support, income support, there's about a dozen different social services. And I think you know the scale of the U.S. consumer base that -- or household base that receives these services. It's about 90 million Americans receiving those services. And when you think about our business, call it, roughly $800 million run rate today against that $5 billion TAM, you've got over a $4 billion really manual processing of principally income verification that we're penetrating into. So, state penetration is a big driver and we think about that as very sustainable. There's not -- there's no one-offs in there. You get embedded in their workflows and then you become a part of that process. As you point out, we did expand -- extend our CMS contract last September. So, we're still taking the benefit of the price increase that was built in there. And as you know, that's a five-year contract with annual escalators. So that's one with a lot of visibility. So there's not any kind of one-offs in there. Anything else you'd add, John? In government -- you can tell we're quite energized. Government, last quarter and now again this quarter, is the largest vertical in Workforce Solutions and it's the business with, we think, the largest runway. Your question about the long-term growth rate, it's obviously outgrowing. In the last three years, it's had a 50% CAGR. It was up 30% in the quarter, I think 35% last quarter. So it's had very strong above kind of framework growth for Workforce Solutions, in the 13% to 15% total growth. We've been clear that we expect government to outgrow our 13% to 15% framework for EWS over the long-term. So that's clearly a business that we have a lot of confidence in and we're investing a lot in because of the opportunity there. We haven't given any guidance for '25. We'll do that as we get through this year, but we've been clear that we expect it to grow faster than the rest of Equifax and faster than the rest of EWS. Yes, we got you now, I think. Yes. That's better, yes. Yeah. And as John said earlier in one of the questions, we expect to see some benefits perhaps later in the year, but that's really going to be in '25, '26, and '27. There's no question that there's been some distraction for that team. This has been our most complex cloud transformation of the 40-year-old kind of consumer credit -- we call it, ACRO platform that we had. To be finishing it in the next couple of weeks is just a huge accomplishment and it's just taken so much bandwidth from the team to complete that. So, kind of the focus of the team is one positive that we'll have in the second-half, but you should think about that really benefiting as we get into '25 and beyond. You point out a number of really important levers. We believe the always-on stability, the ability to roll out new products more quickly just make us a more valuable partner to our customers. And we do expect to have share gains going forward. We've got some of those in flight and a lot of conversations going on. The feedback from our customers, that we've moved 99% of our customers to the cloud -- I think it's even higher than 99% as I speak today, has been outstanding. The performance, the speed, acceleration of moving the data, just the feedback is super positive. And as you know, that's one of the reasons we invested this substantial amount of money in the cloud four-plus-years ago was we believed it was going to give us a stronger competitive position with our customers. So you -- and we should start to see those benefits really in '25, but the momentum -- there should be some good guys as we get into the second-half on that. New products is another big deal. As you know, their vitality has been below our 10% goal for a number of years as they've been working on the cloud transformation. We've seen some positive acceleration in the quarter. I think there were 8% vitality and up 100 bps, which is positive. So, the team is starting to create some bandwidth for new products. And you'll see new products, really, from every element of USIS, a lot of stuff coming out from identity and compliance, which we're excited about, a lot of risk-based solutions, data combination solutions, given we have such really unique data in USIS versus our competitors, particularly in the alternative data with NC+, DataX, and Teletrack. So, a lot of traction there. Some products in marketing, leveraging our IXI wealth data have been coming out. And then the last one I'd comment on is -- I used it in my comments -- I mentioned in my comments is, with the cloud complete in EWS and now the cloud complete in USIS, we've got a big focus on delivering products that really combine TWN, our income and employment data, with the credit file. We think there's a lot of opportunities to put a flag on the credit file, for example, in mortgage, auto, P loans, so when one of our customers is pulling a credit file, they'll know that there is a individual there that's also working. That adds to the underwriting capabilities of that consumer and adds to the value of our credit file and our solution. And we're really energized about those kind of solutions that combine USIS and EWS products that will benefit both businesses, but we think make our credit file more valuable, which should drive credit file share. So that's a second-half focus on the product side, likely a 2025 implementation. So we're really energized around the always-on stability that will drive our competitive advantage, and then as you point out, the ability to roll out more new products, leveraging the USIS data, but then also bridging between USIS and EWS going forward. Yes, I'll just add again. I mentioned it earlier -- in one of the earlier comments. I think you know this, but record additions, we already have the inquiries coming. When we add the records, they turn into revenue. So it's such a powerful lever for us. And as you know, we've had really strong momentum there on records and we've signaled we have strong momentum in the second-half, and also good visibility. We don't have to do anything else, but get the records in our data set and they become revenue, because we already had the inquiries coming in from our customers. We just have higher hit rates. Yes, it's a great question. As I commented on the last question, they've clearly been dampened with all the focus on completing the cloud. We were really energized with the momentum that they even had in the second quarter in the midst of a very heavy quarter of cloud migrations that their vitality was up 100 bps to 8%. They've been below our 10% goal for five years or six years, pick the time frame, when we increased that goal from 5% to 7% to 10% for Equifax. And we expect USIS to move to that 10% as we get into '25 and the latter part of '25, meaning they've got really good momentum there. I rattled off a whole bunch of solutions that they're working on and that they expect to roll out in the second-half. These new products take time and they were clearly hampered by the cloud transformation, and we expect that with the cloud completion in the next couple of weeks to see some increased focus. And then as I mentioned on the other -- the last question, we're also -- have a big focus. We actually have a dedicated leader and team working on the EWS, USIS products, meaning the product combinations, which we've never done before, and we think will be quite powerful and kind of only Equifax solutions that we can bring to market. We've got a dedicated team in USIS and they're going to be really putting the pedal to the metal as we finish the year. To your question about when you'll see a lot of the benefit, I think that acceleration will happen in 2025 versus the second-half, but you're going to see a positive momentum of products coming out. They may not be revenue in the fourth quarter, but they'll turn into revenue in '25 and beyond. And maybe I'd just add, John. I think we're all watching to see when the Fed's going to change rates, and we believe the positive impact that'll have on mortgage activity, we've been very clear that as that starts rolling in, that's going to be accretive to our margins in a very positive way, meaning it's going to drop through in very high incremental EBITDA levels, 70-plus, when that happens in -- likely in '25 and beyond as rates move down to some more normal level. Yes, it's a whole range, as you might imagine. Use pension -- there are pension administrators that manage to find benefit pension payments, almost like a payroll processor for companies. We've signed one or two of those kind of relationships. So you think about those like a payroll processor. Those can be, call it, more chunky, meaning larger. We have direct kind of relationships around pension records and just a long runway in pension. And then there's a lot of pension records, as you might imagine, in federal, state and local government organizations, fire departments, police departments, government agencies, still have defined benefit pensions, most corporations do not, like the vast majority, but some of the legacy corporations still have that. So that's how we're going after pension, we have a dedicated group -- first off, we have a dedicated leader that works for -- our EWS leader that all they work on is records. And you may remember that's a change we made in December, to put a full-time dedicated leader. At the time, he had other tasks in EWS, and we just saw an opportunity to really continue to drive records. So, we asked him to fully focus on records. So, there's a dedicated team on pension and we have a dedicated team on 1099. We have a dedicated team on, call it, W2 or non-farm payroll partnerships, which would be payroll processors, HR software companies and others like that. And then also, remember that half of our records come from our direct relationships that we get through our employer business. So that's another important focus of ours, is we're continuing to invest in new products and capabilities to have those direct record relationships. On 1099, kind of we have a dedicated team. It's a different path that's going to some of the big Gig operators. But remember, 1099, income-producing Americans include doctors, dentists, lawyers that are self-employed and very high income. So you've got to go to like tax prep services that do their quarterly estimated taxes as a way to get some indication of their income. So, lots of different avenues that, I would say your question about, are some chunky and some more granular, the answer is, yes, it's a mix of all of the above across really all three kind of areas for focus on records. The positive we have is our scale, so we can focus on really going after those in so many different places. And we've got a big focus on it for the obvious reason because of the benefit we get. We're already receiving the inquiries. So, as we add records, we're able to translate those into revenue and give higher hit rates for our customers, which is what they're after. Yes, no change, Jeff. We're going to flow that through. We're investing and we have been, and you've followed us for a long time, you know as well. While we were doing the cloud and putting outsized investment in our tech transformation for the obvious long-term strategic reasons and competitive reasons, we've been making the right investments in '21, '22, '23, '24, in new products and other resources, commercial resources, et cetera. So we're investing the right amount to grow Equifax today, and those incremental savings from the cloud will flow through to expand our margins. Same way that we've talked about is, when the mortgage market returns, we'll let that flow through. We're not going to reinvest that. We're investing the right amounts to grow Equifax at 8% to 12% and deliver that 50 bps of kind of what I'll call ongoing operating leverage from running the company. So, as we have like mortgage market recovery or, as you point out, the cloud cost savings, those are going to flow through and they're going to allow us to not only expand our margins, but as John pointed out, with our leverage coming down, we're getting closer to that stage, which we've been after for, as you know, quite some time to start returning cash to shareholders. Yeah. As you know, EWS has been really outperforming our 10% kind of vitality goal for, gosh, almost three years now, principally after they completed the cloud, and it was a real step-up. So they've had -- really broad-based in all their verticals, focused on innovation and new products. You point out talent, where they've rolled out some products and they've got more in the pipeline. And so, there was clearly some benefit there from products that were put in place late last year and in the first-half of this year. Mortgage has got products that they've rolled out. So there's probably some benefit there. We -- while we lapped Mortgage 36, they've got some other solutions that they're bringing in. Employer, we've got a new I-9 solution called I-9 Virtual that's in the marketplace. So, that vertical is focused on new products. And government is also -- got some focus there. So we've been quite energized about EWS, call it, above framework, ability to execute on innovation. We'd expect them, over time, to move back towards the 10%, but they've been well above it for the last three years. And as we talked about, international had a good quarter on innovation and so did USIS in -- even in the midst of their cloud work. Yes. No, we're pleased. We're pleased with Boa Vista's performance. We talked about a bunch of the solutions that we're bringing there now that should benefit the second-half in '25 as we complete the integration. We're just lapping -- getting close to lapping the 12-month mark from acquiring the business, but we're well down the path on integration and rolling in our new products and bringing in our platforms, like Ignite and Interconnect and some of the other new product solutions. So, we're quite optimistic about our Boa Vista acquisition and the opportunity for growth going forward. Yes. I would say, similar to earlier question, it's broad-based. I think you're seeing the benefits of having a fully dedicated team and leader reporting to the leader of EWS, reporting into Chad. Joe Muchnick is the leader who's driving that. And I think we made that change in December and you've seen just the ability to just drive more of those strategic partnerships, which has really been quite positive. It is broad-based. We add records from individual relationships when we're doing employer solutions like I-9, UC, WOTC and other things with them. We've -- as we point out, we added four new partnerships in the quarter. We see a pipeline of those, and those partnerships are with pension administrators, they're with HR software companies, as you point out, and they're with the traditional payroll processors. And remember, when you think about the TAM, if you will, for records, there's roughly, the way we think about it, 225 million working Americans. We're north of 132 million individuals in our data set. Just a long runway for growth going forward. And we've clearly, gosh, over the last three years, five years, six years, seven years been outgrowing our framework for records over the long-term, which is kind of three points, four points of record growth per year is what we think about over the long-term. But there's just been a lot of momentum, given our focus and resources we've been putting on it. Yes. Yes. I think we tried to highlight that we've seen really for the last, call it, couple of quarters some impact from higher interest rates on auto loans dampening some of the auto credit underwriting. So -- and I would say, we don't expect that to change in the second-half and we've reflected that in our framework until rates come down. Yes. I think there's been some slight softening of, I would call it, consumer demand. Like, the consumer is still strong, outside of the subprime consumer, which we know has been impacted by inflation, which -- while it's coming down on a two-year basis, what they're buying is still a bigger part of their disposable income, whether it's groceries or fuel, it's clearly impacted the subprime consumer. It's really around the rates. We saw it in mortgage, obviously. Mortgage, we've seen the impact of higher rates really impacting the mortgage market meaningfully over the last couple of years. And I think in the last six months, we've seen that flow to a less -- much lesser degree, but obviously, a negative impact in auto where you've got payments on a car with the higher rates are just substantially higher than they were a couple of years ago, and that's impacting some level of auto purchases. I think you've seen the inventories by the car dealers increase, which is probably an indicator of consumer demand there because of higher rates. And until we see some reduction in rates, I would expect that auto would be somewhat dampened. It's a -- it's probably the one that we've seen the most of. Outside of that, I think the other verticals are kind of continuing to move along. It's not a customer impact. Our customers are still strong. Our customers are still focused on growing their businesses. I think it's more of an end user demand on the consumer side. Yeah. So I think John commented that we're at the finish line with a lot of these transformations. But when we move all our customers, there's a couple of months of overlap before we shut down the legacy infrastructure as we complete decommissioning those infrastructures. And that's still in our run rate, meaning we're still paying for those duplicate infrastructures, the new cloud and the legacy infrastructure. That will come out of '24. So we'll have full run rate in 2025, but it's delayed a couple of months because of some of the final work we're doing to complete, principally USIS, and I would say, yes, Canada is the other one that we're a few weeks behind and that pushes out those savings. So we have less benefit in '24, but we get the full benefit in '25. Yes, that's a tough one to actually put a point estimate on there. It's obviously going to be good news when the Fed cut rate -- cuts rates, principally in our mortgage vertical. I think you saw the chart in the deck that inquiries are down 50% from what we would call normal levels. We would expect that activity to recover as rates come down and you've got the kind of the macro challenges of consumers -- homeowners, better term, in a home at a 3% or 4% mortgage and likely want to upgrade or change, but are waiting to see rates come down from kind of the high-6s or that kind of range before they make that move. So, there's not a lot of inventory on the market. We would expect that to be positive going forward. And we've tried to frame for you that if you look at where we are today versus what we characterize as normal, that's $1.1 billion of incremental revenue, which is a huge number that -- we would expect, over time, that activity to go back towards normal. We'll see how it goes and, of course, how does the Fed move rates. The interest rates in the United States from the Fed are the highest, I think, pretty much in the globe today and they're 25-year high for the United States. It's -- we all believe, or we certainly believe that they will come down over time and then we'll have a big positive from the mortgage market recovery that we've been clear that will flow through our P&L and drive our margin expansion and free cash generation substantially as that comes back into our financials. I think the biggest driver -- John, you can jump in also, in talent is just continued penetration in that TAM, meaning customer wins, getting to top of waterfall, meaning they're using our solution first, kind of position some of the new products. What would you add on that, John, for talent? Yes. No, no, there's.. Yes. Yes. And it's -- well, I don't know. We don't -- I don't think about it's hurting our margins, but we're investing for obvious reasons in what we believe is a very important growth lever for us of enhancing our scores, models, and products using AI and ML. This isn't new at Equifax, but we've been consistently increasing our focus and spend around resources and capabilities for AI. The tech transformation provides a big lever there with our own AI capabilities and then leveraging that with Google's Vertex AI. So, being in the cloud is a big positive for us. And then we've been investing in more resources and people. I mentioned that we brought on a really strong leader from the industry -- it was actually from one of our customers, that we're excited to have in the business to lead AI and ML for us. You've seen the use of AI expanding. We had a goal of 80% of our models and scores this year to be using our new AI and ML. And I think we're at 89% in the quarter, so north of our goal, which is a good thing. As we move forward, we will move to 100%, right? That's where we're heading. So this is a big lever, and it's one of the pillars of our EFX 2026 strategic priorities, is to really leverage. And what it's going to deliver for our customers is just higher-performing solutions. They're going to be more predictable. They'll help them drive higher approval rates at lower losses, or higher identity validations in our identity businesses. We're super energized and the ability to have all of our data in a single data fabric and to have the Equifax cloud substantially complete as we finish up in the next number of weeks in the USIS, that gives us big, big opportunities to really take our product capabilities and really charge them with AI and ML. So we're super-excited about this as a priority going forward. Yes, no change in the second-half from the first quarter. As you know, there's a small portion of the credit card space that's in subprime that's went through a cycle in, really, '22 and '23, where there was some dampening there because of credit risk exposure with the subprime consumer. That's flattened out, meaning they're kind of at a run rate level. So, that is behind us. And then in the prime/near-prime, it's still a good business for us and we don't see any real changes there. We do. Again, you go from -- kind of take second-half, take 2025, the consumer is strong, they're working. If you think about prime/near-prime consumers, they're -- have -- they have wage growth and they have balance sheet growth from the equity markets. We've all seen the spending behavior from, broadly, the U.S. consumer base kind of post-COVID is very strong. So, that's a good outlook, and our customers are strong. They have strong balance sheets and these are important businesses for them that they want to keep growing. So they're spending money on marketing and they want to originate. And then for us, if we can continue to deliver differentiated solutions that help them grow their businesses faster, that's going to be a good thing for USIS in the card space and along the rest of FI. Yes. In LATAM, the principal driver in there is outside of Brazil. Brazil had a good quarter, and we do expect over the medium and long-term to continue to grow that business well, but it's still early days in Brazil. But strong performance in really most of the markets in Latin America, driven by new products and innovation, Argentina, Chile, a lot of the markets where we have strong leadership positions in those markets. But if you go across the rest of International, U.K. CRA was very strong. U.K. debt management was very strong. Those are growing kind of above market in U.K., particularly CRA, had another very good quarter and likely some share gains in that market. Canada was just above mid-single-digits, which was a very good performance. Australia, below where we would like them to be, but we expect them to recover as it moves forward. But product -- new products, a very positive driver across International as they're driving innovation. That's not what I said, George. But go ahead. Just to clarify, I did not say that there were tight credit conditions in auto. There are in subprime, but that's old news, right? That happened a year ago, two years ago, in '22 and '23, as I think you know. What I talked about was our view that the high rates in auto are impacting end-user demand for financing automobiles, meaning buying automobiles in the last couple of quarters. And it's really a follow-on of what we see in mortgage. The payment levels now for a new car for someone who's financing it are substantially higher than they were a couple of years ago. So we think that's impacted consumer demand, not credit underwriting. So just to clarify that. And I'm sorry, the second-half of your question was what? Yes. So from a credit conditions, we see the consumer continuing to be strong. Employment is high, unemployment is low. That's always a positive for underwriting when the consumers are working. Broadly, credit scores are still strong. I think we've talked before with you and others about the impact of subprime, but that's kind of flattened out from the declines we saw in '22 and '23. And another thing that we think a lot about on credit conditions is the strength of your customers, meaning other financial institutions, and they're broadly very strong. So those elements are very good. The one area -- two areas, obviously, we're seeing impact on consumer demand because of rates is clearly mortgage has been substantial, which we've talked at length about, and then we're seeing some impact in auto. Yes. As you know, we have four really principal levers in EWS, records is one. And as you point out, it's been very strong, which we're pleased with. Price is one. As you know, we don't disclose price but it's one lever. You should think about, George, that we have substantial benefits from penetration, meaning penetrating into new verticals. I think we've talked about that in Government and Talent and others. And then product is a big deal, bringing new solutions that deliver more value to our customers, meaning whether it's multiple data solutions or more historical data, those are generally at a different higher price point because they're bringing more value. But those four levers over the long-term, we think about as being equally weighted in the 13% to 15% and then add some market on top of that, meaning market growth. That's how you get to the 13% to 15%. So we're really energized to have those strong levers. When you think about EWS, clearly, the records -- ability to add records is very unique to that business and most data businesses. So it's a lever that we don't have in other businesses. I would argue penetration is also one that we don't have in other businesses. We don't compete with manual in other businesses. We generally compete with competitors like TU and Experian competing with manual is one that gives us the opportunity to add real value from a productivity standpoint, as well as the speed and accuracy standpoint of instant data that comes from EWS. Thanks, George."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Trevor.\nTrevor Burns: Good morning. Thanks. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab on our IR website. During the call, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 1Q 2024 earnings conference call. Also, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full-year 2024 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted on certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thank you, Trevor, and good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we're off to a strong start in 2024. First quarter reported revenue of $1.389 billion was up 7% at the high end of our February framework. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.1% were slightly above our expectations, and adjusted EPS of $1.50 a share was well above the high end of our guidance. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 6% in the quarter, stronger than expected. The strength in mortgage revenue was in USIS, where mortgage revenue was up 38% against credit inquiries that were down 19% and 700 basis points better than expected and continued strong performance in our new mortgage prequal products. EWS mortgage revenue was down 15% and consistent with our expectations. Twin inquiries are down 22% was slightly better than expected, and this was offset by slightly lower than expected revenue per inquiry, principally driven by product and customer mix. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 80% of total revenue in the quarter, had strong 9% constant currency revenue growth, which is well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework. This was slightly below our expectation of 9.5% non-mortgage revenue growth. Non-mortgage organic constant currency record growth was 5% in the first quarter. At the BU level, EWS Verifier non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 15% and stronger than expected, driven by very strong 35% growth in government and good growth in auto and debt management, slightly offset by some verticals in talent. Employer revenue was down 10% and weaker than expected. This was principally driven by a more rapid decline in ERC revenue than we expected and delays in state government processing of WOTC claims. ERC is now at a run rate of 103 million a quarter and should stay at about that level for the rest of the year. For WOTC, the federal requirement for states to validate WOTC claims changed late last year and most states have not yet completed the changes required to process claims, which dampened our revenue in the quarter. This impacted our WOTC revenue in the first quarter, but we expect this to be a timing issue as this essentially creates a backlog of WOTC submissions that will have to be completed by the states that will begin turning to revenue as state processing accelerates in the remainder of 2024. Offsetting these declines in the quarter, we saw mid single digit growth in I-9 and onboarding revenue. And going forward, we expect employer revenue, including ERC, to be up low single digit percentages for the remainder of 2024. In total, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up 7% and overall EWS revenue was up 1% and adjusted EBITDA margins of EWS at 51.1% were over 50 basis points stronger than our expectations from strong operating leverage and strong performance. USIS had a very strong quarter with revenue up 10%, its highest quarterly revenue growth in three years, even against the 19% mortgage market decline. As I referenced earlier, mortgage revenue was up 38% and stronger than expected from mortgage and pricing pass-through and our new prequal solution. Non-mortgage revenue was up 1% and was weaker than expected. Although we had very strong double digit growth in Kount and consumer solutions and mid single digit growth in banking and lending, we saw double digit declines in third-party bureau sales and low to mid single digit declines in Telco and Auto. In USIS, adjusted EBITDA margins were up \u2013 were 32.7% in the quarter and up about 70 basis points higher than our expectations. International delivered 20% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding the impact of the BVS acquisition, both of which were above our expectations. Very strong growth in Latin America and Europe was partially offset by lower than expected growth in Asia Pacific. International delivered 24.3% adjusted EBITDA margins, up slightly from our expectations. As you can see from the right hand side of the slide, we added a new strategic priority this year to focus on driving AI innovation. As mentioned in February, 70% of our new models and scores were built last year using AI and ML with a goal of 80% this year. In the first quarter, we exceeded this goal with 85% of our new models and scores being built with Equifax AI and Machine Learning. Equifax.ai, leveraging our proprietary data, Equifax Cloud and API capabilities, is a big area of focus and execution for Equifax in 2024 and beyond. We're maintaining our 2024 guidance with revenue at the midpoint of $5.72 billion and adjusted EPs of $7.35 a share. Our strong first quarter with revenue at the top end of the range, EPS above the top end of the range gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the full year guidance we provided in February. We expect strong constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth of over 10% and our full year guidance is based on the assumption that the U.S. mortgage market continues at levels consistent with current run rates with U.S. credit inquiries down about 11% from 2023. Before I cover our business unit results in detail, I want to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and with the consumer. Broadly outside of the bottoming of the mortgage market, there is not a lot of change from our view back in February. The U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at historic levels with low unemployment, which is a positive for consumers and customers. Employment turnover and hiring at lower levels entering 2024 than last year, hiring levels in January and February were at their lowest levels in three years. This is more pronounced for higher salaried roles than lower salaried or hourly jobs. Credit card and auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market, are stable and at historically low levels of less than 1%, but above pre-pandemic levels and subprime credit card and auto delinquency rates continue to remain above pre-pandemic levels with auto subprime delinquencies above 2009 levels. As we've discussed before, it's our view that when consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current under financial obligations, which is good for our customers and good for Equifax. Turning to Slide 5, workforce solutions revenue was up 1% in the quarter, slightly below our expectations. EWS mortgage revenue was down 15% as expected. Twin inquiries are down 22% or slightly better than expected, although weaker than USIS credit inquiries as homebuyers continue to have difficulty completing purchases while shopping behavior continues to be fairly strong. Our revenue outperformed inquiries by 7% which was below the about 11% we have guided during February relative to our February guidance, the benefit of the mortgage price increases implemented in January by EWS and stronger fulfillment rates due to the growth in twin records, whereas expected. However, these were partially offset principally by a shift in product and customer events. As we look to the remainder of 2024, we expect twin record growth to result in improved mortgage outperformance with the second quarter up slightly from first quarter levels and the second half of the year at about 14% outperformance. For the full year of 2024, we expect mortgage outperformance to be about 11% at EWS. This is down significantly from the 20% we saw last year as we lapped the late 2022 launch of our higher-priced Mortgage 36 trended data solution. Non-mortgage verification services revenue which represents over 70% of verifier revenue, delivered a very strong 50% growth at the top end of the EWS long-term revenue growth framework of 13% to 15% and was also above our expectations. Government, which is now our largest Verification Services vertical, had another outstanding quarter and was stronger than our expectations with 35% revenue growth. Government revenue benefited from both our new CMS and SNAP contracts, continued expansion of state contracts, continued TWN record growth and pricing. We expect continued growth in government throughout 2024 with stronger growth rates in the first half as post-COVID CMS redeterminations principally complete in the first quarter. Talent Solutions revenue was down 4% in the quarter which was weaker than expected as we saw very slow volumes through both January and February. Market saw about flat revenue which was more consistent with our expectations \u2013 which we expect to continue into the second quarter. Consumer lending revenue was 6% in the quarter as we saw strength in our auto and debt management businesses slightly offset by declines in card. This is the second consecutive quarter of consumer lending revenue growth as we're lapping headwinds from the FinTech lending pullbacks in 2022 and 2023. Auto and debt management revenue growth was principally driven by strong record growth and our pricing actions in the first quarter. As I referenced earlier, Employer Services revenue was down 10% compared to the \u2013 about 4% decline we discussed in February from ERC and ROIC reductions. Moving forward, we expect employer revenue, excluding ERC, to be up low single digits for the remainder of 2024. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.1% continue to be very strong from non-mortgage revenue growth, due to cost execution, while we continue to invest in new products, expanding the high growth verticals like government and talent, and grow our TWN records. As a reminder, EWS first quarter margins are seasonally lower from a higher mix of employer solutions revenue, principally from ACA and W-2 in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 6 and expanding on our discussion of EWS TAMs, in February, we provided additional details on our fast growing government vertical. On the left side of the slide, we outlined some of the federal agencies we're supporting with EWS Workforce Solutions, digital income, employment, and incarceration data that accelerate the time to deliver needed social services benefits to over 90 million Americans and help government agencies ensure program integrity, a win-win for all parties. And in the middle of the slide, you can see the substantial progress our EWS government vertical has made in a short period of time, penetrating the $5 billion TAM with a three-year CAGR of over 50%. We expect EWS to continue making significant progress penetrating the government vertical from additional sales resources at federal and individual state capital level, strong, clean record growth, new product rollouts with our differentiated incarceration data and system-to-system integrations enabled by our cloud-native technology that makes our solutions easier for our government customers \u2013 our government customers to consume. Our SSA contracts, last year's $1.2 billion CMS contract extension and the new $190 million SNAP contract are examples of our EWS involving various government agencies improve the consumer experience and their own operating efficiency, from the application and authentication phases to redetermination and recovery processes. The strength of the EWS government vertical was clear again in the quarter, and we expect strong future growth in this business in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 7, EWS had another strong quarter of new record additions and signing new payroll processors. During the quarter, EWS signed agreements with two new payroll processors, including one large payroll processor that will contribute over six million current records to the TWN dataset. This added the six partnerships we signed in the fourth quarter that are coming online in the first half of 2024, and this brings the total number of payroll providers added to the TWN database to 35 since the beginning of 2021 and the pipeline for new records continues to be strong. Both of these wins in the quarter are a testament to EWS\u2019 ability to deliver the highest levels of client service from a technology, data security and accuracy, operational excellence, as well as the highest level of record monetization that EWS participates in a broad range of verticals including government, mortgage, talent solutions, talent screening, card, auto and personal loans. And given our advancements in AI and cloud-native capabilities, the time to board new records from payroll processes has decreased over the past few years. We expect these new record additions in the first quarter to come online and begin generating revenue in early third quarter. In the quarter, EWS added four million current records, growing the TWN database by 10% over last year. At the end of the quarter, the TWN database had 172 million current records on 126 million unique individuals. Total records, both current and historic, are now about 670 million and were up about 8%. These are very strong results given the typical churn in holiday season hiring in the first quarter. In terms of coverage, we have current employment records on about 75% BLS non-farm payroll and over 55% coverage on the estimated 225 million income producing Americans. At 126 million unique active records, we have plenty of room to grow the TWN database towards the TAM of 225 million income producing Americans. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue was up 10%, stronger than our expectations and well above their 6% to 8% long-term growth framework, principally due to stronger than expected mortgage revenue. As I referenced earlier, USIS mortgage revenue was up 38% and stronger than our expectations. Mortgage credit inquiries at down 19% were still down substantially, but 700 basis points above our February guidance. We also continue to see very strong performance from our new Mortgage Prequal solution. The strong pricing environment, along with the strength in our Prequal product drove the very strong mortgage outperformance of 57%. At $145 million mortgage revenue was just over 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up just over 1% and weaker than the above 3% growth we had expected. Third-party sales to credit bureaus, including Experian and TransUnion were down double digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of third party bureaus revenue, USIS non-mortgage revenue was up about 2% and closer to our February guidance. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was down less than 1% and below our expectations, again driven by lower third-party bureau sales into a lesser extent declines in auto \u2013 auto and telco. Offsetting these declines was strong double digit growth in Kount and very good mid single digit growth in banking and lending. Commercial revenue growth was up low single digits in the quarter. Financial Marketing Services our B2B off line business was down 1% and slightly below our expectations. Marketing revenue was down 4%, principally due to a 10% decline in IXI revenue versus a difficult comp in the first quarter last year. We expect IXI revenue to grow for the full year. Pre-screen marketing was down less than 1% and at similar levels to the quarterly revenue we had in 2023. We continue to see declines smaller FIs principally or partially offset by growth in larger FIs. Within risk and accounting reviews, we did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but not to the level we would typically see if our customers were expecting a weakening economy. And fraud revenue was up a strong 8% from new business. USIS Consumer Solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter up 10% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. And USIS EBITDA margins were 32.7% in the quarter and higher than our expectations from stronger mortgage revenue growth. Turning now to Slide 9, International revenue was up 20% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of International revenue was up 20% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BVS and above the 18% growth we guided to in February due to better-than-expected revenue in Europe and Latin America. Europe local currency revenue was up very strong 10% in the quarter from strong growth in our UK, CRE, CRA B2B consumer and direct-to-consumer channels as well as our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, was up 31% versus last year driven by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Central America. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We expect to make good progress on the BVS integration as we expect to implement Interconnect, our end-to-end decision platform this summer, for small- and medium-sized businesses and by year-end for large businesses, and implement Ignite, our advanced analytics platform by year-end. The combination of our Ignite and Interconnect platforms will bring significantly enhanced capabilities to both the business and to the Brazilian market. Canada delivered 4% in the quarter as expected. And Canada is on track to complete their migration to the Equifax Cloud in the second quarter. And similar to USIS, we expect to see accelerating NPI as they complete the cloud. Asia-Pacific revenue was below our expectations with revenue down 10% due to lower market volumes principally in our Australian commercial business. We expect Asia-Pacific to have declining revenue in the first half due to the softer market conditions and the near-term impact of long-term contract extensions we signed with several large customers. We expect Asia-Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second half of this year. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.3% were above our expectations due to revenue growth and continued strong cost management. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to make very strong progress with new product innovation, launching over 25 new products in the quarter with a 9% up Vitality Index from broad-based strong performances across all of our BUs. As a reminder, our VI measure includes NPIs for the last three years. And on January 1, drops out NPIs or on January 1 dropped out NPIs from all of 2020. While our first quarter VI was slightly below our long-term goal of 10% as we lacked a large EWS Talent Solutions product launched in 2020, we expect our quarterly VI to accelerate throughout the year leveraging our EFX Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts for the full year 2024 VI of over 10%. Consistent with the fourth quarter of last year, USIS delivered another strong quarter with VI of 7% as we're closer to cloud completion and able to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation in new products, such as our suite of Ignite solutions including Ignite for prospecting and Ignite for financial services. EWS delivered VI of over 10%. We expect EWS VI to accelerate throughout 2024 with new product introductions focused on incarceration data, mortgage prequal and I-9 and onboarding products. As I mentioned earlier, EFX.AI is a pillar of our EFX2026 strategic priorities enabled by our EFX Cloud. In the middle of the slide, you can see that we're accelerating the pace at which we are developing new models, scores and products using AI and machine learning. In the first quarter, 85% of our new models and scores were built using AI and ML, which is ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. NPI and AI are a clear focus for Equifax, which will drive innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities as well as drive EFX top line growth and margins. Before I turn it over to John, I want to spend a few minutes on our progress on two of our critical EFX2026 strategic priorities that support our long-term growth framework of 8% to 12% top line growth and 50 basis points of annual margin expansion. Completing the cloud and inhibiting from building and leveraging our cloud capabilities is a big 2024 priority, which is fundamental to accelerating NPI and execution of AI and more broadly analytics as well as substantially strengthening system response time and resilience of our technology for our customers. Completing the cloud also frees up our team to fully focus on growth and expanding innovation, new products and new markets. Our progress towards completing the cloud is gaining momentum with over 70% of our total revenue in the new Equifax Cloud at the end of the quarter. And we're focused on executing the remaining steps to reach 90% with Equifax revenue in the cloud by year-end. USIS expects to complete their consumer credit, mortgage and telco and utilities exchange customer migrations to the new Equifax Cloud data fabric principally in the third quarter, which will allow them to decommission legacy systems in the second half of this year as planned. Customer feedback from the thousands of customers that we migrated to Equifax Cloud year-to-date has been very positive. Canada is progressing as planned to complete their consumer credit exchange migrations to the data fabric in late second quarter of this year with their data center decommissioning planned for the third quarter. Europe continues to make significant progress with the goal of completing Spain's consumer exchange migration to data fabric and the decommissioning of their legacy systems in the third quarter. And UK is on schedule to complete cloud migrations, decommissionings of their technology and data centers in the first half of 2025. In Latin America, we completed the Argentina and Chile cloud migrations and expect to make substantial progress on the remaining Latin American countries throughout the rest of 2024. And lastly, as planned, we expect Australia to make big progress this year towards completing their consumer credit exchange migrations to the Equifax Cloud in 2025. Second, driving AI innovation is an important EFX2026 strategic priority that leverages our cloud-based data fabric and application architecture and global Ignite analytical and Interconnect decisioning platforms. We're making great progress in embedding these EFX.AI capabilities across our global footprint. Ignite and Interconnect are now broadly available worldwide. And during 2024, we're deploying both Equifax proprietary explainable AI along with Google Vertex AI across Ignite, Interconnect and our global transaction systems. For Equifax, Vertex AI enables faster and more predictive model development on our Ignite platform. And for our clients, Ignite, which combines data analytics and technology into one cloud-based ecosystem, customers can connect their data with our unique data through our identity resolution process to gain a single holistic view of consumers. We now have 100 \u2013 access to 100% of the U.S. population through our data sets in our single data fabric. This is expanding the global population of its consumers for our customer cases by over 20%. And we're driving faster data ingestion and analytics with greater than five times the processing power of our legacy applications tied into our clients' existing campaign, account management and business platforms. Completing the cloud and expanding EFX.AI, along with continued expansion of our differentiated data sets will accelerate innovation and new products at Equifax will drive both our top and bottom line. In the first quarter, we're also off to a good start on our broader operational cloud restructuring plan across Equifax, reflecting cost reductions from the closure of North American data centers and other broader spending controls against our $300 million goals. These actions are improving operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. We're entering the next chapter of new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud towards leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and to provide our second quarter framework. Our second quarter guidance builds on our strong first quarter performance from new products, record growth and pricing. John?\nJohn Gamble: Thanks Mark. Turning to Slide 11. First quarter mortgage market credit inquiries were down about 19% and TWN mortgage inquiry volumes were down 22%. We believe homebuyers continue to have difficulty completing purchase transactions, resulting in a continuation of shopping, which generally results in credit inquiries, which occur earlier in the purchase process being stronger than TWN inquiries. Consistent with our practice from the first quarter and the last several years, our guidance for both credit inquiries and TWN inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two to four weeks modified to reflect normal seasonal patterns. For both credit and TWN inquiries, we saw some weakening in trends in late March and early April as mortgage rates increased over that period. Mortgage credit inquiry run rates remain somewhat better than the guidance we provided in February. Our guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 13% in the second quarter of 2024 and 11% in calendar year 2024, about 600 basis points and 500 basis points better than our February guidance, respectively. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries at about the levels we discussed in February with TWN inquiries down about 19% in Q2 and down about 14% for the year. This reflects the continuation of mortgage shopping we saw in the first quarter. As a reminder and as we discussed in February, we expect the level of USIS mortgage revenue outperformance to moderate as we move through 2024 as we start to lap the growth in new mortgage prequal products. We expect 2Q USIS mortgage outperformance to be about 40%, down from the 57% in the first quarter with full year USIS mortgage outperformance also expected to be on the order of 40%. We expect TWN revenue mortgage outperformance in the second quarter to be up slightly from the 7% we saw in the first quarter. As Mark indicated, second half 2024 mortgage outperformance should be about 14% with full year about 11% and at the low end of our long-term 11% to 13% framework. Slide 12 provides the details of our 2Q 2024 guidance. In 2Q 2024, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.41 billion and $1.43 billion with revenue up about 8% at the midpoint. Nonmortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to about 11%. Mortgage revenue in the second quarter is expected to be up about 3%. Mortgage revenue will be just over 20% of Equifax revenue. FX is negative to revenue about 2 points. Business unit performance in the second quarter is expected to be as follows. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 3%, with mortgage revenue down about 12.5%. EWS nonmortgage revenue should grow over 9% in the quarter. Nonmortgage Verifier revenue will again be up about 15% in the second quarter driven again by government and a return to growth in Talent Solutions. And Employer Services revenue is expected to decline about 4% in the quarter due to declines in ERC revenue. Excluding ERC, Employer Services revenue should be up slightly. We expect Employer Services to return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 as we lap ERC headwinds. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to again be about 51%. USIS revenue is expected to be up over 8% year-to-year, despite the continued decline in mortgage market inquiries. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of over 2% should be up from the 1% we saw this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up strongly to about 34.5%. International revenue is expected to be up over 20% in constant currency due to the addition of BVS. Revenue is expected to be up approaching 10% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 25.5%, reflecting revenue growth. We expect Brazil to deliver revenue of over $40 million in the second quarter. Equifax 2Q 2024 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32% at the mid-point of our guidance, an increase sequentially of about 300 basis points, principally reflecting the higher equity compensation expense we saw in the first quarter. Adjusted EPS in 2Q 2024 is expected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share about flat versus 2Q 2023 at the mid-point. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were about $125 million and consistent with our expectations. We expect capital expenditures in the second quarter to be at levels consistent with the first quarter and we continue to expect CapEx to be about $475 million for the year, which is a year-to-year reduction of over $100 million. As we discussed in February 1 of our capital allocation priorities in 2024 is leverage reduction from free cash flow expansion. As of the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was just over 3 times with a goal by year-end 2024 of about 2.5 times. We believe these levels of leverage are nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases, as well as to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. As Mark covered earlier, we are making very good progress on completing migration of our U.S. and Canadian consumer credit exchange changes to cloud, which will enable the shutdown of significant legacy systems in 3Q and 4Q. These actions enable significant cost benefits in the second half of 2024, which will allow us to deliver sequentially higher EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS in 3Q and 4Q. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full year guidance, which is overall unchanged from the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with our February guidance, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5% with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% at the center of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is now expected to grow over 10%, reflecting USIS mortgage revenue that is stronger than our February guidance. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow more than 20 points better than the about 13% reduction from the average decline in USIS and EWS mortgage inquiries in our framework. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10% with organic growth of over 8%. This is solidly within our long-term framework, although slightly below the levels we discussed in February. FX is about 190 basis points negative to revenue growth. We have also slightly adjusted BU level guidance. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue of about 7% in 2024. This reflects mortgage revenue down slightly about 11 points better than underlying EWS mortgage transactions. EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow about 10%. The slight decline from February guidance is due to the expected weaker revenue performance in employer driven by the more rapid decline in ERC and deferral of WOTC revenue Mark referenced earlier. Excluding the expected significant decline in ERC revenue as that pandemic support program completes, EWS non-mortgage revenue growth is about 12%. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth over 9% in 2024 above the high end of our long-term growth target of 6% to 8%. Mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 25% on the order of 40 points stronger than the expected over 11% decline in mortgage credit inquiry. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 3%, down from the 4% in our February guidance. We continue to expect non-mortgage growth will be driven by strong consumer services, commercial identity and fraud and FI. As we saw in the first quarter, the overall auto market was weaker than our expectation impacting our auto based revenue and our D2C revenue the business in which we sell credit dated to other credit bureaus was weaker than we expected and down substantially. We continue to expect international to deliver constant currency revenue growth of over 15% in 2024 with organic constant currency growth of about 10%. As we discussed in February, the high levels of inflation we are seeing in Argentina are expected to benefit overall international revenue growth by about 5 percentage points. Although uncertain, we have assumed the currency devaluation in Argentina will more than offset inflation in our 2024 planning. We believe that our guidance is centered at the mid-point of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Turning to Slide 14 and as we discussed in February, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the market bottoms and moves from a headwind to a tailwind and the mortgage market recovers towards its historic norms that presents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our mortgage gross margins, this over $1 billion of mortgage revenue would deliver over $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that you would expect to move into our P&L. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Begor: Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 9% constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth, which was well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, a big priority for 2024 is to complete our North America cloud transformation as well as significant portions in our global markets, which will result in continued market expansion and reductions in our capital intensity as the key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. As we complete the cloud, we expect CapEx to increase in 2024 by over $100 million to about $475 million or under 8.5% of revenue with further reductions in 2025 allowing us to move towards our long-term CapEx goal of 7% of revenue as we exit next year. And exiting 2024 with 90% of Equifax revenue into new Equifax Cloud is a big milestone, so the team can move fully towards focusing on growth. Aligned with completing the cloud transformation is our strategic priority to drive innovation through our investments in EFX.AI. AI, ML are changing the way we develop new products in our single data fabric, build higher performing models, scores and products allow us to inject and cleanse more data and operate our consumer care centers more efficiently. We are on offense with EFX.AI. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud differentiated data sets in our single data fabric leveraging EFX.AI and ML and market leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50 basis points of annual margin expansion annually. I\u2019m energized by our strong performance in the first quarter and momentum as we begin 2024, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is alive.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just had a broader question on just the visibility that you have because unlike the prior years, mortgage is actually much better than what you guys guided. But still there were, I think, a lot of moving pieces that didn't allow you to beat by more, I guess. Just curious I think this quarter, obviously, ERC was exceptional, but auto, APAC like, just \u2013 can you just help us understand how much visibility you have in these other areas?\nMark Begor: Yes. Manav, good morning. I think we have good visibility. We typically do, as you know, but there's still a lot of uncertainty. As you know, you go back using your comment on mortgage, 60 days ago, I think a lot of us were looking forward, as well as most of the experts that we have multiple rate cuts in 2024 as recently as two weeks ago, there were still people thinking there was going to be a June cut. And I think, as you know, that's kind of pushed out. Rates went up three weeks ago, two weeks ago, mortgage rates went up 20 basis points to 7%. So while there's a lot of visibility, there's still a lot of uncertainty around, I would call it, principally the mortgage market. And given we're in the first quarter, we thought it was prudent to be balanced in the framework we put forward. As you know, we beat in the first quarter. We had some things to manage in ER spend, EWS like the ERC decline or the WOTC deferral because of the change in forms. And there's always things we're managing as a company. But we thought it was prudent to be balanced given where we are in the quarter and kind of the macro of mortgage, outside of mortgage, we're pretty comfortable with the economy. And we held the year and we'll take another look at it as we go through second quarter.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, got it. And then just the 7% mortgage outperformance in EWS, I know you guys had said that you expected 1Q to be the low end or the low point was seven, kind of in line with your expectations and then just thinking about the 11 for the year and beyond. Is that going to be the new norm then?\nMark Begor: Yes. So we've had very strong mortgage outperformance at EWS over the last couple of years, records are a big driver of that. Obviously, we take price up every year, which we did in 2024. We've also had in the last couple of years what I would call outperformance in EWS mortgage from some of the new product introductions, principally Mortgage 36. So that's kind of the delta from 2024 outperformance, call it in the high teens to 20, down to the double-digit or low single digits. So we were kind of focused on that. As we look forward to the balance of the year, you heard us talk about the record additions which are going to benefit all of the EWS verticals, including mortgage, including the larger payroll processor that we signed. It's going to come online, kind of mid-year, that's going to add 6 million records. So those higher hit rates will benefit all of the EWS businesses in the second half as we continue to grow twin records, and also will benefit mortgage.\nJohn Gamble: Relative to our expectation for the first quarter, seven was a little lower than we expected. As we said in the script, it was really driven a lot by customer mix and channel mix, right. We saw some shifts in our customers and to some of our customers that had lower pricing than others, and that impacted our first quarter outperformance levels. Going forward for the rest of the year, we basically assume that level of mix is going to continue. And as Mark said, the growth is really driven by records. Long-term, I think we've said before that we're expecting mortgage outperformance to look pretty much like the level of outperformance excluding economy \u2013 of the economy that we're talking about for EWS in general, which is something like 11%, 12%, 13%. So I think long-term, that's the type of level we're thinking about.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is outline.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. John, could you go back to the Slide 11 and the 500 basis point better assumption on a USIS mortgage credit inquiries for 2024. Does that translate into 500 basis points better mortgage revenue growth for OIS? And if not, why? And I'm going to give you my second question. We'll also make a comment about mortgage solutions trajectory for the year.\nJohn Gamble: So it translates into better mortgage revenue for USIS in total, not necessarily specifically for OIS, right. So you need to look at both OIS as well as core mortgage. But yes, inquiries translate fairly directly. Yes.\nAndrew Steinerman: And the other part was, could you just talk about mortgage solutions trajectory for the year?\nJohn Gamble: So again, what we're talking about is just mortgage in total, right. So and I think the trajectory for mortgage in total is what we talked about on the call, right. So we didn't really split mortgage solutions and OIS. We manage it as one kind of one single business. I understand it's on two different line items when we report, but we tend to focus on mortgage in total and trying to drive the mortgage performance overall up for the year. And I think we gave very specific information about what we expected overall mortgage is very strong, up over 25% for the full year, right, outperformance on the order of 40 points. So we think it's going to be very strong in total.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham and Company. Your line is now live.\nKyle Peterson:\n, :\nMark Begor: I missed the first step \u2013 the first half of your question about if rates stay higher for longer, how does it impact Equifax?\nKyle Peterson: Yes, got it.\nMark Begor: Yes. So mortgage, I think you get \u2013 mortgage, obviously this year, we're still expecting mortgage to be down. But like, if rates stay where they are, we would expect in 2025, mortgage market to be fairly flat, in 2025 until rates come down. And I think John outlined again, what we believe that whether it's 2025, 2026 or 2027, as rates get down to what I would call a more normal level, as you know, we're at a 20-plus year high right now. Over that longer timeframe, there's a big tailwind in mortgage. For the rest of our businesses, we haven't really been impacted by rates. There's a little bit of impact in auto, those higher rates are pressuring some of the payments, if you will, for that lower end consumer and subprime and near prime. But broadly, we're performing well, where rates are from a non-mortgage standpoint, and we would expect that to continue. So when we think about kind of the long-term of Equifax, we're still committed and confident in our 8% to 12% kind of long-term framework for the company, including a point or two of M&A in that long-term framework, and that's \u2013 it's kind of current rates. And then we've got the benefit is rates come down to some level where they're going to come down to four or three and a half or whatever over the long-term. I don't think any of us expect them to go back to where they were kind of during the COVID pandemic. But as they come down, we're going to have \u2013 we believe a real tailwind as the mortgage market recovers from its levels of 50% below what we would characterize as normal.\nJohn Gamble: And just as a reminder for 2024, right, as we said in the script, our guidance reflects current activity, current run rates, which is at current rates, right. So effectively, our guidance assumes rates stay where they are.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, we've seen some consolidation. The background screening space, I know some of that's at least pending right now, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on if we do see some consolidation there. Is there any change in your strategy or outlook on Talent, within Appriss, the TWN products or is everything just pretty much dependent on hiring volumes?\nMark Begor: Yes. I wouldn't say, it's all dependent on hiring volumes. Obviously, hiring volumes have had an impact on us. We've been able to navigate through the hiring volumes, which are still quite low. Most companies are keeping a tight belt, as they think about where the economy is going. As far as hiring on the white collar side, obviously blue collar is super strong. There's, I don't know what is 9 million plus open jobs right now, but it's still a very vibrant economy from the hiring side. As far as that talent, we just see a big TAM there with lots of opportunity to grow. We have strong relationships with all the top players, including the two you mentioned, and we expect to continue those relationships. We've got a very aggressive pipeline of new product additions that we're continuing to roll out in the talent space. There's a lot of white space for us to penetrate, meaning background screeners that are still using manual, if you will, employment verifications. So that's an opportunity for us. So we remain very optimistic around the future for the talent vertical. And as you point out, when hiring, I would call it in the white collar side stabilizes or perhaps when rates come down and there's some increase in economic activity, we'll get some tailwind from the market side as people are expanding their businesses, and then we'll have things under our control to continue to adding records. The additional records result in higher hit rates there. The 4 million records we added in the quarter are 4 million jobs, that are now going to be able to be monetized in the hit rates we\u2019re delivering at talent. I talked about new products, and of course, we took some price up in January and we\u2019ll do that again in 2025. So we\u2019re optimistic about talent. We\u2019re super optimistic about government. As you know, with the 35% performance in the quarter, which is we see a lot of opportunities there, too.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the EWS outperformance versus the volume. And you talked a little bit about customer shift and it\u2019s something, I guess, that hasn\u2019t come up in the past. Curious if you could dive in a little bit more in terms of kind of what can drive a shift in the sort of mix of customers that you\u2019re working with and how you\u2019re thinking about that for the rest of the year. And is it a function of how the mortgage market is performing or is it new customers that you\u2019re bringing in? Just help us understand that better.\nMark Begor: It\u2019s a little bit of all of the above, but it\u2019s really the mortgage market now at the low levels of activity, down 50% from where it was. There is some changes that happen on how much volume specific customers are completing in a quarter or a month. And we see shifts in that that are, I would call it more pronounced when the numbers are smaller. If you have one mortgage originator that perhaps is being more aggressive at one point in time or when the originations, they want to do their marketing, they\u2019re spending. As you know, a lot of this is \u2013 most of it\u2019s done digitally. So there\u2019s ebbs and flows on, particularly in this market from what we\u2019ve seen, ebbs and flows of kind of the activity that a mortgage originator will put into it. I don\u2019t know John, what else would you add?\nJohn Gamble: Let me just add. Just got to remember a point about performance is not a large number, right? So we can see shifts about performance of several points, and it isn\u2019t a really large number on our mortgage revenue. And that\u2019s why you saw that we had a little bit of outperformance in inquiries. And yes, we had some out \u2013 we had some underperformance and outperformance, but we ended up with revenue on, right? So I think unfortunately what we\u2019re talking about here is really small percentages that can be impacted by not large movements in revenue. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing here, right? But overall, Mark covered it already, right, the real driver here of this business is consistent, large growth in records, which makes the product more valuable, which is why we expect to see continued improvement in the level of mortgage revenue as we go through the year, relatively speaking. So we feel very good about what\u2019s going on with the products we\u2019re offering because of the fact that we\u2019re adding records so rapidly.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up question, as it relates to margin, you did take your inquiry number up on the mortgage side, so just curious how to think through. But if you maintain your EBITDA outlook for the full year, just sort of give and take there in terms of the flow through on higher increase and what might be offsetting that.\nMark Begor: Yes. I think I\u2019d start with the comments I had earlier. I don\u2019t know if you heard my response to Manav question. The first quarter, we still \u2013 a lot of \u2013 we have a lot of visibility in lots of parts of the business. I think the mortgage side is less visible as was pointed out. 60 days ago, all of us thought there\u2019d be \u2013 at least the world thought there would be a bunch of rate cuts in the second half, including one in June. Two weeks ago, the June 1 felt like it disappeared. So, given it\u2019s the first quarter, we were very pleased with what we saw as revenue being kind of the midpoint of our guidance, which is very strong and then EPS outperformance. We thought it was prudent to hold the year and give you a good outlook of what we think second quarter is. And as I said, we\u2019ll look at it again as we get through second quarter and have, what I would characterize is more visibility. I think any of us expected inflation to, so called spike up a little bit in the last couple of months, when we set that guide earlier in the year. But we\u2019re confident in delivering the full year guidance that we laid out and we\u2019ll give you an update as we get through second quarter, we\u2019ll have more visibility at that time.\nJohn Gamble: As you look through the year, we are expecting margins to go up. It\u2019s obvious in our guidance, right? I talked a little bit about the fact that we have meaningful cost reductions coming as we decommission major systems in our consumer businesses in North America. We feel good about executing against those as Mark talked about. We also just \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember we generally have an improving mix of revenue as we go through the year, especially in the fourth quarter as mortgage declines as a percentage of our revenue. It happens every year. It\u2019s just market, right? So as that happens, that tends to be margin accretive for us. So executing against our plans and quite honestly, the addition of records in EWS is very accretive for us as we go because obviously that\u2019s very high margin revenue that doesn\u2019t draw with it expense below variable cost. So we feel very good about our ability to deliver on our full year numbers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nOwen Lau: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to talent. I think you mentioned the Jan and Feb volume was I think below expectation, but March number is better. And you expect that trend to continue. I just want to understand the driver of that weakness in Jan and February. And what makes you confident that the volume would be similar to March level maybe in the second quarter or so? Thanks a lot.\nMark Begor: Yes. We attribute when we talk to our customers, which are background screeners, that kind of softer January, February, just as kind of a very tight operating environment that most companies are operating on. Again, we over skew to white collar workers versus blue collar. Blue collar is still, I would call it red hot, meaning there\u2019s more jobs open than people looking for them. That\u2019s not the issue. Most companies are really watching the economy and we saw that in January, February. We did see an uptick in March and we try to operate off current trends we see and that\u2019s still continuing in April and we expect that to kind of stay at that level. But I wouldn\u2019t call it like a big recovery, just back closer to what we thought the year was going to be as we exited 2023.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then for your cloud migration from, I think 70% revenue to 90% cloud revenue by the end of this year. Can you help us again, how should we \u2013 how can we quantify these uplifts and translate that to revenue growth and margin expansion? And how much of that you\u2019re baked that into your full year guidance already? Thanks.\nMark Begor: Yes, certainly in our guidance, obviously, we haven\u2019t given guidance for 2025 yet. We\u2019ll do that as we get through this year, we expect those cloud completions this year to benefit 2024. That\u2019s built into our margin expansion assumptions in 2024. And then there\u2019ll be some carryover of the second half decommissioning that we have as we complete, like the USIS cloud transformations in the kind of middle of the year and some of the international cloud transformations, same kind of timeframe, those start layering in on kind of a monthly basis as we go through this year. And those will provide some benefits as we go into 2025. So I think we\u2019ve given and we\u2019re happy to share some more around the margin side. The top line side is one, there\u2019s multiple layers of how the cloud is going to benefit us from a top line standpoint. We\u2019re going to be a differentiated partner to our customers with the always on stability from the cloud. You\u2019ve already seen the uplift in new product innovation coming from our differentiated data in the cloud. So that\u2019s going to continue. And businesses like USIS that have been constructed by their cloud migration efforts over the last year and change as they complete the cloud, we would expect that to accelerate their new product rollouts going forward. So we have a lot of optimism of what it\u2019s going to do from a competitive standpoint as we complete the cloud. And as I said in my prepared comments earlier, the other big benefit is the ability for the team as we get towards the second half of the year and into 2025 to fully focus on just growing the business. Over the last almost four plus years, we\u2019ve been growing the business, operating the business, and doing this cloud transformation. It\u2019s a heavy, heavy lift. Getting that completed is a big, big milestone for the company. So we can really take advantage of all of our differentiated data in the cloud. Our increased focus on AI and ML, that\u2019s going to benefit us as we go into the second half and into 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thanks. The next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the mortgage outperformance in USIS. There\u2019s obviously the FICO pricing increase, and then you mentioned the new Prequal product. Given the magnitude of the outperformance, could you kind of parse that a little bit for us? Is it like overwhelmingly FICO with some Prequal or how should we think about that in terms of the impact the new products having there? And then I have a follow up.\nMark Begor: Yes. The pricing pass through is a very, very big piece of the mortgage outperformance. We haven't broken down to two, but the new solution, the pre-qual that's used in the shopping stage, is a meaningful piece and we're very pleased to have that on top of the price action, you should expect us to continue to bring new solutions to market, and this is an example of that as we go forward and as we look forward to 2025 and 2026 and beyond, we'll continue to focus on new solutions from our standpoint. And I think all of us will have to see what that pricing looks like as we get into 2025 from our FICO partner there and what they decide to do next year, as well as beyond 2025.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you. And then here, this is for John. Can you just go over the puts and takes on Workforce Solutions 2024 guidance going to 7% from 8% despite the fact that the mortgage market inquiries are expected to be better. Some of the stuff that were mentioned sounds like they would be more delays rather than permanent impacts. And I'm just hoping you can just parse that out a little bit more because that's kind of surprising to people, I'd say one of the most surprising in what we saw in kind of the earnings report.\nJohn Gamble: Sure. So, I think the full year is down a point, principally because of employer. Right. So that some of the items we talked about certainly was yes, it's a deferral, but it's lower for the year and it doesn't all turn in 2024. And ERC is lower for the year. And so generally speaking, the reduction is principally related to employer. On mortgage, we did indicate we're seeing slightly better performance than mortgage on inquiries. Right. That we said, we had expected shopping when we gave a guidance back in February to kind of to be not as substantial in 2024. What we saw in the first quarter is it was. So we're now assuming it will continue for the entire year. And that even though they're made, the inquiries are similar to; we're expecting a little weaker level of performance in terms of outperformance. Right. That we just talked about. So that's affecting mortgage revenue overall. Non -mortgage verifier revenue really strong, that continues to be very, very good. Government's performing incredibly well, outperforming our expectations overall. We expect talent to recover. We actually had fairly good performance in kind of the non-mortgage financial services portion of the P&L. So we felt relatively good about that. So overall, non-mortgage in verification services is very good. So the real movement relative to the 8% we gave before the biggest driver is employer services and then also mortgages, is even though maybe you have a little better overall inquiries in total for the year, they're being offset by the weaker level of outperformance that we talked about. Principally driven by mix. Right. Principally driven by customer mix, which we saw in the first quarter.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about, the third party sales to credit bureaus that you mentioned that was weak and down double digits in the quarter. What exactly is that and what's driving it? And how should we think about this in the, for the rest of the year?\nMark Begor: Yes, we sell our credit reports to a number of companies that provide credit monitoring to consumers in the U.S. We have our own business, and including the sell to [ph] Experian and TU to lots of others that provide credit monitoring. And we've seen some softness, particularly with the other two credit bureaus in the first quarter and actually late in the year. That's really what we referred to. And I don't know enough about what's driving that, whether they're cutting back on marketing or it's just a more competitive market. But that was an element that we just sold less credit reports that are passed through in credit monitoring solutions.\nJohn Gamble: Yes. We basically assume it's going to continue into the second quarter. Right. So we're seeing it to be at lower run rates. So we're assuming those run rates are just going to continue.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. And then just to follow up on the question around EWS revenues. I know you said that you still expect, I think, government revenues to be up 15% for the year. Curious how we should think about the second quarter, sort of where we are in terms of redeterminations. So basically what's left in 2Q and then if you could also just comment on, I know you're talking about a recovery in talent. But give us a sense of how we should think about talent revenues for the year.\nMark Begor: Yes. So I think that the number you're quoting for government we talked about back in February, and what we're seeing is government is outperforming that. So we feel very good about our government revenue very strong in the first quarter. Yes, redeterminations are technically completed by the end of March. So yes, that revenue should decline, but we're seeing really good performance across government strength in CMS, strength in other areas, strength within the states. Really good progress as we continue to do, to expand staff both through FDA and then also directly with the states. So we feel good about our ability to continue to grow government at a stronger pace than we had previously expected in talent. But we're indicating that we expected to get back to growth, right. I mean, we saw some weakness in January and February, nice recovery in March. We're expecting that to continue. We're going to get back to growth as we go through the year. And as I just mentioned, we do feel relatively good about what we're seeing overall in our non-mortgage financing structure, so that we feel relatively good there as well. So overall, non-mortgage and verification services looks like it's performing very, very nicely. And again, just like with mortgage, as we move through the year, the substantial growth in records, the tremendous growth that we're seeing in adding new payroll processors now large and small, is going to add to the strength in all three of those areas that I just talked about. Right. Government directly, talent also, because it not only adds hit rates, it also deepens the historical file that we're able to deliver to our customers. So it makes our product even more valuable. And then obviously also in non-mortgage financing.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi good morning. I wanted to ask about the FHFA's kind of latest timeline for its credit score requirements. I think they put that out at the end of February. Just wondering how you think about kind of now with that out there, the timing of the impact to your business and if a couple months later or even a couple quarters later since I think you last spoke on it, what your expectations are in terms of the impact to Equifax broadly?\nMark Begor: Sure. I think the latest on that, this pushed out to late this year or early next year. It's still in a comment period. There's a lot of inputs coming in that don't support the 3B to 2B, from what we understand is including congressional inputs on that. There's also, what's on the table is to add a VantageScore in addition to the FICO score with regards to our view of timing, we don't expect anything to happen in 2024. And that's not in our guidance; it's not in our framework. And everything we see and hear that's going to be in 2025, if at all.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Thank you. And then just for my second question, I wanted to go to Slide 14, I know this isn't a new slide, and you've talked about the 2015 to 2019 inquiry level relative to where we are today. I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you can give to that average inquiry level from 2015 to 2019 as it relates to kind of a mix between refi and purchase. And I ask because obviously it would seem like refinance after the wave of refinancing in 2020 and 2021 would be potentially subdued for a longer period of time than 2024, 2025, 2026 if we don't get back to those kind of interest rates. So is there any other context you can, could provide with that number? I guess, more succinctly, how much of that 2015, 2019 inquiry level is purchase versus refi? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes. So if you look at originations during that time period. Right. Because obviously that in historical periods that details available, it was like average $7.5 million a year. And it was something like, something under 60% would have been purchase and something over 40% on average would have been refi. That was kind of the mix that you saw during that period, on average.\nAndrew Nicholas: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Just a bigger picture question here. You talked about elevated activity in terms of rate shopping. Is that universal across, like cards, auto, mortgage, and then how much of an incremental benefit is it at this point in the cycle relative to maybe historical? So just some color would be helpful to understand as we think about longer term trends here.\nMark Begor: Yes. The place we've seen that is really in mortgage. I suspect there's some level in auto, but it's probably harder to see. And as you know, the phenomenon that changed if you go back five years ago, is just digital consumers. Five years ago, there was more face-to-face activity around a lot of big ticket transactions like a mortgage, and now it\u2019s virtually all digital. So it\u2019s easy for a consumer to shop around. So we have seen the increase in the shopping behavior as we went into COVID. That still continued. We believe that that\u2019s just an element that will continue going forward that consumers have the ability to easily look at alternatives kind of digitally. And I think that\u2019s going to be an underlying element of the mortgage market going forward, which maybe to your question, if you look back to 2015 to 2019 [ph], there were some elements of shopping in there, but it\u2019s clearly increased. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to decrease as rates go down in a meaningful way. And rates aren\u2019t going down to where they were before, right? During the COVID time frame, it\u2019s hard to imagine that rates are going to go that low. So let\u2019s say rates go from seven towards six then towards five and maybe they end up at four or something, that\u2019s still a significantly higher rate from what people perhaps were used to during the COVID time frame when rates were so low, there will be an element of shopping going forward.\nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s helpful. And then it sounded like marketing spend, I realize this is not a large part of your business, but just conceptually seems to be down a little bit more than you were anticipating relative to last quarter. Any color you can provide there? And should that be concerning in the sense that if marketing spend is down that potentially is a negative for volumes down the road?\nMark Begor: Yes. I would say that was de minimis. The change \u2013 the way we think about it on a sequential basis, again, we \u2013 our customers are still kind of operating what I would call normally. So there\u2019s that \u2013 like they\u2019re not pulling back because they\u2019re worried about the economy or the consumer. And that\u2019s where you would see marketing or prescreens or digital marketing to consumers around financial products, which is where most of our businesses cut back. We just haven't seen it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nKelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On mortgage Verifier, Fannie announced last month that lenders will now be able to use a single 12-month as that report to validate income, employment and assets, only one stack utilizing bank data. So just curious to get your view on whether this will have any impact on mortgage Verifier volume?\nMark Begor: We don\u2019t think so. And we haven\u2019t seen it. There has been \u2013 there\u2019s various alternatives that can be used in a mortgage process. They generally have more friction, and they typically have less data. And the mortgage originators are \u2013 work hard to make sure that they\u2019re getting the full picture of the consumer. And then the other element is the instant nature of our data. So we haven\u2019t seen a change there, and we don\u2019t expect one going forward. We saw a very wide utilization of our TWN income and employment data in the mortgage vertical, and we expect that to continue. And then as we add records, we\u2019re already getting the inquiries from our customers, we\u2019re going to have higher hit rates as we continue to grow our records.\nKelsey Zhu: Got it. Thanks. And my second question is still in EWS. I was wondering if you can remind us when renewals are coming up for most of your exclusive contracts with payroll providers? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I was under the impression that a lot of these contracts had a three- to five-year term, and they were mostly signed around 2021. So I was just wondering if that means they\u2019re up on renewals this year or next year?\nMark Begor: Yes. We\u2019ve never talked about the term of any of our contracts with our partners. Those are confidential for obvious reasons. We have said, and it\u2019s the way they\u2019re structured, they\u2019re generally structured with auto renewals and they auto renew. And those are happening as we speak. There\u2019s none that are like \u2013 there\u2019s not like a cliff of these coming. If you remember our dialogues over the last one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, we\u2019re adding partnerships every quarter. As you add those, those have a term to them, but they\u2019re on auto renewal, and we deliver so much value to that partner. And the \u2013 not only from the integration, which is very complex. It\u2019s not a simple integration. As you heard earlier, we signed a large partner in the quarter that\u2019s going to add those 6 million records, it\u2019s going to take us two, three, four months of very intense technology and data work in order to bring those records into our environment so then they can be normalized to be delivered in our TWN report. So there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into that integration that makes our relationships quite sticky. And then, of course, from a monetization standpoint, as we keep growing our business, our partners\u2019 monetization grows every quarter. So there\u2019s a very strong relationship there. And as you may know, beyond just income employment with partners like payroll processors, we\u2019re increasingly doing our other services like I-9 unemployment claims and WOTC in partnership with those kind of companies. So we have multiple relationships. So maybe said differently, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in the long-term nature of our partnerships around TWN records.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. You addressed the customer mix headwinds in TWN mortgage, but I think you also said there were some product headwinds, and it wasn\u2019t clear to me. Is that just lapping kind of the Mortgage 36 adoption and losing that tailwind? Or is there some trade-down effect if you can?\nMark Begor: Yes, you got it, Jeff. That\u2019s the Mortgage 36. We\u2019ve got for the second half some other innovation coming out of mortgage in EWS that we would hope will benefit the second half or certainly in 2025. So we\u2019re always focusing on kind of new solutions that will add value. But Mortgage 36 was just a very powerful solution. And as you point out, we are lapping past that.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then can you just comment to kind of share dynamics on the nonexclusive records for TWN mortgage? And just remind us how you monitor that? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes. So just as a reminder for everybody that\u2019s still on the call, half of our records come from individual relationships through our employer vertical where we have delivered those regulatory services like UC I-9 unemployment, et cetera. So we or you, I say you tend to talk about our partner records, but a reminder that half of our records are individual relationships. And we\u2019re growing those every month as we grow our employer business. And as you point out, we\u2019ve got partnerships. And we tend to talk or you tend to talk about payroll processors, but they\u2019re HR software companies. Software platforms is another way for us to partner. We\u2019ve got a number of relationships there and a pipeline of additional relationships. We have pension administrators is another one, which is like a payroll processor but for the pension space. As you know, we\u2019re chasing that 20 million to 30 million of defined benefit pensioners is a big pool of data assets that we have. And those are all multiyear in nature, and we have strong relationships with all of those partners that we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live.\nCraig Huber: Thank you. First question, in your U.S. Online Information Solutions area, can you size for us in dollars your credit card and your auto exposure there? And I\u2019m curious also what your outlook is again for revenues this year reach?\nJohn Gamble: Yes. So we haven\u2019t broken down all of the different markets that we have in USIS. FI and auto are two of our largest segments. So certainly the case, but we haven\u2019t specifically given dollar values within our online services for auto and card. But they\u2019re large within our total OIS revenue.\nCraig Huber: And how about the outlook there for the revenues for each of those auto and credit card for this year, please?\nJohn Gamble: I think what we did is we\u2019ve given a view specifically as it relates to total non-mortgage for USIS. And we talked about that in the call, both for the second quarter and for the year, right? And I think that\u2019s the level of granular we\u2019re going to talk about. We did indicate that we expect to see very nice performance in U.S. consumer, very nice continued growth above our long-term averages, right, with commercial, good performance also within ID and fraud right? Those we expect to continue to perform very, very well. We had very good performance in FI in the first quarter. We gave specifics on that as well. But in terms of specifics by segment, no, we don\u2019t give guidance at that level.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Simon Clinch from Redburn Partners. Your line is now live.\nSimon Clinch: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just jump to the government vertical, please. And of the growth \u2013 the excellent growth that you delivered this quarter, are you able to break out how much of that growth actually came from redetermination so that we can get a sense of what the actual underlying growth rate is, to start with?\nMark Begor: Yeah. And thanks for bringing up government. It's the first time we've gotten a question on that this morning. And as you know, that business is really performing exceptionally well. And as we talked about in the quarter it's actually now our largest vertical inside of Workforce Solutions for the first quarter in Workforce Solutions history. So it's a very powerful business for us in that $5 billion TAM. We exited the year at roughly a $600 million annual run rate in that business, which obviously is well north of, slightly north of 10% of overall Equifax. So it's a vertical we like with lots of growth opportunities. There are \u2013 there's multiple levers I think John and I both talked about in our prepared comments in government. Redeterminations are a piece of that. I wouldn't think about that as like disproportionate from the other levers that we have inside of government. You may remember back in September we signed a big extension with CMS that was over a billion dollars that had a price increase in it. So that's rolling through. That's a five-year contract. You can make your own assumptions on the impact that had in the fourth quarter. And again, the first quarter is that price increase goes into effect and that has annual escalators post when we lap it in September of 2024. We signed a brand new contract in September with USDA for SNAP TANF benefits that's $190 million contract over five years. So that's rolling into the P&L and positive in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And then we've also tried to be pretty deliberate about sharing that the state penetration is also a very strong lever for growth. And we should probably think about how we can better articulate that for you. But as you probably know we have a lot of penetration opportunity primarily at the states. Government social services are delivered at the state level and we've put more and more resources at the state capitals to really drive usage of our solutions. And as a reminder a state is not an entity. Each agency within a state is really the entity that we work with, whether it's food stamps, rent support, child care support, healthcare benefits all the different social services or kind of different organizations and all types of states. So that's had a big positive for us. So it may be a bit long winded, but it's multifaceted. All of those levers and then price, right. Prices inherent in our contracts, we don't do one, one price increases in our government contracts. Those are all built in as multi-year contracts with escalators in them. But we have a lot of visibility as we enter the year when those price actions are going to lay into our P&L as we roll through the year.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. Just time for a couple.\nMark Begor: Strong growth in the second quarter, right, so we're going to continue with strong growth in the second quarter despite the fact that the redetermination after the pause is over. Again, as a reminder, redeterminations happen continuously. It's a requirement of government programs that you redetermine that the participants are still eligible. The difference was they were on pause during the health emergency.\nSimon Clinch: Yeah. Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up question, I guess it's more of a high-level question here on the mortgage market and EWS's position within it. The industry is going to be going through an evolution over the next decade, becoming more automated, reducing costs, but also shrinking, hopefully the time it takes from origination to closing a mortgage. I'm wondering how does that impact your business in EWS in terms of the pricing power you have, but also the number of \u2013 the number of polls you might get per inquiry and all that kind of stuff. How is that factored into your long-term framework?\nMark Begor: Yes. So first off, you hit all the right points and it's not new. It's been happening as we speak, and it's been happening over the last five plus years as more and more consumers are shopping for mortgages online. It's actually very rare that they go into a mortgage broker's office now. So that's been a huge change, and as you point out, the fact that they're not seeing the consumer results in the value of instant as well as digital data being more valuable. And then the second half of that is every vertical we'll focus on mortgage, but autos the same case cards, et cetera. They want to shorten the time between, call it inquiry or application or shopping through the closing. And mortgage is very precarious for a mortgage originator, because they're spending $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 of COGS on that closed loan. And the reason they need instant and accurate data is they need to make sure that they want to continue to invest in that application over what could be a 60, 90 day timeframe and a lot can change for the consumer around their credit. They could take on more credit and then no longer qualify for the loan. It can change about their employment. They could lose their job; change their job, et cetera. So that's why instant data is very valuable. So digitization and focus on shortening the time to complete a process plays to Equifax when we have instant data. In the case of mortgage on income and employment, and background screening for employment history in government, social services around income, those all play to us. And there's also an element of productivity, because if they're not using our solution, in the case of mortgage there's still a large number of mortgage originators that do all of their verifications manually. There's a lot of labor involved in that. As labor costs go up, you have the double benefit of both speed, actually triple speed, accuracy and productivity. So those macros play to us in mortgage and more broadly across Equifax.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. I wanted to ask a question on the guidance. It implies a strong second half improvement in workforce. And you talked about a number of the drivers in this call, including lapping the ERC headwind. And you mentioned adding records, among others. I was hoping you could talk about the pipeline with regard to records, if that's a big driver and also just maybe directionally the importance of what starts to go a little bit better as we go through the year?\nMark Begor: So records is certainly one that is important. We were pleased with our record additions. As you know, we added four partnerships in the fourth quarter. We added a bunch last year, but those four coming on in the first half of the year, and then landing this largest payroll processor with 6 million records, that's a lot of records to add. When you think about [indiscernible] million individuals that is a real positive to have that. And now we have visibility of where we expect that to come on. And as you know, the power in our business model is that when we add a new record or these 6 million records, we monetize them the next day because we're already getting inquiries from our customers for them. So that clearly records in the second half is a positive and ERC is kind of what it's going to be. The WOTC piece is a little \u2013 is a kind of a timing impact. As the government forms didn't get fully implemented in the first quarter. That's going to be a benefit from that small backlog as we go through the second half. What else would you add, John?\nJohn Gamble: I think talent moves back across ten, which we think is very beneficial. You asked upfront about the pipeline for new contributors. We think the pipeline is very strong. What we talked about is who we've closed. The pipeline is also strong and there's opportunities for strengthen as we go through the year. And we would expect that it would, right. So we feel very good about the pipeline of new contributors and it's growing as we continue to add more.\nMark Begor: Toni, I shared this earlier, but you think about the 126 million individuals we have today in our data set for twin. There's 225 million out there, so we got 100 million to go, so there's a long runway for record growth and as John pointed out, we have a very active pipeline for second quarter, for third quarter, for fourth quarter. There's still a lot of momentum and enthusiasm for those that are not monetizing the records with equal crack to do so.\nJohn Gamble: And it has some exciting new products in EWS, some of which we've already talked about, which we think should drive growth again in the non-mortgage segments, generally in verifier. So again we feel very good about the trends that you should be seeing as we go through the year and that will deliver.\nToni Kaplan: Yes. Great. And just as you think about the first four months of this year, basically when you think about what you've seen in terms of consumer demand or lender appetite, you mentioned strong employment persisting and that's obviously good from a consumer credit standpoint. But just any sort of changes or trajectory that you've seen, that either make you more constructive or this is something we're watching?\nJohn Gamble: So far what we've seen, I think in terms of the broader markets other than mortgage, right. Obviously mortgage we guided and now assuming a market that was consistent with run rates that we were seeing. As Mark said, I think expectations in the market were very different than that. And we've seen probably the market expectations move toward where we started, maybe not quite to where we were, but moved in that direction. Other than that, right. I think the only market we talk about where we've seen a little weakness is in auto, and we have seen that was a little weaker than we expected. Other than that, generally speaking, I think the markets don't look that different than when we started the year. FI looks fairly good. Right. So I think we feel fairly good and we think things are operating consistent, generally speaking with where we started the year. Right. The big impact on USIS non-mortgage that we \u2013 that we've already talked about is our sales to other bureaus. Right. And that, that was weaker than we thought, and we've now assumed that that'll continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Arthur Truslove from Citi. Your line is now live.\nArthur Truslove: Thank you very much. Good morning, [indiscernible]. So I guess the main question from me was, you're obviously saying that mortgage origination volumes were down 22%. I guess if I look at data from elsewhere, whether it's Fannie Mae, new acquisitions or MBA forecasts, it looks like they think volumes might been up certainly in January and February and maybe in the first quarter and certainly not down very much. I guess my question is sort of, how do you explain that gap between what these people seem to be seeing and what you've seen in terms of those originations? Thank you.\nMark Begor: Yes. So what we quote, right. Is our inquiry. So we quote actual inquiry data on the credit bureau. Right. And as a reminder, mortgage transactions require tri-bureau pole. So we and our peers see every transaction. Right. We know there's third parties that estimate originations. They don't know what they are. They're doing surveys and estimating a number, and we don't use that number or try to explain the difference between inquiries, which are actuals as of the day that we give them and what you're seeing from third party groups that are doing estimations. So when we're talking about mortgage inquiries in the first quarter and our estimation of mortgage inquiries for the year, it's based on actuals and what we can see transacting.\nArthur Truslove: But just following up on that. So if obviously inquiries are earlier in the process than originations. So I was referring more to the origination side within the Workforce Solutions business. And I guess my question was essentially, are you losing share there, whether to manual activity or to other participants in the market? Because on the sort of origination side, it looks like the third-party data providers offset are forecasting significantly better trends than what you printed. So I guess I was trying to understand whether you\u2026\nMark Begor: Maybe a couple of things, is this the data I think you're looking at and we look at too, we found historically to be too optimistic. Mortgage originations we don't see and the industry don't see except on a six month lag. Right. That's how it's reported. It doesn't show up. And what you're looking at is surveys. These are surveys where MBA and others will go out to some of the participants and say, what do you think mortgage originations are going to be? And some of those were done probably back in February or March when the expectation was of Fed rate cuts, maybe in second quarter, which obviously doesn't feel like that's how the Fed's signaling today. So there's a lot of change in that. When we look back historically at actual originations, which again are on a six month lag compared to our inquiry activity, there's a strong alignment with it, so we don't see it differing. And what we've done for a decade is use our mortgage inquiries as a proxy for the market because that's what we see. And then trying to share with you how we're doing versus the market, which is our mortgage outperformance typically. And what it has been. Not typically, but it has been meaning how far do we grow above the market from price product in the case of EWS records or penetration into either USIS or TWN customers.\nJohn Gamble: And if you take a look at the TWN inquiries that we discussed, as well as compare them to credit, somewhat similar, and they tend to be moving directionally together. So that's something we look at closely to see how they're moving together. Because we know in one case credit, we see all the transactions because it's mandated, right. So when we think about looking at trends and trends in EWS, we try to compare them a little bit to USIS, so that we can, that's our best judge for how things are trending across both businesses.\nArthur Truslove: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Within your Workforce Solutions business, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing around customer price sensitivity and overall competition in the quarter and impact that these might have had on EWS growth?\nMark Begor: Yes. Two different questions. The first one on so-called price sensitivity and I would say universally, nobody likes price, nobody likes a price increase. So from a sensitivity standpoint, there's always challenges in any of our verticals when we go out to take price up. But our customers understand the value of our data and the uniqueness of our data. So those are conversations that we work through, and we work hard to try to be balanced around what we do on price. And as you know, price is only one lever that we use at Equifax. Product is a big part of how we go to market. And product for us, you got to think about, is really bringing more ROI or value to our customer\u2019s penetration into our verticals. We have big white space and lots of verticals, particularly in Workforce Solutions, where we're converting from manual to our instant solution. And then, of course, price. Competition maybe is a different question, you know, we think we have a very strong market position. We don't feel an impact, from the one or two participants that have much smaller businesses, in income and employment. Frankly, we think about our biggest competitor in EWS and income and employment is manual verifications. That's really the white space. And when you see the TAM, we had a TAM chart for government this quarter, and then we had a TAM for the whole business in last quarter's deck. That white space between our revenue and the TAM is all manual verifications. And our focus is on delivering our digital solution and driving penetration in there.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And I wanted to go back to your medium term mortgage outlook at this point, what proportion of mortgages have rates below 5% based on what you see? And how much would rates need to fall for mortgage volumes to go back to pre-COVID levels?\nMark Begor: That's a very hard question to answer. The second half in particular, first half I don't have at my fingertips. We have that. And you can reach out to Trevor or Sam, and they can help us. I think there's public data out there on that. You know, it's very available on the number of mortgages below 5%. When we think about a mortgage recovery, we think about it being multifaceted and actually mostly driven by purchase. The purchase activity has come down dramatically as what I would call as normal refis. And as you know, there's two types of refis that happen. There's rate refis when the rate decrease, which I think is your 5% point. But there's going to be some level of consumers when rates go down to 5% to 4%, whatever the rates go to, of rate refis. There's also a large number of cash out refis. There's something like $29 trillion or almost $30 trillion of untapped equity in consumers\u2019 homes. And there's typically a fairly steady amount of cash out refis that happened. Those have been pulled back. There's still some happening, but they've been pulled back meaningfully from what we would characterize as normal because of the rapid increase in rates. And then purchase is a very big part of the mortgage business, and that's the one that's been curtailed more. There's just not a lot of housing stocks for sale. Consumers are not putting, although it's starting to pick up, but consumers are holding off upgrading from that two bedroom condo to the three bedroom house, or going from a rental property into an owned home. We would expect as rates stabilize, which they really have in the last, outside of the increase of 20 bps in the last couple of weeks, that they've kind of stabilized at this higher level. But the combination of stabilization and then some level of reduction as the Fed takes rates down is, we think will be the stimulus for, activity moving forward over the medium term, pick your, you can call it long or medium term, but meaning 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 we would expect inflation to get under control. We would expect the Fed to take rates down, likely not to where they were during the COVID timeframe, but back down to more historic normal levels in order to boost economic activity. And we think that's going to be a stimulus to start driving our mortgage revenue into that $1.1 billion of opportunity as we return to 2015 to 2019 levels.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor for any further closing comments.\nTrevor Burns: Yes. Thanks, everybody, for your time today. Do you have any follow-up questions you can reach out to me and Sam. We\u2019ll be around today and tomorrow to discuss. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "John Gamble",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. Turning to Slide 11. First quarter mortgage market credit inquiries were down about 19% and TWN mortgage inquiry volumes were down 22%. We believe homebuyers continue to have difficulty completing purchase transactions, resulting in a continuation of shopping, which generally results in credit inquiries, which occur earlier in the purchase process being stronger than TWN inquiries. Consistent with our practice from the first quarter and the last several years, our guidance for both credit inquiries and TWN inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two to four weeks modified to reflect normal seasonal patterns. For both credit and TWN inquiries, we saw some weakening in trends in late March and early April as mortgage rates increased over that period. Mortgage credit inquiry run rates remain somewhat better than the guidance we provided in February. Our guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 13% in the second quarter of 2024 and 11% in calendar year 2024, about 600 basis points and 500 basis points better than our February guidance, respectively. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries at about the levels we discussed in February with TWN inquiries down about 19% in Q2 and down about 14% for the year. This reflects the continuation of mortgage shopping we saw in the first quarter. As a reminder and as we discussed in February, we expect the level of USIS mortgage revenue outperformance to moderate as we move through 2024 as we start to lap the growth in new mortgage prequal products. We expect 2Q USIS mortgage outperformance to be about 40%, down from the 57% in the first quarter with full year USIS mortgage outperformance also expected to be on the order of 40%. We expect TWN revenue mortgage outperformance in the second quarter to be up slightly from the 7% we saw in the first quarter. As Mark indicated, second half 2024 mortgage outperformance should be about 14% with full year about 11% and at the low end of our long-term 11% to 13% framework. Slide 12 provides the details of our 2Q 2024 guidance. In 2Q 2024, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.41 billion and $1.43 billion with revenue up about 8% at the midpoint. Nonmortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to about 11%. Mortgage revenue in the second quarter is expected to be up about 3%. Mortgage revenue will be just over 20% of Equifax revenue. FX is negative to revenue about 2 points. Business unit performance in the second quarter is expected to be as follows. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 3%, with mortgage revenue down about 12.5%. EWS nonmortgage revenue should grow over 9% in the quarter. Nonmortgage Verifier revenue will again be up about 15% in the second quarter driven again by government and a return to growth in Talent Solutions. And Employer Services revenue is expected to decline about 4% in the quarter due to declines in ERC revenue. Excluding ERC, Employer Services revenue should be up slightly. We expect Employer Services to return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 as we lap ERC headwinds. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to again be about 51%. USIS revenue is expected to be up over 8% year-to-year, despite the continued decline in mortgage market inquiries. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of over 2% should be up from the 1% we saw this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up strongly to about 34.5%. International revenue is expected to be up over 20% in constant currency due to the addition of BVS. Revenue is expected to be up approaching 10% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 25.5%, reflecting revenue growth. We expect Brazil to deliver revenue of over $40 million in the second quarter. Equifax 2Q 2024 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32% at the mid-point of our guidance, an increase sequentially of about 300 basis points, principally reflecting the higher equity compensation expense we saw in the first quarter. Adjusted EPS in 2Q 2024 is expected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share about flat versus 2Q 2023 at the mid-point. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were about $125 million and consistent with our expectations. We expect capital expenditures in the second quarter to be at levels consistent with the first quarter and we continue to expect CapEx to be about $475 million for the year, which is a year-to-year reduction of over $100 million. As we discussed in February 1 of our capital allocation priorities in 2024 is leverage reduction from free cash flow expansion. As of the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was just over 3 times with a goal by year-end 2024 of about 2.5 times. We believe these levels of leverage are nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases, as well as to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. As Mark covered earlier, we are making very good progress on completing migration of our U.S. and Canadian consumer credit exchange changes to cloud, which will enable the shutdown of significant legacy systems in 3Q and 4Q. These actions enable significant cost benefits in the second half of 2024, which will allow us to deliver sequentially higher EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS in 3Q and 4Q. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full year guidance, which is overall unchanged from the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with our February guidance, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5% with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% at the center of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is now expected to grow over 10%, reflecting USIS mortgage revenue that is stronger than our February guidance. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow more than 20 points better than the about 13% reduction from the average decline in USIS and EWS mortgage inquiries in our framework. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10% with organic growth of over 8%. This is solidly within our long-term framework, although slightly below the levels we discussed in February. FX is about 190 basis points negative to revenue growth. We have also slightly adjusted BU level guidance. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue of about 7% in 2024. This reflects mortgage revenue down slightly about 11 points better than underlying EWS mortgage transactions. EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow about 10%. The slight decline from February guidance is due to the expected weaker revenue performance in employer driven by the more rapid decline in ERC and deferral of WOTC revenue Mark referenced earlier. Excluding the expected significant decline in ERC revenue as that pandemic support program completes, EWS non-mortgage revenue growth is about 12%. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth over 9% in 2024 above the high end of our long-term growth target of 6% to 8%. Mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 25% on the order of 40 points stronger than the expected over 11% decline in mortgage credit inquiry. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 3%, down from the 4% in our February guidance. We continue to expect non-mortgage growth will be driven by strong consumer services, commercial identity and fraud and FI. As we saw in the first quarter, the overall auto market was weaker than our expectation impacting our auto based revenue and our D2C revenue the business in which we sell credit dated to other credit bureaus was weaker than we expected and down substantially. We continue to expect international to deliver constant currency revenue growth of over 15% in 2024 with organic constant currency growth of about 10%. As we discussed in February, the high levels of inflation we are seeing in Argentina are expected to benefit overall international revenue growth by about 5 percentage points. Although uncertain, we have assumed the currency devaluation in Argentina will more than offset inflation in our 2024 planning. We believe that our guidance is centered at the mid-point of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Turning to Slide 14 and as we discussed in February, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the market bottoms and moves from a headwind to a tailwind and the mortgage market recovers towards its historic norms that presents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our mortgage gross margins, this over $1 billion of mortgage revenue would deliver over $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that you would expect to move into our P&L. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Relative to our expectation for the first quarter, seven was a little lower than we expected. As we said in the script, it was really driven a lot by customer mix and channel mix, right. We saw some shifts in our customers and to some of our customers that had lower pricing than others, and that impacted our first quarter outperformance levels. Going forward for the rest of the year, we basically assume that level of mix is going to continue. And as Mark said, the growth is really driven by records. Long-term, I think we've said before that we're expecting mortgage outperformance to look pretty much like the level of outperformance excluding economy \u2013 of the economy that we're talking about for EWS in general, which is something like 11%, 12%, 13%. So I think long-term, that's the type of level we're thinking about. So it translates into better mortgage revenue for USIS in total, not necessarily specifically for OIS, right. So you need to look at both OIS as well as core mortgage. But yes, inquiries translate fairly directly. Yes. So again, what we're talking about is just mortgage in total, right. So and I think the trajectory for mortgage in total is what we talked about on the call, right. So we didn't really split mortgage solutions and OIS. We manage it as one kind of one single business. I understand it's on two different line items when we report, but we tend to focus on mortgage in total and trying to drive the mortgage performance overall up for the year. And I think we gave very specific information about what we expected overall mortgage is very strong, up over 25% for the full year, right, outperformance on the order of 40 points. So we think it's going to be very strong in total. And just as a reminder for 2024, right, as we said in the script, our guidance reflects current activity, current run rates, which is at current rates, right. So effectively, our guidance assumes rates stay where they are. Let me just add. Just got to remember a point about performance is not a large number, right? So we can see shifts about performance of several points, and it isn't a really large number on our mortgage revenue. And that's why you saw that we had a little bit of outperformance in inquiries. And yes, we had some out \u2013 we had some underperformance and outperformance, but we ended up with revenue on, right? So I think unfortunately what we're talking about here is really small percentages that can be impacted by not large movements in revenue. And that's what you're seeing here, right? But overall, Mark covered it already, right, the real driver here of this business is consistent, large growth in records, which makes the product more valuable, which is why we expect to see continued improvement in the level of mortgage revenue as we go through the year, relatively speaking. So we feel very good about what's going on with the products we're offering because of the fact that we're adding records so rapidly. As you look through the year, we are expecting margins to go up. It's obvious in our guidance, right? I talked a little bit about the fact that we have meaningful cost reductions coming as we decommission major systems in our consumer businesses in North America. We feel good about executing against those as Mark talked about. We also just \u2013 you've got to remember we generally have an improving mix of revenue as we go through the year, especially in the fourth quarter as mortgage declines as a percentage of our revenue. It happens every year. It's just market, right? So as that happens, that tends to be margin accretive for us. So executing against our plans and quite honestly, the addition of records in EWS is very accretive for us as we go because obviously that's very high margin revenue that doesn't draw with it expense below variable cost. So we feel very good about our ability to deliver on our full year numbers. Sure. So, I think the full year is down a point, principally because of employer. Right. So that some of the items we talked about certainly was yes, it's a deferral, but it's lower for the year and it doesn't all turn in 2024. And ERC is lower for the year. And so generally speaking, the reduction is principally related to employer. On mortgage, we did indicate we're seeing slightly better performance than mortgage on inquiries. Right. That we said, we had expected shopping when we gave a guidance back in February to kind of to be not as substantial in 2024. What we saw in the first quarter is it was. So we're now assuming it will continue for the entire year. And that even though they're made, the inquiries are similar to; we're expecting a little weaker level of performance in terms of outperformance. Right. That we just talked about. So that's affecting mortgage revenue overall. Non -mortgage verifier revenue really strong, that continues to be very, very good. Government's performing incredibly well, outperforming our expectations overall. We expect talent to recover. We actually had fairly good performance in kind of the non-mortgage financial services portion of the P&L. So we felt relatively good about that. So overall, non-mortgage in verification services is very good. So the real movement relative to the 8% we gave before the biggest driver is employer services and then also mortgages, is even though maybe you have a little better overall inquiries in total for the year, they're being offset by the weaker level of outperformance that we talked about. Principally driven by mix. Right. Principally driven by customer mix, which we saw in the first quarter. Yes. We basically assume it's going to continue into the second quarter. Right. So we're seeing it to be at lower run rates. So we're assuming those run rates are just going to continue. Yes. So we haven't broken down all of the different markets that we have in USIS. FI and auto are two of our largest segments. So certainly the case, but we haven't specifically given dollar values within our online services for auto and card. But they're large within our total OIS revenue. I think what we did is we've given a view specifically as it relates to total non-mortgage for USIS. And we talked about that in the call, both for the second quarter and for the year, right? And I think that's the level of granular we're going to talk about. We did indicate that we expect to see very nice performance in U.S. consumer, very nice continued growth above our long-term averages, right, with commercial, good performance also within ID and fraud right? Those we expect to continue to perform very, very well. We had very good performance in FI in the first quarter. We gave specifics on that as well. But in terms of specifics by segment, no, we don't give guidance at that level. I think talent moves back across ten, which we think is very beneficial. You asked upfront about the pipeline for new contributors. We think the pipeline is very strong. What we talked about is who we've closed. The pipeline is also strong and there's opportunities for strengthen as we go through the year. And we would expect that it would, right. So we feel very good about the pipeline of new contributors and it's growing as we continue to add more. And it has some exciting new products in EWS, some of which we've already talked about, which we think should drive growth again in the non-mortgage segments, generally in verifier. So again we feel very good about the trends that you should be seeing as we go through the year and that will deliver. So far what we've seen, I think in terms of the broader markets other than mortgage, right. Obviously mortgage we guided and now assuming a market that was consistent with run rates that we were seeing. As Mark said, I think expectations in the market were very different than that. And we've seen probably the market expectations move toward where we started, maybe not quite to where we were, but moved in that direction. Other than that, right. I think the only market we talk about where we've seen a little weakness is in auto, and we have seen that was a little weaker than we expected. Other than that, generally speaking, I think the markets don't look that different than when we started the year. FI looks fairly good. Right. So I think we feel fairly good and we think things are operating consistent, generally speaking with where we started the year. Right. The big impact on USIS non-mortgage that we \u2013 that we've already talked about is our sales to other bureaus. Right. And that, that was weaker than we thought, and we've now assumed that that'll continue. And if you take a look at the TWN inquiries that we discussed, as well as compare them to credit, somewhat similar, and they tend to be moving directionally together. So that's something we look at closely to see how they're moving together. Because we know in one case credit, we see all the transactions because it's mandated, right. So when we think about looking at trends and trends in EWS, we try to compare them a little bit to USIS, so that we can, that's our best judge for how things are trending across both businesses."

            "name": "Mark Begor",
            "content": "Thank you, Trevor, and good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we're off to a strong start in 2024. First quarter reported revenue of $1.389 billion was up 7% at the high end of our February framework. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.1% were slightly above our expectations, and adjusted EPS of $1.50 a share was well above the high end of our guidance. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 6% in the quarter, stronger than expected. The strength in mortgage revenue was in USIS, where mortgage revenue was up 38% against credit inquiries that were down 19% and 700 basis points better than expected and continued strong performance in our new mortgage prequal products. EWS mortgage revenue was down 15% and consistent with our expectations. Twin inquiries are down 22% was slightly better than expected, and this was offset by slightly lower than expected revenue per inquiry, principally driven by product and customer mix. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 80% of total revenue in the quarter, had strong 9% constant currency revenue growth, which is well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework. This was slightly below our expectation of 9.5% non-mortgage revenue growth. Non-mortgage organic constant currency record growth was 5% in the first quarter. At the BU level, EWS Verifier non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 15% and stronger than expected, driven by very strong 35% growth in government and good growth in auto and debt management, slightly offset by some verticals in talent. Employer revenue was down 10% and weaker than expected. This was principally driven by a more rapid decline in ERC revenue than we expected and delays in state government processing of WOTC claims. ERC is now at a run rate of 103 million a quarter and should stay at about that level for the rest of the year. For WOTC, the federal requirement for states to validate WOTC claims changed late last year and most states have not yet completed the changes required to process claims, which dampened our revenue in the quarter. This impacted our WOTC revenue in the first quarter, but we expect this to be a timing issue as this essentially creates a backlog of WOTC submissions that will have to be completed by the states that will begin turning to revenue as state processing accelerates in the remainder of 2024. Offsetting these declines in the quarter, we saw mid single digit growth in I-9 and onboarding revenue. And going forward, we expect employer revenue, including ERC, to be up low single digit percentages for the remainder of 2024. In total, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up 7% and overall EWS revenue was up 1% and adjusted EBITDA margins of EWS at 51.1% were over 50 basis points stronger than our expectations from strong operating leverage and strong performance. USIS had a very strong quarter with revenue up 10%, its highest quarterly revenue growth in three years, even against the 19% mortgage market decline. As I referenced earlier, mortgage revenue was up 38% and stronger than expected from mortgage and pricing pass-through and our new prequal solution. Non-mortgage revenue was up 1% and was weaker than expected. Although we had very strong double digit growth in Kount and consumer solutions and mid single digit growth in banking and lending, we saw double digit declines in third-party bureau sales and low to mid single digit declines in Telco and Auto. In USIS, adjusted EBITDA margins were up \u2013 were 32.7% in the quarter and up about 70 basis points higher than our expectations. International delivered 20% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding the impact of the BVS acquisition, both of which were above our expectations. Very strong growth in Latin America and Europe was partially offset by lower than expected growth in Asia Pacific. International delivered 24.3% adjusted EBITDA margins, up slightly from our expectations. As you can see from the right hand side of the slide, we added a new strategic priority this year to focus on driving AI innovation. As mentioned in February, 70% of our new models and scores were built last year using AI and ML with a goal of 80% this year. In the first quarter, we exceeded this goal with 85% of our new models and scores being built with Equifax AI and Machine Learning. Equifax.ai, leveraging our proprietary data, Equifax Cloud and API capabilities, is a big area of focus and execution for Equifax in 2024 and beyond. We're maintaining our 2024 guidance with revenue at the midpoint of $5.72 billion and adjusted EPs of $7.35 a share. Our strong first quarter with revenue at the top end of the range, EPS above the top end of the range gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the full year guidance we provided in February. We expect strong constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth of over 10% and our full year guidance is based on the assumption that the U.S. mortgage market continues at levels consistent with current run rates with U.S. credit inquiries down about 11% from 2023. Before I cover our business unit results in detail, I want to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and with the consumer. Broadly outside of the bottoming of the mortgage market, there is not a lot of change from our view back in February. The U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at historic levels with low unemployment, which is a positive for consumers and customers. Employment turnover and hiring at lower levels entering 2024 than last year, hiring levels in January and February were at their lowest levels in three years. This is more pronounced for higher salaried roles than lower salaried or hourly jobs. Credit card and auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market, are stable and at historically low levels of less than 1%, but above pre-pandemic levels and subprime credit card and auto delinquency rates continue to remain above pre-pandemic levels with auto subprime delinquencies above 2009 levels. As we've discussed before, it's our view that when consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current under financial obligations, which is good for our customers and good for Equifax. Turning to Slide 5, workforce solutions revenue was up 1% in the quarter, slightly below our expectations. EWS mortgage revenue was down 15% as expected. Twin inquiries are down 22% or slightly better than expected, although weaker than USIS credit inquiries as homebuyers continue to have difficulty completing purchases while shopping behavior continues to be fairly strong. Our revenue outperformed inquiries by 7% which was below the about 11% we have guided during February relative to our February guidance, the benefit of the mortgage price increases implemented in January by EWS and stronger fulfillment rates due to the growth in twin records, whereas expected. However, these were partially offset principally by a shift in product and customer events. As we look to the remainder of 2024, we expect twin record growth to result in improved mortgage outperformance with the second quarter up slightly from first quarter levels and the second half of the year at about 14% outperformance. For the full year of 2024, we expect mortgage outperformance to be about 11% at EWS. This is down significantly from the 20% we saw last year as we lapped the late 2022 launch of our higher-priced Mortgage 36 trended data solution. Non-mortgage verification services revenue which represents over 70% of verifier revenue, delivered a very strong 50% growth at the top end of the EWS long-term revenue growth framework of 13% to 15% and was also above our expectations. Government, which is now our largest Verification Services vertical, had another outstanding quarter and was stronger than our expectations with 35% revenue growth. Government revenue benefited from both our new CMS and SNAP contracts, continued expansion of state contracts, continued TWN record growth and pricing. We expect continued growth in government throughout 2024 with stronger growth rates in the first half as post-COVID CMS redeterminations principally complete in the first quarter. Talent Solutions revenue was down 4% in the quarter which was weaker than expected as we saw very slow volumes through both January and February. Market saw about flat revenue which was more consistent with our expectations \u2013 which we expect to continue into the second quarter. Consumer lending revenue was 6% in the quarter as we saw strength in our auto and debt management businesses slightly offset by declines in card. This is the second consecutive quarter of consumer lending revenue growth as we're lapping headwinds from the FinTech lending pullbacks in 2022 and 2023. Auto and debt management revenue growth was principally driven by strong record growth and our pricing actions in the first quarter. As I referenced earlier, Employer Services revenue was down 10% compared to the \u2013 about 4% decline we discussed in February from ERC and ROIC reductions. Moving forward, we expect employer revenue, excluding ERC, to be up low single digits for the remainder of 2024. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.1% continue to be very strong from non-mortgage revenue growth, due to cost execution, while we continue to invest in new products, expanding the high growth verticals like government and talent, and grow our TWN records. As a reminder, EWS first quarter margins are seasonally lower from a higher mix of employer solutions revenue, principally from ACA and W-2 in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 6 and expanding on our discussion of EWS TAMs, in February, we provided additional details on our fast growing government vertical. On the left side of the slide, we outlined some of the federal agencies we're supporting with EWS Workforce Solutions, digital income, employment, and incarceration data that accelerate the time to deliver needed social services benefits to over 90 million Americans and help government agencies ensure program integrity, a win-win for all parties. And in the middle of the slide, you can see the substantial progress our EWS government vertical has made in a short period of time, penetrating the $5 billion TAM with a three-year CAGR of over 50%. We expect EWS to continue making significant progress penetrating the government vertical from additional sales resources at federal and individual state capital level, strong, clean record growth, new product rollouts with our differentiated incarceration data and system-to-system integrations enabled by our cloud-native technology that makes our solutions easier for our government customers \u2013 our government customers to consume. Our SSA contracts, last year's $1.2 billion CMS contract extension and the new $190 million SNAP contract are examples of our EWS involving various government agencies improve the consumer experience and their own operating efficiency, from the application and authentication phases to redetermination and recovery processes. The strength of the EWS government vertical was clear again in the quarter, and we expect strong future growth in this business in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 7, EWS had another strong quarter of new record additions and signing new payroll processors. During the quarter, EWS signed agreements with two new payroll processors, including one large payroll processor that will contribute over six million current records to the TWN dataset. This added the six partnerships we signed in the fourth quarter that are coming online in the first half of 2024, and this brings the total number of payroll providers added to the TWN database to 35 since the beginning of 2021 and the pipeline for new records continues to be strong. Both of these wins in the quarter are a testament to EWS' ability to deliver the highest levels of client service from a technology, data security and accuracy, operational excellence, as well as the highest level of record monetization that EWS participates in a broad range of verticals including government, mortgage, talent solutions, talent screening, card, auto and personal loans. And given our advancements in AI and cloud-native capabilities, the time to board new records from payroll processes has decreased over the past few years. We expect these new record additions in the first quarter to come online and begin generating revenue in early third quarter. In the quarter, EWS added four million current records, growing the TWN database by 10% over last year. At the end of the quarter, the TWN database had 172 million current records on 126 million unique individuals. Total records, both current and historic, are now about 670 million and were up about 8%. These are very strong results given the typical churn in holiday season hiring in the first quarter. In terms of coverage, we have current employment records on about 75% BLS non-farm payroll and over 55% coverage on the estimated 225 million income producing Americans. At 126 million unique active records, we have plenty of room to grow the TWN database towards the TAM of 225 million income producing Americans. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue was up 10%, stronger than our expectations and well above their 6% to 8% long-term growth framework, principally due to stronger than expected mortgage revenue. As I referenced earlier, USIS mortgage revenue was up 38% and stronger than our expectations. Mortgage credit inquiries at down 19% were still down substantially, but 700 basis points above our February guidance. We also continue to see very strong performance from our new Mortgage Prequal solution. The strong pricing environment, along with the strength in our Prequal product drove the very strong mortgage outperformance of 57%. At $145 million mortgage revenue was just over 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up just over 1% and weaker than the above 3% growth we had expected. Third-party sales to credit bureaus, including Experian and TransUnion were down double digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of third party bureaus revenue, USIS non-mortgage revenue was up about 2% and closer to our February guidance. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was down less than 1% and below our expectations, again driven by lower third-party bureau sales into a lesser extent declines in auto \u2013 auto and telco. Offsetting these declines was strong double digit growth in Kount and very good mid single digit growth in banking and lending. Commercial revenue growth was up low single digits in the quarter. Financial Marketing Services our B2B off line business was down 1% and slightly below our expectations. Marketing revenue was down 4%, principally due to a 10% decline in IXI revenue versus a difficult comp in the first quarter last year. We expect IXI revenue to grow for the full year. Pre-screen marketing was down less than 1% and at similar levels to the quarterly revenue we had in 2023. We continue to see declines smaller FIs principally or partially offset by growth in larger FIs. Within risk and accounting reviews, we did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but not to the level we would typically see if our customers were expecting a weakening economy. And fraud revenue was up a strong 8% from new business. USIS Consumer Solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter up 10% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. And USIS EBITDA margins were 32.7% in the quarter and higher than our expectations from stronger mortgage revenue growth. Turning now to Slide 9, International revenue was up 20% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of International revenue was up 20% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BVS and above the 18% growth we guided to in February due to better-than-expected revenue in Europe and Latin America. Europe local currency revenue was up very strong 10% in the quarter from strong growth in our UK, CRE, CRA B2B consumer and direct-to-consumer channels as well as our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, was up 31% versus last year driven by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Central America. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We expect to make good progress on the BVS integration as we expect to implement Interconnect, our end-to-end decision platform this summer, for small- and medium-sized businesses and by year-end for large businesses, and implement Ignite, our advanced analytics platform by year-end. The combination of our Ignite and Interconnect platforms will bring significantly enhanced capabilities to both the business and to the Brazilian market. Canada delivered 4% in the quarter as expected. And Canada is on track to complete their migration to the Equifax Cloud in the second quarter. And similar to USIS, we expect to see accelerating NPI as they complete the cloud. Asia-Pacific revenue was below our expectations with revenue down 10% due to lower market volumes principally in our Australian commercial business. We expect Asia-Pacific to have declining revenue in the first half due to the softer market conditions and the near-term impact of long-term contract extensions we signed with several large customers. We expect Asia-Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second half of this year. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.3% were above our expectations due to revenue growth and continued strong cost management. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to make very strong progress with new product innovation, launching over 25 new products in the quarter with a 9% up Vitality Index from broad-based strong performances across all of our BUs. As a reminder, our VI measure includes NPIs for the last three years. And on January 1, drops out NPIs or on January 1 dropped out NPIs from all of 2020. While our first quarter VI was slightly below our long-term goal of 10% as we lacked a large EWS Talent Solutions product launched in 2020, we expect our quarterly VI to accelerate throughout the year leveraging our EFX Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts for the full year 2024 VI of over 10%. Consistent with the fourth quarter of last year, USIS delivered another strong quarter with VI of 7% as we're closer to cloud completion and able to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation in new products, such as our suite of Ignite solutions including Ignite for prospecting and Ignite for financial services. EWS delivered VI of over 10%. We expect EWS VI to accelerate throughout 2024 with new product introductions focused on incarceration data, mortgage prequal and I-9 and onboarding products. As I mentioned earlier, EFX.AI is a pillar of our EFX2026 strategic priorities enabled by our EFX Cloud. In the middle of the slide, you can see that we're accelerating the pace at which we are developing new models, scores and products using AI and machine learning. In the first quarter, 85% of our new models and scores were built using AI and ML, which is ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. NPI and AI are a clear focus for Equifax, which will drive innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities as well as drive EFX top line growth and margins. Before I turn it over to John, I want to spend a few minutes on our progress on two of our critical EFX2026 strategic priorities that support our long-term growth framework of 8% to 12% top line growth and 50 basis points of annual margin expansion. Completing the cloud and inhibiting from building and leveraging our cloud capabilities is a big 2024 priority, which is fundamental to accelerating NPI and execution of AI and more broadly analytics as well as substantially strengthening system response time and resilience of our technology for our customers. Completing the cloud also frees up our team to fully focus on growth and expanding innovation, new products and new markets. Our progress towards completing the cloud is gaining momentum with over 70% of our total revenue in the new Equifax Cloud at the end of the quarter. And we're focused on executing the remaining steps to reach 90% with Equifax revenue in the cloud by year-end. USIS expects to complete their consumer credit, mortgage and telco and utilities exchange customer migrations to the new Equifax Cloud data fabric principally in the third quarter, which will allow them to decommission legacy systems in the second half of this year as planned. Customer feedback from the thousands of customers that we migrated to Equifax Cloud year-to-date has been very positive. Canada is progressing as planned to complete their consumer credit exchange migrations to the data fabric in late second quarter of this year with their data center decommissioning planned for the third quarter. Europe continues to make significant progress with the goal of completing Spain's consumer exchange migration to data fabric and the decommissioning of their legacy systems in the third quarter. And UK is on schedule to complete cloud migrations, decommissionings of their technology and data centers in the first half of 2025. In Latin America, we completed the Argentina and Chile cloud migrations and expect to make substantial progress on the remaining Latin American countries throughout the rest of 2024. And lastly, as planned, we expect Australia to make big progress this year towards completing their consumer credit exchange migrations to the Equifax Cloud in 2025. Second, driving AI innovation is an important EFX2026 strategic priority that leverages our cloud-based data fabric and application architecture and global Ignite analytical and Interconnect decisioning platforms. We're making great progress in embedding these EFX.AI capabilities across our global footprint. Ignite and Interconnect are now broadly available worldwide. And during 2024, we're deploying both Equifax proprietary explainable AI along with Google Vertex AI across Ignite, Interconnect and our global transaction systems. For Equifax, Vertex AI enables faster and more predictive model development on our Ignite platform. And for our clients, Ignite, which combines data analytics and technology into one cloud-based ecosystem, customers can connect their data with our unique data through our identity resolution process to gain a single holistic view of consumers. We now have 100 \u2013 access to 100% of the U.S. population through our data sets in our single data fabric. This is expanding the global population of its consumers for our customer cases by over 20%. And we're driving faster data ingestion and analytics with greater than five times the processing power of our legacy applications tied into our clients' existing campaign, account management and business platforms. Completing the cloud and expanding EFX.AI, along with continued expansion of our differentiated data sets will accelerate innovation and new products at Equifax will drive both our top and bottom line. In the first quarter, we're also off to a good start on our broader operational cloud restructuring plan across Equifax, reflecting cost reductions from the closure of North American data centers and other broader spending controls against our $300 million goals. These actions are improving operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. We're entering the next chapter of new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud towards leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and to provide our second quarter framework. Our second quarter guidance builds on our strong first quarter performance from new products, record growth and pricing. John? Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 9% constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth, which was well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, a big priority for 2024 is to complete our North America cloud transformation as well as significant portions in our global markets, which will result in continued market expansion and reductions in our capital intensity as the key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. As we complete the cloud, we expect CapEx to increase in 2024 by over $100 million to about $475 million or under 8.5% of revenue with further reductions in 2025 allowing us to move towards our long-term CapEx goal of 7% of revenue as we exit next year. And exiting 2024 with 90% of Equifax revenue into new Equifax Cloud is a big milestone, so the team can move fully towards focusing on growth. Aligned with completing the cloud transformation is our strategic priority to drive innovation through our investments in EFX.AI. AI, ML are changing the way we develop new products in our single data fabric, build higher performing models, scores and products allow us to inject and cleanse more data and operate our consumer care centers more efficiently. We are on offense with EFX.AI. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud differentiated data sets in our single data fabric leveraging EFX.AI and ML and market leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50 basis points of annual margin expansion annually. I'm energized by our strong performance in the first quarter and momentum as we begin 2024, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. Yes. Manav, good morning. I think we have good visibility. We typically do, as you know, but there's still a lot of uncertainty. As you know, you go back using your comment on mortgage, 60 days ago, I think a lot of us were looking forward, as well as most of the experts that we have multiple rate cuts in 2024 as recently as two weeks ago, there were still people thinking there was going to be a June cut. And I think, as you know, that's kind of pushed out. Rates went up three weeks ago, two weeks ago, mortgage rates went up 20 basis points to 7%. So while there's a lot of visibility, there's still a lot of uncertainty around, I would call it, principally the mortgage market. And given we're in the first quarter, we thought it was prudent to be balanced in the framework we put forward. As you know, we beat in the first quarter. We had some things to manage in ER spend, EWS like the ERC decline or the WOTC deferral because of the change in forms. And there's always things we're managing as a company. But we thought it was prudent to be balanced given where we are in the quarter and kind of the macro of mortgage, outside of mortgage, we're pretty comfortable with the economy. And we held the year and we'll take another look at it as we go through second quarter. Yes. So we've had very strong mortgage outperformance at EWS over the last couple of years, records are a big driver of that. Obviously, we take price up every year, which we did in 2024. We've also had in the last couple of years what I would call outperformance in EWS mortgage from some of the new product introductions, principally Mortgage 36. So that's kind of the delta from 2024 outperformance, call it in the high teens to 20, down to the double-digit or low single digits. So we were kind of focused on that. As we look forward to the balance of the year, you heard us talk about the record additions which are going to benefit all of the EWS verticals, including mortgage, including the larger payroll processor that we signed. It's going to come online, kind of mid-year, that's going to add 6 million records. So those higher hit rates will benefit all of the EWS businesses in the second half as we continue to grow twin records, and also will benefit mortgage. Yes. So mortgage, I think you get \u2013 mortgage, obviously this year, we're still expecting mortgage to be down. But like, if rates stay where they are, we would expect in 2025, mortgage market to be fairly flat, in 2025 until rates come down. And I think John outlined again, what we believe that whether it's 2025, 2026 or 2027, as rates get down to what I would call a more normal level, as you know, we're at a 20-plus year high right now. Over that longer timeframe, there's a big tailwind in mortgage. For the rest of our businesses, we haven't really been impacted by rates. There's a little bit of impact in auto, those higher rates are pressuring some of the payments, if you will, for that lower end consumer and subprime and near prime. But broadly, we're performing well, where rates are from a non-mortgage standpoint, and we would expect that to continue. So when we think about kind of the long-term of Equifax, we're still committed and confident in our 8% to 12% kind of long-term framework for the company, including a point or two of M&A in that long-term framework, and that's \u2013 it's kind of current rates. And then we've got the benefit is rates come down to some level where they're going to come down to four or three and a half or whatever over the long-term. I don't think any of us expect them to go back to where they were kind of during the COVID pandemic. But as they come down, we're going to have \u2013 we believe a real tailwind as the mortgage market recovers from its levels of 50% below what we would characterize as normal. Yes. I wouldn't say, it's all dependent on hiring volumes. Obviously, hiring volumes have had an impact on us. We've been able to navigate through the hiring volumes, which are still quite low. Most companies are keeping a tight belt, as they think about where the economy is going. As far as hiring on the white collar side, obviously blue collar is super strong. There's, I don't know what is 9 million plus open jobs right now, but it's still a very vibrant economy from the hiring side. As far as that talent, we just see a big TAM there with lots of opportunity to grow. We have strong relationships with all the top players, including the two you mentioned, and we expect to continue those relationships. We've got a very aggressive pipeline of new product additions that we're continuing to roll out in the talent space. There's a lot of white space for us to penetrate, meaning background screeners that are still using manual, if you will, employment verifications. So that's an opportunity for us. So we remain very optimistic around the future for the talent vertical. And as you point out, when hiring, I would call it in the white collar side stabilizes or perhaps when rates come down and there's some increase in economic activity, we'll get some tailwind from the market side as people are expanding their businesses, and then we'll have things under our control to continue to adding records. The additional records result in higher hit rates there. The 4 million records we added in the quarter are 4 million jobs, that are now going to be able to be monetized in the hit rates we're delivering at talent. I talked about new products, and of course, we took some price up in January and we'll do that again in 2025. So we're optimistic about talent. We're super optimistic about government. As you know, with the 35% performance in the quarter, which is we see a lot of opportunities there, too. It's a little bit of all of the above, but it's really the mortgage market now at the low levels of activity, down 50% from where it was. There is some changes that happen on how much volume specific customers are completing in a quarter or a month. And we see shifts in that that are, I would call it more pronounced when the numbers are smaller. If you have one mortgage originator that perhaps is being more aggressive at one point in time or when the originations, they want to do their marketing, they're spending. As you know, a lot of this is \u2013 most of it's done digitally. So there's ebbs and flows on, particularly in this market from what we've seen, ebbs and flows of kind of the activity that a mortgage originator will put into it. I don't know John, what else would you add? Yes. I think I'd start with the comments I had earlier. I don't know if you heard my response to Manav question. The first quarter, we still \u2013 a lot of \u2013 we have a lot of visibility in lots of parts of the business. I think the mortgage side is less visible as was pointed out. 60 days ago, all of us thought there'd be \u2013 at least the world thought there would be a bunch of rate cuts in the second half, including one in June. Two weeks ago, the June 1 felt like it disappeared. So, given it's the first quarter, we were very pleased with what we saw as revenue being kind of the midpoint of our guidance, which is very strong and then EPS outperformance. We thought it was prudent to hold the year and give you a good outlook of what we think second quarter is. And as I said, we'll look at it again as we get through second quarter and have, what I would characterize is more visibility. I think any of us expected inflation to, so called spike up a little bit in the last couple of months, when we set that guide earlier in the year. But we're confident in delivering the full year guidance that we laid out and we'll give you an update as we get through second quarter, we'll have more visibility at that time. Yes. We attribute when we talk to our customers, which are background screeners, that kind of softer January, February, just as kind of a very tight operating environment that most companies are operating on. Again, we over skew to white collar workers versus blue collar. Blue collar is still, I would call it red hot, meaning there's more jobs open than people looking for them. That's not the issue. Most companies are really watching the economy and we saw that in January, February. We did see an uptick in March and we try to operate off current trends we see and that's still continuing in April and we expect that to kind of stay at that level. But I wouldn't call it like a big recovery, just back closer to what we thought the year was going to be as we exited 2023. Yes, certainly in our guidance, obviously, we haven't given guidance for 2025 yet. We'll do that as we get through this year, we expect those cloud completions this year to benefit 2024. That's built into our margin expansion assumptions in 2024. And then there'll be some carryover of the second half decommissioning that we have as we complete, like the USIS cloud transformations in the kind of middle of the year and some of the international cloud transformations, same kind of timeframe, those start layering in on kind of a monthly basis as we go through this year. And those will provide some benefits as we go into 2025. So I think we've given and we're happy to share some more around the margin side. The top line side is one, there's multiple layers of how the cloud is going to benefit us from a top line standpoint. We're going to be a differentiated partner to our customers with the always on stability from the cloud. You've already seen the uplift in new product innovation coming from our differentiated data in the cloud. So that's going to continue. And businesses like USIS that have been constructed by their cloud migration efforts over the last year and change as they complete the cloud, we would expect that to accelerate their new product rollouts going forward. So we have a lot of optimism of what it's going to do from a competitive standpoint as we complete the cloud. And as I said in my prepared comments earlier, the other big benefit is the ability for the team as we get towards the second half of the year and into 2025 to fully focus on just growing the business. Over the last almost four plus years, we've been growing the business, operating the business, and doing this cloud transformation. It's a heavy, heavy lift. Getting that completed is a big, big milestone for the company. So we can really take advantage of all of our differentiated data in the cloud. Our increased focus on AI and ML, that's going to benefit us as we go into the second half and into 2025 and beyond. Yes. The pricing pass through is a very, very big piece of the mortgage outperformance. We haven't broken down to two, but the new solution, the pre-qual that's used in the shopping stage, is a meaningful piece and we're very pleased to have that on top of the price action, you should expect us to continue to bring new solutions to market, and this is an example of that as we go forward and as we look forward to 2025 and 2026 and beyond, we'll continue to focus on new solutions from our standpoint. And I think all of us will have to see what that pricing looks like as we get into 2025 from our FICO partner there and what they decide to do next year, as well as beyond 2025. Yes, we sell our credit reports to a number of companies that provide credit monitoring to consumers in the U.S. We have our own business, and including the sell to [ph] Experian and TU to lots of others that provide credit monitoring. And we've seen some softness, particularly with the other two credit bureaus in the first quarter and actually late in the year. That's really what we referred to. And I don't know enough about what's driving that, whether they're cutting back on marketing or it's just a more competitive market. But that was an element that we just sold less credit reports that are passed through in credit monitoring solutions. Yes. So I think that the number you're quoting for government we talked about back in February, and what we're seeing is government is outperforming that. So we feel very good about our government revenue very strong in the first quarter. Yes, redeterminations are technically completed by the end of March. So yes, that revenue should decline, but we're seeing really good performance across government strength in CMS, strength in other areas, strength within the states. Really good progress as we continue to do, to expand staff both through FDA and then also directly with the states. So we feel good about our ability to continue to grow government at a stronger pace than we had previously expected in talent. But we're indicating that we expected to get back to growth, right. I mean, we saw some weakness in January and February, nice recovery in March. We're expecting that to continue. We're going to get back to growth as we go through the year. And as I just mentioned, we do feel relatively good about what we're seeing overall in our non-mortgage financing structure, so that we feel relatively good there as well. So overall, non-mortgage and verification services looks like it's performing very, very nicely. And again, just like with mortgage, as we move through the year, the substantial growth in records, the tremendous growth that we're seeing in adding new payroll processors now large and small, is going to add to the strength in all three of those areas that I just talked about. Right. Government directly, talent also, because it not only adds hit rates, it also deepens the historical file that we're able to deliver to our customers. So it makes our product even more valuable. And then obviously also in non-mortgage financing. Sure. I think the latest on that, this pushed out to late this year or early next year. It's still in a comment period. There's a lot of inputs coming in that don't support the 3B to 2B, from what we understand is including congressional inputs on that. There's also, what's on the table is to add a VantageScore in addition to the FICO score with regards to our view of timing, we don't expect anything to happen in 2024. And that's not in our guidance; it's not in our framework. And everything we see and hear that's going to be in 2025, if at all. Yes. So if you look at originations during that time period. Right. Because obviously that in historical periods that details available, it was like average $7.5 million a year. And it was something like, something under 60% would have been purchase and something over 40% on average would have been refi. That was kind of the mix that you saw during that period, on average. Yes. The place we've seen that is really in mortgage. I suspect there's some level in auto, but it's probably harder to see. And as you know, the phenomenon that changed if you go back five years ago, is just digital consumers. Five years ago, there was more face-to-face activity around a lot of big ticket transactions like a mortgage, and now it's virtually all digital. So it's easy for a consumer to shop around. So we have seen the increase in the shopping behavior as we went into COVID. That still continued. We believe that that's just an element that will continue going forward that consumers have the ability to easily look at alternatives kind of digitally. And I think that's going to be an underlying element of the mortgage market going forward, which maybe to your question, if you look back to 2015 to 2019 [ph], there were some elements of shopping in there, but it's clearly increased. We don't think it's going to decrease as rates go down in a meaningful way. And rates aren't going down to where they were before, right? During the COVID time frame, it's hard to imagine that rates are going to go that low. So let's say rates go from seven towards six then towards five and maybe they end up at four or something, that's still a significantly higher rate from what people perhaps were used to during the COVID time frame when rates were so low, there will be an element of shopping going forward. Yes. I would say that was de minimis. The change \u2013 the way we think about it on a sequential basis, again, we \u2013 our customers are still kind of operating what I would call normally. So there's that \u2013 like they're not pulling back because they're worried about the economy or the consumer. And that's where you would see marketing or prescreens or digital marketing to consumers around financial products, which is where most of our businesses cut back. We just haven't seen it. We don't think so. And we haven't seen it. There has been \u2013 there's various alternatives that can be used in a mortgage process. They generally have more friction, and they typically have less data. And the mortgage originators are \u2013 work hard to make sure that they're getting the full picture of the consumer. And then the other element is the instant nature of our data. So we haven't seen a change there, and we don't expect one going forward. We saw a very wide utilization of our TWN income and employment data in the mortgage vertical, and we expect that to continue. And then as we add records, we're already getting the inquiries from our customers, we're going to have higher hit rates as we continue to grow our records. Yes. We've never talked about the term of any of our contracts with our partners. Those are confidential for obvious reasons. We have said, and it's the way they're structured, they're generally structured with auto renewals and they auto renew. And those are happening as we speak. There's none that are like \u2013 there's not like a cliff of these coming. If you remember our dialogues over the last one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, we're adding partnerships every quarter. As you add those, those have a term to them, but they're on auto renewal, and we deliver so much value to that partner. And the \u2013 not only from the integration, which is very complex. It's not a simple integration. As you heard earlier, we signed a large partner in the quarter that's going to add those 6 million records, it's going to take us two, three, four months of very intense technology and data work in order to bring those records into our environment so then they can be normalized to be delivered in our TWN report. So there's a lot of work that goes into that integration that makes our relationships quite sticky. And then, of course, from a monetization standpoint, as we keep growing our business, our partners' monetization grows every quarter. So there's a very strong relationship there. And as you may know, beyond just income employment with partners like payroll processors, we're increasingly doing our other services like I-9 unemployment claims and WOTC in partnership with those kind of companies. So we have multiple relationships. So maybe said differently, we've got a lot of confidence in the long-term nature of our partnerships around TWN records. Yes, you got it, Jeff. That's the Mortgage 36. We've got for the second half some other innovation coming out of mortgage in EWS that we would hope will benefit the second half or certainly in 2025. So we're always focusing on kind of new solutions that will add value. But Mortgage 36 was just a very powerful solution. And as you point out, we are lapping past that. Yes. So just as a reminder for everybody that's still on the call, half of our records come from individual relationships through our employer vertical where we have delivered those regulatory services like UC I-9 unemployment, et cetera. So we or you, I say you tend to talk about our partner records, but a reminder that half of our records are individual relationships. And we're growing those every month as we grow our employer business. And as you point out, we've got partnerships. And we tend to talk or you tend to talk about payroll processors, but they're HR software companies. Software platforms is another way for us to partner. We've got a number of relationships there and a pipeline of additional relationships. We have pension administrators is another one, which is like a payroll processor but for the pension space. As you know, we're chasing that 20 million to 30 million of defined benefit pensioners is a big pool of data assets that we have. And those are all multiyear in nature, and we have strong relationships with all of those partners that we have. Yeah. And thanks for bringing up government. It's the first time we've gotten a question on that this morning. And as you know, that business is really performing exceptionally well. And as we talked about in the quarter it's actually now our largest vertical inside of Workforce Solutions for the first quarter in Workforce Solutions history. So it's a very powerful business for us in that $5 billion TAM. We exited the year at roughly a $600 million annual run rate in that business, which obviously is well north of, slightly north of 10% of overall Equifax. So it's a vertical we like with lots of growth opportunities. There are \u2013 there's multiple levers I think John and I both talked about in our prepared comments in government. Redeterminations are a piece of that. I wouldn't think about that as like disproportionate from the other levers that we have inside of government. You may remember back in September we signed a big extension with CMS that was over a billion dollars that had a price increase in it. So that's rolling through. That's a five-year contract. You can make your own assumptions on the impact that had in the fourth quarter. And again, the first quarter is that price increase goes into effect and that has annual escalators post when we lap it in September of 2024. We signed a brand new contract in September with USDA for SNAP TANF benefits that's $190 million contract over five years. So that's rolling into the P&L and positive in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And then we've also tried to be pretty deliberate about sharing that the state penetration is also a very strong lever for growth. And we should probably think about how we can better articulate that for you. But as you probably know we have a lot of penetration opportunity primarily at the states. Government social services are delivered at the state level and we've put more and more resources at the state capitals to really drive usage of our solutions. And as a reminder a state is not an entity. Each agency within a state is really the entity that we work with, whether it's food stamps, rent support, child care support, healthcare benefits all the different social services or kind of different organizations and all types of states. So that's had a big positive for us. So it may be a bit long winded, but it's multifaceted. All of those levers and then price, right. Prices inherent in our contracts, we don't do one, one price increases in our government contracts. Those are all built in as multi-year contracts with escalators in them. But we have a lot of visibility as we enter the year when those price actions are going to lay into our P&L as we roll through the year. Strong growth in the second quarter, right, so we're going to continue with strong growth in the second quarter despite the fact that the redetermination after the pause is over. Again, as a reminder, redeterminations happen continuously. It's a requirement of government programs that you redetermine that the participants are still eligible. The difference was they were on pause during the health emergency. Yes. So first off, you hit all the right points and it's not new. It's been happening as we speak, and it's been happening over the last five plus years as more and more consumers are shopping for mortgages online. It's actually very rare that they go into a mortgage broker's office now. So that's been a huge change, and as you point out, the fact that they're not seeing the consumer results in the value of instant as well as digital data being more valuable. And then the second half of that is every vertical we'll focus on mortgage, but autos the same case cards, et cetera. They want to shorten the time between, call it inquiry or application or shopping through the closing. And mortgage is very precarious for a mortgage originator, because they're spending $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 of COGS on that closed loan. And the reason they need instant and accurate data is they need to make sure that they want to continue to invest in that application over what could be a 60, 90 day timeframe and a lot can change for the consumer around their credit. They could take on more credit and then no longer qualify for the loan. It can change about their employment. They could lose their job; change their job, et cetera. So that's why instant data is very valuable. So digitization and focus on shortening the time to complete a process plays to Equifax when we have instant data. In the case of mortgage on income and employment, and background screening for employment history in government, social services around income, those all play to us. And there's also an element of productivity, because if they're not using our solution, in the case of mortgage there's still a large number of mortgage originators that do all of their verifications manually. There's a lot of labor involved in that. As labor costs go up, you have the double benefit of both speed, actually triple speed, accuracy and productivity. So those macros play to us in mortgage and more broadly across Equifax. So records is certainly one that is important. We were pleased with our record additions. As you know, we added four partnerships in the fourth quarter. We added a bunch last year, but those four coming on in the first half of the year, and then landing this largest payroll processor with 6 million records, that's a lot of records to add. When you think about [indiscernible] million individuals that is a real positive to have that. And now we have visibility of where we expect that to come on. And as you know, the power in our business model is that when we add a new record or these 6 million records, we monetize them the next day because we're already getting inquiries from our customers for them. So that clearly records in the second half is a positive and ERC is kind of what it's going to be. The WOTC piece is a little \u2013 is a kind of a timing impact. As the government forms didn't get fully implemented in the first quarter. That's going to be a benefit from that small backlog as we go through the second half. What else would you add, John? Toni, I shared this earlier, but you think about the 126 million individuals we have today in our data set for twin. There's 225 million out there, so we got 100 million to go, so there's a long runway for record growth and as John pointed out, we have a very active pipeline for second quarter, for third quarter, for fourth quarter. There's still a lot of momentum and enthusiasm for those that are not monetizing the records with equal crack to do so. Yes. So what we quote, right. Is our inquiry. So we quote actual inquiry data on the credit bureau. Right. And as a reminder, mortgage transactions require tri-bureau pole. So we and our peers see every transaction. Right. We know there's third parties that estimate originations. They don't know what they are. They're doing surveys and estimating a number, and we don't use that number or try to explain the difference between inquiries, which are actuals as of the day that we give them and what you're seeing from third party groups that are doing estimations. So when we're talking about mortgage inquiries in the first quarter and our estimation of mortgage inquiries for the year, it's based on actuals and what we can see transacting. Maybe a couple of things, is this the data I think you're looking at and we look at too, we found historically to be too optimistic. Mortgage originations we don't see and the industry don't see except on a six month lag. Right. That's how it's reported. It doesn't show up. And what you're looking at is surveys. These are surveys where MBA and others will go out to some of the participants and say, what do you think mortgage originations are going to be? And some of those were done probably back in February or March when the expectation was of Fed rate cuts, maybe in second quarter, which obviously doesn't feel like that's how the Fed's signaling today. So there's a lot of change in that. When we look back historically at actual originations, which again are on a six month lag compared to our inquiry activity, there's a strong alignment with it, so we don't see it differing. And what we've done for a decade is use our mortgage inquiries as a proxy for the market because that's what we see. And then trying to share with you how we're doing versus the market, which is our mortgage outperformance typically. And what it has been. Not typically, but it has been meaning how far do we grow above the market from price product in the case of EWS records or penetration into either USIS or TWN customers. Yes. Two different questions. The first one on so-called price sensitivity and I would say universally, nobody likes price, nobody likes a price increase. So from a sensitivity standpoint, there's always challenges in any of our verticals when we go out to take price up. But our customers understand the value of our data and the uniqueness of our data. So those are conversations that we work through, and we work hard to try to be balanced around what we do on price. And as you know, price is only one lever that we use at Equifax. Product is a big part of how we go to market. And product for us, you got to think about, is really bringing more ROI or value to our customer's penetration into our verticals. We have big white space and lots of verticals, particularly in Workforce Solutions, where we're converting from manual to our instant solution. And then, of course, price. Competition maybe is a different question, you know, we think we have a very strong market position. We don't feel an impact, from the one or two participants that have much smaller businesses, in income and employment. Frankly, we think about our biggest competitor in EWS and income and employment is manual verifications. That's really the white space. And when you see the TAM, we had a TAM chart for government this quarter, and then we had a TAM for the whole business in last quarter's deck. That white space between our revenue and the TAM is all manual verifications. And our focus is on delivering our digital solution and driving penetration in there. That's a very hard question to answer. The second half in particular, first half I don't have at my fingertips. We have that. And you can reach out to Trevor or Sam, and they can help us. I think there's public data out there on that. You know, it's very available on the number of mortgages below 5%. When we think about a mortgage recovery, we think about it being multifaceted and actually mostly driven by purchase. The purchase activity has come down dramatically as what I would call as normal refis. And as you know, there's two types of refis that happen. There's rate refis when the rate decrease, which I think is your 5% point. But there's going to be some level of consumers when rates go down to 5% to 4%, whatever the rates go to, of rate refis. There's also a large number of cash out refis. There's something like $29 trillion or almost $30 trillion of untapped equity in consumers' homes. And there's typically a fairly steady amount of cash out refis that happened. Those have been pulled back. There's still some happening, but they've been pulled back meaningfully from what we would characterize as normal because of the rapid increase in rates. And then purchase is a very big part of the mortgage business, and that's the one that's been curtailed more. There's just not a lot of housing stocks for sale. Consumers are not putting, although it's starting to pick up, but consumers are holding off upgrading from that two bedroom condo to the three bedroom house, or going from a rental property into an owned home. We would expect as rates stabilize, which they really have in the last, outside of the increase of 20 bps in the last couple of weeks, that they've kind of stabilized at this higher level. But the combination of stabilization and then some level of reduction as the Fed takes rates down is, we think will be the stimulus for, activity moving forward over the medium term, pick your, you can call it long or medium term, but meaning 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 we would expect inflation to get under control. We would expect the Fed to take rates down, likely not to where they were during the COVID timeframe, but back down to more historic normal levels in order to boost economic activity. And we think that's going to be a stimulus to start driving our mortgage revenue into that $1.1 billion of opportunity as we return to 2015 to 2019 levels."
