AMETEK concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering record operating results despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our businesses saw solid sequential sales and order improvements in the quarter, while year-over-year growth turned positive across several of our businesses. We also drove exceptional operating performance in the quarter, leveraging our broad set of operational excellence initiatives. These efforts led to record backlog, margins, and cash flow as well as a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations, positioning us extremely well as we look ahead to 2021.  The safety of our employees remains our number one priority. We continue to adjust our practices and enforce our safety protocols across our businesses to help limit the possible spread of the virus. While we are cautious in the short-term, given COVID-19 and ongoing travel restrictions, we are highly confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to deliver exceptional growth and shareholder returns over the long-term. The AMETEK growth model continues to provide the framework for long-term sustainable success, and our performance in 2020 was a testament to the strength and flexibility of the model.  Now, let me return to our results for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 8% with a divestiture of Reading Alloys of 3 point [ph], the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing one point to growth, and foreign currency added two points. As we saw in prior quarters, our commercial aerospace business was the most impacted by the pandemic with sales down approximately 35% in the quarter. Order is continuing to improve with our book to bill at 1.07 for the fourth quarter. This led to a record backlog of $1.8 billion, providing us with a positive line of sight into 2021.  Operating income in the fourth quarter was $298.1 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were a record 24.9%, up an impressive 210 basis points compared to the prior year period. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was a record $360.7 million and EBITDA margins were also a record of 30.1%, up a robust 300 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2019. This operating performance led to earnings per diluted share of $1.08 matching last year\u2019s fourth quarter results and comfortably ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Our business has also delivered outstanding cash flow during the quarter, with operating cash flow up 13% to a record $386 million and free cash flow conversion exceptional 158% of net income. Now, let me provide additional detail of the operating group level for the fourth quarter. The Electronic Instruments Group delivers superb operating performance despite challenging market conditions. EIG sales in the fourth quarter were $819.4 million, down 7% from the prior year and in line with our expectations of solid sequential improvement. Organic sales were down 10% while the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing 2% and foreign currency contributing 1%. Commercial aerospace remained the largest driver of the sales weakness, our other EIG businesses saw improvements versus prior quarters. Our materials analysis division returned to growth in the fourth quarter while other EIG businesses, including Zygo and Telular are also again getting year-over-year growth. Despite the overall sales decline, EIG\u2019s operating income in the fourth quarter increased 3% over the prior year to a record $236 million and operating margin has reached a new high of 28.8% expanding an exceptional 270 basis points over the same period in 2019.  Our Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating results in the quarter. EMG sales were $379.5 million down 11% from the fourth quarter in 2019, driven in large part by the divestiture of Reading Alloys. Organic sales were down 4% with a divestiture and eight point headwind and foreign currency adding two points. In addition to continued strong growth across our defense businesses, we were pleased to see our automation business generate solid organic growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter operating income for EMG was $79.8 million and operating margin expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 21%.  Now for the full year results. Despite very difficult end market conditions and meaningful top-line headwinds in 2020 AMETEK was able to expand full year operating margins while delivering record levels of operating and free cash flow, truly outstanding performance. Overall sales for the year were $4.5 billion down 12% from 2019. Organic sales declined 13% with acquisitions adding 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3% headwind, and foreign currency flat for the year. Operating income in 2020 was a $1.1 billion and operating margins were a record 23.6% expanding 80 basis points over 2019. EBITDA for the year was $1.32 billion and EBITDA margins were a record 29.2% up 230 basis points from last year. This led to full year earnings of $3.95 per diluted share down 6% versus the prior year. As bill will highlight our businesses did a fantastic job managing our working capital, which helped drive a record level of cash flow while full year operating cash flow up 15% to $1.28 billion.  In summary, while 2020 was very challenging, I'm extremely proud of the way AMETEK colleagues managed through the pandemic and delivered tremendous results. Before I cover the outlook for 2021, I wanted to highlight certain key elements of the AMETEK growth model and how each position us for long-term success. First and foremost, AMETEK\u2019s proven operational acumens stood out in 2020 with our businesses doing an incredible job, driving our operational excellence initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we generated 60 million in total cost savings with 50 million in structural savings and 10 million in temporary savings. And for the full year total incremental savings versus the prior year were $235 million with approximately $145 million of structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings, including furloughs, travel reductions, and temporary pay actions. As we look ahead to 2021, we expect a much more modest level of temporary savings versus 2020 as the economy continues to recover from the worst of the pandemic and we continue to add back these temporary costs. However, we do expect to drive meaningful, incremental structural savings across our various operational excellence initiatives, including across our global sourcing activities. For the full year 2021, we expect approximately $140 million of incremental operational excellence savings.  Shifting to new product development. Even through this downturn we remain committed to investing in new products and solutions that help our customers solve their most complex challenges. In 2020, we invested $246 million in research, development, and engineering, approximately 5.5% of sales. These investments led to outstanding innovation and dozens of new product launches. In the fourth quarter our Vitality Index or the percent of sales generated from products introduced over the last three years was an impressive 25%. In 2021, we expect to invest approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales in research development and engineering to enhance our position as a global technology leader. This is a 10% increase over 2020 RD&E [ph] spend. Finally, I want to touch on our acquisition strategy. Prior to the onset of the pandemic last year, we acquired IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission critical defense and industrial applications. IntelliPower has integrated nicely into our power systems and instruments division and is performing well. While deal flow in 2020 was impacted by the pandemic, we were seeing continued improvements in the M&A markets and are managing a strong pipeline of acquisition targets across a broad set of markets. As Bill will discuss shortly, AMETEK has significant balance sheet capacity and when combined with our robust cash flow generation provides us with meaningful capital to support our acquisition strategy, which remains our number one priority for capital deployment. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. While we remain cautious in the short-term, given the uncertainty and the timing and pace of the recovery, we're confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. We continue to manage our businesses safely and prudently while ensuring continued investments in key growth initiatives. For the year we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single-digits versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.30 up 6% to 9% compared to 2020. For the first quarter, we anticipate continued year-over-year impact from the pandemic with overall sales down low to mid-single-digits and first quarter earnings of $0.97 to a $1.02 per share, flat to down 5% versus the prior year.  In summary, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. I'm confident that we are emerging from this unprecedented economic environment even stronger than we were before. Again, I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and tremendous efforts as we manage the ongoing global crisis. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill. \nWilliam J. Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding finish to 2020 with record operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter. I would also like to thank and recognize all of my AMETEK colleagues for their significant contributions in 2020. The way our teams persevered to the challenges of the past year was truly impressive. With that I will provide additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year, but we'll also provide some additional guidance for 2021.  Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $17.7 million up modestly from the prior year. For the full year G&A was down 11% from 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary cost reductions. And as a percentage of total sales was 1.5% in both years. For 2021 general and administrative expenses were expected to be up approximately 10% due primarily to the return of temporary costs, including compensation. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.1% up from 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The difference in tax rate was due primarily to the finalization of tax returns in each of the years. For 2021, assuming the current tax regime, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.  Our businesses continued to manage their working capital exceptionally well. Operating working capital was an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter, down 330 basis points from the 17.3% reported in the same quarter last year, reflecting the outstanding work by our teams. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2021 are expected to be approximately $110 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $65 million and for the full year was $255 million. In 2021 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, including after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.50 per diluted share.  As Dave highlighted our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $386 million up 13% over last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow was also a record $349 million up 16% over the same period last year, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 158% of net income. Cash flow for the full year also set new record levels. Operating cash flow for 2020 was $1.28 billion up 15% over the prior year and free cash flow was $1.21 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%. Full year free cash flow conversion was 158% of net income adjusted for the Redding Alloys gain.  Total debt at December 31st was $2.41 billion down from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times at year-end. We enter 2021 with approximately $2.6 billion in liquidity to support our growth initiatives. This liquidity, along with our strong balance sheet and no material debt maturities until 2024 enables us to manage the continued effects of the economic downturn, will also deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions.  To conclude our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2021 and beyond remains positive, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model, and our world-class workforce. Kevin. \nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we're now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. \nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi guys, good morning. \nDavid A. Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Just obviously ending the piece on the 2.6 billion of liquidity, as you think of that M&A pipeline today, 2020 and even the beginning of 2021 there has been a lot of noted challenges. Has that caused you to alter sort of what's attractive in your mind and towards the AMETEK portfolio?\nWilliam J. Burke: That's a great question, Allison, and not really. I mean, M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we feel there's going to be substantial opportunity for us. We -- as you mentioned with the liquidity and our cash flow, we have a very strong balance sheet and we're really positioned to use that as a lever to increase our earnings. And we're seeing an uptick in pipeline opportunities. You started to see some of the pent up demand happen in Q4, the market is very hot, we're maintaining our discipline, but we're working on deals of all sizes. We have some larger deals we're working on and we have some AMETEK typical size of the ozone. We even have a couple of small technology acquisitions we're looking at. So, I would say we've never been busier on M&A and we're looking at it the same way. We think deploying our capital on M&A is the best way to get our shareholders return.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Now within that, are there any verticals that have, I guess, increased in importance in your view just given what's happened?\nWilliam J. Burke: Yeah, I think, we have a 42 business units and they all develop an acquisition plan and we're looking at all of those. And, we're certainly seeing properties come available in all areas. We're also looking at some places where we can get a high return on capital. So I'd say that, our bias is toward more technology deals, but not necessarily a vertical market. We're looking at all of them right now. \nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Agree. And then just last, on that temporary cost savings, I know Bill you talked about G&A being up 10%. Should we layer that in more so in the back half, how should we think of that cadence of that coming back?\nWilliam J. Burke: I'd say primarily that the temporary costs with some small exceptions in the first quarter as we continue to see the effects of the pandemic. They're going to be coming back basically I'd say evenly across the year, a little bit lower in the first quarter.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thank you. \nKevin Coleman: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. \nDavid A. Zapico: Good morning Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, nice, strong finish to the year. And would like to hear what the approach was this time to providing guidance, I mean, there's still so much COVID uncertainty in the macro so what was different this time as you frame guidance and maybe give us some insight into how the cadence of the monthly sequential improvement that you saw this year? \nDavid A. Zapico: Sure. And thank you for your comments on the quarter. We sat back and -- near the end of the year and into January, there was situations that occur where you're having to close down your plants for a couple of days, get everyone tested, clean it and people were bringing the virus to work, I'll say. And it created a difficult operating environment. And certainly it made us think through giving guidance for the quarter and for the year. But as we thought through it, and we were executing well, so well that we got confident that we're able to operate and execute with the virus and we have good processes and protocols in place. And we're seeing the -- we're mid cycle and long cycle businesses and we're seeing those demand pick up later in the year we are assuming and that all went into a discussion. We talked about it several times, but we feel comfortable with the guidance that we're giving and we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to execute and we feel the processes and procedures we've developed are allowing us to operate safely. And we also feel we're feeling an uptick and we're looking for the short cycle businesses and markets and seeing them trend up and we're assuming that's going to happen for us a couple of quarters later.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And if we're looking at first quarter guide, and is there any of the usual seasonality in effect. I mean, just with COVID it's uncertain how much is a reaction to coming back the recovery, but is there any of the usual seasonality in effect?\nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah. What happens to us usually in Q1 is that our processed businesses are stronger in Q4 and not as strong in Q1, that's the seasonality. So you have a drop in revenue there. And then on the bottom line in Q1, along with the contribution margin effect of that, you have a lack of Reading and you also have us resetting some compensation G&A type costs. So, you add that all together and our top line guide for Q1 is down low to mid-single-digits. And we gave the earnings range of $0.97 to $1.02. So, that's the way that we got that. And you also asked about the cadence and I didn't answer that in the first part of your question. The cadence throughout the quarter was a pretty typical trend for us. Orders grew sequentially every month with December being the strongest month of the year and in fact strongest month of the quarter -- of 2020. And in terms of sales, we had a similar pattern with growing sequentially. December was strong and also the strongest month of the year. So that was good. And then January, orders in sales, they ended up at a level of support over Q1 in our full year guide and I would characterize them as solid. So continuing the positive trend, when you think about the low to mid-single-digit guide, back in Q2, we had organic growth of about minus 22% and that improved in Q3 where it was minus 14%. And then you see the last quarter Q4 completed was minus 8%. So to go from that minus 8% organic to minus low to mid-single-digit organic, you see a continuing improvement. So we have calendarization seasonality issue, but underlying it is a continuing sequential improvement of the business.\nDeane Dray: Yeah, that really sounds and looks like a V-shape recovery to us. I know there is a lot of hard work in getting that done, I appreciate it. And you also answered my question about January, so I'm all set. Thank you very much.\nDavid A. Zapico: Thank you Deane.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning guys.\nDavid A. Zapico: Hey, Josh.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Dave, just on the incremental margin expectation. I know there's a lot of moving pieces, some of what you touched on and probably chief amongst those is maybe to start the year, organic growth no need to get out ahead of yourself on expectations, but as the year progresses or as growth starts to accelerate, what should we think of is kind of the underlying incremental margin for AMETEK right now, I know that with small numbers on the growth, it kind of gets distorted by other items, but what the real number is as we move forward? \nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, I think that's a great question. And you will recall that we talked about it last quarter, we had about 90 million of temporary costs that we're going to have to fit back in and to the budget model this year. And what it turns out is that we got really strong OPEX cost reductions of 140 million. On top of that we have continued stronger pricing and when you take the organic growth combined with the OPEX structural savings combined with the pricing, we're able to absorb the temporary costs coming back to the P&L and end up with an incremental margin of about 35%. Now, typically AMETEK would have a bit higher incremental margin, but the 35% is a solid number and it includes absorbing all the temporary costs. So we feel comfortable with the margin forecast that we have for 2021. We think core operating margins will be up about 40 basis points. And we believe the incremental margins will be up about 35%. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. And then just on the end markets themselves, obviously a pretty heady cocktail of businesses inside the portfolio. Just given that this has been such an atypical downturn and recovery, anything that you would call out as maybe being ahead of normal kind of recovery trajectory or behind for that matter relative to some of these early mid and late cycle markets that you guys participate in? \nDavid A. Zapico: Not really. I think the military market has been very strong for us. We've talked about that. We think that'll continue into 2021. We are seeing a tick up in the semiconductor market, that's not atypical. A lot of people are seeing that, but we have some technology that's a more tied to the EUV, which is the next technology in semiconductor. So we're seeing some research demands in that area. That business looks solid for us. And in general, everything is behaving as we would think it would and we do have the mid and long cycle businesses and the aerospace business we're not assuming it's going to -- the commercial aerospace business we're not assuming a recovery during, it's flat up a bit, flat low single for 2021. Most of the other markets are up mid-single-digit. \nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Yeah, that's great detail. Thanks Dave. \nDavid A. Zapico: Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Good morning. Wanted to sort of pick up on the FY 2021 sort of [Technical Difficulty] anything by geography that you've called out next year in your plant process, I'd be particularly interested in what your views are on the U.S. and China markets?\nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, good question. Yeah, I'll start with Q4. In Q4 there were really mixed trends across geographies and with Asia returning to strong growth and Europe and U.S. seeing continued sequential improvement, but still showing negative organic growth. And we talk about Asia first, we had a great quarter in Asia. We were up low double-digits, and we had strong growth in both our process and automation businesses. And China in particular grew 22% with us in the quarter. So a really big pickup there in the process and automation. And if we talk about prior quarters, automation picking up, the process business followed, and that had a big impact on EIG margins as you can see in the accounts. When you think about the U.S. we were down low double-digits on broad based weakness, other than the defense market. Defense market was strong and we think about Europe, we were down mid-teens on broad based weakness, other than the automation business. So, in the U.S. and in Europe it was down except for small parts of our portfolio that were bright spots, but in China we really knocked it out of the park. In Asia we did well. What we're thinking, the incremental improvements in 2021 are going to continue in Europe and the U.S. so the sequential improvements that we've been seeing are going to continue. And, we think that Asia or quotation activity Asia is going to maintain strength. So I'm not sure if we're going to go up 22% in China, every quarter, but certainly we're seeing strength in the pipeline in China and [indiscernible].\nNigel Coe: Great, thank you. And, regards to the M&A pipeline, you talked about variety of different sizes in there, how big multiples and multiples right now what was seen in the public multiples is obviously very high, how confident are you, you can still do deals, ROI to make sense to you?\nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, we've been able to do it so far, and we have a very strong pipeline and so I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to keep doing that. I mean, that's a -- there's a lot of yields. The thing that's happened is we're able to drive more synergy than we were a few years or five or 10 years ago. We have a great synergy capability to improve businesses and we're disciplined, returns matter to us, and I'm confident that we're going to be able to deploy the cash on M&A.\nNigel Coe: Right, thanks again. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. \nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning everybody. \nDavid A. Zapico: Good morning Brett. \nBrett Linzey: Hey, I wanted to come back to the structural cost programs. Obviously, you guys have done quite a bit over the last couple of years to, navigate the pandemic, but also integrate acquired businesses. As we think about the programs in 2021, do those continue on a structural basis or do you think you've got the businesses where they need to be from a cost structure standpoint? \nDavid A. Zapico: I think there's still structural programs that we're going to execute in 2021. And it's ongoing because we're combining businesses and we're implementing acquisition synergies. And we've got that 140 million in structural costs and there's 80 million of structural savings, there's 80 million of OPEX savings in that. So remember we have a spillover from 2020, but there's ongoing program. So the way I look at it is we have over 150 operating facilities and we have a strategic plan on OPEX, and we take the advantages to combine and make things more efficient all the time and 2021 will be no different.\nBrett Linzey: Got it, that's great. And just on back to the price cost question, what are you embedding for price via gross price realization for 2021 and how are you thinking about freight, steel, other raw mat inflationary pressures against that? And then any items in terms of supply chain that are a worry point that we should be thinking about or constraining your ability to serve customers? \nDavid A. Zapico: Good question. So, for all of the 2020 we had about 1.5 points of price and total inflation was about 1 point. So at a 50 basis point spread for all of the year but actually in Q4 of 2020, our pricing ticked up a bit. So it was a little higher than 1.5%. So that added to margins and for 2021, we see slightly higher pricing than 1.5%, but we're going to have slightly higher inflation. So you think about it as a 50 basis point spread, a little higher price, a little higher inflation, and we are seeing commodity price inflation. We are seeing transportation costs, but we got them under control. We have very good supply chain people and we've got that factored in and with our highly differentiated portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets, we have those kind of costs we're typically able to pass them on to the customer. And I've been very pleased to see our pricing out of -- to the pandemic. Now in terms of material shortages I mean, there's a little bit of a -- there are issues in the semiconductor market that had been in the press where you see the automotive industry having some issues now and our supply chain people are on top of that and working it. But it hasn\u2019t cost us any missed [indiscernible] or anything like that. So, it is just something to manage and an issue we are working on. \nBrett Linzey: And just one more on prices, is it fair say with the exit of Reading that your volatility on price up and down has dampened somewhat as part of the total portfolio, is that fair?\nDavid A. Zapico: That\u2019s exactly right Brett. You are right on. \nBrett Linzey: Got it, okay. Great, I will pass along. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. \nChristopher Glynn: Hey, thank you. Good morning everybody. \nDavid A. Zapico: Good morning Chris. \nChristopher Glynn: Nice numbers, I think the balance sheet might look the most ample I have ever seen. So, in my understanding haven\u2019t covered you a long time, usually guide kind of base case revenue with some hedge in the implied margin outlook and you went through that with Josh\u2019s question. In this case you are entering 2021 with record backlog and minus 13% organic comp for the full year. I think it sort of suggests mid-single-digit pretty in the bag barring significant macro disruptions. Just want to reconcile the organic comp with the backlog numbers if you could. \nWilliam J. Burke: Yeah, the backlog number is customer is feeling confident and placing orders for the year. It is not just one quarter, the customers are getting their orders in for the first couple of quarters of the year and I think that AMETEK you have covered a long time, we are mid and long cycle businesses so we typically see the uptick couple of quarters later. Our automation business is seeing it now but the long cycle businesses in aero and oil and gas are not seeing an uptick. So the fact that we have a negative organic growth in Q1 and there is four numbers for the year, when you have one number that is negative and you add them up, you are at mid-single-digits. \nChristopher Glynn: Got it, thanks for that. \nDavid A. Zapico: Okay. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt. \nScott Graham: Hey, good morning. Great job on the cost side as usual and supply chain. I wanted to ask maybe a little bit more on the cost add backs. Dave is the plan to add back the entire 90 that you took out and if so how does that go into the segments?\nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, I don\u2019t think we will add back the entire 90 but I will give you an example. We left the temporary cost savings in Q4 were $10 million. So we really ramped on by that point. In Q1 it is significantly lower than that. So, it is -- and we will adjust that as we go through the year but I think that temporary costs are going to become so small as we go throughout the year they are not meaningful anymore. So it is really the structural savings that drive the margin improvement. \nScott Graham: Got is and then maybe Bill one for you, the working capital numbers were like pretty incredible. I was just wondering it\u2019s going to have to go the other way this year, what would you think the working capital percentage increases by in 2021?\nWilliam J. Burke: Well, as you think about it yeah, our businesses did a fantastic job on working capital, taken inventories down, receivables performance was the best I have seen in my 30 years with the company, 30 years plus. So it was fantastic. Will that continue, well I don\u2019t know. We are going to work real hard to make sure it does and our businesses are focused on that. So will there be some give back next year, I expect it to be a little bit but we are very much focused on trying to keep that at the levels we have seen in this fourth quarter and the full year.\nDavid A. Zapico: And the key point for us Scott is, I think we had 158% free cash flow to net income conversion in 2020. And for 2021 we're targeting 110%. So above a 100% even this environment, certainly we're going to have to put some cash back on the balance sheet, but we're operating very efficiently and, we're going to put it back on the balance sheet grudgingly. \nScott Graham: Got it. Thank you. Would you mind if I squeeze in one more? \nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, sure. \nScott Graham: Sure. So, in terms of the liquidity number, I mean, Christopher's comment was like, I haven't seen this level of liquidity in your balance sheet in my time. Is there room in there for some share buybacks if the first half of the year is maybe a little bit slower on M&A than you're hoping because I know how disciplined you are there, is there room for share buybacks in that? \nWilliam J. Burke: Clearly our number one priority is M&A. And I really think we're going to be able to deploy the capital on M&A but, if we can't, we'll find a way to get the cash back to you, either through buybacks or dividends. We have a consistently increasing dividend and we've been opportunistic on share buybacks. But I'm not feeling that way right now. I think there's an incredible acquisition opportunity for us and for physicians at a level and to your point, a liquidity position that we haven't been at before. So it's very exciting to me, and I'm very excited about the pipeline. \nScott Graham: Great, thank you. \nDavid A. Zapico: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, good morning. \nDavid A. Zapico: Hey Rick, we don't hear you. So Andrew, why don't we go to the next question. \nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi guys, good morning. \nDavid A. Zapico: Good morning, Andrew. \nAndrew Obin: Hey, congratulations on another great quarter. \nDavid A. Zapico: Thank you. \nAndrew Obin: Just a question for you on orders, we sort of tried to back into the number from your book to bill, as it were sort of calculated something like down around 8%. I was wondering if we could talk about the auto rates and just maybe give us color by market, I mean, I think it's sort of highlighted, China [ph] highlighted aerospace, but maybe a little bit more color there? \nWilliam J. Burke: Yeah, I'll give you the numbers. Our overall orders were down 8%. But organic we're down 2%. And EIG organic we're down 2% and EMG organic we're down 1%. So what you backed into with the overall orders was correct and we had a good organic month at minus two. \nAndrew Obin: Got you, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Can you just talk about how you guys are thinking about your own CAPEX spending into 2021 and how you have changed in any way, shape or form, how you think about where you will spend CAPEX on, what you spend CAPEX on into aftermath of the pandemic? \nWilliam J. Burke: Yeah, CAPEX is -- we plan on 110 million this year. And opportunities -- we have opportunities that are going to provide excellent returns. For growth CAPEX, efficiency improvements, expanding our footprint in emerging markets, and if you recall in 2020 we talked about at mid-year, we had some expansion projects in emerging markets, and we couldn't get people there. We needed to get some expertise from different regions to the emerging markets, we couldn't travel. So we delayed them. So we spent 74 million in 2020 and our original plan was 102 million. So we ended up spending a little less than 2% in 2020 and 2021 we're going to spend a little over 2%. We're going to make up a bit of those projects, because they're still there. And there's great opportunity in other areas. But we're still longer term 2% of sales is the CAPEX number. And we have a little bit of makeup this year with projects that -- these efficiency projects and growth projects have very high internal rates of returns or rates of returns like 30%, 40%, 50%. So this is the kind of stuff that you want to fund. You want to get done. And we have a whole slew of projects that we're getting after. \nAndrew Obin: And just are you spending anything different on what kind of equipment you're buying, are you spending more on software, are you changing your suppliers? \nWilliam J. Burke: Yeah, I think there's a mix of all that in there and it's bottoms up from the businesses. But yeah, I think definitely software or digital strategy is driving a lot of that. I think the emerging market infrastructure that we're putting in place is driving that. So you are right on in the areas and we just have a particularly large group of projects, and we're going to get those done this year and we got great returns on them. \nAndrew Obin: Fantastic, great to hear. Thank you very much. \nDavid A. Zapico: Thank you Andrew. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning guys. I wanted to talk a little bit more about M&A because I am curious your philosophy is out of this -- out of the pandemic, do you -- out of the other capacity due to some larger size deals. First off, do you see more medium large sized deals as likely? And then secondly, is there sort of philosophy here that to buy stuff that's kind of beaten down, beaten up that you could -- you're buying at a low here, are you going to go after certain assets that whatever is opportunistic at the time, wherever there's a good deal to be had? \nDavid A. Zapico: Right, I think it's both. It's all of the above. And when I think about the -- we expanded our revenue targets, the acquisition we're looking at so you can see deals in that $200 million to $300 million to $400 million range. Those are considered big. So we're not talking about the acquisitions that would be the size of AMETEK or even half the size of AMETEK. We think those bigger deals, it's much harder to create value. So there's smaller deals, but the size growing with the size of the company, we're a bigger company now. So, like I said, there's technology deals we're looking at that augment our organic growth, there's deals in our sweet, sweet spot, very close to our existing positions that will get a very high return on capital one. And there's some bigger deals that fit with us, but are in adjacent markets. And there's multiple deals in each one of those categories. So we are busy, we're prudent and approach. But I'm optimistic that we're going to be able to deploy our capital and add very strong businesses effective. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And can you remind us what was medical as a percentage of sales this year in 2020? And then can you just minus, like what is that, you know, what that area I think it's pretty interesting as a budding platform for you guys, what are you thinking about that going forward? \nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, medical sales 2021, 2020 are in the range of 15% of sales. So that's approximately $700 million. And, we have businesses that are doing very well in that area and their niche positions like all of AMETEK and there's expansion opportunities there. So we're actively looking at healthcare medical space and we'd like to see that be a bigger percentage of the company. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Thank you guys. \nDavid A. Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey guys, good morning. This is Francesco on for Joe. \nDavid A. Zapico: Hello Francesco, good morning. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, can you guys talk a little bit about your expectations on aerospace, do you think this in coming to be bottoming out soon and what are the mix implications going forward? \nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, it's a great question. And the first point is our aerospace business is one of our more profitable businesses. It is definitely greater than the company average. That was before the pandemic and right now. And the team has done an excellent job of realigning the cost structure, lower volume, but still very profitable and more profitable than the average AMETEK business. So we think any change in volume is going to result in high contribution margins because we have so bring down the cost structure. The second point is there's a distinctly different demand pattern that we've been talking about all along. About half of our business in aerospace and defense is in the military space. That business was up mid-teens in the fourth quarter. We think we still see growth in 2021, but it'll be more mid-single-digits. And in the commercial space, that business was down about 35% in the fourth quarter, down about 30% for the entire full year. And for 2021 the commercial aerospace business we're saying is flat up low single-digits. And the commercial aerospace business is impacted by many variables impacting demand, including government support, airline capacity decisions, and overriding all the competence of the flying public and it's very difficult to predict that thing and to predict those things when the pandemic is raging. So we're pretty conservative about how we are looking at that. The management team we have in aerospace is outstanding. And eventually the commercial business is going to come back. I don't think it's going to be 2021. I think it's going to be beyond that and our guidance reflects that. So we're really -- we have really done the hard work and done the right thing in our aerospace business. So we're poised even for small incremental sales growth to deliver good margins and eventually, that long cycle business will pick up and drive the earnings of the company. \nUnidentified Analyst : Great, that's extremely helpful. Thank you very much. \nDavid A. Zapico: Okay. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. \nRichard Eastman: Alright, thank you. Try this\u2026 \nDavid A. Zapico: Try one more time. \nRichard Eastman: Yeah, not sure what happened there. Hey, just a quick thought, Dave, when we talk\u2026 \nDavid A. Zapico: Rick, I think we lost you again. Alright, we got you now.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. Hey, just when we try to reconcile our segment growth to the AMETEK core growth outlook for 2021. So we're kind of 3% to 5%. And my question is, is EIG I presume EMG, with process coming back stronger, does EMG on the high end of maybe a 3% to 5% core 2021 growth rate? \nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, we gave a mid-single-digit range. So for me that says between 4% and 6%, not 3% to 5%. But in that 4% to 6% range, both of the businesses are going to be in that range. And certainly EMG is going to probably start out a little better in the year, but we think the -- when we end the year, they're both going to be plus mid-single-digit growth. \nRichard Eastman: Dave, when I kind of run that math through the numbers here, I look at both segments of the business perhaps being at a revenue rate at the end of 2021 that's below 19 and I guess my thought is there that the longer cycle, mean aerospace would be below and then would oil and gas still be projected to be below 2019 level, are there any other? \nDavid A. Zapico: Yeah, oil and gas is projected to be lower, and oil and gas is going to have -- the way it looks for us a strong 2022 right now. But, if you if you think about where we're at right now in the fourth quarter, the businesses that showed positive organic growth for our defense business in process, some of our research businesses like our materials analysis division, that division was all positive, organic. Our UPG business Zygo was positive organic. The Telular business was positive organic, and our automation business was positive organic. So as we go out through the year, that'll change. But yeah, the fact of the matter is with our mid and long cycle exposure, while the strong second half and for some of our markets, we will not get back to 2019 in 2021. \nRichard Eastman: Yes, fair enough. And when you talk defense, Dave, is that\u2026\nDavid A. Zapico: Rick, I think we lost you and your question there. \nKevin Coleman: Andrew, why don\u2019t we wrap it up. \nDavid A. Zapico: Rick, we hear you now I think. \nRichard Eastman: I don't understand it. Okay, but with defense Dave, when you speak to defense, that's all aerospace defense, is there anything else that you're capturing in that? \nDavid A. Zapico: No, it is aerospace defense but we do have some land based programs within aerospace, but it's all -- business, that's right. \nRichard Eastman: Okay. Thanks again. Thanks for tolerating the problems. Thank you. \nDavid A. Zapico: No problem. \nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks. \nKevin Coleman: Great, thank you, Andrew. And thanks everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast may be accessed in the investor section of ametek.com. Thanks and have a great day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David A. Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you Kevin and good morning, everyone. AMETEK concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering record operating results despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our businesses saw solid sequential sales and order improvements in the quarter, while year-over-year growth turned positive across several of our businesses. We also drove exceptional operating performance in the quarter, leveraging our broad set of operational excellence initiatives. These efforts led to record backlog, margins, and cash flow as well as a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations, positioning us extremely well as we look ahead to 2021.  The safety of our employees remains our number one priority. We continue to adjust our practices and enforce our safety protocols across our businesses to help limit the possible spread of the virus. While we are cautious in the short-term, given COVID-19 and ongoing travel restrictions, we are highly confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to deliver exceptional growth and shareholder returns over the long-term. The AMETEK growth model continues to provide the framework for long-term sustainable success, and our performance in 2020 was a testament to the strength and flexibility of the model.  Now, let me return to our results for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 8% with a divestiture of Reading Alloys of 3 point [ph], the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing one point to growth, and foreign currency added two points. As we saw in prior quarters, our commercial aerospace business was the most impacted by the pandemic with sales down approximately 35% in the quarter. Order is continuing to improve with our book to bill at 1.07 for the fourth quarter. This led to a record backlog of $1.8 billion, providing us with a positive line of sight into 2021.  Operating income in the fourth quarter was $298.1 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were a record 24.9%, up an impressive 210 basis points compared to the prior year period. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was a record $360.7 million and EBITDA margins were also a record of 30.1%, up a robust 300 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2019. This operating performance led to earnings per diluted share of $1.08 matching last year\u2019s fourth quarter results and comfortably ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Our business has also delivered outstanding cash flow during the quarter, with operating cash flow up 13% to a record $386 million and free cash flow conversion exceptional 158% of net income. Now, let me provide additional detail of the operating group level for the fourth quarter. The Electronic Instruments Group delivers superb operating performance despite challenging market conditions. EIG sales in the fourth quarter were $819.4 million, down 7% from the prior year and in line with our expectations of solid sequential improvement. Organic sales were down 10% while the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing 2% and foreign currency contributing 1%. Commercial aerospace remained the largest driver of the sales weakness, our other EIG businesses saw improvements versus prior quarters. Our materials analysis division returned to growth in the fourth quarter while other EIG businesses, including Zygo and Telular are also again getting year-over-year growth. Despite the overall sales decline, EIG\u2019s operating income in the fourth quarter increased 3% over the prior year to a record $236 million and operating margin has reached a new high of 28.8% expanding an exceptional 270 basis points over the same period in 2019.  Our Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating results in the quarter. EMG sales were $379.5 million down 11% from the fourth quarter in 2019, driven in large part by the divestiture of Reading Alloys. Organic sales were down 4% with a divestiture and eight point headwind and foreign currency adding two points. In addition to continued strong growth across our defense businesses, we were pleased to see our automation business generate solid organic growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter operating income for EMG was $79.8 million and operating margin expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 21%.  Now for the full year results. Despite very difficult end market conditions and meaningful top-line headwinds in 2020 AMETEK was able to expand full year operating margins while delivering record levels of operating and free cash flow, truly outstanding performance. Overall sales for the year were $4.5 billion down 12% from 2019. Organic sales declined 13% with acquisitions adding 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3% headwind, and foreign currency flat for the year. Operating income in 2020 was a $1.1 billion and operating margins were a record 23.6% expanding 80 basis points over 2019. EBITDA for the year was $1.32 billion and EBITDA margins were a record 29.2% up 230 basis points from last year. This led to full year earnings of $3.95 per diluted share down 6% versus the prior year. As bill will highlight our businesses did a fantastic job managing our working capital, which helped drive a record level of cash flow while full year operating cash flow up 15% to $1.28 billion.  In summary, while 2020 was very challenging, I'm extremely proud of the way AMETEK colleagues managed through the pandemic and delivered tremendous results. Before I cover the outlook for 2021, I wanted to highlight certain key elements of the AMETEK growth model and how each position us for long-term success. First and foremost, AMETEK\u2019s proven operational acumens stood out in 2020 with our businesses doing an incredible job, driving our operational excellence initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we generated 60 million in total cost savings with 50 million in structural savings and 10 million in temporary savings. And for the full year total incremental savings versus the prior year were $235 million with approximately $145 million of structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings, including furloughs, travel reductions, and temporary pay actions. As we look ahead to 2021, we expect a much more modest level of temporary savings versus 2020 as the economy continues to recover from the worst of the pandemic and we continue to add back these temporary costs. However, we do expect to drive meaningful, incremental structural savings across our various operational excellence initiatives, including across our global sourcing activities. For the full year 2021, we expect approximately $140 million of incremental operational excellence savings.  Shifting to new product development. Even through this downturn we remain committed to investing in new products and solutions that help our customers solve their most complex challenges. In 2020, we invested $246 million in research, development, and engineering, approximately 5.5% of sales. These investments led to outstanding innovation and dozens of new product launches. In the fourth quarter our Vitality Index or the percent of sales generated from products introduced over the last three years was an impressive 25%. In 2021, we expect to invest approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales in research development and engineering to enhance our position as a global technology leader. This is a 10% increase over 2020 RD&E [ph] spend. Finally, I want to touch on our acquisition strategy. Prior to the onset of the pandemic last year, we acquired IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission critical defense and industrial applications. IntelliPower has integrated nicely into our power systems and instruments division and is performing well. While deal flow in 2020 was impacted by the pandemic, we were seeing continued improvements in the M&A markets and are managing a strong pipeline of acquisition targets across a broad set of markets. As Bill will discuss shortly, AMETEK has significant balance sheet capacity and when combined with our robust cash flow generation provides us with meaningful capital to support our acquisition strategy, which remains our number one priority for capital deployment. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. While we remain cautious in the short-term, given the uncertainty and the timing and pace of the recovery, we're confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. We continue to manage our businesses safely and prudently while ensuring continued investments in key growth initiatives. For the year we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single-digits versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.30 up 6% to 9% compared to 2020. For the first quarter, we anticipate continued year-over-year impact from the pandemic with overall sales down low to mid-single-digits and first quarter earnings of $0.97 to a $1.02 per share, flat to down 5% versus the prior year.  In summary, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. I'm confident that we are emerging from this unprecedented economic environment even stronger than we were before. Again, I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and tremendous efforts as we manage the ongoing global crisis. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill. Good morning, Allison. Good morning Deane. Sure. And thank you for your comments on the quarter. We sat back and -- near the end of the year and into January, there was situations that occur where you're having to close down your plants for a couple of days, get everyone tested, clean it and people were bringing the virus to work, I'll say. And it created a difficult operating environment. And certainly it made us think through giving guidance for the quarter and for the year. But as we thought through it, and we were executing well, so well that we got confident that we're able to operate and execute with the virus and we have good processes and protocols in place. And we're seeing the -- we're mid cycle and long cycle businesses and we're seeing those demand pick up later in the year we are assuming and that all went into a discussion. We talked about it several times, but we feel comfortable with the guidance that we're giving and we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to execute and we feel the processes and procedures we've developed are allowing us to operate safely. And we also feel we're feeling an uptick and we're looking for the short cycle businesses and markets and seeing them trend up and we're assuming that's going to happen for us a couple of quarters later. Yeah. What happens to us usually in Q1 is that our processed businesses are stronger in Q4 and not as strong in Q1, that's the seasonality. So you have a drop in revenue there. And then on the bottom line in Q1, along with the contribution margin effect of that, you have a lack of Reading and you also have us resetting some compensation G&A type costs. So, you add that all together and our top line guide for Q1 is down low to mid-single-digits. And we gave the earnings range of $0.97 to $1.02. So, that's the way that we got that. And you also asked about the cadence and I didn't answer that in the first part of your question. The cadence throughout the quarter was a pretty typical trend for us. Orders grew sequentially every month with December being the strongest month of the year and in fact strongest month of the quarter -- of 2020. And in terms of sales, we had a similar pattern with growing sequentially. December was strong and also the strongest month of the year. So that was good. And then January, orders in sales, they ended up at a level of support over Q1 in our full year guide and I would characterize them as solid. So continuing the positive trend, when you think about the low to mid-single-digit guide, back in Q2, we had organic growth of about minus 22% and that improved in Q3 where it was minus 14%. And then you see the last quarter Q4 completed was minus 8%. So to go from that minus 8% organic to minus low to mid-single-digit organic, you see a continuing improvement. So we have calendarization seasonality issue, but underlying it is a continuing sequential improvement of the business. Thank you Deane. Hey, Josh. Yeah, I think that's a great question. And you will recall that we talked about it last quarter, we had about 90 million of temporary costs that we're going to have to fit back in and to the budget model this year. And what it turns out is that we got really strong OPEX cost reductions of 140 million. On top of that we have continued stronger pricing and when you take the organic growth combined with the OPEX structural savings combined with the pricing, we're able to absorb the temporary costs coming back to the P&L and end up with an incremental margin of about 35%. Now, typically AMETEK would have a bit higher incremental margin, but the 35% is a solid number and it includes absorbing all the temporary costs. So we feel comfortable with the margin forecast that we have for 2021. We think core operating margins will be up about 40 basis points. And we believe the incremental margins will be up about 35%. Not really. I think the military market has been very strong for us. We've talked about that. We think that'll continue into 2021. We are seeing a tick up in the semiconductor market, that's not atypical. A lot of people are seeing that, but we have some technology that's a more tied to the EUV, which is the next technology in semiconductor. So we're seeing some research demands in that area. That business looks solid for us. And in general, everything is behaving as we would think it would and we do have the mid and long cycle businesses and the aerospace business we're not assuming it's going to -- the commercial aerospace business we're not assuming a recovery during, it's flat up a bit, flat low single for 2021. Most of the other markets are up mid-single-digit. Sure. Yeah, good question. Yeah, I'll start with Q4. In Q4 there were really mixed trends across geographies and with Asia returning to strong growth and Europe and U.S. seeing continued sequential improvement, but still showing negative organic growth. And we talk about Asia first, we had a great quarter in Asia. We were up low double-digits, and we had strong growth in both our process and automation businesses. And China in particular grew 22% with us in the quarter. So a really big pickup there in the process and automation. And if we talk about prior quarters, automation picking up, the process business followed, and that had a big impact on EIG margins as you can see in the accounts. When you think about the U.S. we were down low double-digits on broad based weakness, other than the defense market. Defense market was strong and we think about Europe, we were down mid-teens on broad based weakness, other than the automation business. So, in the U.S. and in Europe it was down except for small parts of our portfolio that were bright spots, but in China we really knocked it out of the park. In Asia we did well. What we're thinking, the incremental improvements in 2021 are going to continue in Europe and the U.S. so the sequential improvements that we've been seeing are going to continue. And, we think that Asia or quotation activity Asia is going to maintain strength. So I'm not sure if we're going to go up 22% in China, every quarter, but certainly we're seeing strength in the pipeline in China and [indiscernible]. Yeah, we've been able to do it so far, and we have a very strong pipeline and so I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to keep doing that. I mean, that's a -- there's a lot of yields. The thing that's happened is we're able to drive more synergy than we were a few years or five or 10 years ago. We have a great synergy capability to improve businesses and we're disciplined, returns matter to us, and I'm confident that we're going to be able to deploy the cash on M&A. Good morning Brett. I think there's still structural programs that we're going to execute in 2021. And it's ongoing because we're combining businesses and we're implementing acquisition synergies. And we've got that 140 million in structural costs and there's 80 million of structural savings, there's 80 million of OPEX savings in that. So remember we have a spillover from 2020, but there's ongoing program. So the way I look at it is we have over 150 operating facilities and we have a strategic plan on OPEX, and we take the advantages to combine and make things more efficient all the time and 2021 will be no different. Good question. So, for all of the 2020 we had about 1.5 points of price and total inflation was about 1 point. So at a 50 basis point spread for all of the year but actually in Q4 of 2020, our pricing ticked up a bit. So it was a little higher than 1.5%. So that added to margins and for 2021, we see slightly higher pricing than 1.5%, but we're going to have slightly higher inflation. So you think about it as a 50 basis point spread, a little higher price, a little higher inflation, and we are seeing commodity price inflation. We are seeing transportation costs, but we got them under control. We have very good supply chain people and we've got that factored in and with our highly differentiated portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets, we have those kind of costs we're typically able to pass them on to the customer. And I've been very pleased to see our pricing out of -- to the pandemic. Now in terms of material shortages I mean, there's a little bit of a -- there are issues in the semiconductor market that had been in the press where you see the automotive industry having some issues now and our supply chain people are on top of that and working it. But it hasn\u2019t cost us any missed [indiscernible] or anything like that. So, it is just something to manage and an issue we are working on. That\u2019s exactly right Brett. You are right on. Good morning Chris. Okay. Yeah, I don\u2019t think we will add back the entire 90 but I will give you an example. We left the temporary cost savings in Q4 were $10 million. So we really ramped on by that point. In Q1 it is significantly lower than that. So, it is -- and we will adjust that as we go through the year but I think that temporary costs are going to become so small as we go throughout the year they are not meaningful anymore. So it is really the structural savings that drive the margin improvement. And the key point for us Scott is, I think we had 158% free cash flow to net income conversion in 2020. And for 2021 we're targeting 110%. So above a 100% even this environment, certainly we're going to have to put some cash back on the balance sheet, but we're operating very efficiently and, we're going to put it back on the balance sheet grudgingly. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Hey Rick, we don't hear you. So Andrew, why don't we go to the next question. Good morning, Andrew. Thank you. Thank you Andrew. Right, I think it's both. It's all of the above. And when I think about the -- we expanded our revenue targets, the acquisition we're looking at so you can see deals in that $200 million to $300 million to $400 million range. Those are considered big. So we're not talking about the acquisitions that would be the size of AMETEK or even half the size of AMETEK. We think those bigger deals, it's much harder to create value. So there's smaller deals, but the size growing with the size of the company, we're a bigger company now. So, like I said, there's technology deals we're looking at that augment our organic growth, there's deals in our sweet, sweet spot, very close to our existing positions that will get a very high return on capital one. And there's some bigger deals that fit with us, but are in adjacent markets. And there's multiple deals in each one of those categories. So we are busy, we're prudent and approach. But I'm optimistic that we're going to be able to deploy our capital and add very strong businesses effective. Yeah, medical sales 2021, 2020 are in the range of 15% of sales. So that's approximately $700 million. And, we have businesses that are doing very well in that area and their niche positions like all of AMETEK and there's expansion opportunities there. So we're actively looking at healthcare medical space and we'd like to see that be a bigger percentage of the company. Thank you. Hello Francesco, good morning. Yeah, it's a great question. And the first point is our aerospace business is one of our more profitable businesses. It is definitely greater than the company average. That was before the pandemic and right now. And the team has done an excellent job of realigning the cost structure, lower volume, but still very profitable and more profitable than the average AMETEK business. So we think any change in volume is going to result in high contribution margins because we have so bring down the cost structure. The second point is there's a distinctly different demand pattern that we've been talking about all along. About half of our business in aerospace and defense is in the military space. That business was up mid-teens in the fourth quarter. We think we still see growth in 2021, but it'll be more mid-single-digits. And in the commercial space, that business was down about 35% in the fourth quarter, down about 30% for the entire full year. And for 2021 the commercial aerospace business we're saying is flat up low single-digits. And the commercial aerospace business is impacted by many variables impacting demand, including government support, airline capacity decisions, and overriding all the competence of the flying public and it's very difficult to predict that thing and to predict those things when the pandemic is raging. So we're pretty conservative about how we are looking at that. The management team we have in aerospace is outstanding. And eventually the commercial business is going to come back. I don't think it's going to be 2021. I think it's going to be beyond that and our guidance reflects that. So we're really -- we have really done the hard work and done the right thing in our aerospace business. So we're poised even for small incremental sales growth to deliver good margins and eventually, that long cycle business will pick up and drive the earnings of the company. Okay. Try one more time. Rick, I think we lost you again. Alright, we got you now. Yeah, we gave a mid-single-digit range. So for me that says between 4% and 6%, not 3% to 5%. But in that 4% to 6% range, both of the businesses are going to be in that range. And certainly EMG is going to probably start out a little better in the year, but we think the -- when we end the year, they're both going to be plus mid-single-digit growth. Yeah, oil and gas is projected to be lower, and oil and gas is going to have -- the way it looks for us a strong 2022 right now. But, if you if you think about where we're at right now in the fourth quarter, the businesses that showed positive organic growth for our defense business in process, some of our research businesses like our materials analysis division, that division was all positive, organic. Our UPG business Zygo was positive organic. The Telular business was positive organic, and our automation business was positive organic. So as we go out through the year, that'll change. But yeah, the fact of the matter is with our mid and long cycle exposure, while the strong second half and for some of our markets, we will not get back to 2019 in 2021. Rick, I think we lost you and your question there. Rick, we hear you now I think. No, it is aerospace defense but we do have some land based programs within aerospace, but it's all -- business, that's right. No problem."

            "name": "William J. Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding finish to 2020 with record operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter. I would also like to thank and recognize all of my AMETEK colleagues for their significant contributions in 2020. The way our teams persevered to the challenges of the past year was truly impressive. With that I will provide additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year, but we'll also provide some additional guidance for 2021.  Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $17.7 million up modestly from the prior year. For the full year G&A was down 11% from 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary cost reductions. And as a percentage of total sales was 1.5% in both years. For 2021 general and administrative expenses were expected to be up approximately 10% due primarily to the return of temporary costs, including compensation. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.1% up from 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The difference in tax rate was due primarily to the finalization of tax returns in each of the years. For 2021, assuming the current tax regime, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.  Our businesses continued to manage their working capital exceptionally well. Operating working capital was an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter, down 330 basis points from the 17.3% reported in the same quarter last year, reflecting the outstanding work by our teams. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2021 are expected to be approximately $110 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $65 million and for the full year was $255 million. In 2021 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, including after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.50 per diluted share.  As Dave highlighted our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $386 million up 13% over last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow was also a record $349 million up 16% over the same period last year, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 158% of net income. Cash flow for the full year also set new record levels. Operating cash flow for 2020 was $1.28 billion up 15% over the prior year and free cash flow was $1.21 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%. Full year free cash flow conversion was 158% of net income adjusted for the Redding Alloys gain.  Total debt at December 31st was $2.41 billion down from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times at year-end. We enter 2021 with approximately $2.6 billion in liquidity to support our growth initiatives. This liquidity, along with our strong balance sheet and no material debt maturities until 2024 enables us to manage the continued effects of the economic downturn, will also deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions.  To conclude our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2021 and beyond remains positive, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model, and our world-class workforce. Kevin. That's a great question, Allison, and not really. I mean, M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we feel there's going to be substantial opportunity for us. We -- as you mentioned with the liquidity and our cash flow, we have a very strong balance sheet and we're really positioned to use that as a lever to increase our earnings. And we're seeing an uptick in pipeline opportunities. You started to see some of the pent up demand happen in Q4, the market is very hot, we're maintaining our discipline, but we're working on deals of all sizes. We have some larger deals we're working on and we have some AMETEK typical size of the ozone. We even have a couple of small technology acquisitions we're looking at. So, I would say we've never been busier on M&A and we're looking at it the same way. We think deploying our capital on M&A is the best way to get our shareholders return. Yeah, I think, we have a 42 business units and they all develop an acquisition plan and we're looking at all of those. And, we're certainly seeing properties come available in all areas. We're also looking at some places where we can get a high return on capital. So I'd say that, our bias is toward more technology deals, but not necessarily a vertical market. We're looking at all of them right now. I'd say primarily that the temporary costs with some small exceptions in the first quarter as we continue to see the effects of the pandemic. They're going to be coming back basically I'd say evenly across the year, a little bit lower in the first quarter. Yeah, the backlog number is customer is feeling confident and placing orders for the year. It is not just one quarter, the customers are getting their orders in for the first couple of quarters of the year and I think that AMETEK you have covered a long time, we are mid and long cycle businesses so we typically see the uptick couple of quarters later. Our automation business is seeing it now but the long cycle businesses in aero and oil and gas are not seeing an uptick. So the fact that we have a negative organic growth in Q1 and there is four numbers for the year, when you have one number that is negative and you add them up, you are at mid-single-digits. Well, as you think about it yeah, our businesses did a fantastic job on working capital, taken inventories down, receivables performance was the best I have seen in my 30 years with the company, 30 years plus. So it was fantastic. Will that continue, well I don\u2019t know. We are going to work real hard to make sure it does and our businesses are focused on that. So will there be some give back next year, I expect it to be a little bit but we are very much focused on trying to keep that at the levels we have seen in this fourth quarter and the full year. Clearly our number one priority is M&A. And I really think we're going to be able to deploy the capital on M&A but, if we can't, we'll find a way to get the cash back to you, either through buybacks or dividends. We have a consistently increasing dividend and we've been opportunistic on share buybacks. But I'm not feeling that way right now. I think there's an incredible acquisition opportunity for us and for physicians at a level and to your point, a liquidity position that we haven't been at before. So it's very exciting to me, and I'm very excited about the pipeline. Yeah, I'll give you the numbers. Our overall orders were down 8%. But organic we're down 2%. And EIG organic we're down 2% and EMG organic we're down 1%. So what you backed into with the overall orders was correct and we had a good organic month at minus two. Yeah, CAPEX is -- we plan on 110 million this year. And opportunities -- we have opportunities that are going to provide excellent returns. For growth CAPEX, efficiency improvements, expanding our footprint in emerging markets, and if you recall in 2020 we talked about at mid-year, we had some expansion projects in emerging markets, and we couldn't get people there. We needed to get some expertise from different regions to the emerging markets, we couldn't travel. So we delayed them. So we spent 74 million in 2020 and our original plan was 102 million. So we ended up spending a little less than 2% in 2020 and 2021 we're going to spend a little over 2%. We're going to make up a bit of those projects, because they're still there. And there's great opportunity in other areas. But we're still longer term 2% of sales is the CAPEX number. And we have a little bit of makeup this year with projects that -- these efficiency projects and growth projects have very high internal rates of returns or rates of returns like 30%, 40%, 50%. So this is the kind of stuff that you want to fund. You want to get done. And we have a whole slew of projects that we're getting after. Yeah, I think there's a mix of all that in there and it's bottoms up from the businesses. But yeah, I think definitely software or digital strategy is driving a lot of that. I think the emerging market infrastructure that we're putting in place is driving that. So you are right on in the areas and we just have a particularly large group of projects, and we're going to get those done this year and we got great returns on them."

We will begin today\u2019s call with prepared remarks from Dave and Bill, and then open it up for questions. I will now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered a strong third quarter, despite ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. While sales continue to be impacted by the pandemic, the demand environment shows solid improvements from the second quarter, as customers return to work and travel restrictions began to slowly ease. In addition, our businesses delivered outstanding operating performance, allowing us to expand margins, generate excellent cash flow and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. I would like to thank our employees who are managing exceptionally well through this pandemic, overcoming both personal and professional challenges to provide essential products and services to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the strength of our workforce and the dedication to our mission of solving our customer\u2019s most complex challenges We remain vigilant and focused on our employees\u2019 safety. Our site and country level pandemic coordinators are doing an excellent job adapting to the shifting guidelines provided by the CDC, and local health and safety agencies. The flexibility our teams have shown in implementing new processes and protocols to ensure a safe working environment has been excellent. Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Third quarter sales were $1.13 billion, down 12% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Organic sales were down 14%. With the recent acquisitions contributing 5 points to growth, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3-point headwind and foreign currency adding 1 point. As expected, our commercial aerospace business, which is less than 10% of the overall company, experienced the largest impact from COVID, with sales down approximately 35% versus the prior year. Our businesses continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to help mitigate demand weakness. These efforts lead to excellent operating results in the quarter. Third quarter operating income was $270 million and operating margins were a record 24%, up 40 basis points compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, while decremental margins were an impressive 20% in the quarter. EBITDA in the third quarter was $332 million and EBITDA margins were a record 29.5%, up 210 basis points over last year\u2019s comparable period. This led to earnings per diluted share of $1.01, down just 5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Furthermore, our businesses generated a strong level of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million and free cash flow conversion was an impressive 146% of that income. Next, let me provide additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the quarter, despite end-market weakness, delivering outstanding operating performance resulting in strong margin expansion. Sales in the third quarter for EIG were $748.4 million, down 8% from the comparable period in 2019. As expected, we saw solid and wide-spread sequential sales improvements from the second quarter. Organic sales were down 15% year-over-year, with the acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing 6 points and foreign currency contributing 1 point. Commercial aerospace remains a largest driver of organic sales weakness in EIG. EIG\u2019s third quarter operating income was $203.7 million and operating margins were an impressive 27.2%, up 30 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Our Electromechanical Group also saw sequential sales improvement and mitigated a weak demand environment with solid operating performance. EMG sales were $378.6 million, down 18% from last year\u2019s third quarter, driven in part by the impact of the Reading Alloys divestiture. Organic sales were down 13%, with a divestiture of 8-point headwind, the acquisition of PDT added 2 points and foreign currency adding 1 point. EMG\u2019s operating income was $84.3 million and operating margins were solid at 22.3% for the quarter. Let me comment briefly on end-market dynamics for some of our businesses. Overall, we saw solid sequential sales improvements across all markets in the third quarter. We expect continued sequential improvements in the fourth quarter for all businesses other than customer aerospace, where we expect largely flat conditions sequentially. Our strongest market remains defense, where we continue to be well-positioned with content across a wide range of important defense platforms. We are also very well-positioned with our medical and healthcare businesses. Although, they experienced a delay in the return of electro procedures during the third quarter, which offsets solid COVID-driven demand. And our most challenging market remains commercial aerospace remain cautious of a trajectory of a recovery given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Given the uncertain and challenging end-market dynamics, our businesses remain highly focused on driving operational excellence initiatives, both structural and temporary, to manage topline weakness, while ensuring we maintain our investments and key growth initiatives across the company. AMETEK\u2019s asset-light operating model provides us with the flexibility to do both. Our ability to expand margins and generate strong levels of cash flow during this pandemic is evidence of the strength of our operating model. In the third quarter, we generated $70 million in total cost savings, which was at the high end of our expectations, with $40 million in structural savings and $30 million in temporary cost reduction savings. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly higher level of structural savings, while temporary savings will be reduced from the third quarter levels, as we add back additional temporary costs during the quarter. As a result, we expect approximately $55 million in our total cost savings in the fourth quarter, with $45 million in structural and $10 million in temporary cost savings. And for the full year, we expect approximately $230 million in total cost savings, with $140 million in structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings. Our businesses continue to implement new and innovative ways to reach our customers around the world in new markets. Through virtual meeting platforms, augmented reality product demonstrations and service, and enhanced digital marketing initiatives, our businesses have adapted quickly to the new landscape. Seeing our businesses adopt these new ways of doing business quickly and effectively has been very impressive. Our businesses are also collaborating across platforms. As an example, AMETEK Land and AMETEK Rauland recently partnered together to help support Rauland\u2019s reopen schools safely campaign for their Telecenter U solution. Rauland is the leading provider of critical communications, workflow and safety solutions for hospitals and schools. Their Telecenter U solution connects classrooms and educational facilities to district offices for emergencies, event management and everyday communications. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of non-contact temperature measurement solutions, recently developed their new VIRALERT 3 system for rapid detection of elevated skin temperatures at points of entry to various facilities, including schools. Through this collaborative effort, Rauland was able to incorporate Land\u2019s VIRALERT 3 technology into their Telecenter U solution to help their customers safely reopen their schools by allowing for temperature screening of students and faculty. In return, AMETEK Land will reach thousands of new potential customers through Rauland\u2019s well-established network of school districts. The result was a valuable solution for our customers. Congratulations to the AMETEK and the AMETEK Rauland team for the success on this project. We are also finding ways to support our customers through new product innovation. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to invest meaningfully in our research and development initiatives, and we are seeing great success from these efforts. Our Vitality Index, which measures the amount of sales generated from new products introduced during the last three years was very strong at 25% in the quarter. During the quarter, Creaform, a worldwide leader in 3D measurement solutions, unveiled its R-Series 3D scanning solution that is designed for automated dimensional quality control applications. The suite of R-Series solutions includes the new robot-mounted MetraSCAN 3D scanner with CUBE-R, a turnkey industrial measuring cell that is designed to be integrated into factories for at-line inspections. Together, the solution provides customers with much faster cycle times, more accurate and repeatable results, higher resolution and operational simplicity, to increase productivity by measuring more dimensions on more parts without compromising on accuracy. Congratulations to the Creaform team for launching this outstanding new solution. Now shifting to acquisitions. While deal flow during the second quarter and third quarter has been impacted by the pandemic, we are starting to see a healthy pickup in activity. Our pipeline is strong and conversations with acquisition targets are accelerating. As Bill will highlight in a moment, over the last two quarters, we have further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position, and remain poised to deploy significant capacity -- capital on strategic acquisitions. We will remain active, yet disciplined, in our acquisition process. We continue to focus on acquiring niche technology leaders with attractive growth profiles with opportunities for us to add value commercially and operationally. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While the global economy continues to present challenges and uncertainties, visibility has improved across most markets. As a result, we are providing guidance for the fourth quarter. Overall sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be down high-single digits with a similar level of organic sales decline. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.04, down 4% to 7% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter decremental margins are expected to remain solid in the low 20%s. To summarize, our businesses delivered a solid quarter in a difficult environment. AMETEK continues to manage this global crisis well to the proven strength of the AMETEK growth model and with a talented workforce. Our cost mitigation efforts have allowed the company to weather this ongoing storm and we are confident that we will overcome these challenges with a bright future. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I\u2019d like to echo Dave\u2019s comments on the quarter, as we saw outstanding operating performance driven by the tremendous efforts of our team in a very challenging economic environment. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were down $4.5 million, compared to the same period of 2019, primarily due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.7% last year. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, down from 19.5% in the same period last year. The lower tax rate in the quarter was due to returned provision adjustments and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings. For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%, and as we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Operating capital and working capital was an impressive 17% in the third quarter, down sequentially from the second quarter\u2019s 19.6% on outstanding working capital management. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $10 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million, which is $5 million higher than our full year expectations last quarter, as we are investing in incremental growth opportunities. Our full year capital expenditures estimate remains below our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $63 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash flow, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million, free cash flow was $300 million and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 146% of net income. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion, up slightly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $68 million from the end of the second quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.1 times, as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times at quarter end, which improved by 2 -- 0.2 turns in the quarter. We remain well-positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.3 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives. This includes approximately $1 billion in available revolver capacity. As we have highlighted on previous calls, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023. In summary, our businesses continue to manage through the pandemic exceptionally well, delivering strong operating results and high levels of cash flow. The dedication of our world-class workforce to serving our essential customers has truly been impressive. We remain well-positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges, while investing in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Matt.\nMatt Summerville: Walkthrough -- hey. Hey, Dave. I was wondering if you can maybe start by doing your more detailed walkthrough on the businesses, please?\nDave Zapico: Sure. I will start with the process business. Overall sales for process were down mid-single digits in the quarter. We had the contributions from the Gatan acquisition and they were offset by an organic sales decline and it was in line with AMETEK\u2019s overall organic sales decline. We saw sequential improvements in sales during the quarter, with this improvement being widespread across our process businesses. Our CAMECA and ZYGO businesses had solvent quarters, driven in part by their exposures to research and semiconductor markets. They did very well and we expect continued solid sequential improvements in sales for process during the fourth quarter. I will go into aerospace next. Both overall and organic sales for our entire A&D business were down mid-teens in the quarter, showing nice sequential growth from the second quarter. Similar to the second quarter, there was a meaningful difference in performance between our defense and commercial aerospace businesses. Our defense businesses continue to see solid demand, with sales up low-double digits on a percentage basis versus last year, while the commercial aerospace businesses were down about 35% versus last year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect demand to maintain -- to be relatively flat or sequentially versus the third quarter, as the broad commercial aerospace market continues to adjust to the uncertain demand environment due to COVID-19. And next our Power & Industrial market segment, overall sales for Power & Industrial were down low-double digits in the third quarter, with contributions from IntelliPower being offset by a mid-teens organic sales decline. Demand levels in the third quarter improved nicely from the second quarter and we expect sequential improvements again in the fourth quarter. And finally for our Automation & Engineered Solution market segment, organic sales in the third quarter for A&ES were down mid-teens on a percentage basis. We saw modest sequential improvements in these businesses in the third quarter as we had expected with applications tied to medical markets performing well. We also saw a return to growth in China for Automation & Engineered Solution business in the quarter and as with the other sub-segments we expect sequential improvements across both our Automation & Engineered Solution businesses in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a walk around the company, Matt.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks, Dave. And then as my follow-up, can you comment on what your price realization was in Q3 and what you are looking for in terms of sourcing savings for the full year? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I think the -- I will go with the price first. The -- we are very pleased to see our pricing held up well. Q3 was similar to Q2. We achieved about 0.5 of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was about a point. So we had a 50 basis points of positive spread added to margins. And your second question was on sourcing savings, that -- we consider that part of structural savings and it was about $60 million.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. The one point, though, to finish, it was $60 million for the year, to Matt. And go ahead, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Sure. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nDave Zapico: Hi.\nDeane Dray: It\u2019s great to see you guys are back in the quarterly guidance business, because that does speak to your earnings visibility. So, first question is, kind of related to this visibility, if you can take us through the cadence of the month in the quarter organically. Maybe how October month-to-date has looked and let\u2019s start there, please?\nDave Zapico: Sure. In terms of orders in Q3, it was pretty typical trend for us with September being the strongest month of the quarter. In fact, it was our strongest month since I believe February back in Q1, when we started to really feel the impact of the virus. That\u2019s orders. In terms of sales, September, again, was our highest month of the quarter and the highest month of the year so far. And in terms of October, obviously, it is not completed yet, but it looks good. Orders are trending well and it is supportive of our guidance in Q4, which shows solid sequential improvement.\nDeane Dray: So did you see in the month that sequential improvement consistent through the quarter?\nDave Zapico: We saw sequential improvements in orders and sales. I believe August was a bit of an outlier, but August is always tricky for us. So in general, it was a trend upward with September the highest in both sales and in orders.\nDeane Dray: Great. And then just kind of bridge this, degree of confidence in the sequential improvement. How this translates into your confidence in restoring guidance?\nBill Burke: Yeah. I think the confidence is really based on us becoming more confident with our ability to live with the virus and we have got visibility in our markets. We are seeing consistent improvement and consistent engagement with customers across all of our markets and we just got to the point where we were comfortable giving guidance. Our guidance range is a little bit wider than it typically is and that takes into account some of the uncertainty for the fourth quarter. But we just got comfortable, because our businesses are operating in a good rhythm and it builds a level of confidence with us.\nDeane Dray: Great. And just my last question, not to oversimplify your mix and with respect to how you, in the last question, Matt\u2019s question, you gave and highlighted those businesses. But if I thought about AMETEK and the strength of your medical and defense is probably -- those are probably the strongest here. How did those collectively do in the quarter? And then the weakest, which is more secular, it\u2019s not execution. We get that, and actually, the commercial business you outperformed a number of your peers in this space in this market. So -- but the two sides to this medical, defense, how did they do versus the oil and gas and commercial aero on the other side?\nDave Zapico: All right. That\u2019s a great question. One way to think about it is, if I take the two most challenged markets out, the commercial aerospace and the oil and gas, sales were down approximately 10%. And another way to think about that is, our defense showed strong growth in the third quarter, up mid-teens. Our healthcare business was just slightly down because of the -- we had COVID-related demand that was strong, but we had -- people weren\u2019t going to hospitals and getting surgical procedures, so that was off a little bit. But the combinations of both the defense and medical was clearly our strongest and that was about flat.\nDeane Dray: Terrific. And just a quick clarification, when you said flat for Q2 for aero, was that commercial aero and defense or was it combined?\nDave Zapico: So sequentially we are saying it\u2019s going to be flat and that\u2019s both for military and commercial aerospace.\nDeane Dray: Got it. That is really helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.\nDave Zapico: Hi, Scott.\nScott Graham: Hey. Good morning. Well done again.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nScott Graham: I do have a question first on, I think, an area that you might be most proud of this quarter, operating working capital. What did you do there to push that percentage down as much as you did, what happened?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. The first comment is, that\u2019s one of the hallmarks of AMETEK is our-- we think about working capital is being very -- you have to run businesses where you are efficient with working capital and there\u2019s some elements that really over performed and I will let Bill comment on that.\nBill Burke: Yeah. I think what you saw was our receivables performance has been fantastic. Our businesses have really done a great job staying close to our customers and understanding that pushing for payment. Our receivables were down to 46 days on a DSO basis, which is -- as well as it\u2019s been in quite a while, so I think the teams did a fantastic job there. And then the other thing, it\u2019s at little more difficult, especially when sales are declining as rapidly as they did earlier in the year is getting your supply chains realigned to that level of demand and they did a great job with that as well, and I think, you saw that play out in the third quarter. So I think those two things in combination really enabled us to reduce that working capital percentage to 17% and the teams have just done a fantastic job on that around the company.\nScott Graham: That\u2019s great. Thank you, Bill. Now here is another one. The $90 million of expected full year temporary cost reductions, a lot of companies are saying, hey, not all of that comes back. What is your view on that for 2021 at this point? How much comes back? How much is maybe permanent?\nDave Zapico: The first point I would make is, the temporary cost savings will be at a run rate of about $10 million in the fourth quarter. The second point is related to next year. What we -- we are in a situation. We have to sit down with all of our teams, our budgeting processes in November. It\u2019s a bottoms-up comprehensive planning process for each business unit. They are going to look at growth in each of their markets, customer plans, competitive dynamics, investment opportunities, capital projects, cost reductions and part of that discussion is going to be how fast the temporary costs are going to come back and what the impact is year-over-year. At a high level, travel is a part of that and it is going to come back slowly through the year, but some of the costs have already been restored. So we really don\u2019t have a detailed plan on that next year, because we haven\u2019t done our budgeting yet. We start that process in November. But that\u2019s how I think about it.\nScott Graham: Okay. Last question. Thank you for that. On the M&A pipeline, obviously, you have a much broader swath of businesses today than you did even two years or three years ago, particularly, I look at Gatan and how you have gotten even more into the scientific markets. Could you give us something maybe a little bit more granular date on what you are looking for? And I know competitively you have got to be careful there. But I am assuming that medical, scientific/research would be really kind of at the top of the list for things you are looking for. Could you comment on that?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I think that\u2019s an area that we are definitely looking at. I mean it\u2019s broad based. We -- as you know, we have a decentralized business model and we get acquisition plans rolled up through our businesses through an adjacency process. And we are looking at all parts of the business in all areas and we are seeing an uptick in opportunity -- uptick in discussions. But they could come from all parts of our business. But the area that you highlighted is a particularly interesting one to us.\nScott Graham: Very good. Thank you. Good job.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.\nDave Zapico: Hello, Ivana\nIvana Delevska: Good morning. Good morning, guys. So, just wanted to ask, what percent of your portfolio may be excluding aero and defense and medical is levered to CapEx? And what are you seeing in those CapEx levered businesses?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I -- most of the products that we sell are at a price range that could be considered both OpEx or CapEx. So we really don\u2019t segment it that way. But certainly the -- you think about the big projects and the big project businesses and our oil and gas business and our metals business and some of the heavier industries are delayed right now, but the operating expenditures are continuing. So I don\u2019t have a percentage to give you but that\u2019s how we think about it.\nIvana Delevska: And then in terms of the CapEx levered businesses, are those like down significantly more than the rest, would you say?\nDave Zapico: No. In fact, our -- in the research market for CAMECA, they are selling million -- $3 million tools and that\u2019s one of the businesses that I highlighted in process to talk about on our -- so that\u2019s not the case. I mean, that\u2019s a university market or a research market, very expensive. The key there is that we have the best products and we are the only one in the world that makes an atomprobe and we have a unique SIMs capability. So people say they budget for our products and we build products, and they deliver them. So -- and CAMECA, which is a CapEx market for us, had one of their best quarters. So it is\u2026\nIvana Delevska: Yeah. Yeah.\nDave Zapico: It\u2019s really dependent on the customer dynamics.\nIvana Delevska: Got it. Thank you very much.\nDave Zapico: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the question. So, Dave, I want to go back to the aerospace down 35%. It\u2019s a steep decline for sure. But compared to sort of down 50 to 60% we have seen from so many other suppliers into that market. So I am just curious, would that be a reason why your decline would be significantly decoupled from what we see in the industry? I am thinking about any programs or any other factors, because that\u2019s -- that does sound like it\u2019s actually a pretty good performance?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s a -- it was a good performance. Remember, we thought we were going to be down in the mid-to-high 40s and we ended up down 35% in the commercial aerospace. Our teams did an excellent job. When you look at the different sub-segments, the third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM ended up being down similar with business jet and we thought business jet would be higher and the third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM would be lower and those two sub-segments performed better. But I -- that\u2019s as much of backlog and things like that. Commercial is finding a bottom. There are many variables, including government support, airline capacity decisions, obviously, the confidence of the flying public. When we thought about our business sequentially, that\u2019s the only part of our business we think will not improve. So definitely a better quarter, I can\u2019t comment on the performance of other companies, because I really don\u2019t know it. But I know our team did a good job on shipping product and as a negative 35%, pleased with the performance. This is as strange as that sounds.\nNigel Coe: Yeah. Right. That business is definitely getting better. And then just on cyclical costs, you gave some great detail there and I think you said $45 million of cost during 4Q. Is that a forward run rate, so as we go into 2021, are we looking at maybe, I don\u2019t know, $40 or -- $40 million or so of kind of, like, carryover benefits into \u201821?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. First of all, Nigel, it\u2019s $55 million of savings in Q4 and\u2026\nNigel Coe: Okay.\nDave Zapico: \u2026 $45 million of it is structural and $10 million of it is temporary. And I am going to give you -- there\u2019s a $50 million carryover from the restructuring that we did earlier in the year. But in terms of getting into any specifics, I am going to not answer the question for next year. Our budgeting process is going to be in November and really there\u2019s a lot of discussion on cost reduction, investments and the temporary costs that are going to come back and that all goes into a mix. It will be a pretty complex budgeting process this year with the pandemic. There\u2019s some extra variables in it. So I am not going to comment on what the savings will be for next year.\nNigel Coe: It sounds like you are still maybe configuring different actions in 4Q and just kind of like maybe set up a \u201821, would that be fair?\nDave Zapico: No. I don\u2019t think so. But we are going to go through our budgeting processes and something may come out of there. But we don\u2019t have anything planned in Q4.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hope all is well.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: So just wondering if, in the current environment where some smaller companies might be concerned about global dynamics, supply chain, trade, et cetera, if you are picking up on any new motivations by sellers, including some you have tracked and quoted for some years?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I think there is some activity out there where people are anticipating possibly a tax rate change. So there\u2019s some people that are -- have their businesses out there as part of the uptick and pipeline opportunities. And in terms of the overall uncertainty in the global environment, if you are a smaller owner of a company that has all of these dynamics in terms of COVID and geopolitical issues, and issues with China, you are certainly a little unsettled. And we have known these people for year -- years and we are certainly having discussions with them in terms of when the right time for them to sell their business is.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And any changes in the competition for deals that you are interested in seeing?\nDave Zapico: I would say no competition change that is noticeable. It\u2019s been about the same for the last couple years.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.\nBill Burke: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Just a couple people actually asked me, did I miss -- did you guys actually give us actual orders in the third quarter, you usually do that?\nBill Burke: Yeah. I can do that. Our overall orders were minus 8%, our organic orders were minus 12% and our book-to-bill was 1.01.\nAndrew Obin: Okay. That was easy. And then the second question, just I will ask on elective procedures. I think most of your competitors sort of said that elective surgery is back to 90%, 95% level pre-COVID. Are you just -- has that been your experience and what are seeing on elective procedures into Q4?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I think elective procedures for us, we think it is going to stay at a reduced level until next year, is the -- we are hearing from customers. So we think we will have another quarter in Q4 of some kind of reduced elective procedures and then it will recover next year. And I anticipate they are working off backlog and there is less demand with COVID, so that market will correct itself as time goes on.\nAndrew Obin: But your experience is consistent sort of with the data that I cited that your competitors are citing, right?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I am not sure what our competitors have cited. But we are down a bit in numbers that you put out there 90% or 95% kind of makes sense.\nAndrew Obin: Okay. And just to ask Ivana\u2019s question in a slightly different way, on the way up as IP recovers, what kind of revenue leverage to IP should we be thinking for your portfolio ex aero and maybe ex healthcare?\nDave Zapico: Go ahead.\nBill Burke: Yeah. That\u2019s something we are going to talk about with our businesses, but historically, AMETEK has recovered very well from significant downturns and we are seeing the improvement in Q3 versus Q2. We are anticipating seeing it in Q4 versus Q3, and historically, we have really performed well in upticks. So we have a mid and long cycle business and we are seeing good improvements. And what you are seeing is now is short cycle activities picking up. So that should bode well for the future. But we are going to go through our budgets and figure everything out.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you so much.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.\nBrett Linzey: Hey. Good morning all. Maybe first question, just on defense and medical, first on the defense side, very strong 2020 continues to look pretty good here. What is your visibility in that business next year based on wins or platforms you are on, clearly a tough comp, but can you see that growing still next year? And then on the medical side, any identifiable COVID-related opportunities that you could point to or even quantify that could pop up here over the coming months?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. The first question is, I am really not going to comment on the military demand environment next year, but the spending pattern, those things are relatively healthy and we will see what the political environment brings, but usually those changes occur slowly over time. So you think the overall spending environment will be supportive next year and our quoting activity shows that. In terms of the COVID-related products, I mean, the first thing I pointed to is the land temperature measurement, where we are doing body temperature scanning. When I came into work today, I went through the land system. It\u2019s very quick, easy, efficient and measures body temperature. The other things that are happening in our Automation business, there\u2019s a lot of COVID testing devices that require sample automation, movement of samples very precisely through testing. The demand in that business is very strong. We are also seeing some demand for temporary setups in hospital type situations with our Rauland Healthcare businesses. So we are really seeing some pockets of improved demand and that\u2019s built into the overall story.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. That\u2019s great. And then just in terms of the geographic complexion. Could you maybe give us a little more color, what sales or order rates? And then I am actually curious specific on Europe in October with the lockdown chatter and maybe even enactment was starting to percolate a little bit. Did you see a\u2026\nDave Zapico: Right.\nBrett Linzey: \u2026 slowing kind of late in October in Europe? Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Yeah. I will take the second question first. I mean, our orders for October are very good. They are in line with what we are expecting and we are seeing no geographical problems at this point. In terms of the third quarter, the geographical third quarter, we had positive sequential trends across all geographies, with Europe and U.S. remaining the most challenged. So the U.S. was down I think 13%, broad based weakness. Europe was down 20% on broad based weakness. Asia was down mid-single digits. We had a good strength in EMG in China and China was positive at plus 3% for us. So -- but all geographies improved sequentially.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Brett.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nRobert Jamieson: Hey. Good morning, This is Robert. Hey. Good morning. It\u2019s Robert in for Joe this morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot has been covered. I guess a quick one on the structural and variable costs for Q4, is there any -- is that pretty evenly split between the EIG and EMG, anything you can give about it?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. It is. It is pretty well split between the two. So EIG is a little bit higher because of the relative size of it, but it is split based on volume.\nRobert Jamieson: Okay. Great. And then can you provide another update on Gatan\u2019s performance so far and how that has been progressing versus expectations and synergies into next year?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, we met our year-one profitability target. So we are going to be reviewing that with our Board next week. We had a very good first year. The team did an excellent job. We had -- We were helped by COVID-related sales, about half of that business was life sciences and we also announced the combining of our Gatan with our EDX business [ph] in similar market, so we drove excellent synergy. So very positive and the K3 camera helped us solve some of the COVID-related problems, being the first camera to structure the virus. So all very good and the people of Gatan are very proud of that. Okay?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew\nBill Burke: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So, Dave, you talked about, you reinstated quarterly guidance, and you mentioned, visibility getting a little bit better, which is interesting. Some companies aren\u2019t willing to say that yet or hesitate into year-end still a lot of uncertainty. So I guess, where are you seeing across your space, where are you feeling more comfortable, obviously in some areas with, by nature, like military spending, you kind of have better visibility just all the time. But I guess, where do you get more comfortable saying that and maybe is this coming from some of the conversations you are having with some of your customers?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. That\u2019s a great question, Andrew. And when you think about it, we are getting better at living with the virus. Our customers are getting better at living with the virus. Our suppliers are getting better at living with the virus. And there is an uptick in cases, especially in Europe and the Western U.S. and we are watching that closely. But we expect to continue to run as an essential business and our customers are essential customers and they are expecting to continue to run. So business activity levels are continuing to improve and even in Europe when you some increased lockdowns to certain degrees, essential businesses are still operating. So that is really the broader context that we used to reinstate guidance and talking with our teams they are confident they can deliver the fourth quarter.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yeah. That\u2019s fair. And you talked about -- this quarter about some benefits from COVID and some COVID-related products. I guess, it\u2019s hard -- you have a lot going on on that side. I guess how much of it do you think is sustainable demand into 2021? I guess, I mean, how would you characterize sort of a temporary bump in demand related to those products versus something that might linger next year and beyond?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. As I said, a couple of times, we are not going to talk about next year. We are going to work with our teams. But in general, we are seeing a pretty substantial improvement quarter-to-quarter and we will find out the details with our teams. But I would expect that improvement trend will continue into next year, and as I talked earlier on this call about AMETEK, typically has responded positively to a deep downturn. So we will find that all out. We don\u2019t know about the timing and there may be some COVID-related demand that falls off. But there is also going to be some demand that was impacted by COVID that is going to improve. So we will figure that out during our budget process.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. All right. That\u2019s fair. Thanks, David.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo.\nMichael McGinn: Hey, guys. Mike on for Allison. Thanks for the question. \nDave Zapico: Hi, Mike.\nBill Burke: Hi.\nMichael McGinn: I want to go back to the capital allocation discussion. So as you move into the heavy R&D industries with the bolt-on acquisitions from versus maybe more material and direct COGS industries. Is there any discussion on the way you approach and report gross margin, which I believe differs from your peers at?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Our cost of sales includes engineering and that\u2019s historically how we have done that and we have not had a discussion recently of changing that.\nMichael McGinn: Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess switching to some of your end markets. I believe you have an Automation & Engineered Solution platform that was approaching $1.5 billion prior to downturn. So I was curious what are near-shoring or re-shoring kind of player theme would look like for you guys in the businesses that would be most impactful for?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Automation is one of them. Automation did well in the third quarter. It did better than our Engineered Services business and they are seeing that demand. They also saw good strength in China from that. And when you think about the product that I talked about today from Creaform, that\u2019s all product for at-line metrology. So our Automation businesses and Instrumentation businesses are very well-positioned to do -- to improve in an environment that includes re-shoring. We have a lot of products that our customers use to make their manufacturing more efficient and more productive. So that\u2019s kind of in our sweet spot.\nMichael McGinn: Okay. And so is it fair to say that some of those businesses have a higher Vitality Index than maybe the Legacy AMETEK platform? I believe you said it was like 25% this quarter. Just is that where the R&D focus is now and going forward?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I think the R&D focus is EIG-biased versus EMG and the Vitality Index is higher in those kind of businesses. So that would be a correct view from your view -- your viewpoint.\nMichael McGinn: Okay. Appreciate the time. I will pass it along.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nBill Burke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investor section of ametek.com. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered a strong third quarter, despite ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. While sales continue to be impacted by the pandemic, the demand environment shows solid improvements from the second quarter, as customers return to work and travel restrictions began to slowly ease. In addition, our businesses delivered outstanding operating performance, allowing us to expand margins, generate excellent cash flow and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. I would like to thank our employees who are managing exceptionally well through this pandemic, overcoming both personal and professional challenges to provide essential products and services to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the strength of our workforce and the dedication to our mission of solving our customer\u2019s most complex challenges We remain vigilant and focused on our employees\u2019 safety. Our site and country level pandemic coordinators are doing an excellent job adapting to the shifting guidelines provided by the CDC, and local health and safety agencies. The flexibility our teams have shown in implementing new processes and protocols to ensure a safe working environment has been excellent. Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Third quarter sales were $1.13 billion, down 12% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Organic sales were down 14%. With the recent acquisitions contributing 5 points to growth, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3-point headwind and foreign currency adding 1 point. As expected, our commercial aerospace business, which is less than 10% of the overall company, experienced the largest impact from COVID, with sales down approximately 35% versus the prior year. Our businesses continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to help mitigate demand weakness. These efforts lead to excellent operating results in the quarter. Third quarter operating income was $270 million and operating margins were a record 24%, up 40 basis points compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, while decremental margins were an impressive 20% in the quarter. EBITDA in the third quarter was $332 million and EBITDA margins were a record 29.5%, up 210 basis points over last year\u2019s comparable period. This led to earnings per diluted share of $1.01, down just 5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Furthermore, our businesses generated a strong level of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million and free cash flow conversion was an impressive 146% of that income. Next, let me provide additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the quarter, despite end-market weakness, delivering outstanding operating performance resulting in strong margin expansion. Sales in the third quarter for EIG were $748.4 million, down 8% from the comparable period in 2019. As expected, we saw solid and wide-spread sequential sales improvements from the second quarter. Organic sales were down 15% year-over-year, with the acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing 6 points and foreign currency contributing 1 point. Commercial aerospace remains a largest driver of organic sales weakness in EIG. EIG\u2019s third quarter operating income was $203.7 million and operating margins were an impressive 27.2%, up 30 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Our Electromechanical Group also saw sequential sales improvement and mitigated a weak demand environment with solid operating performance. EMG sales were $378.6 million, down 18% from last year\u2019s third quarter, driven in part by the impact of the Reading Alloys divestiture. Organic sales were down 13%, with a divestiture of 8-point headwind, the acquisition of PDT added 2 points and foreign currency adding 1 point. EMG\u2019s operating income was $84.3 million and operating margins were solid at 22.3% for the quarter. Let me comment briefly on end-market dynamics for some of our businesses. Overall, we saw solid sequential sales improvements across all markets in the third quarter. We expect continued sequential improvements in the fourth quarter for all businesses other than customer aerospace, where we expect largely flat conditions sequentially. Our strongest market remains defense, where we continue to be well-positioned with content across a wide range of important defense platforms. We are also very well-positioned with our medical and healthcare businesses. Although, they experienced a delay in the return of electro procedures during the third quarter, which offsets solid COVID-driven demand. And our most challenging market remains commercial aerospace remain cautious of a trajectory of a recovery given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Given the uncertain and challenging end-market dynamics, our businesses remain highly focused on driving operational excellence initiatives, both structural and temporary, to manage topline weakness, while ensuring we maintain our investments and key growth initiatives across the company. AMETEK\u2019s asset-light operating model provides us with the flexibility to do both. Our ability to expand margins and generate strong levels of cash flow during this pandemic is evidence of the strength of our operating model. In the third quarter, we generated $70 million in total cost savings, which was at the high end of our expectations, with $40 million in structural savings and $30 million in temporary cost reduction savings. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly higher level of structural savings, while temporary savings will be reduced from the third quarter levels, as we add back additional temporary costs during the quarter. As a result, we expect approximately $55 million in our total cost savings in the fourth quarter, with $45 million in structural and $10 million in temporary cost savings. And for the full year, we expect approximately $230 million in total cost savings, with $140 million in structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings. Our businesses continue to implement new and innovative ways to reach our customers around the world in new markets. Through virtual meeting platforms, augmented reality product demonstrations and service, and enhanced digital marketing initiatives, our businesses have adapted quickly to the new landscape. Seeing our businesses adopt these new ways of doing business quickly and effectively has been very impressive. Our businesses are also collaborating across platforms. As an example, AMETEK Land and AMETEK Rauland recently partnered together to help support Rauland\u2019s reopen schools safely campaign for their Telecenter U solution. Rauland is the leading provider of critical communications, workflow and safety solutions for hospitals and schools. Their Telecenter U solution connects classrooms and educational facilities to district offices for emergencies, event management and everyday communications. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of non-contact temperature measurement solutions, recently developed their new VIRALERT 3 system for rapid detection of elevated skin temperatures at points of entry to various facilities, including schools. Through this collaborative effort, Rauland was able to incorporate Land\u2019s VIRALERT 3 technology into their Telecenter U solution to help their customers safely reopen their schools by allowing for temperature screening of students and faculty. In return, AMETEK Land will reach thousands of new potential customers through Rauland\u2019s well-established network of school districts. The result was a valuable solution for our customers. Congratulations to the AMETEK and the AMETEK Rauland team for the success on this project. We are also finding ways to support our customers through new product innovation. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to invest meaningfully in our research and development initiatives, and we are seeing great success from these efforts. Our Vitality Index, which measures the amount of sales generated from new products introduced during the last three years was very strong at 25% in the quarter. During the quarter, Creaform, a worldwide leader in 3D measurement solutions, unveiled its R-Series 3D scanning solution that is designed for automated dimensional quality control applications. The suite of R-Series solutions includes the new robot-mounted MetraSCAN 3D scanner with CUBE-R, a turnkey industrial measuring cell that is designed to be integrated into factories for at-line inspections. Together, the solution provides customers with much faster cycle times, more accurate and repeatable results, higher resolution and operational simplicity, to increase productivity by measuring more dimensions on more parts without compromising on accuracy. Congratulations to the Creaform team for launching this outstanding new solution. Now shifting to acquisitions. While deal flow during the second quarter and third quarter has been impacted by the pandemic, we are starting to see a healthy pickup in activity. Our pipeline is strong and conversations with acquisition targets are accelerating. As Bill will highlight in a moment, over the last two quarters, we have further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position, and remain poised to deploy significant capacity -- capital on strategic acquisitions. We will remain active, yet disciplined, in our acquisition process. We continue to focus on acquiring niche technology leaders with attractive growth profiles with opportunities for us to add value commercially and operationally. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While the global economy continues to present challenges and uncertainties, visibility has improved across most markets. As a result, we are providing guidance for the fourth quarter. Overall sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be down high-single digits with a similar level of organic sales decline. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.04, down 4% to 7% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter decremental margins are expected to remain solid in the low 20%s. To summarize, our businesses delivered a solid quarter in a difficult environment. AMETEK continues to manage this global crisis well to the proven strength of the AMETEK growth model and with a talented workforce. Our cost mitigation efforts have allowed the company to weather this ongoing storm and we are confident that we will overcome these challenges with a bright future. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill? Good morning, Matt. Sure. I will start with the process business. Overall sales for process were down mid-single digits in the quarter. We had the contributions from the Gatan acquisition and they were offset by an organic sales decline and it was in line with AMETEK\u2019s overall organic sales decline. We saw sequential improvements in sales during the quarter, with this improvement being widespread across our process businesses. Our CAMECA and ZYGO businesses had solvent quarters, driven in part by their exposures to research and semiconductor markets. They did very well and we expect continued solid sequential improvements in sales for process during the fourth quarter. I will go into aerospace next. Both overall and organic sales for our entire A&D business were down mid-teens in the quarter, showing nice sequential growth from the second quarter. Similar to the second quarter, there was a meaningful difference in performance between our defense and commercial aerospace businesses. Our defense businesses continue to see solid demand, with sales up low-double digits on a percentage basis versus last year, while the commercial aerospace businesses were down about 35% versus last year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect demand to maintain -- to be relatively flat or sequentially versus the third quarter, as the broad commercial aerospace market continues to adjust to the uncertain demand environment due to COVID-19. And next our Power & Industrial market segment, overall sales for Power & Industrial were down low-double digits in the third quarter, with contributions from IntelliPower being offset by a mid-teens organic sales decline. Demand levels in the third quarter improved nicely from the second quarter and we expect sequential improvements again in the fourth quarter. And finally for our Automation & Engineered Solution market segment, organic sales in the third quarter for A&ES were down mid-teens on a percentage basis. We saw modest sequential improvements in these businesses in the third quarter as we had expected with applications tied to medical markets performing well. We also saw a return to growth in China for Automation & Engineered Solution business in the quarter and as with the other sub-segments we expect sequential improvements across both our Automation & Engineered Solution businesses in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a walk around the company, Matt. Yeah. I think the -- I will go with the price first. The -- we are very pleased to see our pricing held up well. Q3 was similar to Q2. We achieved about 0.5 of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was about a point. So we had a 50 basis points of positive spread added to margins. And your second question was on sourcing savings, that -- we consider that part of structural savings and it was about $60 million. Yeah. The one point, though, to finish, it was $60 million for the year, to Matt. And go ahead, Deane. Hi. Sure. In terms of orders in Q3, it was pretty typical trend for us with September being the strongest month of the quarter. In fact, it was our strongest month since I believe February back in Q1, when we started to really feel the impact of the virus. That\u2019s orders. In terms of sales, September, again, was our highest month of the quarter and the highest month of the year so far. And in terms of October, obviously, it is not completed yet, but it looks good. Orders are trending well and it is supportive of our guidance in Q4, which shows solid sequential improvement. We saw sequential improvements in orders and sales. I believe August was a bit of an outlier, but August is always tricky for us. So in general, it was a trend upward with September the highest in both sales and in orders. All right. That\u2019s a great question. One way to think about it is, if I take the two most challenged markets out, the commercial aerospace and the oil and gas, sales were down approximately 10%. And another way to think about that is, our defense showed strong growth in the third quarter, up mid-teens. Our healthcare business was just slightly down because of the -- we had COVID-related demand that was strong, but we had -- people weren\u2019t going to hospitals and getting surgical procedures, so that was off a little bit. But the combinations of both the defense and medical was clearly our strongest and that was about flat. So sequentially we are saying it\u2019s going to be flat and that\u2019s both for military and commercial aerospace. Thanks. Hi, Scott. Thank you. Yeah. The first comment is, that\u2019s one of the hallmarks of AMETEK is our-- we think about working capital is being very -- you have to run businesses where you are efficient with working capital and there\u2019s some elements that really over performed and I will let Bill comment on that. The first point I would make is, the temporary cost savings will be at a run rate of about $10 million in the fourth quarter. The second point is related to next year. What we -- we are in a situation. We have to sit down with all of our teams, our budgeting processes in November. It\u2019s a bottoms-up comprehensive planning process for each business unit. They are going to look at growth in each of their markets, customer plans, competitive dynamics, investment opportunities, capital projects, cost reductions and part of that discussion is going to be how fast the temporary costs are going to come back and what the impact is year-over-year. At a high level, travel is a part of that and it is going to come back slowly through the year, but some of the costs have already been restored. So we really don\u2019t have a detailed plan on that next year, because we haven\u2019t done our budgeting yet. We start that process in November. But that\u2019s how I think about it. Yeah. I think that\u2019s an area that we are definitely looking at. I mean it\u2019s broad based. We -- as you know, we have a decentralized business model and we get acquisition plans rolled up through our businesses through an adjacency process. And we are looking at all parts of the business in all areas and we are seeing an uptick in opportunity -- uptick in discussions. But they could come from all parts of our business. But the area that you highlighted is a particularly interesting one to us. Thank you, Scott. Hello, Ivana Yeah. I -- most of the products that we sell are at a price range that could be considered both OpEx or CapEx. So we really don\u2019t segment it that way. But certainly the -- you think about the big projects and the big project businesses and our oil and gas business and our metals business and some of the heavier industries are delayed right now, but the operating expenditures are continuing. So I don\u2019t have a percentage to give you but that\u2019s how we think about it. No. In fact, our -- in the research market for CAMECA, they are selling million -- $3 million tools and that\u2019s one of the businesses that I highlighted in process to talk about on our -- so that\u2019s not the case. I mean, that\u2019s a university market or a research market, very expensive. The key there is that we have the best products and we are the only one in the world that makes an atomprobe and we have a unique SIMs capability. So people say they budget for our products and we build products, and they deliver them. So -- and CAMECA, which is a CapEx market for us, had one of their best quarters. So it is\u2026 It\u2019s really dependent on the customer dynamics. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s a -- it was a good performance. Remember, we thought we were going to be down in the mid-to-high 40s and we ended up down 35% in the commercial aerospace. Our teams did an excellent job. When you look at the different sub-segments, the third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM ended up being down similar with business jet and we thought business jet would be higher and the third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM would be lower and those two sub-segments performed better. But I -- that\u2019s as much of backlog and things like that. Commercial is finding a bottom. There are many variables, including government support, airline capacity decisions, obviously, the confidence of the flying public. When we thought about our business sequentially, that\u2019s the only part of our business we think will not improve. So definitely a better quarter, I can\u2019t comment on the performance of other companies, because I really don\u2019t know it. But I know our team did a good job on shipping product and as a negative 35%, pleased with the performance. This is as strange as that sounds. Yeah. First of all, Nigel, it\u2019s $55 million of savings in Q4 and\u2026 \u2026 $45 million of it is structural and $10 million of it is temporary. And I am going to give you -- there\u2019s a $50 million carryover from the restructuring that we did earlier in the year. But in terms of getting into any specifics, I am going to not answer the question for next year. Our budgeting process is going to be in November and really there\u2019s a lot of discussion on cost reduction, investments and the temporary costs that are going to come back and that all goes into a mix. It will be a pretty complex budgeting process this year with the pandemic. There\u2019s some extra variables in it. So I am not going to comment on what the savings will be for next year. No. I don\u2019t think so. But we are going to go through our budgeting processes and something may come out of there. But we don\u2019t have anything planned in Q4. Thanks. Good morning, Chris. Yeah. I think there is some activity out there where people are anticipating possibly a tax rate change. So there\u2019s some people that are -- have their businesses out there as part of the uptick and pipeline opportunities. And in terms of the overall uncertainty in the global environment, if you are a smaller owner of a company that has all of these dynamics in terms of COVID and geopolitical issues, and issues with China, you are certainly a little unsettled. And we have known these people for year -- years and we are certainly having discussions with them in terms of when the right time for them to sell their business is. I would say no competition change that is noticeable. It\u2019s been about the same for the last couple years. Thank you, Chris. Good morning, Andrew. Yeah. I think elective procedures for us, we think it is going to stay at a reduced level until next year, is the -- we are hearing from customers. So we think we will have another quarter in Q4 of some kind of reduced elective procedures and then it will recover next year. And I anticipate they are working off backlog and there is less demand with COVID, so that market will correct itself as time goes on. Yeah. I am not sure what our competitors have cited. But we are down a bit in numbers that you put out there 90% or 95% kind of makes sense. Go ahead. Thank you, Andrew. Yeah. The first question is, I am really not going to comment on the military demand environment next year, but the spending pattern, those things are relatively healthy and we will see what the political environment brings, but usually those changes occur slowly over time. So you think the overall spending environment will be supportive next year and our quoting activity shows that. In terms of the COVID-related products, I mean, the first thing I pointed to is the land temperature measurement, where we are doing body temperature scanning. When I came into work today, I went through the land system. It\u2019s very quick, easy, efficient and measures body temperature. The other things that are happening in our Automation business, there\u2019s a lot of COVID testing devices that require sample automation, movement of samples very precisely through testing. The demand in that business is very strong. We are also seeing some demand for temporary setups in hospital type situations with our Rauland Healthcare businesses. So we are really seeing some pockets of improved demand and that\u2019s built into the overall story. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I will take the second question first. I mean, our orders for October are very good. They are in line with what we are expecting and we are seeing no geographical problems at this point. In terms of the third quarter, the geographical third quarter, we had positive sequential trends across all geographies, with Europe and U.S. remaining the most challenged. So the U.S. was down I think 13%, broad based weakness. Europe was down 20% on broad based weakness. Asia was down mid-single digits. We had a good strength in EMG in China and China was positive at plus 3% for us. So -- but all geographies improved sequentially. Thank you, Brett. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. It is. It is pretty well split between the two. So EIG is a little bit higher because of the relative size of it, but it is split based on volume. Yeah. I mean, we met our year-one profitability target. So we are going to be reviewing that with our Board next week. We had a very good first year. The team did an excellent job. We had -- We were helped by COVID-related sales, about half of that business was life sciences and we also announced the combining of our Gatan with our EDX business [ph] in similar market, so we drove excellent synergy. So very positive and the K3 camera helped us solve some of the COVID-related problems, being the first camera to structure the virus. So all very good and the people of Gatan are very proud of that. Okay? Good morning, Andrew Yeah. That\u2019s a great question, Andrew. And when you think about it, we are getting better at living with the virus. Our customers are getting better at living with the virus. Our suppliers are getting better at living with the virus. And there is an uptick in cases, especially in Europe and the Western U.S. and we are watching that closely. But we expect to continue to run as an essential business and our customers are essential customers and they are expecting to continue to run. So business activity levels are continuing to improve and even in Europe when you some increased lockdowns to certain degrees, essential businesses are still operating. So that is really the broader context that we used to reinstate guidance and talking with our teams they are confident they can deliver the fourth quarter. Yeah. As I said, a couple of times, we are not going to talk about next year. We are going to work with our teams. But in general, we are seeing a pretty substantial improvement quarter-to-quarter and we will find out the details with our teams. But I would expect that improvement trend will continue into next year, and as I talked earlier on this call about AMETEK, typically has responded positively to a deep downturn. So we will find that all out. We don\u2019t know about the timing and there may be some COVID-related demand that falls off. But there is also going to be some demand that was impacted by COVID that is going to improve. So we will figure that out during our budget process. Thank you. Hi, Mike. Yeah. Our cost of sales includes engineering and that\u2019s historically how we have done that and we have not had a discussion recently of changing that. Yeah. Automation is one of them. Automation did well in the third quarter. It did better than our Engineered Services business and they are seeing that demand. They also saw good strength in China from that. And when you think about the product that I talked about today from Creaform, that\u2019s all product for at-line metrology. So our Automation businesses and Instrumentation businesses are very well-positioned to do -- to improve in an environment that includes re-shoring. We have a lot of products that our customers use to make their manufacturing more efficient and more productive. So that\u2019s kind of in our sweet spot. Yeah. I think the R&D focus is EIG-biased versus EMG and the Vitality Index is higher in those kind of businesses. So that would be a correct view from your view -- your viewpoint. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. I\u2019d like to echo Dave\u2019s comments on the quarter, as we saw outstanding operating performance driven by the tremendous efforts of our team in a very challenging economic environment. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were down $4.5 million, compared to the same period of 2019, primarily due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.7% last year. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, down from 19.5% in the same period last year. The lower tax rate in the quarter was due to returned provision adjustments and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings. For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%, and as we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Operating capital and working capital was an impressive 17% in the third quarter, down sequentially from the second quarter\u2019s 19.6% on outstanding working capital management. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $10 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million, which is $5 million higher than our full year expectations last quarter, as we are investing in incremental growth opportunities. Our full year capital expenditures estimate remains below our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $63 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash flow, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million, free cash flow was $300 million and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 146% of net income. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion, up slightly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $68 million from the end of the second quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.1 times, as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times at quarter end, which improved by 2 -- 0.2 turns in the quarter. We remain well-positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.3 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives. This includes approximately $1 billion in available revolver capacity. As we have highlighted on previous calls, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023. In summary, our businesses continue to manage through the pandemic exceptionally well, delivering strong operating results and high levels of cash flow. The dedication of our world-class workforce to serving our essential customers has truly been impressive. We remain well-positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges, while investing in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin? Yeah. I think the confidence is really based on us becoming more confident with our ability to live with the virus and we have got visibility in our markets. We are seeing consistent improvement and consistent engagement with customers across all of our markets and we just got to the point where we were comfortable giving guidance. Our guidance range is a little bit wider than it typically is and that takes into account some of the uncertainty for the fourth quarter. But we just got comfortable, because our businesses are operating in a good rhythm and it builds a level of confidence with us. Yeah. I think what you saw was our receivables performance has been fantastic. Our businesses have really done a great job staying close to our customers and understanding that pushing for payment. Our receivables were down to 46 days on a DSO basis, which is -- as well as it\u2019s been in quite a while, so I think the teams did a fantastic job there. And then the other thing, it\u2019s at little more difficult, especially when sales are declining as rapidly as they did earlier in the year is getting your supply chains realigned to that level of demand and they did a great job with that as well, and I think, you saw that play out in the third quarter. So I think those two things in combination really enabled us to reduce that working capital percentage to 17% and the teams have just done a fantastic job on that around the company. Good morning. Yeah. I can do that. Our overall orders were minus 8%, our organic orders were minus 12% and our book-to-bill was 1.01. Yeah. That\u2019s something we are going to talk about with our businesses, but historically, AMETEK has recovered very well from significant downturns and we are seeing the improvement in Q3 versus Q2. We are anticipating seeing it in Q4 versus Q3, and historically, we have really performed well in upticks. So we have a mid and long cycle business and we are seeing good improvements. And what you are seeing is now is short cycle activities picking up. So that should bode well for the future. But we are going to go through our budgets and figure everything out. Good morning. Hi. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce, Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Coleman.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. AMETEK's second quarter results were released earlier this morning and are available on market systems and in the Investors section of our website. This call is also being webcasted and can be accessed on our website. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in the AMETEK's filings with the SEC, including in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2019 or 2020 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related, intangible amortization and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of 2020 and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Despite an economic environment as challenging and uncertain as any we have ever faced in AMETEK, our businesses stood strong in the second quarter delivering outstanding operating performance that exceeded expectations. I wanted to start by thanking all AMETEK colleagues who are working tirelessly through this pandemic to provide our customers with great products and exceptional service. As our result of test, our employees are doing an amazing job. The safety of our employees remains our highest priority. We continue to implement our pandemic response plan, which provides a pandemic for our businesses to manage our facilities and workforce during this pandemic. We are following CDC and local health and safety guidelines and are adjusting and enhancing our safety protocols as required to ensure safe working environment for our employees. Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Sales in the second quarter were $1.01 billion, down 22% versus the second quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 22% with recent acquisitions contributing 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a three point headwind and foreign currency a one point headwind. Despite substantial demand weakness, as our business delivered exceptional operating performance. Operating income in the quarter was $227 million and operating margins were very strong at 22.4%, while decremental margins were an impressive 25%. EBITDA in the second quarter was $289.7 million and EBITDA margins were a record 28.6%, up 160 basis points over last year's second quarter. This drove earnings of $0.84 per diluted share, down 20% versus the second quarter of 2019. Our cash generation in the quarter was superb. Operating cash flow was up 28% year-over-year to $315 million. Free cash flow conversion was also exceptionally strong at 183% of net income. Our businesses are focused on controlling what they can. The operating performance in the quarter is validation of the strength and flexibility of our asset-light business model, the quality of our niche businesses, and most importantly, the talent and commitment of our workforce. Next, I will provide some additional details at the operating group level. Second quarter sales for Electronic Instruments Group were $647.9 million, down 21% from the same period last year. Organic sales were down 26% with the acquisition of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing 5%. Despite the impact COVID-19 had on sales, our EIG businesses delivered excellent operating performance. EIG's operating income in the second quarter was $159.6 million and operating margins remained strong at 24.6%. The Electromechanical Group also delivered excellent operating results, driven by better than expected organic sales and their operational excellence initiatives, which contributed to exceptional margin expansion. EMG's sales were $364 million, down 22% versus the prior year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 16% with the recent acquisition of PDT adding 3%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys was an eight point headwind and foreign currency was a one point headwind. EMG's margin expansion was outstanding in the quarter. While operating income decreased to $84.3 million, operating margins expanded an impressive 170 basis points to a record 23.2% driven by our proactive operational excellence initiatives. Truly exceptional work by our teams. Now let me provide some color on the different end market dynamics we are experiencing within our business. AMETEK serves a diverse set of end markets. And across these end markets, we are seeing very different levels of demand and COVID-19 impacts. So as I did last quarter, I'll group our businesses into three buckets based on the levels of demand we are experiencing and provide some commentary on each. I'll start with the most challenging markets, commercial aerospace and oil and gas, which combined account for approximately 15% of AMETEK's sales. The weakness in commercial aerospace was largely as expected and driven by the impacts of COVID-19 on both our commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses. We expect these businesses to remain challenged for the balance of the year. Along with the impact from COVID-19, weakness in our oil and gas business was a result of difficult prior year comparison given several large project shipments last year. As a result, we expect solid sequential improvements in this business during the third quarter and fourth quarters. Combined, sales for aerospace, commercial aerospace and oil and gas were down approximately 45% in the quarter. Excluding these two markets, AMETEK's sales were down mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter. Next, our strongest markets, defense and medical. Combining these markets account for over 20% of our sales and we have been experiencing solid internal growth, while also strategically expanding our portfolio in these areas through acquisitions. In the second quarter, sales were up low-single-digits for these businesses and we expect this strength to continue in the third quarter and fourth quarters. And for the balance of our markets, which include power, industrial, automation, metals, food and beverage and research, we were seeing demand levels somewhere in between those other two streams. We expect to see sequential improvements through the balance of the year for these businesses also. To offset these COVID-19-driven demand challenges, we remain focused on actively managing our cost structure through a mix of structural and temporary cost actions. Our executive office meets regularly with each of our businesses to review current market conditions, their demand outlook for the coming months and their operational plans. It is critical that each of our businesses develop an operating plan customized for their business, and that this operating planning be adjusted if conditions change. This flexibility is key in our asset-light operating model where costs can be quickly variablized. This approach allows us to best align our cost structure with demand levels we are experiencing by market and by business. We have the flexibility to expand cost savings initiatives or as demand continues -- demand conditions improve, we can add back costs as required. In the second quarter, we generated $85 million in total cost savings with $35 million in structural savings and $50 million in temporary cost savings. This level of savings was above our initial estimate of $80 million total cost savings in the quarter. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect approximately $65 million in total cost savings with $35 million to $40 million in structural and $25 million to $30 million in temporary savings. And for the full year, we now expect structural savings of $135 million and will flex our temporary cost savings either up or down based on volume levels in the fourth quarter. The spread of the coronavirus has oddly forced companies to adapt and adjust how they do business. Work from home requirements and travel restrictions have changed our company's interact and engage with customers. Our businesses have been proactive in developing and utilize digital capabilities to help them stay engaged with our customers. Our sales and engineering teams are working side-by-side with our customers through digital channels to cultivate and build relationships. These initiatives have included virtual events through newly implemented digital platforms to provide product demos, webinars and collaborative business meetings. Finally, some of our teams are finding innovative ways to help provide aftermarket services for our customers through interactive technologies. I commend our teams for quickly adapting to the new reality and for embracing these new ways of doing business. We remain committed to investing in additional technologies to support our customer experience. Despite the global demand challenges, AMETEK continues to invest meaningfully in new product development initiatives. We are seeing great success from these investments as our businesses are introducing many new innovative solutions to help solve our customers' greatest challenges. Our vitality index, which measures the amount of sales generated from new products introduced during the last three years was very strong at 26%. And here are just a few of the recent examples of new product introductions. AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of non-contact temperature measurement solutions saw a robust demand in the second quarter for their new VIRALERT 3. This newly developed non-contact temperature measurement solution is used to rapidly detect elevated skin temperature, while allowing users to adhere to social distancing requirements. The safe, non-contact easy-to-use and highly accurate temperature solution is being used at entry points of offices, warehouses, hospitals, schools and recreational facilities. Given the product's ability to complete, accurate temperature screenings of scale, the VIRALERT 3 is playing a role in reopening key facilities around the world. Creaform, a leader in 3D measurement technologies released the latest solution in their MetraSCAN 3D line. The MetraSCAN Black is the fastest and most accurate 3D scanner in the world with four times the speed and resolution of its predecessor. The MetraSCAN Black can withstand harsh production environments and is utilized in the most complex quality control and quality assurance applications. This incredibly versatile instrument can be used to scan various part sizes and service finishes in real-time all with the same device. And additionally, MOCON, a leading global provider of food package testing Instruments released their latest version of the Dansensor CheckPoint. This new portable head space gas analyzer provides quality control managers a more precise, faster and more stable solution for measuring gases in specific food applications using Modified Atmosphere Packaging or MAP. MAPs are used to extend the shelf life for packaged foods and pharmaceutical products requiring specialized packaging. Congratulations to the Land, Creaform and MOCON teams on these impressive new product developments. Now shifting to acquisitions. The overall M&A market remains relatively quiet given the high levels of uncertainty around the coronavirus and its impact on the economy. That being said, our M&A teams remain very active and we are managing several opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position and the ability to deploy meaningful amounts of capital on acquisitions. Our preference remains deploying that capital on strategic acquisitions that provide us the ability to add high quality companies to our portfolio and drive excellent returns for our shareholders. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. High levels of uncertainty remain given the continuing spread of the coronavirus, especially throughout parts of the U.S. While visibility has improved from this point last quarter, it is still limited as customers remain cautious. As a result, we will not be providing guidance for the third quarter or the full year. We will issue guidance as conditions stabilize and visibility improves. However, I did want to provide some high level comments around the third quarter and the balance of the year given what we know now. First, we expect to see sequential improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarters with commercial aerospace being the only business not expected to see sequential improvements. Second, we still expect very strong decremental margins at approximately 30% in the third quarter. And lastly, we now expect full year decremental margins in the 25% range versus our previous estimate of 25% to 30% decrementals. In summary, AMETEK managed well through what was an extraordinarily challenging environment during the second quarter. The strength of the AMETEK growth model was evident in our second quarter performance and we will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through this dynamic market conditions. We are taking responsible cost actions and continuing to invest in our businesses to ensure they are poised to generate strong growth coming out of the downturn. We also have a robust balance sheet and liquidity position to allow us to capitalize on what we believe will be an opportunistic period for acquisitions. Finally, we're confident that AMETEK will emerge from these challenges a stronger organization, given the growth profiles of our differentiated businesses, the company's financial strength, and most importantly, the impressive level of talent within our world-class workforce. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'd be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I'd like to echo Dave's comments on the outstanding efforts of our employees around the world. They continue to deliver exceptional performance during these challenging times. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were down $1.7 million compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.5%, down from 20.4% in the same period last year. The lower rate in the quarter was due to tax planning initiatives. For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was 19.6% versus 18.3% in last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $10 million. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million, down from our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $61 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, which includes after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate high levels of cash. Operating cash flow in the quarter was excellent at $315 million, up 20% over last year's comparable quarter. Free cash flow was also outstanding at $305 million, up 36% over the same period last year, and free cash flow conversion was superb at 183% of net income. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.87 billion, up modestly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $383 million from the end of the first quarter as we repaid a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.13 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.1 times as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This ratio was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times at quarter end. And both our gross and net debt to EBITDA ratios improved by 0.1 turns in the quarter. AMETEK remains well positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.1 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives. This includes over $950 million in available revolver capacity. As we highlighted on our last call, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023. To conclude, our ability to deliver solid results with outstanding cash generation despite these unprecedented challenges is a testament to the strength of our businesses and the dedication of our world-class workforce. The AMETEK growth model and our financial strength firmly position us to manage this economic environment and invest in future growth to deliver long-term success. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, could we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions. First, Dave, can you talk about what you saw from an organic order standpoint in the quarter and maybe provide some color on kind of what the monthly year-over-year cadence may have looked like from April into July?\nDave Zapico: Right. Our overall orders were down negative 22% and organic was down about the same, so really aligned with our sales. Both of our groups were down and really followed sales. And we ended up with a book-to-bill of about 0.99. And for orders, the April was a low point in the quarter. It grew nicely in May and then again in June. So it followed the similar trend for sales.\nMatt Summerville: And then can you talk about your expectation for second half decrementals? You indicated in Q3 may be expecting something a little worse than what you had in Q2. So maybe what's driving that? And then maybe put that in the context of the sustainability you see for the record EMG margin performance you generated in the quarter? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. The first point is the -- the second point -- I'll answer your second question first. The EMG margins were exceptional and they were driven by strong operating performance. We had positive mix in our defense businesses and we also had the divestiture of Reading Alloys that contributed 50 basis points at the EMG level. So EMG had a great quarter. And the majority of that margin expansion was driven by excellent operating capability. In terms of the decrementals, I mean, we had good decrementals in both parts of the business. We had 16% decrementals in EMG and 31% in EIG, and those are really good. And in terms of the guidance of 30% decrementals for Q3, we're adding back some cost and we're really preparing for a larger fourth quarter. So -- and still for the full year, we increased our decrementals from 30% to 25%. So that's what we're doing. We're managing the business looking at -- focused on cash, focused on managing the decrementals and focused on driving key growth opportunities. And we're doing an excellent job of managing the decrementals and really kept our net income, our cash EPS down at the same level of our sales drop, which is pretty amazing when you consider the profitability level of the company. So we're pretty pleased with that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi guys, good morning. Dave, could you talk with -- I know you mentioned the structural versus cyclical costs, but could you give a little bit more color on the structural cost savings that you're doing? Is it widespread across the verticals or is it focused specific on the more challenged ones like aerospace?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I would say the structural costs are more focused on the more challenged markets. And they're resizing those businesses to the new demand level that we have. Those businesses are profitable. They will remain profitable on the way down. And the way we're looking at it as the businesses started to grow from the bottom will be very profitable on the way up. So there is a quick change in revenue and the team have done an excellent job of adjusting to the new demand level. Also there was an element of those structural savings that are pulled forward from projects in our strategic plan. So we look forward out every three years and if we get a time like this, we pull forward some projects that are some efficiency, some plant consolidations, but mainly the structural -- while across the board, they were mainly targeted at the commercial aerospace and oil and gas business.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. And then just turning to the M&A given you know obviously it's still challenged there. But could you give us a little color on your pipeline in terms of size? Have you pivoted to specific end market vertical? And I guess even just comfort level, just given the uncertainty relative to the size of potential deals like you're likely looking at?\nDave Zapico: Great question. I mean, as you know Alison, M&As remains our first priority. And we feel there is going to be a substantial opportunity for us as we get through this crisis because there's going to be pent-up demand on deals. And we have the balance sheet and the cash flow generating capability to execute on the opportunity. And while the broader deal activity is due right now, we're very active in pipeline development. And we actually have a couple of deals we're looking at right now. So we're actually in diligence. And those are deals that have been working to our pipeline. There are larger deals and there are smaller deals. So I'm quite optimistic on the pipeline. But you still have the situation where to get to the end of a deal buyers and sellers have to agree on new pricing expectations based on the cash flow visibility and that impacts the evaluation process. And we're adjusting our process because we have the inability to perform the face-to-face diligence that we used to take for granted. And we still need to have some of that to feel comfortable in what we're buying. So we still think it's going to be late 2020 before the market returns to new -- to some kind of normal, but we are active on some properties right now. So I'm pretty pleased with how hard the team is driving the pipeline, and there is good candidates in our pipeline.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning. Dave, can you just remind us with all of the structural and temporary cost elements coming in, and I know you're still kind of leaving it open on the fourth quarter based on demand, how should we all in think about incremental margins for next year because obviously there's a lot of torque in the business, gross margins are high, so volume recovery would feel pretty good. But if I had to crosscheck that against maybe some of the temporary costs that come out, still fair to say that incrementals can start with the three next year or should we think about that differently or maybe more specifically knowing what we know about the temporary side?\nDave Zapico: Right. That's a great question. And I don't think there's any doubt that incrementals can start with the three. If you look at past downturns, AMETEK's really driven margin expansion as we come out of the downturns. And the temporary costs we're going to put back in as we progress throughout the year, but that's not stopping us from putting up positive incrementals. So I think largely, you're going to end up with contribution margins in 2021 in that kind of range, and I'm optimistic about that. Because the other thing you have to factor in is our pricing. Our pricing was very strong in the quarter and it's holding up well and we're very pleased with it.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then kind of a two-part second question. First, anything on July, I think Matt Summerville asked about it, but I don't know if there is anything specific? And maybe talk around the role of backlog in some of the momentum? Are you feeling like you're living hand to mouth in most of the businesses or was backlog maybe kind of distorting 2Q where there is still some longer cycle businesses that need to run off?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. No, our backlog is pretty flat at $1.7 billion. And as you know, we went through our guidance. But what you and what Matt were asking is a sense of where the business is going forward, and we can give you that. I mean, if you start with Q2, our sales, April was the worst and improved in May and further improvement in June. And if you look at that improvement trend and you look at July, which is supportive of it, we think that we'll be down roughly 50% in the third quarter. But that's an estimate based on what we know and there are many uncertainties. But that's kind of what we're tracking to right now. And it kind of...\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Understood.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Okay.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, Dave. I'll get back in queue.\nDave Zapico: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. So you mentioned research. I'm just curious kind of how you research end markets performed. Can't imagine the stay at home, work from home trend is really helpful there. So just curious what you're seeing there, because I know that's more of an EIG kind of exposure?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I think the -- I'll break the research market into a couple of different areas. In the material science area of research, both university and corporate R&D, it was weak. Those projects have been pushed to the right. But in the life sciences area, the market is holding up very well. And it was shown by our Gatan business, the business that we acquired last year. They had performed very well, slightly ahead of our expectations and actually had flat revenue year-over-year in the second quarter with our top-line well and that was driven by the life sciences market. And Gatan products have been influential in the fight against COVID. In fact, researchers at the University of Texas used Gatan K3 camera. They were the first people to structurally image the spike protein on the coronavirus. So that's driven a lot of excitement in demand around the demand tools. In fact, Gatan K3 was the first person to structure the coronavirus. The next two people that did use the K2, which is slower. And the speed of the cameras, the K3 is faster, allowed the researchers to get done quicker. So good demand drivers in that business. And it really points to again our research market. There are some areas that are doing very well, some areas that aren't, and in certain parts of the world, those research institutions have not really opened up, they're still close. So we're hanging in there, but it's a complex story.\nNigel Coe: Okay. So on balance, doesn't feel like it's any worse than the average. And then maybe just a little bit context on the geo markets. If you could give us how U.S., Europe, China, etc. are performing versus -- and then just on the export exposure, has that changed materially over the last several years? And I'm just curious how the U.S. dollar weakness maybe benefits you going forward?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. As you know, we're naturally hedged at the top-line and the bottom line based on currency. So the currency swing doesn't really impact our profitability. But when the dollar weakens, we do get more competitive. So it's something that we're looking at. So it's a good thing for us because we export over $1 billion. And in terms of the geographical story line, we really have broad-based weakness, and Europe and the U.S. were most challenged. Europe was down 29% on broad weakness and it also had a difficult comp because there was some Middle East project business for our oil and gas business. U.S. was down about 20%, but it was pretty broad-based. And Asia was the best of the markets that was down mid-teens and had notable strength in Asia in our automation business. China improved for us. China was actually up 3%. So positive rebound in China driven by our automation & CAMECA business. So that's the story; broad-based weakness and Asia was the best driven by China.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, I did notice that you guys put free cash flow in your release for the first time. So we really do appreciate that.\nDave Zapico: I'll let Kevin know that. Kevin has got a smile on his face.\nDeane Dray: I'm sure he does, because I've pestered him about that for quite a while, but we really do appreciate it. But now I feel obligated to ask a free cash flow question. So here it is. Did you benefit at all from the timing of tax payments? We've seen other companies that have had upside on free cash flow. So was that a factor?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Not a huge factor, Deane. It was probably about $18 million or so. So that $183 million would still be a pretty strong number, probably in the mid-160s to 170 kind of a place.\nDeane Dray: Good. And I really like how you segment the business in those three buckets just to kind of give us the color real-time as to the COVID impact. And last quarter, I'm pretty sure you included defense in the better bucket, better performing and it got called out as a positive mix this quarter as well for EMG. Can you comment on defense? And should it be in that bucket?\nDave Zapico: Defense was in the good markets in both last quarter and this quarter. So defense -- the buckets haven't changed and defense and medical were positive in Q2 and they were also positive in Q3. And as you recall, our defense business is about 5% of the company, and it's doing extremely well. It was up low-double-digits in the quarter. So while the commercial market was challenged, the defense market was strong.\nDeane Dray: Great. And then on Gatan, really like that -- the update there and especially on the imaging of the spore. When is the next generation due to be release? Will that be the K4?\nDave Zapico: It is. There is a K3 Plus and the K4, we're working on them both. And we haven't announced when the next one will come to market.\nDeane Dray: Terrific. All right, last question on capex. So you had cut $25 million out just for cash preservation. When might that come back? And just share with us a bit of your decision making as to what would you trim and why? And when you bring, what types of projects do you bring back on? Thanks.\nBill Burke: Yeah. The important point for us is our RD&E spending is roughly flat with 2019. So we thought that was going to be up coming into the year and we trim that back to flat, but we're really investing in RD&E. And the types of things we've delayed are expansions in regions of the world where we're trying to put extra capacity in place in a new region of the world that we're putting some capacity. And so those kind of projects got delayed. Quite honestly, we have decentralized the entrepreneurial team. And they understand the situation, so they make natural decisions and we really don't have to push that number. That's what comes up to us. That's where our business leaders want to spend. And I can see as we get later in the year, start evaluating, turning on some of those expansion projects we have in the various geographies of the world that we put on hold, but it's very difficult to complete those.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks, and good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Rob. Congratulations on the book.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you so much. It's kind. So I just have two questions on the temporary side, if I can. I think last quarter you talked about delays and difficulties in getting the customer sites or whatever, pushing out a little bit of revenue. Is that still ongoing? And does that come back at any point? That's the first.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. That certainly was with us throughout all of Q2. And it's still a bit of an issue, especially now traveling in the U.S. And really when it comes to, you can travel, but you're quarantined. And that was a big issue in China. Now that's abated, but that's a spotty issue around the world. And it was a big factor in Q2, it will be a diminishing factor in Q3.\nRob Wertheimer: And then does that -- a few points of revenue that kind of come back to you in 4Q or whatever or is there risk that it cancels or is it too small?\nDave Zapico: No, no. That's -- that will come back. And they've been rescheduled and pushing things out, but it will definitely come back.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. And then on the cost side, if I may. Can you kind of roll the temporary costs indefinitely? The way you described it, it's obvious that commercial aero maybe in trouble, oil and gas for a bit. And so maybe more permanent restructuring is appropriate there. But for the other markets that are just depressed during COVID and we don't know when it comes back, can you roll that indefinitely or does that come a point where costs have to sort of come back in the system?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. That's a good question, Rob. And when we did a restructuring early on, you'll recall. And we think we got the balance correct, but -- and we'll bring back those temporary costs. But if it gets to the point where there is diminished long-term viewpoint on revenue, then it doesn't -- we can't run with the temporary cost forever. So it's a -- I view those temporary costs as coming out -- coming back during the course of the year. And if demand doesn't come back, then we may have to do something extra on the cost side. But we're certainly not looking at that as a long-term situation.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Dave, you mentioned some different adaptations around delivering, administering some of your aftermarket services operation. I'm wondering if you're revealing any -- or any businesses coming up with delivery models that might actually be productivity levers and kind of remain post-COVID?\nDave Zapico: That's really the case. The accelerated adoption of digital capabilities is really opening our eyes. And it's obviously in the digital marketing area and the way we interact with our customers. The one thing I'd point to is in the -- we have complex systems that are installed and calibrated and they need commissions and we have some service teams that are using augmented reality to remotely service and install our products and really interesting tools right now. So I think some of those will be long lasting. And we're certainly adapting our business and learning as we move through this pandemic.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the third quarter outlook for kind of everything getting a little better versus other than commercial aerospace, any -- some areas maybe you could call out where you're seeing the sharpest kind of rebounds, in particular, anything just getting back to normal?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Our automation business is kind of let us back. That's doing well. Our oil and gas business is going to recover, but that's because of a lack of a comp as much as anything. So those two businesses are ones that will recover. And I think our defense business will be strong. And the other thing we see is in the medical space. We saw really good demand on the COVID-related products, like COVID testing and COVID breathing apparatus, but we saw the elective surgeries tail off. In the second half of the year what our medtech customers are telling us is the elective surgeries are going to rebound. So that's the kind of things I'd point you to.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin. So I wanted to understand a little bit more on the cost side where you talked about third quarter your cost reductions are going to be $65 million. If my calculations here are right that you were a little bit below what the annualized number would be for structural in the quarter and that should pick up in the second half of the year, which would suggest a pretty significant reduction in your temporary in the third quarter, yet you're not providing full year EPS guidance. So I guess, I'm trying to maybe connect those dots there, if you're dropping down on the temporary, why don't you feel more comfortable with giving guidance?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. There are too many variables and uncertainties to give guidance with our difficult precision. And I do appreciate your question and I understand what you're asking for that information in normal times. We'd give you that type of information, but these aren't normal times. And we withdrew our guidance and we just don't feel comfortable putting it back in place yet because of COVID and the lack of visibility and with the typical precision that we have.\nScott Graham: Can I maybe take a stab at one of them. Would it be that you're unable to project what your second half mix will be? Is that part of it?\nDave Zapico: No, I don't think that's -- I mean, I was pleased with the mix hold up, the pricing hold up. That's -- that isn't a concern. It's really you if you think about it, we're in a pandemic. And we don't -- we can have hotspots to show up in places and we're constantly managing things. So there is a lot of uncertainty now, and we just don't feel we can give guidance with a typical precision.\nScott Graham: Understood. Thank you. A couple of others, if you could. Typically you give that by business unit stuff, maybe you can just kind of call out specifically what you saw in the quarter in automation, power, research specifically? And maybe if you could split for us commercial aerospace, OE versus aftermarket?\nBill Burke: Right. I'll take you through the market segment commentary because that covers a lot of ground, and I think we'll be able to answer your questions there. Our process business, overall sales were down high-teens in the quarter. And we had the contributions from Gatan, offset by organic sales declines in line with AMETEK's organic sales decline. And we talked about widespread travel restrictions. And in addition to project push outs and delays in our ability to provide service, so that impacted process significantly. The largest weakness in process was in oil and gas business. Our medical businesses performed well in the quarter, as did our Zygo business. Zygo is seeing solid growth driven by some semiconductor fabrication work and Extreme UV, EUV. And while the end markets remain challenged and visibility is limited, we do expect to see sequential improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarters across our process businesses, including oil and gas. In aerospace, I think we've talked about that. We were -- the defense business was up low-double-digits. The commercial business was down in the high-40s. In the commercial business, the aftermarket was a little worse and the OE was a little better. We expect our defense businesses to stay strong in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And the commercial aerospace business, it's bouncing around bottom and we may have some shifts between aftermarket and OE, but we're not calling that one out as improving. We may be conservative on that, but that's where we are. In our power and industrial business, they were down in high-20 range. A lot of similar dynamics to our process business. Demand impacted by the global shutdowns and travel restrictions. And we're looking to -- the orders in our power business were stronger. And we're looking to second half where we expect conditions to improve modestly with sequential growth in both our power and industrial businesses. And finally, our automation and engineered solution businesses, they were down mid-teens on a percentage basis. And we're seeing automation trends improve across Asia, within China. And healthcare is the other big driver for our automation business. So we're seeing good sequential improvements there. And we expect that to continue in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.\nIvana Delevska: Good morning, guys. So I just wanted to ask about the structural cost opportunities as we get into next year. I know there was some volume-related benefits that you were originally expecting to get this year that may get pushed out the next year. So could you just give us a sense of like, how do you see next year shaping up? And what will be the different buckets?\nDave Zapico: Sure. We haven't done a lot of thinking about next year at this point. But the one thing that we do know, we'll probably have about $50 million -- $45 million or $50 million flowing over into next year from the structural reductions that we did in 2020. So we'll have a good head start on whatever cost reduction plans that we put together. And we'll couple that with the traditional material cost to us and the other projects that we'll put together. And we typically have a pretty healthy project list, and we decide on that list during our budgeting process. So haven't really done much planning, but we have a good sense -- a good head start with the structural flow over from the things we've done in 2020.\nIvana Delevska: And how much was the volume like sourcing expected to help this year that didn't materialize because of the environment?\nDave Zapico: Yeah, sourcing was a big driver, and I'm just going from memory now and Kevin can -- you can check this with Kevin before that. But we probably lost about $10 million or $20 million of sourcing savings because the volume isn't there and we had to make that up by the other structural savings.\nIvana Delevska: Perfect. And just one more question in terms of synergy realization. Could you compare next year to this year in terms of how much synergies you expect from the different deals and the timing?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. The way I can answer that is we're on track with all of our deals. I mentioned, Gatan, that's the biggest deal that we did last year, and we just did a review of that business. And we're actually slightly ahead of our acquisition model. So when we combine that business with our EDAX business, it's another business within our portfolio, and they're in the same market. So that combination is driving this synergy and they have the same customer base. And all of our acquisitions are progressing and we're certainly focused on the synergy. And some of the top-line may not be there, but we're focused on the synergy. It's pretty hard to tell you right now in 2021 what that's going to be. We'll typically tell you that in the beginning of 2021 when we go through everything and understand at a granular level what actually is going to happen and what we're going to do.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi guys. Good morning. I'm going to try first question. So one of sort of companies that I covered today sort of took a stab at when they thought revenues were going to turn flat year-over-year. Would you guys care to guess if and when that happens?\nDave Zapico: I'm not going to guess at that.\nAndrew Obin: Okay. I figured that much. You guys highlighted automation doing well. Could you talk -- are you seeing any of your customers sort of moving their supply chains around the globe? And what are the sources outside of China of automation doing well?\nDave Zapico: Yeah, that's a good question. And we are seeing that, Andrew. So supply chains are regionalizing. So there was a point of time where there was some overdependence on China. And I think a lot of companies are reconfiguring their supply chains and there's some reshoring activities going on. And that's going to help us because our process businesses help businesses manufacture things efficiently and at lower cost, and it's happening. The seeds of that are just beginning now, but that's going to be a good long-term driver for us.\nAndrew Obin: And what industries do you care -- what industries are you seeing reshoring in, particularly in North America?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. It's just the beginnings. But there's definitely plans in place for a lot of companies to make their supply chains more durable. And we're seeing volume intake -- potential volume upticks in places like the U.S. and Europe for reshoring activities. But this is really on the early edges of it. And -- but it's fundamentally people want regionalized supply chains and want to reduce their dependence on parts of the world.\nAndrew Obin: And then on M&A front, you sort of highlighted that you're engaged in some due diligence, some of these are smaller deals. So how do you look at your sort of firepower in terms of how much can you spend on M&A over the next couple of years? And how big a deal can you guys get to?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, I look at it like we certainly can look at our free cash flow, look at our operating cash flow. It's $1 billion plus year type thing. And then we have a current liquidity of about $2.1 billion. So very clearly, our balance sheet is strong. I think Bill mentioned that it delevered during the second quarter. So in a pandemic when our top-line was down 22%, our balance sheet delevers, that's a testament. I don't know if you want to comment on that, Bill?\nBill Burke: Well, I think we certainly -- Dave, you mentioned the $2 billion, we could do more than that and still remain below our covenants. But as we've always said this is not a capital constraint strategy, this is more about finding the right businesses that will move the portfolio in the right direction and drive the returns that we're looking for. But the strength of the balance sheet can certainly support several -- couple of billion dollars worth of deals.\nAndrew Obin: And more appetite for larger deals going forward?\nDave Zapico: We're looking at some larger deals. Gatan, we spent close to $1 billion on. And we have some businesses that are in our pipeline right now that are of that size.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys. Forgive me if I missed that. Did you -- can you comment on the price versus cost in the quarter?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. You didn't miss it. We talked about it, but we didn't give the numbers. And I'm very pleased to see our pricing held up well. Q2 was similar to Q1. We achieved about a point and a half of price across the entire business. And total inflation and the impact of tariffs was a little less than 1%. So had a good positive spread added to margins and that drove some of the margin performance in the quarter.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And David, you've been around the blocks a few times, given you've had a few more months to kind of digest what's going on in the situation with aerospace, last quarter everything was so fresh. Do you have any updated commentary about what you're seeing, what you're hearing from customers and how you expect that market to go over the next couple of years?\nDave Zapico: It's going to take several years to get passengers back to the same volume in 2019. There's no doubt about that. And what -- the base -- our base model for aerospace assumes that there's a medical solution to the virus, whether it's a vaccine or therapeutic, and people have to be comfortable flying again, and that's going to take some time. But we're balancing our aerospace, and our military business is doing extremely well. And we're very pleased with our portfolio. It's a high quality set of businesses and our strategy is to focus on a diverse set of markets. So we think we're well positioned with our leadership positions to recover with the market and recover profitably. But that's one market that we're going to have to -- it's going to depend on the government funding, it's going to depend on capacity decisions of many airlines, it's going to depend on the confidence of the flying public. So there's still some uncertainty associated with that. So we just manage what we know. And we can resize the business. I was running our aerospace business back on 9/11. So been through a similar type of hit. And if you look at what our aerospace has done since then, we resize it and it's been a tremendous contributor to AMETEK over the time, and we're doing the same thing right now. So we have a great team in aerospace and leadership positions and many areas, excellent positions with wide boats. And we're controlling what we can control right now, but it's certainly going to be an extended recovery.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with R.W. Baird.\nRichard Eastman: Yes. Thanks for the questions. Dave, just to expand on your last answer there, could you just recalibrate us on maybe the percentage of the business in AMETEK that is aerospace? And also how the four businesses maybe will perform or the four segments will perform for '20?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, the aerospace presence is 15% of sales. And that's a -- 5% of that 15% is in the military market. And 10% of that 15% is in the commercial market. And that commercial market includes our OE market, it includes our business gen market, it includes our third-party aftermarket. And that's the business that we're saying is a small part of our company, about 10%. But we're saying that we're not seeing as clearly a recovery path during the second half of the year. I think we got a little better in Q2. So we call that at maybe 45% for the balance of the year. But it's pretty difficult to get too granular on that market right now, because many variables that you don't control are happening and we're just managing what we can control. In terms of the process business, we're saying we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4, and that includes our oil and gas business. In terms of power and industrial, we're saying we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4. And in terms of our automation and engineered solutions, we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4. So we think that sequential improvement that we're seeing will continue as the economy gets back to normal.\nRichard Eastman: Okay, OK. And then just one question on the gross margin. Bill, the gross margin declined maybe 110 basis points, I guess, year-over-year. Could you just break that out a little bit? It sounds like you had a positive contribution from price, maybe only 30 basis points or something. But could you just give us a little bit of a walk up there or walk down on the 110?\nBill Burke: Yeah. I think the -- I think you've got the positive there in terms of price versus cost. But what you're really dealing with is just the reduction in the sales levels. You're just getting the decremental margins on the fixed costs. So I don't think there's anything more interesting.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. All right. And mix here -- was mix much of an issue here between EMG? Again, I guess you favor EMG a little bit with less of a decline versus EIG? So mix was negative there.\nDave Zapico: I think the military market and the healthcare market held up well for EMG. And in EIG, we have good part of commercial aerospace, and you also have the oil and gas business.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey guys. Good morning. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I spoke with you last quarter from an organic standpoint was that EIG probably does a little bit better than EMG. So curious as to what kind of shifted during the quarter from a local market standpoint that would have kind of flipped that around?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. Everybody here is shaking their heads. We didn't signal EIG would be better than EMG.\nJoseph Giordano: Okay.\nDave Zapico: We talked about the automation business getting stronger. We talked about the military business and then commercial aerospace. Commercial aerospace was going to be weak and oil and gas is going to be weak, and those are predominantly in EIG. So it kind of paid out like we thought.\nJoseph Giordano: Okay. And then on R&D side you talked about some of the advancements in some of your businesses made during the quarter, new launches. Can you just kind of talk to us about how R&D is so critical to what you guys do? And how are you guys doing it in this environment with social distancing and this? And what has had to change in order to allow R&D to progress at this stage?\nDave Zapico: Yeah, it's a great question. Great question, Joe. I've been pleasantly surprised at the quality and effectiveness, and we're getting the work done. But for R&D, it's not ideal. I mean, we have to have technicians interact with engineers and they have to find a way to get together and there is a certain spontaneity and productivity that comes with people getting together. So we're still learning. But we're using the tools and doing things safely and we're making good progress. But it's certainly an issue that we specifically have worked on and it holds us back certainly. But the digital tools are helping mitigate the problems.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Despite an economic environment as challenging and uncertain as any we have ever faced in AMETEK, our businesses stood strong in the second quarter delivering outstanding operating performance that exceeded expectations. I wanted to start by thanking all AMETEK colleagues who are working tirelessly through this pandemic to provide our customers with great products and exceptional service. As our result of test, our employees are doing an amazing job. The safety of our employees remains our highest priority. We continue to implement our pandemic response plan, which provides a pandemic for our businesses to manage our facilities and workforce during this pandemic. We are following CDC and local health and safety guidelines and are adjusting and enhancing our safety protocols as required to ensure safe working environment for our employees. Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Sales in the second quarter were $1.01 billion, down 22% versus the second quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 22% with recent acquisitions contributing 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a three point headwind and foreign currency a one point headwind. Despite substantial demand weakness, as our business delivered exceptional operating performance. Operating income in the quarter was $227 million and operating margins were very strong at 22.4%, while decremental margins were an impressive 25%. EBITDA in the second quarter was $289.7 million and EBITDA margins were a record 28.6%, up 160 basis points over last year's second quarter. This drove earnings of $0.84 per diluted share, down 20% versus the second quarter of 2019. Our cash generation in the quarter was superb. Operating cash flow was up 28% year-over-year to $315 million. Free cash flow conversion was also exceptionally strong at 183% of net income. Our businesses are focused on controlling what they can. The operating performance in the quarter is validation of the strength and flexibility of our asset-light business model, the quality of our niche businesses, and most importantly, the talent and commitment of our workforce. Next, I will provide some additional details at the operating group level. Second quarter sales for Electronic Instruments Group were $647.9 million, down 21% from the same period last year. Organic sales were down 26% with the acquisition of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing 5%. Despite the impact COVID-19 had on sales, our EIG businesses delivered excellent operating performance. EIG's operating income in the second quarter was $159.6 million and operating margins remained strong at 24.6%. The Electromechanical Group also delivered excellent operating results, driven by better than expected organic sales and their operational excellence initiatives, which contributed to exceptional margin expansion. EMG's sales were $364 million, down 22% versus the prior year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 16% with the recent acquisition of PDT adding 3%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys was an eight point headwind and foreign currency was a one point headwind. EMG's margin expansion was outstanding in the quarter. While operating income decreased to $84.3 million, operating margins expanded an impressive 170 basis points to a record 23.2% driven by our proactive operational excellence initiatives. Truly exceptional work by our teams. Now let me provide some color on the different end market dynamics we are experiencing within our business. AMETEK serves a diverse set of end markets. And across these end markets, we are seeing very different levels of demand and COVID-19 impacts. So as I did last quarter, I'll group our businesses into three buckets based on the levels of demand we are experiencing and provide some commentary on each. I'll start with the most challenging markets, commercial aerospace and oil and gas, which combined account for approximately 15% of AMETEK's sales. The weakness in commercial aerospace was largely as expected and driven by the impacts of COVID-19 on both our commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses. We expect these businesses to remain challenged for the balance of the year. Along with the impact from COVID-19, weakness in our oil and gas business was a result of difficult prior year comparison given several large project shipments last year. As a result, we expect solid sequential improvements in this business during the third quarter and fourth quarters. Combined, sales for aerospace, commercial aerospace and oil and gas were down approximately 45% in the quarter. Excluding these two markets, AMETEK's sales were down mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter. Next, our strongest markets, defense and medical. Combining these markets account for over 20% of our sales and we have been experiencing solid internal growth, while also strategically expanding our portfolio in these areas through acquisitions. In the second quarter, sales were up low-single-digits for these businesses and we expect this strength to continue in the third quarter and fourth quarters. And for the balance of our markets, which include power, industrial, automation, metals, food and beverage and research, we were seeing demand levels somewhere in between those other two streams. We expect to see sequential improvements through the balance of the year for these businesses also. To offset these COVID-19-driven demand challenges, we remain focused on actively managing our cost structure through a mix of structural and temporary cost actions. Our executive office meets regularly with each of our businesses to review current market conditions, their demand outlook for the coming months and their operational plans. It is critical that each of our businesses develop an operating plan customized for their business, and that this operating planning be adjusted if conditions change. This flexibility is key in our asset-light operating model where costs can be quickly variablized. This approach allows us to best align our cost structure with demand levels we are experiencing by market and by business. We have the flexibility to expand cost savings initiatives or as demand continues -- demand conditions improve, we can add back costs as required. In the second quarter, we generated $85 million in total cost savings with $35 million in structural savings and $50 million in temporary cost savings. This level of savings was above our initial estimate of $80 million total cost savings in the quarter. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect approximately $65 million in total cost savings with $35 million to $40 million in structural and $25 million to $30 million in temporary savings. And for the full year, we now expect structural savings of $135 million and will flex our temporary cost savings either up or down based on volume levels in the fourth quarter. The spread of the coronavirus has oddly forced companies to adapt and adjust how they do business. Work from home requirements and travel restrictions have changed our company's interact and engage with customers. Our businesses have been proactive in developing and utilize digital capabilities to help them stay engaged with our customers. Our sales and engineering teams are working side-by-side with our customers through digital channels to cultivate and build relationships. These initiatives have included virtual events through newly implemented digital platforms to provide product demos, webinars and collaborative business meetings. Finally, some of our teams are finding innovative ways to help provide aftermarket services for our customers through interactive technologies. I commend our teams for quickly adapting to the new reality and for embracing these new ways of doing business. We remain committed to investing in additional technologies to support our customer experience. Despite the global demand challenges, AMETEK continues to invest meaningfully in new product development initiatives. We are seeing great success from these investments as our businesses are introducing many new innovative solutions to help solve our customers' greatest challenges. Our vitality index, which measures the amount of sales generated from new products introduced during the last three years was very strong at 26%. And here are just a few of the recent examples of new product introductions. AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of non-contact temperature measurement solutions saw a robust demand in the second quarter for their new VIRALERT 3. This newly developed non-contact temperature measurement solution is used to rapidly detect elevated skin temperature, while allowing users to adhere to social distancing requirements. The safe, non-contact easy-to-use and highly accurate temperature solution is being used at entry points of offices, warehouses, hospitals, schools and recreational facilities. Given the product's ability to complete, accurate temperature screenings of scale, the VIRALERT 3 is playing a role in reopening key facilities around the world. Creaform, a leader in 3D measurement technologies released the latest solution in their MetraSCAN 3D line. The MetraSCAN Black is the fastest and most accurate 3D scanner in the world with four times the speed and resolution of its predecessor. The MetraSCAN Black can withstand harsh production environments and is utilized in the most complex quality control and quality assurance applications. This incredibly versatile instrument can be used to scan various part sizes and service finishes in real-time all with the same device. And additionally, MOCON, a leading global provider of food package testing Instruments released their latest version of the Dansensor CheckPoint. This new portable head space gas analyzer provides quality control managers a more precise, faster and more stable solution for measuring gases in specific food applications using Modified Atmosphere Packaging or MAP. MAPs are used to extend the shelf life for packaged foods and pharmaceutical products requiring specialized packaging. Congratulations to the Land, Creaform and MOCON teams on these impressive new product developments. Now shifting to acquisitions. The overall M&A market remains relatively quiet given the high levels of uncertainty around the coronavirus and its impact on the economy. That being said, our M&A teams remain very active and we are managing several opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position and the ability to deploy meaningful amounts of capital on acquisitions. Our preference remains deploying that capital on strategic acquisitions that provide us the ability to add high quality companies to our portfolio and drive excellent returns for our shareholders. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. High levels of uncertainty remain given the continuing spread of the coronavirus, especially throughout parts of the U.S. While visibility has improved from this point last quarter, it is still limited as customers remain cautious. As a result, we will not be providing guidance for the third quarter or the full year. We will issue guidance as conditions stabilize and visibility improves. However, I did want to provide some high level comments around the third quarter and the balance of the year given what we know now. First, we expect to see sequential improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarters with commercial aerospace being the only business not expected to see sequential improvements. Second, we still expect very strong decremental margins at approximately 30% in the third quarter. And lastly, we now expect full year decremental margins in the 25% range versus our previous estimate of 25% to 30% decrementals. In summary, AMETEK managed well through what was an extraordinarily challenging environment during the second quarter. The strength of the AMETEK growth model was evident in our second quarter performance and we will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through this dynamic market conditions. We are taking responsible cost actions and continuing to invest in our businesses to ensure they are poised to generate strong growth coming out of the downturn. We also have a robust balance sheet and liquidity position to allow us to capitalize on what we believe will be an opportunistic period for acquisitions. Finally, we're confident that AMETEK will emerge from these challenges a stronger organization, given the growth profiles of our differentiated businesses, the company's financial strength, and most importantly, the impressive level of talent within our world-class workforce. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'd be glad to take your questions. Bill? Right. Our overall orders were down negative 22% and organic was down about the same, so really aligned with our sales. Both of our groups were down and really followed sales. And we ended up with a book-to-bill of about 0.99. And for orders, the April was a low point in the quarter. It grew nicely in May and then again in June. So it followed the similar trend for sales. Yeah. The first point is the -- the second point -- I'll answer your second question first. The EMG margins were exceptional and they were driven by strong operating performance. We had positive mix in our defense businesses and we also had the divestiture of Reading Alloys that contributed 50 basis points at the EMG level. So EMG had a great quarter. And the majority of that margin expansion was driven by excellent operating capability. In terms of the decrementals, I mean, we had good decrementals in both parts of the business. We had 16% decrementals in EMG and 31% in EIG, and those are really good. And in terms of the guidance of 30% decrementals for Q3, we're adding back some cost and we're really preparing for a larger fourth quarter. So -- and still for the full year, we increased our decrementals from 30% to 25%. So that's what we're doing. We're managing the business looking at -- focused on cash, focused on managing the decrementals and focused on driving key growth opportunities. And we're doing an excellent job of managing the decrementals and really kept our net income, our cash EPS down at the same level of our sales drop, which is pretty amazing when you consider the profitability level of the company. So we're pretty pleased with that. Yeah. I would say the structural costs are more focused on the more challenged markets. And they're resizing those businesses to the new demand level that we have. Those businesses are profitable. They will remain profitable on the way down. And the way we're looking at it as the businesses started to grow from the bottom will be very profitable on the way up. So there is a quick change in revenue and the team have done an excellent job of adjusting to the new demand level. Also there was an element of those structural savings that are pulled forward from projects in our strategic plan. So we look forward out every three years and if we get a time like this, we pull forward some projects that are some efficiency, some plant consolidations, but mainly the structural -- while across the board, they were mainly targeted at the commercial aerospace and oil and gas business. Great question. I mean, as you know Alison, M&As remains our first priority. And we feel there is going to be a substantial opportunity for us as we get through this crisis because there's going to be pent-up demand on deals. And we have the balance sheet and the cash flow generating capability to execute on the opportunity. And while the broader deal activity is due right now, we're very active in pipeline development. And we actually have a couple of deals we're looking at right now. So we're actually in diligence. And those are deals that have been working to our pipeline. There are larger deals and there are smaller deals. So I'm quite optimistic on the pipeline. But you still have the situation where to get to the end of a deal buyers and sellers have to agree on new pricing expectations based on the cash flow visibility and that impacts the evaluation process. And we're adjusting our process because we have the inability to perform the face-to-face diligence that we used to take for granted. And we still need to have some of that to feel comfortable in what we're buying. So we still think it's going to be late 2020 before the market returns to new -- to some kind of normal, but we are active on some properties right now. So I'm pretty pleased with how hard the team is driving the pipeline, and there is good candidates in our pipeline. Right. That's a great question. And I don't think there's any doubt that incrementals can start with the three. If you look at past downturns, AMETEK's really driven margin expansion as we come out of the downturns. And the temporary costs we're going to put back in as we progress throughout the year, but that's not stopping us from putting up positive incrementals. So I think largely, you're going to end up with contribution margins in 2021 in that kind of range, and I'm optimistic about that. Because the other thing you have to factor in is our pricing. Our pricing was very strong in the quarter and it's holding up well and we're very pleased with it. Yeah. No, our backlog is pretty flat at $1.7 billion. And as you know, we went through our guidance. But what you and what Matt were asking is a sense of where the business is going forward, and we can give you that. I mean, if you start with Q2, our sales, April was the worst and improved in May and further improvement in June. And if you look at that improvement trend and you look at July, which is supportive of it, we think that we'll be down roughly 50% in the third quarter. But that's an estimate based on what we know and there are many uncertainties. But that's kind of what we're tracking to right now. And it kind of... Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Josh. Yeah. I think the -- I'll break the research market into a couple of different areas. In the material science area of research, both university and corporate R&D, it was weak. Those projects have been pushed to the right. But in the life sciences area, the market is holding up very well. And it was shown by our Gatan business, the business that we acquired last year. They had performed very well, slightly ahead of our expectations and actually had flat revenue year-over-year in the second quarter with our top-line well and that was driven by the life sciences market. And Gatan products have been influential in the fight against COVID. In fact, researchers at the University of Texas used Gatan K3 camera. They were the first people to structurally image the spike protein on the coronavirus. So that's driven a lot of excitement in demand around the demand tools. In fact, Gatan K3 was the first person to structure the coronavirus. The next two people that did use the K2, which is slower. And the speed of the cameras, the K3 is faster, allowed the researchers to get done quicker. So good demand drivers in that business. And it really points to again our research market. There are some areas that are doing very well, some areas that aren't, and in certain parts of the world, those research institutions have not really opened up, they're still close. So we're hanging in there, but it's a complex story. Yeah. As you know, we're naturally hedged at the top-line and the bottom line based on currency. So the currency swing doesn't really impact our profitability. But when the dollar weakens, we do get more competitive. So it's something that we're looking at. So it's a good thing for us because we export over $1 billion. And in terms of the geographical story line, we really have broad-based weakness, and Europe and the U.S. were most challenged. Europe was down 29% on broad weakness and it also had a difficult comp because there was some Middle East project business for our oil and gas business. U.S. was down about 20%, but it was pretty broad-based. And Asia was the best of the markets that was down mid-teens and had notable strength in Asia in our automation business. China improved for us. China was actually up 3%. So positive rebound in China driven by our automation & CAMECA business. So that's the story; broad-based weakness and Asia was the best driven by China. I'll let Kevin know that. Kevin has got a smile on his face. Yeah. Not a huge factor, Deane. It was probably about $18 million or so. So that $183 million would still be a pretty strong number, probably in the mid-160s to 170 kind of a place. Defense was in the good markets in both last quarter and this quarter. So defense -- the buckets haven't changed and defense and medical were positive in Q2 and they were also positive in Q3. And as you recall, our defense business is about 5% of the company, and it's doing extremely well. It was up low-double-digits in the quarter. So while the commercial market was challenged, the defense market was strong. It is. There is a K3 Plus and the K4, we're working on them both. And we haven't announced when the next one will come to market. Good morning, Rob. Congratulations on the book. Yeah. That certainly was with us throughout all of Q2. And it's still a bit of an issue, especially now traveling in the U.S. And really when it comes to, you can travel, but you're quarantined. And that was a big issue in China. Now that's abated, but that's a spotty issue around the world. And it was a big factor in Q2, it will be a diminishing factor in Q3. No, no. That's -- that will come back. And they've been rescheduled and pushing things out, but it will definitely come back. Yeah. That's a good question, Rob. And when we did a restructuring early on, you'll recall. And we think we got the balance correct, but -- and we'll bring back those temporary costs. But if it gets to the point where there is diminished long-term viewpoint on revenue, then it doesn't -- we can't run with the temporary cost forever. So it's a -- I view those temporary costs as coming out -- coming back during the course of the year. And if demand doesn't come back, then we may have to do something extra on the cost side. But we're certainly not looking at that as a long-term situation. That's really the case. The accelerated adoption of digital capabilities is really opening our eyes. And it's obviously in the digital marketing area and the way we interact with our customers. The one thing I'd point to is in the -- we have complex systems that are installed and calibrated and they need commissions and we have some service teams that are using augmented reality to remotely service and install our products and really interesting tools right now. So I think some of those will be long lasting. And we're certainly adapting our business and learning as we move through this pandemic. Yeah. Our automation business is kind of let us back. That's doing well. Our oil and gas business is going to recover, but that's because of a lack of a comp as much as anything. So those two businesses are ones that will recover. And I think our defense business will be strong. And the other thing we see is in the medical space. We saw really good demand on the COVID-related products, like COVID testing and COVID breathing apparatus, but we saw the elective surgeries tail off. In the second half of the year what our medtech customers are telling us is the elective surgeries are going to rebound. So that's the kind of things I'd point you to. Yeah. There are too many variables and uncertainties to give guidance with our difficult precision. And I do appreciate your question and I understand what you're asking for that information in normal times. We'd give you that type of information, but these aren't normal times. And we withdrew our guidance and we just don't feel comfortable putting it back in place yet because of COVID and the lack of visibility and with the typical precision that we have. No, I don't think that's -- I mean, I was pleased with the mix hold up, the pricing hold up. That's -- that isn't a concern. It's really you if you think about it, we're in a pandemic. And we don't -- we can have hotspots to show up in places and we're constantly managing things. So there is a lot of uncertainty now, and we just don't feel we can give guidance with a typical precision. Sure. We haven't done a lot of thinking about next year at this point. But the one thing that we do know, we'll probably have about $50 million -- $45 million or $50 million flowing over into next year from the structural reductions that we did in 2020. So we'll have a good head start on whatever cost reduction plans that we put together. And we'll couple that with the traditional material cost to us and the other projects that we'll put together. And we typically have a pretty healthy project list, and we decide on that list during our budgeting process. So haven't really done much planning, but we have a good sense -- a good head start with the structural flow over from the things we've done in 2020. Yeah, sourcing was a big driver, and I'm just going from memory now and Kevin can -- you can check this with Kevin before that. But we probably lost about $10 million or $20 million of sourcing savings because the volume isn't there and we had to make that up by the other structural savings. Yeah. The way I can answer that is we're on track with all of our deals. I mentioned, Gatan, that's the biggest deal that we did last year, and we just did a review of that business. And we're actually slightly ahead of our acquisition model. So when we combine that business with our EDAX business, it's another business within our portfolio, and they're in the same market. So that combination is driving this synergy and they have the same customer base. And all of our acquisitions are progressing and we're certainly focused on the synergy. And some of the top-line may not be there, but we're focused on the synergy. It's pretty hard to tell you right now in 2021 what that's going to be. We'll typically tell you that in the beginning of 2021 when we go through everything and understand at a granular level what actually is going to happen and what we're going to do. I'm not going to guess at that. Yeah, that's a good question. And we are seeing that, Andrew. So supply chains are regionalizing. So there was a point of time where there was some overdependence on China. And I think a lot of companies are reconfiguring their supply chains and there's some reshoring activities going on. And that's going to help us because our process businesses help businesses manufacture things efficiently and at lower cost, and it's happening. The seeds of that are just beginning now, but that's going to be a good long-term driver for us. Yeah. It's just the beginnings. But there's definitely plans in place for a lot of companies to make their supply chains more durable. And we're seeing volume intake -- potential volume upticks in places like the U.S. and Europe for reshoring activities. But this is really on the early edges of it. And -- but it's fundamentally people want regionalized supply chains and want to reduce their dependence on parts of the world. Yeah. I mean, I look at it like we certainly can look at our free cash flow, look at our operating cash flow. It's $1 billion plus year type thing. And then we have a current liquidity of about $2.1 billion. So very clearly, our balance sheet is strong. I think Bill mentioned that it delevered during the second quarter. So in a pandemic when our top-line was down 22%, our balance sheet delevers, that's a testament. I don't know if you want to comment on that, Bill? We're looking at some larger deals. Gatan, we spent close to $1 billion on. And we have some businesses that are in our pipeline right now that are of that size. Yeah. You didn't miss it. We talked about it, but we didn't give the numbers. And I'm very pleased to see our pricing held up well. Q2 was similar to Q1. We achieved about a point and a half of price across the entire business. And total inflation and the impact of tariffs was a little less than 1%. So had a good positive spread added to margins and that drove some of the margin performance in the quarter. It's going to take several years to get passengers back to the same volume in 2019. There's no doubt about that. And what -- the base -- our base model for aerospace assumes that there's a medical solution to the virus, whether it's a vaccine or therapeutic, and people have to be comfortable flying again, and that's going to take some time. But we're balancing our aerospace, and our military business is doing extremely well. And we're very pleased with our portfolio. It's a high quality set of businesses and our strategy is to focus on a diverse set of markets. So we think we're well positioned with our leadership positions to recover with the market and recover profitably. But that's one market that we're going to have to -- it's going to depend on the government funding, it's going to depend on capacity decisions of many airlines, it's going to depend on the confidence of the flying public. So there's still some uncertainty associated with that. So we just manage what we know. And we can resize the business. I was running our aerospace business back on 9/11. So been through a similar type of hit. And if you look at what our aerospace has done since then, we resize it and it's been a tremendous contributor to AMETEK over the time, and we're doing the same thing right now. So we have a great team in aerospace and leadership positions and many areas, excellent positions with wide boats. And we're controlling what we can control right now, but it's certainly going to be an extended recovery. Yeah. I mean, the aerospace presence is 15% of sales. And that's a -- 5% of that 15% is in the military market. And 10% of that 15% is in the commercial market. And that commercial market includes our OE market, it includes our business gen market, it includes our third-party aftermarket. And that's the business that we're saying is a small part of our company, about 10%. But we're saying that we're not seeing as clearly a recovery path during the second half of the year. I think we got a little better in Q2. So we call that at maybe 45% for the balance of the year. But it's pretty difficult to get too granular on that market right now, because many variables that you don't control are happening and we're just managing what we can control. In terms of the process business, we're saying we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4, and that includes our oil and gas business. In terms of power and industrial, we're saying we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4. And in terms of our automation and engineered solutions, we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4. So we think that sequential improvement that we're seeing will continue as the economy gets back to normal. I think the military market and the healthcare market held up well for EMG. And in EIG, we have good part of commercial aerospace, and you also have the oil and gas business. Yeah. Everybody here is shaking their heads. We didn't signal EIG would be better than EMG. We talked about the automation business getting stronger. We talked about the military business and then commercial aerospace. Commercial aerospace was going to be weak and oil and gas is going to be weak, and those are predominantly in EIG. So it kind of paid out like we thought. Yeah, it's a great question. Great question, Joe. I've been pleasantly surprised at the quality and effectiveness, and we're getting the work done. But for R&D, it's not ideal. I mean, we have to have technicians interact with engineers and they have to find a way to get together and there is a certain spontaneity and productivity that comes with people getting together. So we're still learning. But we're using the tools and doing things safely and we're making good progress. But it's certainly an issue that we specifically have worked on and it holds us back certainly. But the digital tools are helping mitigate the problems."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. I'd like to echo Dave's comments on the outstanding efforts of our employees around the world. They continue to deliver exceptional performance during these challenging times. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were down $1.7 million compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.5%, down from 20.4% in the same period last year. The lower rate in the quarter was due to tax planning initiatives. For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was 19.6% versus 18.3% in last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $10 million. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million, down from our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $61 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, which includes after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate high levels of cash. Operating cash flow in the quarter was excellent at $315 million, up 20% over last year's comparable quarter. Free cash flow was also outstanding at $305 million, up 36% over the same period last year, and free cash flow conversion was superb at 183% of net income. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.87 billion, up modestly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $383 million from the end of the first quarter as we repaid a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.13 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.1 times as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This ratio was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times at quarter end. And both our gross and net debt to EBITDA ratios improved by 0.1 turns in the quarter. AMETEK remains well positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.1 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives. This includes over $950 million in available revolver capacity. As we highlighted on our last call, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023. To conclude, our ability to deliver solid results with outstanding cash generation despite these unprecedented challenges is a testament to the strength of our businesses and the dedication of our world-class workforce. The AMETEK growth model and our financial strength firmly position us to manage this economic environment and invest in future growth to deliver long-term success. Kevin? Yeah. The important point for us is our RD&E spending is roughly flat with 2019. So we thought that was going to be up coming into the year and we trim that back to flat, but we're really investing in RD&E. And the types of things we've delayed are expansions in regions of the world where we're trying to put extra capacity in place in a new region of the world that we're putting some capacity. And so those kind of projects got delayed. Quite honestly, we have decentralized the entrepreneurial team. And they understand the situation, so they make natural decisions and we really don't have to push that number. That's what comes up to us. That's where our business leaders want to spend. And I can see as we get later in the year, start evaluating, turning on some of those expansion projects we have in the various geographies of the world that we put on hold, but it's very difficult to complete those. Right. I'll take you through the market segment commentary because that covers a lot of ground, and I think we'll be able to answer your questions there. Our process business, overall sales were down high-teens in the quarter. And we had the contributions from Gatan, offset by organic sales declines in line with AMETEK's organic sales decline. And we talked about widespread travel restrictions. And in addition to project push outs and delays in our ability to provide service, so that impacted process significantly. The largest weakness in process was in oil and gas business. Our medical businesses performed well in the quarter, as did our Zygo business. Zygo is seeing solid growth driven by some semiconductor fabrication work and Extreme UV, EUV. And while the end markets remain challenged and visibility is limited, we do expect to see sequential improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarters across our process businesses, including oil and gas. In aerospace, I think we've talked about that. We were -- the defense business was up low-double-digits. The commercial business was down in the high-40s. In the commercial business, the aftermarket was a little worse and the OE was a little better. We expect our defense businesses to stay strong in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And the commercial aerospace business, it's bouncing around bottom and we may have some shifts between aftermarket and OE, but we're not calling that one out as improving. We may be conservative on that, but that's where we are. In our power and industrial business, they were down in high-20 range. A lot of similar dynamics to our process business. Demand impacted by the global shutdowns and travel restrictions. And we're looking to -- the orders in our power business were stronger. And we're looking to second half where we expect conditions to improve modestly with sequential growth in both our power and industrial businesses. And finally, our automation and engineered solution businesses, they were down mid-teens on a percentage basis. And we're seeing automation trends improve across Asia, within China. And healthcare is the other big driver for our automation business. So we're seeing good sequential improvements there. And we expect that to continue in the second half. Well, I think we certainly -- Dave, you mentioned the $2 billion, we could do more than that and still remain below our covenants. But as we've always said this is not a capital constraint strategy, this is more about finding the right businesses that will move the portfolio in the right direction and drive the returns that we're looking for. But the strength of the balance sheet can certainly support several -- couple of billion dollars worth of deals. Yeah. I think the -- I think you've got the positive there in terms of price versus cost. But what you're really dealing with is just the reduction in the sales levels. You're just getting the decremental margins on the fixed costs. So I don't think there's anything more interesting."

Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Despite a challenging and highly uncertain economic environment due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, AMETEK delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by excellent operating performance with earnings in line with our guidance range. I'll provide more details on the first quarter results shortly, but first I want to extend my thanks to all my AMETEK colleagues and recognize them for their amazing dedication and commitment through this difficult time. A courage and resilience I witnessed has been truly impressive. As AMETEK has been deemed an essential or life sustaining business at our operating facilities, our employees continue to provide critical solutions and services to customers across many industries including healthcare, defense, food and beverage and laboratory research.  To help safety and well-being our employee as they support these essential customers is our highest priority. We've implemented numerous safety measures aimed at providing a safe work environment. Our pandemic response plan providing a framework for our businesses to manage our facilities and workforce during this pandemic.  Among other things the plan to establishes personal and workplace hygiene practices, a global communications network of site and country pandemic coordinators, and a supply chain logistics and operations team to provide solutions to help mitigate the impact of pandemic on our business. Daily communication with local pandemic coordinators and senior management ensures we are complying with the center of disease control and local government regulations.  As part of the plan, we also implemented various safety measures including work from home requirements for those whose job allow, social distancing on our facilities and our factory floors, daily temperature monitoring of employees reporting work, use of personal protective equipment and staggered work shifts.  We remain vigilant as we return to higher level of operating activity. Now let me return to the first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.2 billion, down 6.6% from the same quarter in 2019. Recent acquisitions contributed 4%; the divesture of Reading Alloys was a two point headwind, foreign currency was one point headwind and organic sales were down 8% in the quarter. The measures we took during the quarter led to strong operating performance. While operating income decreased 3% year-over-year to $276 million. Operating margins expanded an excellent 100 basis points to 23%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating income margins expanded 110 basis points over the prior year period. Detrimental margins in the quarter were approximately 10 % shut our operating capability reflecting our ability to reduce our cost structure, as well as the strength and flexibility of our operating model. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $342 million, up 2% over the prior year with a record adjusted EBITDA mortgages of 28.5%. The operating performance led to earnings of $1.02 per diluted share, up 2% versus the comparable basis in the first quarter of 2019. And in line with our guidance range of $1.01 to $1.04. The $44 million restructuring charge we took in the quarter is expected to generate approximately $85 million in annualized structural savings. We also generate a strong cash flow in the first quarter with operating cash flow up 38% to $271 million. Free cash flow conversion was also strong at 148% of adjusted net income excluding the Reading Alloys gain.  Next, I will provide additional details at the operating group level. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $774.2 million, down 4% over last year's first quarter. The acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributed 6%. Foreign currency was a modest headwind and organic sales were down 9%. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $194.1 million, down 4% versus the prior year. EIG operating margins were 25.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins expanded 20 basis points over the prior year period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter despite top-line weakness as a result of the coronavirus. EMG's first quarter sales were $428 million, down 11% versus the prior year. The acquisition of PDT added 3% of the divesture of Reading Alloys was a six point headwind. Foreign currency was a one-point headwind and organic sales were down 7%. EMG's proactive cost mitigation actions led to impressive margin expansion. Our operating income was down slightly to $97.5 million in the quarter, operating margins excluding acquisitions expanded 220 basis points to a record 22.8%. During the first quarter, we also completed the acquisition of IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial applications. Their products and solutions nicely complement our power systems and instruments businesses and they deepen our expertise and high reliability power protection applications. Annual sales for IntelliPower were approximately $40 million and we deployed $150 million on the acquisition. We also completed the divesture Reading Alloys to Kymera for $250 million. The closing of the transaction which occurred near the end of the first quarter was a positive outcome for all parties as Kymera is an outstanding strategic partner for Reading Alloys. For AMETEK, proceeds from the sales were reported on our acquisition strategy which remains our priority for capital deployment. While we are pleased with the first quarter results, the global economic environment is obviously changed since the start of the first quarter. In January, global demand was solid. In February and extended Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus resulted in disruptions and China-based activity for customers and suppliers. Later in the month as China slowly reopened for business, Europe and the US and other parts of Asia started to feel the impact of the virus. At that time, we started to limit discretionary spend and non-essential travel. In addition, each of our businesses develop detailed contingency plan to prepare for a potential slowdown. In March, the impact of Covid-19 on the global economy was broadening. Many countries, states and counties started to impose travel restrictions, stay at home orders and social distancing measures for all but essential employees. Supply change delays started to emerge and customers turn cautious given the building uncertainty. Although, our facilities were operational throughout the first quarter given our essential business designation, we did see a direct impact on sales in the first quarter due to the virus. Worldwide travel restrictions limited our ability to provide support and installation services. This impacted our EIG process and power businesses most significantly in the quarter. And a broad set of customers delayed shipments.  Now a few comments on the demand environment in April. Demand in April was meaningly weaker than we experienced in March. Travel restrictions and social distancing mandates shut down all but essential activities as customers and suppliers temporary closed or implemented furloughs for all or parts of April. This has inevitably led to significant disruptions and impacts on demand. Restrictions across many geographies are slowly being loosened. However, we remain cautious on the pace of recovery. Now let me provide some comments on what we were seeing in select end markets. Although, we're seeing challenging conditions across most end markets, we're seeing solid demand continue across our healthcare, medical and defense markets, which account for approximately 20% of our sales. Our most challenged markets are commercial aerospace and oil and gas which combined account for approximately 16% of AMETEK sales. We expect meaningful weakness across these markets throughout all of 2020. In the balance of our markets including power, industrial, semiconductor research, metals and automations, we expect weak conditions in the second quarter with sequential improvements during the second half of the year. Shifting now to the actions we are taking to proactively manage our business, while ensuring we are supplying and supporting our key customers. As the spread of the virus expanded and restrictions widened in March, our business began to execute on contingency plans and implemented cost reduction actions. These contingency plans focused on maximizing cash flow, ensuring critical sources of supply and protecting key investments. All while ensuring appropriate safety measures were in place. The cost reduction actions we are taking include structural actions such as reduction enforce and facility cost consolidations, as well as temporary reductions, such as discretionary spend reductions, furloughs, temporary facility shutdowns; short time work weeks and temporary pay reductions. Given the reduction in demand we are experienced and we made a difficult decision to reduce our workforce. The total reduction of forces approximately 10% of our employee base across direct, indirect and SG&A functions. In addition, in the second quarter many of our businesses are implementing furloughs or temporary facility shutdowns. These furloughs generally range in length from one week to three weeks depending on the operating location and their customer market dynamics. The decision to furlough operations was made to have mitigated the spread of the virus, to better align our cost structure with demand and to position us to quickly respond when demand returns. The temporary pay reductions we implemented generally range between 15% and 20% for salaried employees including all AMETEK officers with a similar reduction of fees paid to our Board of Directors. As a result of these actions, we expect total cost savings in the second quarter of approximately $80 million with approximately $50 million of these savings from temporary actions and $30 million from structural actions. As we proceed into the second half of the year, we expect the benefit from our structural cost actions to ramp up with full year structural savings started at approximately $125 million. We will flex our temporary cost savings either up or down in the third and fourth quarters based on volume levels. In addition to these cost savings initiatives, we also reduced our capital expenditures by over 25% from our initial plans in the year, with full year CapEx now expected to be roughly $75 million. Before I provide commentary on our outlook for the quarter, I want to highlight the work AMETEK is doing where we operate to assist in the fight against Covid-19. Through the Ametek Foundation, we have made more than $1.5 million in contributions to charitable organizations many of whom are providing food and essential items to those in need, along with personal protective equipment to the men and women on the frontlines of this pandemic. We are proud to partner with numerous organizations around the world where we have an operating presence to support the immense humanitarian crisis caused by the pandemic. I also wanted to highlight a few of Ametek businesses are involved in the fight against Covid-19. AMETEK Roland, a leading provider of mission-critical communication and workflow solutions used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities has developed the Roland Rapid Response kit. This solution allows nurses and healthcare providers to quickly triage patients, gather necessary supplies and determine the appropriate clinical response all while keeping a safe distance to minimize repetitive staff to patient contact. They are being deployed for use in temporary medical facilities and new patient care facilities within hospitals to meet the surge of additional patients. Ametek Land is another great example. Land is a leading manufacturer of monitors and analyzers for industrial infrared, non-contact temperature measurement. In March, they released their virulence solution, a temperature screening thermal imaging system designed for highly accurate human body temperature measurement. This technology can be utilized for screening at point of entry into key facilities such as offices, factories, schools, government buildings and transportation hubs. They are seeing strong initial interest for the solution is temperature screening at this scale will play a fundamental role in helping to contain the spread of the Covid-19 and along with return to our normal daily lives.  AMETEK's Powervar business is providing customized, uninterruptible power systems to a number of leading medical device diagnostic equipment providers' use for coronavirus testing. These UPS systems are being deployed worldwide. And lastly, AMETEK Advanced Motion Solutions is providing critical solutions to manufacturers of ventilators and laboratory diagnostic equipment used in the Covid-19 response. These are just a few examples of the critical roles our businesses are playing and combating this global crisis. We are proud to be part of the solution and committed to supporting our customers in these efforts. As we previously announced due to the uncertainty is presented by the Covid-19 global pandemic, we have withdrawn our full-year guidance and will not be issuing quarterly guidance at this time. We will issue guidance as condition stabilizes and visibility improves. However, I did want to provide some level of comments about the second quarter and the balance of the year, given what we know now. First, we expect that the quarter will be the low point in sales in earnings this year given broad-based uncertainty and the impact on global demand from stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions. Second, we expect sequential improvements in sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters as the economy slowly reopens. And third, we expect to manage full-year decremental margins in the 25% to 30% range. While the second quarter decremental is being between 30% and 35%. To summarize, AMETEK delivered solid results on the first quarter on strong execution through unprecedented market dynamics. Bill will speak to this in a moment, but the actions we took in the first quarter strengthen our already strong balance sheet and liquidity. And we are poised to emerge from this economic crisis in a strong financial position, which will allow us to continue to deploy capital and acquisitions and invest in our growth initiatives. We are confident in the future of AMETEK as our world-class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK growth model will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. The message we've given to our employees is simply, while these are truly unprecedented times, AMETEK has faced challenging and uncertain environments before. And each time the collective strengths and talents of all AMETEK colleagues have allowed us to emerge stronger and better position. Together, we're working to make sure AMETEK again emerge stronger and better position for the next chapter of our growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I would also like to thank our colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts over the past few months. We have asked a lot of our colleagues as we manage the impact of Covid-19 on our business. And as always, they have risen to the challenge. The actions our businesses took in the first quarter helped us deliver strong operating performance and improved our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Let me provide some financial highlights for the quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were down $3 million compared to the same period in 2019 due largely to lower compensation costs. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales versus last year's level of 1.4% of sales. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.4% down from last year's first quarter tax rate of 20.5% with this lower rate in the quarter being due to tax planning initiatives. For 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21% and as we've stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Operating working capital in the quarter was 18.9% versus 18.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Capital expenditures were $17 million for the first quarter. As Dave indicated, we now expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million, down from our initial expectations of a $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $66 million. For the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $120 million or $0.52 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was outstanding at $271 million, up 38% over 2019's first quarter. Free cash flow was $254 million, up 45% over the prior year period and free cash flow conversion adjusted for the Reading gain was excellent at 148%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $3.25 billion, up from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. During the first quarter, we drew down $500 million from our revolver to bolster our liquidity position. We also deployed approximately $115 million on the acquisition of IntelliPower during the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.25 billion, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Reading Alloys and the draw down on the revolver. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.2x as we were intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This ratio was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5x. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4x at the end of the quarter. AMETEK is extremely well positioned to manage this economic downturn. We have more than $1.8 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives, including $550 million in available revolver capacity. We have a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023.  To conclude, our businesses delivered a solid quarter despite extraordinary challenges due to Covid-19. Our world-class workforce, the strong cash generation of our niche businesses and our balance sheet strength position us well to manage this downturn and will position us well to invest in our growth strategies over the long term. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew could we please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJoshuaPokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're well. If you wouldn't mind just talking a little bit about April or maybe March exit rates just give us a sense for what you're seeing out there. I appreciate all the color on decrementals and then certainly how margins held up in the first quarter. But maybe give us a sense for demand cadence, I know a few weeks maybe isn't a trend at this point but just to kind of calibrate where we're at on that first.\nDaveZapico: Sure. Josh. So there'll be a substantial revenue drop in April. We were down about 25% in April. And as we look ahead to the quarter we can be down about 25% or a bit more or a bit less because we have limited availability. But I pointed to that 25% that we actually were down in April.\nJoshuaPokrzywinski: Got it. That's really helpful. I appreciate, Dave. And I guess on the other side of this understanding that some of these countermeasures on the cost side end up being temporary and some are a little bit more permanent in nature. Anything that would prevent kind of a normal incremental margin on the other side i.e. are you pulling on the temporary levers such that you do need to kind of reflect the cost base or compensation metrics et cetera, when we do finally recover it. It doesn't look like the case but you just want to make sure that that's the way you're thinking about it.\nDaveZapico: Yes. That's a good question and that's why there's a balance of structural and temporary cost reductions. I mean we, historically, when AMETEK recover out of these downturns we've been had very high contribution margins and I would expect the same thing to occur this time. But we're using our best judgment and our experience with these businesses to balance the structural cost reductions with the temporary. So we have going to have $80 million in cost savings in Q2 about $30 million of that is structural and about $50 million of that's temporary. And then as we go through the course we'll increase or decrease that temporary cost reductions based on demand. And if it looks like demand is not materializing, it doesn't do any good to leave around the excess and unutilized resources. So we have the capability to do more, but we have a good feel for these businesses and we want to get through this thing with our businesses impact intact.  At the same time focus on the decrementals as we get through that. And I would expect that we would have very good incrementals as when we ultimately get through the crisis and we recover.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeaneDray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just to clarify the down 25% in April was that an organic revenue growth? And how did orders shake out?\nDaveZapico: Orders and sales are about the same. Orders were about that 25 point level; sales were just a bit more and that's really on the total orders and sales.\nDeaneDray: Good. And, Dave, can you talk about visibility? I mean part of the AMETEK business model is you've got healthy recurring revenues around 30%. So how do you think those hold up and just kind of connect us what we're seeing in terms of customer behavior, push outs, cancellations and so forth.\nDaveZapico: Yes. Sure. That's a good question, Deane. I mean when I think about Q1 or the end of Q1, we left probably $40 million or $50 million, four or five points of organic growth. We could not ship because our customers weren't available to take delivery or we cannot travel to the site to do the installation and commissioning work. So it's -- that was a big deal for us and we have to get to places in China and around the world and in the US especially in our process and power businesses. And do that commissioning and get that recurring revenue. So part of the customer behavior part for your question is that they delayed shipments. And we weren't able to access them and part of the recurring revenue is, it's driven by the ability to service them. So I think the recurring revenues will hold up relatively well, may be except in the aerospace business but we have to be able to travel and get to our customers and had to return some normalcy there for that to happen.\nDeaneDray: That's real helpful and appreciates all the color on the decrementals because that's absolutely within the band that we'd expect based upon the cost outs that you've taken. So I kind of feel like we can ask a more forward-looking question regarding when and how can you pivot to playing offense. You've got just an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We know M&A markets need to settle down, but what's expectation in terms of line of sight on potential acquisitions at the stage or is it just too early.\nDaveZapico: I think it's a great question, Deane, because we feel we're going to emerge from this crisis with an excellent M&A opportunity. It's going to remain our first priority for capital allocation. Bill already went through the strong balance sheet, the cash flow generating capabilities of companies and we had a very strong pipeline going into this crisis. We closed on an IntelliPower in Q1. We were very close on another deal, a very nice business we had just felt we could not finalize our diligence and integrate it with the restrictions caused by the virus. Certainly, it's a potential to continue with that deal post crisis because we really like it. And we have a good relationship with the sellers. And we're going to keep developing our pipeline. We have multiple tangible opportunities for post crisis. I mean a great pipeline going into this and we're going to use our business development team to maintain those relationships. In terms of the current environment, buyers and sellers are focused differently what challenges they have in their business. New set of buyers. There's a new set of buyer price expectations that need to get aligned with seller expectations. You don't have the ability to perform face-to-face diligence to negotiate to integrate it. So I think it's going to be late 2020 maybe the fourth quarter of 2020 before the market begins returning to normal. But I think we're well positioned to really capitalize on the opportunity there. And that's the way we're thinking about this thing. We're going to preserve our balance sheet now make sure it's strong and we're going to see a bigger opportunity and we get out of this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett. \nIvanaDelevska: Good morning. So just wanted to ask as we emerge from this what percent of your businesses do you think could kind of more quickly come back versus what could take longer time to get back to normal?\nDaveZapico: Yes. That's a good question, Ivana. And it's really -- it's both end market and the time of -- and the type of business that we're talking about. As I mentioned earlier, we serve a range of different end markets and some of these markets are seeing solid demand. These include medical wealth care, defense businesses and some markets are very challenged and oil and gas and aerospace. So I think the oil and gas and aerospace businesses are going to be the last to pick up positively; probably oil and gas will pick up well before aerospace, but the aerospace downturn we could have a couple two or three years but the majority of our businesses I think are going to recover quite well from this. And we have higher incremental margins and we're managing the decremental is on the way down. So I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to -- we were able to expand the last three years to 2019, we grew organically 5% a year greater than industrial production. And we got great margin expansion and in the environment that we're going to have in the second half of the year and into 2021 you may be an environment we're growing a little bit faster than that. So I expect our businesses to respond and our businesses to have better margins on the way out and with the exception that aerospace and oil and gas could be down for a while.\nIvanaDelevska: Okay. And in terms of mix in terms of marginal impacts of those businesses kind of underperforming. Would it be a positive for margins?\nDaveZapico: Yes. I think it'll be a positive for margins on the way down our aerospace is a pretty profitable business. It's a couple of points more profitable than the base business and our oil and gas is about at the base business profitability. We had 20% EBITDA in the first quarter so. But I think if you go back and look at the prior downturns and AMETEK recovered from them. We've always had healthy contribution margins on the way out because we're such a profitable business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.\nScottGraham: Hey. Good morning Dave, Bill, Kevin. Hey, so I hope you can help me with a couple of questions on the cost save. So we came into the year with about $90 million of them sort of based productivity as I call it. And I think I heard you say that the restructuring charges are going to give us $85 million in savings. Do we add those numbers together?\nDaveZapico: No. Well, you are actually doing an annualized basis. The $85 million is on an annualized basis. So when I think about the second half of the year we talked about $30 million maybe $30 million in structural safe savings in Q3 combined with about $50 million of variable when we get to the second half of the year Q3 and Q4 and we have about $75 million of structural savings right across those two quarters. So the structural savings will ramp up and if it plays out like we think the temporary savings will ramp down. And we'll exit 2021 with a pretty healthy level cost reductions on a run rate basis going into 2021.\nScottGraham: And -- right so the 2021 carryover on structural, what would that be?\nDaveZapico: It's going to depend on some things, but I think it will be about $40 million.\nScottGraham: Got it. and if you could just maybe help us understand on the cadence of sales in aerospace, commercial aerospace and oil and gas, certainly we understand that they\u2019re worse, perhaps a lot worse than the April sales number, but is there any kind of parameter you can throw around those numbers to help us understand what the real deltas are?\nDaveZapico: Yes. I'll give you an idea with aerospace and, again, there\u2019s a caveat that we don\u2019t have good visibility. But our commercial aerospace business is up 10% of the company, that includes our OE and after market that can be down 50%, and the after-market part of it can be down more, the OE part of it down a little less, but that markets going drop, it\u2019s going to be pretty significant and we\u2019re seeing that happen. So, that\u2019s just a fact for a considerable amount of time.\nScottGraham: Yes. And the oil and gas?\nDaveZapico: Oil and gas is going to have a tough time, I think the recovery is going to be faster because it\u2019s going to be more based on a commodity price and it\u2019s not going to be as long term, it\u2019s going to be people start driving their cars again. It\u2019s going to be, you know, definitely less than 50% for the year, but I\u2019d put it in the 25% range or something like that, more so in the upstream than the downstream. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigelCoe: Thanks. Good morning, gents. So just going back to the decremental margins, obviously, very impressive management of those. So before the discretionary cost savings, what kind of gross decremental margin are we looking at here? Is it sort of 45% type numbers? And are you confident that there\u2019s enough discretionary cost you can go after to manage decrementals into those ranges within a reasonable revenue range?\nDaveZapico: Yes, it\u2019s an excellent question, Nigel. And if you think about this kind of environment, you\u2019re going to end up with the decremental margins of \u2013 if we did nothing, we\u2019d be in that 50%, 55%, some businesses at 60% range. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re mitigating that greater-than-50% decremental margin in this kind of environment, and we have a higher margin business. And the costs that we\u2019re taking out are getting us to the 25% to 30% decrementals for the year.\nNigelCoe: Okay. But what you\u2019re saying is there\u2019s enough discretionary cost in the short-term to comfortably manage in that range? There\u2019s no breakpoints that you see right now.\nDaveZapico: Yes, I don\u2019t see \u2013 it\u2019s going to be difficult, and we didn\u2019t give guidance, but we\u2019re pretty good at managing the decrementals and that\u2019s our focus right now. We\u2019re going month to month, and our operating operations are making adjustments on the level of capacity and the level of customer demands. And I think that we can manage to that 25% to 30% level for the year.\nNigelCoe:  Great. And then my follow-up question is one of the keys to success for AMETEK in the past has been the right incentives at the divisional level. Some for growth, some for margin, cash flow, et cetera. Given the lack of visibility right now, how have you changed the incentive structure for your divisional managers?\nDaveZapico: We haven\u2019t changed them as of yet. They\u2019re still based on the original targets that were set for the year. And we\u2019re \u2013 we are managing through this thing. And I personally \u2013 everybody is going to feel some pain through this process, and resetting targets to the existing level of our business isn\u2019t fair for everyone, including our shareholders. So it\u2019s going to be a tough year, and there\u2019s going to be less variable compensation. That opportunity is still there, but it\u2019s not going to materialize. And that\u2019s just the way it is. And I\u2019ll talk to my Comp Committee about the appropriate things in these areas. But in general, there\u2019s going to be lower variable payments from our incentive systems this year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.\nBrettLinzey: Hey. Good morning, guys. Hey. Just wanted to come back to the comments on the medical health care and defense bucket at 20%. Were you suggesting in April that was actually a positive in terms of sales and orders? And then how are you thinking about that for the year?\nDaveZapico: Yes, I think the defense, the medical, the health care are going to be positive for the year. And in April, they didn\u2019t decline as much. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. That piece of our business at this point seems to feel pretty solid. The thing that we \u2013 it was very encouraging in Q1, we bought Gatan. We have a couple of quarter with Gatan; it\u2019s still above its acquisition model. So they\u2019re doing a great job for us. And some of our recent acquisitions like Rauland in the health care space, MOCON in the food space, and Telular in the IoT space, these are three pretty sizable deals we did over the last couple years. All three of those businesses in Q1 had double digit orders growth. So we\u2019re expecting those kinds of businesses to hold up pretty well. We\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s going to be plus or minus, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be the \u2013 they did not see that kind of decline in the quarter. We\u2019re not \u2013 they\u2019re not going to see that decline in the quarter.\nBrettLinzey: Okay. Great. And then just shifting to free cash flow. Very solid start to the year. What is the expectation as we go forward here? I mean, should we assume that the working capital should get a lift as the business cycles down? And maybe just a little bit of a framework on conversion or maybe a range you\u2019re thinking about for the year.\nDaveZapico: Yes, I think in the second quarter, you\u2019d expect a working capital lift as you have both impacted the lower sales level. But then some of that will get added back given the sequential increases in sales that we\u2019re expecting. I think overall a good place to be would be north of 120% of free cash flow conversion to net income.\nBrettLinzey: Okay. Great.\nDaveZapico: For the year. For the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens.\nRobertMcCarthy: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess the first question is a little bit to amplify your comments around the realignment charges you took. I guess this is consistent with kind of your practice periodically. I think the last time you did this was kind of in the 2016 time frame with the oil and gas retrenchment. You talked about a payback I think of 2x or something along those lines. But could you talk about that in terms of what you\u2019re expecting for the run rate savings again? And then just in that context, where are you taking out the most capacity? Is it presumably aerospace? Is it presumably these businesses that seem to be a little more longer cycle and structurally challenged and obviously are in the news because you see a lot of capacity being taken out across the complex?\nDaveZapico: Right. That\u2019s a great question, Rob. We attempted to balance these permanent cost reductions in area where demand has been more impacted. So, as an example, in the commercial aerospace market, we had about a 20% headcount reduction, and we had a little bit more than our average in the oil and gas business. Then we used a temporary approach in other areas to be positioned to respond quickly when demand recovers. And when we think about the structural savings, that was about $30 million in Q2, and that will increase sequentially as we go through the year. And then we\u2019ll exit the year \u2013 it was a question answered earlier \u2013 with about a $40 million benefit to 2021. But we\u2019ll see increased structural savings in Q3 and then in Q4. And we\u2019ll take our temporary savings and adjust that based on volume. But we felt it was necessary for the permanent reductions. It\u2019s very a difficult decision, but where demand is most impacted, not short term but more long term, we took those actions.\nRobertMcCarthy: Yes, and just for pedagogical purposes, presumably that\u2019s all baked into the decrementals you already highlighted?\nDaveZapico: That\u2019s all baked into the decrementals, correct.\nRobertMcCarthy: Yes, okay. Of course. All right. And then the second question is, obviously, I think you answered Deane\u2019s question very well about M&A and the opportunity set. But you are sitting on a lot of cash. It is a very difficult environment for potential share repurchase. You have done share repurchase in the past. I think notably in the fourth quarter of 2018 you thought it was particularly prudent, given the intrinsic value of your company. Well, if memory serves. But how do you think about share repurchase in this environment? Or perhaps you don\u2019t have as much visibility. And then, obviously, you have the whole populism problem with share repurchase as a whole in terms of a use of capital allocation. How do you think about it \u2013 because you do have a sizable cash balance? And even despite what we\u2019re going to see right now, still a strong prospect for continued cash generation here.\nDaveZapico: Yes, the first point is our priority is M&A. So we want to be able to execute on those M&A opportunities as we clear the crisis. And we have been opportunistic with buybacks, and we have the capacity to do buybacks. So that\u2019s something we\u2019ll consider. And our third priority, we\u2019ll maintain the consistent dividend that we pay. But right now with the situation being so uncertain, we have built some extra cash. We have the liquidity, and we\u2019re going to make sure our balance sheet is strong as we get through this crisis. And if there is an opportunity to do buybacks, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll consider. But clearly, capital allocations number one priority is acquisitions. And right now we\u2019re just making sure we get through this thing with a healthy, strong balance sheet and a strong company.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.\nRichardEastman: Yes. Good morning. Dave, could you just speak to \u2013 I\u2019m curious a little bit here as we move forward into the second quarter and into the back half of the year, when I look at EIG and that segment of the business, it does I think \u2013 oil and gas shows up in there. Could you just talk a little bit more about some of the process industries, the process instruments, how they\u2019re holding together? And then also the large commercial business, I think, falls largely in EIG. So does that suggest that EIG is weaker than EMG as we track through the balance of the year?\nDaveZapico: No. The way you think about first our aerospace businesses are, Rick, it\u2019s predominantly in EMG. So that\u2019s going to be a headwind to EMG. But on the EMG side, I think our automation business has been through a lot of \u2013 it was the first business that went in. And we\u2019re already starting to see some improvements out of China for automation business. So our automation business could be the first part of the business that does well and recovers. It could be. When you think about EIG, your question about process is a good one, because process serves a wide range of end markets, which are experiencing different dynamics, different end market dynamics.  On the positive side we\u2019re seeing solid demand in our medical, health care, and high-end research businesses within that segment. And that segment includes Roland and MOCON and Telular and Demand. And I\u2019ve already commented on these businesses and their growth drivers. Conversely, it\u2019s the part of our business that has oil and gas, which counts overall to about 6% of AMETEK sales. And we\u2019re going to be challenged in that part of it until the oil prices recover because there\u2019s supply and demand imbalance .And while we expect process sales to improve sequentially in the second half of the year, we expect the oil and gas component of it to remain challenged because of the sizable cuts to the capital budgets and the supply and demand imbalances.\nRichardEastman: Okay. Okay. And then just a quick question. Just a couple thoughts, if you will, about geographies here in the quarter. And maybe do we see the same type of cadence out of Asia, China? Do we see some recovery late in March \u2013 modest recovery? Just maybe the cadence around the geographies here as we exited first quarter and into the second.\nDaveZapico: Sure, Rick. I mean, the headline on the geography story is those are broad-based weaknesses in our geographies with Europe and Asia most challenged. And when you think about it, Asia was down high teens. And it was China was down first; it was driven by travel restrictions, the inability to install and commission our products. It was China, Japan, Korea. And then we look at China specifically. As you got to the end of the quarter, it started to recover. And it\u2019s recovering and improving, but it\u2019s not completely back. Our facilities over there are operating with pretty much full capacity now, and we\u2019ve got our supply base up and running. But we very recently started traveling to most customer sites. We weren\u2019t allowed to travel and do installation and do service work. I\u2019ll give an example. In the research end markets, there are some universities that still haven\u2019t opened back up yet. And we have some equipment waiting to be installed there. So in China, I would say it\u2019s improving, but it\u2019s definitely not the whole way back. And then when we think about Europe and it was down low double digits and same kind of drivers. The biggest impact was on our Dunkermotoren business and our process businesses in Europe. And then when we got to the U.S., the U.S. in the first quarter was down about 3% due to the same customer delays and delays, inability to commission product. So it feels like we\u2019re kind of coming out of it in the opposite way that it surfaced. So Asia feels like China is recovering a bit. And it seems like the U.S. may be still heading in a bit, and Europe might be at the bottom right now. So it was broad-based weakness. Europe and Asia were most challenged.\nRichardEastman: Understood. And just maybe a last question for me, sorry. When you look at the overall business and the type of downturns here that we\u2019re seeing in demand that has historically not had much impact on your pricing. Is that correct?\nDaveZapico: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I mean, this environment is different. So we\u2019re going to have to see. But I expect that we\u2019re going to be able to achieve this same level of price. We did in Q1. Q1 2020 pricing was good. We got 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was about 1%. So we had a 50-basis point positive spread adding to our margin expansion, and I expect that\u2019s going to continue for the year, but we\u2019re in an environment now where you really don\u2019t know what the fluctuating demand pattern is.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrewObin: Yes. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Thank you for providing more information and great execution. Just in terms of your supply chain in Asia and just globally, how has it \u2013 how is it holding up with all the shutdowns in places like India and Malaysia? I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening in Indonesia. And how are you rethinking your supply chain for the post-COVID-19 world?\nDaveZapico: Yes, good question. I mean, our philosophy is to always supply in the region where the demand is and we were moving to that even before the tariffs started and even now with COVID, we think that makes sense. We want to build where the demand is. So that will give us regional thought process around there. You mentioned Malaysia. Malaysia was one of the areas where we had some difficulty in the first quarter. I mean, the government came in and told us we couldn\u2019t operate and that was the only place in the world that happened. And we couldn\u2019t operate for a period of time and then we got authorization to operate at 25%, and then authorization to go to 50% and eventually right now we\u2019re at about 100%.  So it\u2019s \u2013 the different governments around the world responded differently and we have a really good supply chain team, and they\u2019re out battling with all these problems and getting them solved and they did a good job solving that one. So what we see across the world is \u2013 I\u2019ll give Mexico as an example. We have suppliers in Mexico. And Mexico is a little bit later to recognize the coronavirus threat, and then the government jumped in and started to do all the same things that were done around the rest of the world. But they seemed to implement it with the local authorities having different levels of judgment in what was essential and what was not essential. So we spent a lot of time and our supply chain team did a great job during the quarter getting suppliers turned on to Mexico when the local authorities had to tell them to shut them down.  And that involved us going to the authorities, telling them why they were essential as a supplier, and we got those all working. So it\u2019s been a really, really difficult time for our supply base, and our people have done just a fantastic job in managing it, and we\u2019ll expect there will be continuing problems like that during the second quarter and as we go through this thing and we have localized problems and outbreaks that we have to deal with, and we\u2019ve got good management, and they know how to deal with these things and we\u2019re dealing with them. But at the same time, it creates enough of a visibility issue that that\u2019s why we went through our guidance.\nAndrewObin: And just another question on China. You did sort of say that China is getting better. What kind of lessons, because I think people are trying to figure out what lessons this China holds for the shape of recovery in Europe and the U.S.? We\u2019ve heard from some companies; I think Parker or Honeywell sort of seem to have said that March was this big spur of demand coming back. But then April is a little bit slower because the economy is now back to normal, so maybe it\u2019s not all the way straight up. Can you just give more color on what\u2019s happening in China, April versus March relative and absolute terms? And as I said, more importantly, what lessons do you think this recovery holds for Europe and the U.S.? Thank you very much.\nDaveZapico: Yes, I think the lessons for Europe and the U.S. is you have to follow the social distancing mandates that the governments are putting through, and you will recover. And when you recover, it\u2019s not going to be across China. It was a choppy recovery with different regions having different requirements on travel. And I think we\u2019re going to have the same things here. So in terms of China specifically, as I said before, it\u2019s recovering, but it\u2019s not completely back. So our plants are now operating near 100% of capacity, but what\u2019s causing us a bit of the difficulty now is being able to travel to the customer sites and do service work and do install work. And just recently that started to open up. Just very recently.  I think last week we started traveling in places like Beijing and things to do service work. So I think you learn from that. I mean, we learned from China. It was interesting to watch within the company. Our operating people did a fantastic job in China managing through this, the COVID-19 problem. And we have essential customers in China, and we were probably one of the few plants that were still operating there, serving the medical customers in China. But they kind of set a work plan for us of using temperature monitoring and PPE and thinking about how to relay out production lines and how to relay out factory floors and talking about the flows of people within the buildings and how you quarantine someone within the building. And we learned from that as a company. So we learned from that. We helped in developing in China, and we saw how it worked and what didn\u2019t work. And now that\u2019s informing our decisions in Europe and the U.S. So it\u2019s \u2013 and we learn something new every day, and something changes every day. So I don\u2019t know if...\nAndrewObin: But just to follow up, is China up sequentially in April versus March? And thank you so much for answering my questions.\nDaveZapico: Yes, China is up in April, but in March, it was very diminished. And it just picked up at the end.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.\nAndrewBuscaglia: Hi, guys. I wanted to dig in to Aerospace just a little bit more. So obviously, the outlook, weak for that area long-term or longer term. But can you talk about that business, how you guys think about it and where there\u2019s exposure? And I\u2019m talking about where are you exposed to production versus miles flown. And what do you need to see come back within your businesses the most for that market to recover?\nDaveZapico: Right. That\u2019s an excellent question, Andrew. And as a reminder, AMETEK has a balanced exposure across our Aerospace and Defense markets. So our total exposure is about 15% of sales. 15% of AMETEK is in Aerospace, with roughly 5% to Defense. So we\u2019re seeing that Defense is still strong, and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year. 5% of the 15% is in Commercial and Business Jet OEM, and 5% is in the Aftermarket. So that 5% in Commercial and Business Jet OEM and the 5% in the Aftermarket, that\u2019s a roughly 10% exposure to Commercial OEM and Aftermarket that we think is going to be very challenged. And when I was talking about the potential to be down 50% and the potential that the Aftermarket is down more and the OE is maybe 50% or a little less, that\u2019s really what I was talking about. And in terms of our exposures, we have broad exposures across essentially all key aerospace and defense platforms. And we have a great business. I mean, we have leadership positions in aerospace power generation. We kind of revolutionized the way power is distributed around an aircraft. We\u2019re winning lots of business there. We have an excellent business in advanced sensors, airframes and engines and all parts of aircrafts. And we have an excellent thermal management business that handles heating and cooling of aircraft on very difficult applications. So the fundamental businesses that we have in that space are just great businesses. And they\u2019re going to go through a tough time, and the Aerospace market is going to look different, but we have really good management there. And as I said, we\u2019re adjusting to it now.\nAndrewBuscaglia: Yes, I mean, it sounds like you\u2019re generally still positive on that business over the long term and that \u2013 my next question was going to be, what\u2019s going on to discourage you from acquiring in that space and building that business more? Or not? It seems like the latter.\nDaveZapico: Yes, I think the way that we think about it is we want balanced end-market exposures. And right now we\u2019re dealing with a lot in that business as we decrease. But we really like the business. We have really sustainable businesses there, with wide moats around the business. They\u2019re good businesses. They\u2019re essential. And those businesses are going to be fine. So there\u2019s going to be an adjustment in volume, where you reset the cost structure. But when those businesses start growing, they\u2019re going to grow with healthy incremental margins. So we still feel good about it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoeGiordano: Hey, guys. Good morning. Hey. I think you touched most of the operational stuff already. So Dave, I just want like a bigger picture. I mean when you stepped into the role, it was like maybe the worst possible situation in terms of timing. So what can you kind of \u2013 what did you learn managing that initially through an energy crisis and how your businesses were impacted? I mean, I know that that\u2019s all smaller as a percentage of sales, and you just sold Reading, so it\u2019s different portfolio, but what were some of the critical lessons you learned then and how you applying that now?\nDaveZapico: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And I just come back to the seasoned management team that we have at AMETEK. I mean all of my executive office, they have been through many downturns, and they know what to do. We know what to do. And a big part of our \u2013 because we have such good culture and we have such long-term employees, they realize we\u2019re going to get through this. And the new people in our business are learning from them, and we\u2019re getting through this. And Bill and I, we\u2019ve changed our management cadence. And in March, we had operating meetings with every one of our business units. And we\u2019re going to do that again probably \u2013 I think it starts next week when we get through this call. And we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s changing the cadence, and through those meetings we understand what\u2019s going on with the business. We make sure we\u2019re focused on cash flow. We are making sure of right things for our customer base and we\u2019ll learn from that. So \u2013 and we understand what\u2019s going on in the business. But I think the biggest thing when you step back and you think about this thing long-term, we\u2019re very well positioned. We have proven management capability to manage through this downturn. Our businesses are well positioned with leadership positions, high barriers to entry, strong technology positions, the quintessential essential business, and we\u2019re executing very well, generating excellent cash flow as evidenced by the first quarter, as evidenced by the past few years. We got the question earlier, we have a proven capability to get price and offset inflation with price. We have that capital deployment strategy. World-class acquisition products. So there\u2019s no doubt in my mind we\u2019re going to get through this and we\u2019re going to be stronger for it. But it all comes back to the people, and we have the experience to get it done.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nKenNewman: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Ken Newman on for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Hope you guys are healthy. I just want to circle back to your \u2013 thank you very much. Just want to circle back on your comments around aero. Obviously, I know the environment is very challenging right now. But just trying to think about your 2Q trough comments and maybe any color that you\u2019ve been having on the conversations that you\u2019ve been having with your customers there in terms of the cadence for volumes in the back half as some of these facilities, especially for Boeing are starting to start back up. Curious if you would expect to feel the pull from the facilities as soon as they start up? Or do you think they have enough inventories to start initially and then they would come back to you once that normalizes?\nDaveZapico: Yes, I think it\u2019s a mix, Ken, because there\u2019s going to be \u2013 you think about a production line. There\u2019s going to be some things they need right away and there\u2019s going to be some excess inventory. So it\u2019s a mix of things. And as I said before, what we\u2019re seeing and what we saw in April is that business is challenged, substantially challenged. So that it\u2019s going to take a while for that business to adapt to those customer bases to the new demand. And the fact that we have balance in our aerospace business and we have 5% of it in defense of the 15%, it really helps us because we have some solid demand there so. But we\u2019ll definitely recover as the business recovers but it\u2019s going to take some time. And quite honestly, all those customers haven\u2019t even decided what the new build rates are going to be. So they\u2019re just deciding that now and those conversations are going on.\nKenNewman: Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one more for me, bigger picture. I\u2019m just curious about your conversations with customers around the automation solutions that you guys provide. Do you think customers may be looking more towards automation after having to deal with first, tariffs and now the pandemic? Just how are you thinking about that market as we kind of progress through this down cycle and maybe looking towards the other side?\nDaveZapico: Yes, I mean, the automation business has an excellent opportunity because if you want to eliminate \u2013 in the era of social distancing, that\u2019s going to drive demand for automation. So it\u2019s a demand driver on the exit of this that wasn\u2019t there before we went in. And again, in our automation business, that was weaker in 2019. We started to see that business normalize run rate later in the first quarter, particularly in China. So pretty positive on our automation business, and we were always positive on it because there\u2019s long-term demand drivers. And right now, our automation business is spending time along in the medical world providing automation systems for some of these testing devices for coronavirus where they have to test multiple samples. So they\u2019re using more automation equipment to do that. So we\u2019re positive on it, and that business is going to do well going forward.\nKenNewman: And just one quick follow-up to that is do those automation markets typically have \u2013 are those considered margin accretive to the base business?\nDaveZapico: Yes, I think it\u2019s margin accretive to EMG, for sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Andrew, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast can be accessed on our website in the Investor section. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Despite a challenging and highly uncertain economic environment due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, AMETEK delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by excellent operating performance with earnings in line with our guidance range. I'll provide more details on the first quarter results shortly, but first I want to extend my thanks to all my AMETEK colleagues and recognize them for their amazing dedication and commitment through this difficult time. A courage and resilience I witnessed has been truly impressive. As AMETEK has been deemed an essential or life sustaining business at our operating facilities, our employees continue to provide critical solutions and services to customers across many industries including healthcare, defense, food and beverage and laboratory research.  To help safety and well-being our employee as they support these essential customers is our highest priority. We've implemented numerous safety measures aimed at providing a safe work environment. Our pandemic response plan providing a framework for our businesses to manage our facilities and workforce during this pandemic.  Among other things the plan to establishes personal and workplace hygiene practices, a global communications network of site and country pandemic coordinators, and a supply chain logistics and operations team to provide solutions to help mitigate the impact of pandemic on our business. Daily communication with local pandemic coordinators and senior management ensures we are complying with the center of disease control and local government regulations.  As part of the plan, we also implemented various safety measures including work from home requirements for those whose job allow, social distancing on our facilities and our factory floors, daily temperature monitoring of employees reporting work, use of personal protective equipment and staggered work shifts.  We remain vigilant as we return to higher level of operating activity. Now let me return to the first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.2 billion, down 6.6% from the same quarter in 2019. Recent acquisitions contributed 4%; the divesture of Reading Alloys was a two point headwind, foreign currency was one point headwind and organic sales were down 8% in the quarter. The measures we took during the quarter led to strong operating performance. While operating income decreased 3% year-over-year to $276 million. Operating margins expanded an excellent 100 basis points to 23%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating income margins expanded 110 basis points over the prior year period. Detrimental margins in the quarter were approximately 10 % shut our operating capability reflecting our ability to reduce our cost structure, as well as the strength and flexibility of our operating model. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $342 million, up 2% over the prior year with a record adjusted EBITDA mortgages of 28.5%. The operating performance led to earnings of $1.02 per diluted share, up 2% versus the comparable basis in the first quarter of 2019. And in line with our guidance range of $1.01 to $1.04. The $44 million restructuring charge we took in the quarter is expected to generate approximately $85 million in annualized structural savings. We also generate a strong cash flow in the first quarter with operating cash flow up 38% to $271 million. Free cash flow conversion was also strong at 148% of adjusted net income excluding the Reading Alloys gain.  Next, I will provide additional details at the operating group level. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $774.2 million, down 4% over last year's first quarter. The acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributed 6%. Foreign currency was a modest headwind and organic sales were down 9%. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $194.1 million, down 4% versus the prior year. EIG operating margins were 25.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins expanded 20 basis points over the prior year period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter despite top-line weakness as a result of the coronavirus. EMG's first quarter sales were $428 million, down 11% versus the prior year. The acquisition of PDT added 3% of the divesture of Reading Alloys was a six point headwind. Foreign currency was a one-point headwind and organic sales were down 7%. EMG's proactive cost mitigation actions led to impressive margin expansion. Our operating income was down slightly to $97.5 million in the quarter, operating margins excluding acquisitions expanded 220 basis points to a record 22.8%. During the first quarter, we also completed the acquisition of IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial applications. Their products and solutions nicely complement our power systems and instruments businesses and they deepen our expertise and high reliability power protection applications. Annual sales for IntelliPower were approximately $40 million and we deployed $150 million on the acquisition. We also completed the divesture Reading Alloys to Kymera for $250 million. The closing of the transaction which occurred near the end of the first quarter was a positive outcome for all parties as Kymera is an outstanding strategic partner for Reading Alloys. For AMETEK, proceeds from the sales were reported on our acquisition strategy which remains our priority for capital deployment. While we are pleased with the first quarter results, the global economic environment is obviously changed since the start of the first quarter. In January, global demand was solid. In February and extended Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus resulted in disruptions and China-based activity for customers and suppliers. Later in the month as China slowly reopened for business, Europe and the US and other parts of Asia started to feel the impact of the virus. At that time, we started to limit discretionary spend and non-essential travel. In addition, each of our businesses develop detailed contingency plan to prepare for a potential slowdown. In March, the impact of Covid-19 on the global economy was broadening. Many countries, states and counties started to impose travel restrictions, stay at home orders and social distancing measures for all but essential employees. Supply change delays started to emerge and customers turn cautious given the building uncertainty. Although, our facilities were operational throughout the first quarter given our essential business designation, we did see a direct impact on sales in the first quarter due to the virus. Worldwide travel restrictions limited our ability to provide support and installation services. This impacted our EIG process and power businesses most significantly in the quarter. And a broad set of customers delayed shipments.  Now a few comments on the demand environment in April. Demand in April was meaningly weaker than we experienced in March. Travel restrictions and social distancing mandates shut down all but essential activities as customers and suppliers temporary closed or implemented furloughs for all or parts of April. This has inevitably led to significant disruptions and impacts on demand. Restrictions across many geographies are slowly being loosened. However, we remain cautious on the pace of recovery. Now let me provide some comments on what we were seeing in select end markets. Although, we're seeing challenging conditions across most end markets, we're seeing solid demand continue across our healthcare, medical and defense markets, which account for approximately 20% of our sales. Our most challenged markets are commercial aerospace and oil and gas which combined account for approximately 16% of AMETEK sales. We expect meaningful weakness across these markets throughout all of 2020. In the balance of our markets including power, industrial, semiconductor research, metals and automations, we expect weak conditions in the second quarter with sequential improvements during the second half of the year. Shifting now to the actions we are taking to proactively manage our business, while ensuring we are supplying and supporting our key customers. As the spread of the virus expanded and restrictions widened in March, our business began to execute on contingency plans and implemented cost reduction actions. These contingency plans focused on maximizing cash flow, ensuring critical sources of supply and protecting key investments. All while ensuring appropriate safety measures were in place. The cost reduction actions we are taking include structural actions such as reduction enforce and facility cost consolidations, as well as temporary reductions, such as discretionary spend reductions, furloughs, temporary facility shutdowns; short time work weeks and temporary pay reductions. Given the reduction in demand we are experienced and we made a difficult decision to reduce our workforce. The total reduction of forces approximately 10% of our employee base across direct, indirect and SG&A functions. In addition, in the second quarter many of our businesses are implementing furloughs or temporary facility shutdowns. These furloughs generally range in length from one week to three weeks depending on the operating location and their customer market dynamics. The decision to furlough operations was made to have mitigated the spread of the virus, to better align our cost structure with demand and to position us to quickly respond when demand returns. The temporary pay reductions we implemented generally range between 15% and 20% for salaried employees including all AMETEK officers with a similar reduction of fees paid to our Board of Directors. As a result of these actions, we expect total cost savings in the second quarter of approximately $80 million with approximately $50 million of these savings from temporary actions and $30 million from structural actions. As we proceed into the second half of the year, we expect the benefit from our structural cost actions to ramp up with full year structural savings started at approximately $125 million. We will flex our temporary cost savings either up or down in the third and fourth quarters based on volume levels. In addition to these cost savings initiatives, we also reduced our capital expenditures by over 25% from our initial plans in the year, with full year CapEx now expected to be roughly $75 million. Before I provide commentary on our outlook for the quarter, I want to highlight the work AMETEK is doing where we operate to assist in the fight against Covid-19. Through the Ametek Foundation, we have made more than $1.5 million in contributions to charitable organizations many of whom are providing food and essential items to those in need, along with personal protective equipment to the men and women on the frontlines of this pandemic. We are proud to partner with numerous organizations around the world where we have an operating presence to support the immense humanitarian crisis caused by the pandemic. I also wanted to highlight a few of Ametek businesses are involved in the fight against Covid-19. AMETEK Roland, a leading provider of mission-critical communication and workflow solutions used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities has developed the Roland Rapid Response kit. This solution allows nurses and healthcare providers to quickly triage patients, gather necessary supplies and determine the appropriate clinical response all while keeping a safe distance to minimize repetitive staff to patient contact. They are being deployed for use in temporary medical facilities and new patient care facilities within hospitals to meet the surge of additional patients. Ametek Land is another great example. Land is a leading manufacturer of monitors and analyzers for industrial infrared, non-contact temperature measurement. In March, they released their virulence solution, a temperature screening thermal imaging system designed for highly accurate human body temperature measurement. This technology can be utilized for screening at point of entry into key facilities such as offices, factories, schools, government buildings and transportation hubs. They are seeing strong initial interest for the solution is temperature screening at this scale will play a fundamental role in helping to contain the spread of the Covid-19 and along with return to our normal daily lives.  AMETEK's Powervar business is providing customized, uninterruptible power systems to a number of leading medical device diagnostic equipment providers' use for coronavirus testing. These UPS systems are being deployed worldwide. And lastly, AMETEK Advanced Motion Solutions is providing critical solutions to manufacturers of ventilators and laboratory diagnostic equipment used in the Covid-19 response. These are just a few examples of the critical roles our businesses are playing and combating this global crisis. We are proud to be part of the solution and committed to supporting our customers in these efforts. As we previously announced due to the uncertainty is presented by the Covid-19 global pandemic, we have withdrawn our full-year guidance and will not be issuing quarterly guidance at this time. We will issue guidance as condition stabilizes and visibility improves. However, I did want to provide some level of comments about the second quarter and the balance of the year, given what we know now. First, we expect that the quarter will be the low point in sales in earnings this year given broad-based uncertainty and the impact on global demand from stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions. Second, we expect sequential improvements in sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters as the economy slowly reopens. And third, we expect to manage full-year decremental margins in the 25% to 30% range. While the second quarter decremental is being between 30% and 35%. To summarize, AMETEK delivered solid results on the first quarter on strong execution through unprecedented market dynamics. Bill will speak to this in a moment, but the actions we took in the first quarter strengthen our already strong balance sheet and liquidity. And we are poised to emerge from this economic crisis in a strong financial position, which will allow us to continue to deploy capital and acquisitions and invest in our growth initiatives. We are confident in the future of AMETEK as our world-class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK growth model will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. The message we've given to our employees is simply, while these are truly unprecedented times, AMETEK has faced challenging and uncertain environments before. And each time the collective strengths and talents of all AMETEK colleagues have allowed us to emerge stronger and better position. Together, we're working to make sure AMETEK again emerge stronger and better position for the next chapter of our growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill? Sure. Josh. So there'll be a substantial revenue drop in April. We were down about 25% in April. And as we look ahead to the quarter we can be down about 25% or a bit more or a bit less because we have limited availability. But I pointed to that 25% that we actually were down in April. Yes. That's a good question and that's why there's a balance of structural and temporary cost reductions. I mean we, historically, when AMETEK recover out of these downturns we've been had very high contribution margins and I would expect the same thing to occur this time. But we're using our best judgment and our experience with these businesses to balance the structural cost reductions with the temporary. So we have going to have $80 million in cost savings in Q2 about $30 million of that is structural and about $50 million of that's temporary. And then as we go through the course we'll increase or decrease that temporary cost reductions based on demand. And if it looks like demand is not materializing, it doesn't do any good to leave around the excess and unutilized resources. So we have the capability to do more, but we have a good feel for these businesses and we want to get through this thing with our businesses impact intact.  At the same time focus on the decrementals as we get through that. And I would expect that we would have very good incrementals as when we ultimately get through the crisis and we recover. Orders and sales are about the same. Orders were about that 25 point level; sales were just a bit more and that's really on the total orders and sales. Yes. Sure. That's a good question, Deane. I mean when I think about Q1 or the end of Q1, we left probably $40 million or $50 million, four or five points of organic growth. We could not ship because our customers weren't available to take delivery or we cannot travel to the site to do the installation and commissioning work. So it's -- that was a big deal for us and we have to get to places in China and around the world and in the US especially in our process and power businesses. And do that commissioning and get that recurring revenue. So part of the customer behavior part for your question is that they delayed shipments. And we weren't able to access them and part of the recurring revenue is, it's driven by the ability to service them. So I think the recurring revenues will hold up relatively well, may be except in the aerospace business but we have to be able to travel and get to our customers and had to return some normalcy there for that to happen. I think it's a great question, Deane, because we feel we're going to emerge from this crisis with an excellent M&A opportunity. It's going to remain our first priority for capital allocation. Bill already went through the strong balance sheet, the cash flow generating capabilities of companies and we had a very strong pipeline going into this crisis. We closed on an IntelliPower in Q1. We were very close on another deal, a very nice business we had just felt we could not finalize our diligence and integrate it with the restrictions caused by the virus. Certainly, it's a potential to continue with that deal post crisis because we really like it. And we have a good relationship with the sellers. And we're going to keep developing our pipeline. We have multiple tangible opportunities for post crisis. I mean a great pipeline going into this and we're going to use our business development team to maintain those relationships. In terms of the current environment, buyers and sellers are focused differently what challenges they have in their business. New set of buyers. There's a new set of buyer price expectations that need to get aligned with seller expectations. You don't have the ability to perform face-to-face diligence to negotiate to integrate it. So I think it's going to be late 2020 maybe the fourth quarter of 2020 before the market begins returning to normal. But I think we're well positioned to really capitalize on the opportunity there. And that's the way we're thinking about this thing. We're going to preserve our balance sheet now make sure it's strong and we're going to see a bigger opportunity and we get out of this. Yes. That's a good question, Ivana. And it's really -- it's both end market and the time of -- and the type of business that we're talking about. As I mentioned earlier, we serve a range of different end markets and some of these markets are seeing solid demand. These include medical wealth care, defense businesses and some markets are very challenged and oil and gas and aerospace. So I think the oil and gas and aerospace businesses are going to be the last to pick up positively; probably oil and gas will pick up well before aerospace, but the aerospace downturn we could have a couple two or three years but the majority of our businesses I think are going to recover quite well from this. And we have higher incremental margins and we're managing the decremental is on the way down. So I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to -- we were able to expand the last three years to 2019, we grew organically 5% a year greater than industrial production. And we got great margin expansion and in the environment that we're going to have in the second half of the year and into 2021 you may be an environment we're growing a little bit faster than that. So I expect our businesses to respond and our businesses to have better margins on the way out and with the exception that aerospace and oil and gas could be down for a while. Yes. I think it'll be a positive for margins on the way down our aerospace is a pretty profitable business. It's a couple of points more profitable than the base business and our oil and gas is about at the base business profitability. We had 20% EBITDA in the first quarter so. But I think if you go back and look at the prior downturns and AMETEK recovered from them. We've always had healthy contribution margins on the way out because we're such a profitable business. No. Well, you are actually doing an annualized basis. The $85 million is on an annualized basis. So when I think about the second half of the year we talked about $30 million maybe $30 million in structural safe savings in Q3 combined with about $50 million of variable when we get to the second half of the year Q3 and Q4 and we have about $75 million of structural savings right across those two quarters. So the structural savings will ramp up and if it plays out like we think the temporary savings will ramp down. And we'll exit 2021 with a pretty healthy level cost reductions on a run rate basis going into 2021. It's going to depend on some things, but I think it will be about $40 million. Yes. I'll give you an idea with aerospace and, again, there\u2019s a caveat that we don\u2019t have good visibility. But our commercial aerospace business is up 10% of the company, that includes our OE and after market that can be down 50%, and the after-market part of it can be down more, the OE part of it down a little less, but that markets going drop, it\u2019s going to be pretty significant and we\u2019re seeing that happen. So, that\u2019s just a fact for a considerable amount of time. Oil and gas is going to have a tough time, I think the recovery is going to be faster because it\u2019s going to be more based on a commodity price and it\u2019s not going to be as long term, it\u2019s going to be people start driving their cars again. It\u2019s going to be, you know, definitely less than 50% for the year, but I\u2019d put it in the 25% range or something like that, more so in the upstream than the downstream. Yes, it\u2019s an excellent question, Nigel. And if you think about this kind of environment, you\u2019re going to end up with the decremental margins of \u2013 if we did nothing, we\u2019d be in that 50%, 55%, some businesses at 60% range. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re mitigating that greater-than-50% decremental margin in this kind of environment, and we have a higher margin business. And the costs that we\u2019re taking out are getting us to the 25% to 30% decrementals for the year. Yes, I don\u2019t see \u2013 it\u2019s going to be difficult, and we didn\u2019t give guidance, but we\u2019re pretty good at managing the decrementals and that\u2019s our focus right now. We\u2019re going month to month, and our operating operations are making adjustments on the level of capacity and the level of customer demands. And I think that we can manage to that 25% to 30% level for the year. We haven\u2019t changed them as of yet. They\u2019re still based on the original targets that were set for the year. And we\u2019re \u2013 we are managing through this thing. And I personally \u2013 everybody is going to feel some pain through this process, and resetting targets to the existing level of our business isn\u2019t fair for everyone, including our shareholders. So it\u2019s going to be a tough year, and there\u2019s going to be less variable compensation. That opportunity is still there, but it\u2019s not going to materialize. And that\u2019s just the way it is. And I\u2019ll talk to my Comp Committee about the appropriate things in these areas. But in general, there\u2019s going to be lower variable payments from our incentive systems this year. Yes, I think the defense, the medical, the health care are going to be positive for the year. And in April, they didn\u2019t decline as much. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. That piece of our business at this point seems to feel pretty solid. The thing that we \u2013 it was very encouraging in Q1, we bought Gatan. We have a couple of quarter with Gatan; it\u2019s still above its acquisition model. So they\u2019re doing a great job for us. And some of our recent acquisitions like Rauland in the health care space, MOCON in the food space, and Telular in the IoT space, these are three pretty sizable deals we did over the last couple years. All three of those businesses in Q1 had double digit orders growth. So we\u2019re expecting those kinds of businesses to hold up pretty well. We\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s going to be plus or minus, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be the \u2013 they did not see that kind of decline in the quarter. We\u2019re not \u2013 they\u2019re not going to see that decline in the quarter. Yes, I think in the second quarter, you\u2019d expect a working capital lift as you have both impacted the lower sales level. But then some of that will get added back given the sequential increases in sales that we\u2019re expecting. I think overall a good place to be would be north of 120% of free cash flow conversion to net income. For the year. For the year. Right. That\u2019s a great question, Rob. We attempted to balance these permanent cost reductions in area where demand has been more impacted. So, as an example, in the commercial aerospace market, we had about a 20% headcount reduction, and we had a little bit more than our average in the oil and gas business. Then we used a temporary approach in other areas to be positioned to respond quickly when demand recovers. And when we think about the structural savings, that was about $30 million in Q2, and that will increase sequentially as we go through the year. And then we\u2019ll exit the year \u2013 it was a question answered earlier \u2013 with about a $40 million benefit to 2021. But we\u2019ll see increased structural savings in Q3 and then in Q4. And we\u2019ll take our temporary savings and adjust that based on volume. But we felt it was necessary for the permanent reductions. It\u2019s very a difficult decision, but where demand is most impacted, not short term but more long term, we took those actions. That\u2019s all baked into the decrementals, correct. Yes, the first point is our priority is M&A. So we want to be able to execute on those M&A opportunities as we clear the crisis. And we have been opportunistic with buybacks, and we have the capacity to do buybacks. So that\u2019s something we\u2019ll consider. And our third priority, we\u2019ll maintain the consistent dividend that we pay. But right now with the situation being so uncertain, we have built some extra cash. We have the liquidity, and we\u2019re going to make sure our balance sheet is strong as we get through this crisis. And if there is an opportunity to do buybacks, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll consider. But clearly, capital allocations number one priority is acquisitions. And right now we\u2019re just making sure we get through this thing with a healthy, strong balance sheet and a strong company. No. The way you think about first our aerospace businesses are, Rick, it\u2019s predominantly in EMG. So that\u2019s going to be a headwind to EMG. But on the EMG side, I think our automation business has been through a lot of \u2013 it was the first business that went in. And we\u2019re already starting to see some improvements out of China for automation business. So our automation business could be the first part of the business that does well and recovers. It could be. When you think about EIG, your question about process is a good one, because process serves a wide range of end markets, which are experiencing different dynamics, different end market dynamics.  On the positive side we\u2019re seeing solid demand in our medical, health care, and high-end research businesses within that segment. And that segment includes Roland and MOCON and Telular and Demand. And I\u2019ve already commented on these businesses and their growth drivers. Conversely, it\u2019s the part of our business that has oil and gas, which counts overall to about 6% of AMETEK sales. And we\u2019re going to be challenged in that part of it until the oil prices recover because there\u2019s supply and demand imbalance .And while we expect process sales to improve sequentially in the second half of the year, we expect the oil and gas component of it to remain challenged because of the sizable cuts to the capital budgets and the supply and demand imbalances. Sure, Rick. I mean, the headline on the geography story is those are broad-based weaknesses in our geographies with Europe and Asia most challenged. And when you think about it, Asia was down high teens. And it was China was down first; it was driven by travel restrictions, the inability to install and commission our products. It was China, Japan, Korea. And then we look at China specifically. As you got to the end of the quarter, it started to recover. And it\u2019s recovering and improving, but it\u2019s not completely back. Our facilities over there are operating with pretty much full capacity now, and we\u2019ve got our supply base up and running. But we very recently started traveling to most customer sites. We weren\u2019t allowed to travel and do installation and do service work. I\u2019ll give an example. In the research end markets, there are some universities that still haven\u2019t opened back up yet. And we have some equipment waiting to be installed there. So in China, I would say it\u2019s improving, but it\u2019s definitely not the whole way back. And then when we think about Europe and it was down low double digits and same kind of drivers. The biggest impact was on our Dunkermotoren business and our process businesses in Europe. And then when we got to the U.S., the U.S. in the first quarter was down about 3% due to the same customer delays and delays, inability to commission product. So it feels like we\u2019re kind of coming out of it in the opposite way that it surfaced. So Asia feels like China is recovering a bit. And it seems like the U.S. may be still heading in a bit, and Europe might be at the bottom right now. So it was broad-based weakness. Europe and Asia were most challenged. Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I mean, this environment is different. So we\u2019re going to have to see. But I expect that we\u2019re going to be able to achieve this same level of price. We did in Q1. Q1 2020 pricing was good. We got 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was about 1%. So we had a 50-basis point positive spread adding to our margin expansion, and I expect that\u2019s going to continue for the year, but we\u2019re in an environment now where you really don\u2019t know what the fluctuating demand pattern is. Yes, good question. I mean, our philosophy is to always supply in the region where the demand is and we were moving to that even before the tariffs started and even now with COVID, we think that makes sense. We want to build where the demand is. So that will give us regional thought process around there. You mentioned Malaysia. Malaysia was one of the areas where we had some difficulty in the first quarter. I mean, the government came in and told us we couldn\u2019t operate and that was the only place in the world that happened. And we couldn\u2019t operate for a period of time and then we got authorization to operate at 25%, and then authorization to go to 50% and eventually right now we\u2019re at about 100%.  So it\u2019s \u2013 the different governments around the world responded differently and we have a really good supply chain team, and they\u2019re out battling with all these problems and getting them solved and they did a good job solving that one. So what we see across the world is \u2013 I\u2019ll give Mexico as an example. We have suppliers in Mexico. And Mexico is a little bit later to recognize the coronavirus threat, and then the government jumped in and started to do all the same things that were done around the rest of the world. But they seemed to implement it with the local authorities having different levels of judgment in what was essential and what was not essential. So we spent a lot of time and our supply chain team did a great job during the quarter getting suppliers turned on to Mexico when the local authorities had to tell them to shut them down.  And that involved us going to the authorities, telling them why they were essential as a supplier, and we got those all working. So it\u2019s been a really, really difficult time for our supply base, and our people have done just a fantastic job in managing it, and we\u2019ll expect there will be continuing problems like that during the second quarter and as we go through this thing and we have localized problems and outbreaks that we have to deal with, and we\u2019ve got good management, and they know how to deal with these things and we\u2019re dealing with them. But at the same time, it creates enough of a visibility issue that that\u2019s why we went through our guidance. Yes, I think the lessons for Europe and the U.S. is you have to follow the social distancing mandates that the governments are putting through, and you will recover. And when you recover, it\u2019s not going to be across China. It was a choppy recovery with different regions having different requirements on travel. And I think we\u2019re going to have the same things here. So in terms of China specifically, as I said before, it\u2019s recovering, but it\u2019s not completely back. So our plants are now operating near 100% of capacity, but what\u2019s causing us a bit of the difficulty now is being able to travel to the customer sites and do service work and do install work. And just recently that started to open up. Just very recently.  I think last week we started traveling in places like Beijing and things to do service work. So I think you learn from that. I mean, we learned from China. It was interesting to watch within the company. Our operating people did a fantastic job in China managing through this, the COVID-19 problem. And we have essential customers in China, and we were probably one of the few plants that were still operating there, serving the medical customers in China. But they kind of set a work plan for us of using temperature monitoring and PPE and thinking about how to relay out production lines and how to relay out factory floors and talking about the flows of people within the buildings and how you quarantine someone within the building. And we learned from that as a company. So we learned from that. We helped in developing in China, and we saw how it worked and what didn\u2019t work. And now that\u2019s informing our decisions in Europe and the U.S. So it\u2019s \u2013 and we learn something new every day, and something changes every day. So I don\u2019t know if... Yes, China is up in April, but in March, it was very diminished. And it just picked up at the end. Right. That\u2019s an excellent question, Andrew. And as a reminder, AMETEK has a balanced exposure across our Aerospace and Defense markets. So our total exposure is about 15% of sales. 15% of AMETEK is in Aerospace, with roughly 5% to Defense. So we\u2019re seeing that Defense is still strong, and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year. 5% of the 15% is in Commercial and Business Jet OEM, and 5% is in the Aftermarket. So that 5% in Commercial and Business Jet OEM and the 5% in the Aftermarket, that\u2019s a roughly 10% exposure to Commercial OEM and Aftermarket that we think is going to be very challenged. And when I was talking about the potential to be down 50% and the potential that the Aftermarket is down more and the OE is maybe 50% or a little less, that\u2019s really what I was talking about. And in terms of our exposures, we have broad exposures across essentially all key aerospace and defense platforms. And we have a great business. I mean, we have leadership positions in aerospace power generation. We kind of revolutionized the way power is distributed around an aircraft. We\u2019re winning lots of business there. We have an excellent business in advanced sensors, airframes and engines and all parts of aircrafts. And we have an excellent thermal management business that handles heating and cooling of aircraft on very difficult applications. So the fundamental businesses that we have in that space are just great businesses. And they\u2019re going to go through a tough time, and the Aerospace market is going to look different, but we have really good management there. And as I said, we\u2019re adjusting to it now. Yes, I think the way that we think about it is we want balanced end-market exposures. And right now we\u2019re dealing with a lot in that business as we decrease. But we really like the business. We have really sustainable businesses there, with wide moats around the business. They\u2019re good businesses. They\u2019re essential. And those businesses are going to be fine. So there\u2019s going to be an adjustment in volume, where you reset the cost structure. But when those businesses start growing, they\u2019re going to grow with healthy incremental margins. So we still feel good about it. Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And I just come back to the seasoned management team that we have at AMETEK. I mean all of my executive office, they have been through many downturns, and they know what to do. We know what to do. And a big part of our \u2013 because we have such good culture and we have such long-term employees, they realize we\u2019re going to get through this. And the new people in our business are learning from them, and we\u2019re getting through this. And Bill and I, we\u2019ve changed our management cadence. And in March, we had operating meetings with every one of our business units. And we\u2019re going to do that again probably \u2013 I think it starts next week when we get through this call. And we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s changing the cadence, and through those meetings we understand what\u2019s going on with the business. We make sure we\u2019re focused on cash flow. We are making sure of right things for our customer base and we\u2019ll learn from that. So \u2013 and we understand what\u2019s going on in the business. But I think the biggest thing when you step back and you think about this thing long-term, we\u2019re very well positioned. We have proven management capability to manage through this downturn. Our businesses are well positioned with leadership positions, high barriers to entry, strong technology positions, the quintessential essential business, and we\u2019re executing very well, generating excellent cash flow as evidenced by the first quarter, as evidenced by the past few years. We got the question earlier, we have a proven capability to get price and offset inflation with price. We have that capital deployment strategy. World-class acquisition products. So there\u2019s no doubt in my mind we\u2019re going to get through this and we\u2019re going to be stronger for it. But it all comes back to the people, and we have the experience to get it done. Yes, I think it\u2019s a mix, Ken, because there\u2019s going to be \u2013 you think about a production line. There\u2019s going to be some things they need right away and there\u2019s going to be some excess inventory. So it\u2019s a mix of things. And as I said before, what we\u2019re seeing and what we saw in April is that business is challenged, substantially challenged. So that it\u2019s going to take a while for that business to adapt to those customer bases to the new demand. And the fact that we have balance in our aerospace business and we have 5% of it in defense of the 15%, it really helps us because we have some solid demand there so. But we\u2019ll definitely recover as the business recovers but it\u2019s going to take some time. And quite honestly, all those customers haven\u2019t even decided what the new build rates are going to be. So they\u2019re just deciding that now and those conversations are going on. Yes, I mean, the automation business has an excellent opportunity because if you want to eliminate \u2013 in the era of social distancing, that\u2019s going to drive demand for automation. So it\u2019s a demand driver on the exit of this that wasn\u2019t there before we went in. And again, in our automation business, that was weaker in 2019. We started to see that business normalize run rate later in the first quarter, particularly in China. So pretty positive on our automation business, and we were always positive on it because there\u2019s long-term demand drivers. And right now, our automation business is spending time along in the medical world providing automation systems for some of these testing devices for coronavirus where they have to test multiple samples. So they\u2019re using more automation equipment to do that. So we\u2019re positive on it, and that business is going to do well going forward. Yes, I think it\u2019s margin accretive to EMG, for sure."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. I would also like to thank our colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts over the past few months. We have asked a lot of our colleagues as we manage the impact of Covid-19 on our business. And as always, they have risen to the challenge. The actions our businesses took in the first quarter helped us deliver strong operating performance and improved our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Let me provide some financial highlights for the quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were down $3 million compared to the same period in 2019 due largely to lower compensation costs. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales versus last year's level of 1.4% of sales. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.4% down from last year's first quarter tax rate of 20.5% with this lower rate in the quarter being due to tax planning initiatives. For 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21% and as we've stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Operating working capital in the quarter was 18.9% versus 18.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Capital expenditures were $17 million for the first quarter. As Dave indicated, we now expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million, down from our initial expectations of a $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $66 million. For the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $120 million or $0.52 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was outstanding at $271 million, up 38% over 2019's first quarter. Free cash flow was $254 million, up 45% over the prior year period and free cash flow conversion adjusted for the Reading gain was excellent at 148%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $3.25 billion, up from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. During the first quarter, we drew down $500 million from our revolver to bolster our liquidity position. We also deployed approximately $115 million on the acquisition of IntelliPower during the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.25 billion, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Reading Alloys and the draw down on the revolver. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.2x as we were intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This ratio was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5x. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4x at the end of the quarter. AMETEK is extremely well positioned to manage this economic downturn. We have more than $1.8 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives, including $550 million in available revolver capacity. We have a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023.  To conclude, our businesses delivered a solid quarter despite extraordinary challenges due to Covid-19. Our world-class workforce, the strong cash generation of our niche businesses and our balance sheet strength position us well to manage this downturn and will position us well to invest in our growth strategies over the long term.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of 2020 and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave. \nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK concluded 2021 with an excellent fourth quarter. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operating performance resulted in robust profit and earnings growth. Demand remains strong and broad-based across our end markets, leading to superb order growth and a record backlog as we enter 2022. We are integrating six recent acquisitions into the AMETEK growth model and are well positioned to deploy capital on additional acquisitions, given our excellent cash flow generation and strong balance sheet. We asked a lot of our teams in 2021 and as the pandemic and supply chain tightness led to disruption and uncertainty. As always, our colleagues stepped up to these challenges and delivered tremendous results. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your hard work and tremendous contributions to our success. Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.50 billion, up 25% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectation. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added nine points and foreign currency was a one point headwind in the quarter. Overall, orders in the fourth quarter were $1.61 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 22% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.73 billion, which is up over 50% from the start of the year driven by strong, underlying orders across our businesses, plus the contributions from acquisitions. Fourth quarter operating income was a record $361 million, up 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 24%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 25.8%, up a very strong 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $437 million, up 21% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 29.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.37 per diluted share, up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.28 to $1.30. Our record performance in the fourth quarter speaks to the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to drive strong growth throughout economic cycles. While the pandemic impacted results in 2020, we have quickly recovered and are now running well above pre-pandemic levels. For example, AMETEK's fourth quarter 2021 sales were 15% higher than our sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic, while core operating margins were up 300 basis points and earnings were up 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group, sales for EIG were a record $1.06 billion, up 29% compared to last year's fourth quarter, organic sales were up 17%, acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency was a one point headwind. Growth remains strong and broad-based across EIG with particularly strong growth in our Gatan and CAMECA businesses. EIG's fourth quarter operating income was a record $280 million up 18% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 29.3% up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020. The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $447 million up 18% versus the prior year driven by broad-based organic sales growth. Our Automation businesses saw continued strong demand across a wide range of end markets. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $105 million, up 32% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 260 basis points to 23.6%. Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2021, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $5.5 billion up 22% from 2020. Organic sales increased 15%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency, a modest tailwind. Overall orders were up 40% versus the prior year with 26% organic orders growth leading to a record backlog and providing us solid visibility as we look ahead to 2022. Operating income for 2021 was $1.3 billion up 22%. And operating margins were 23.6% with core margins up 110 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $1.6 billion, up 20% from 2020. And full year 2021 earnings were $4.85 per diluted share, up 23% versus the prior year. In addition to the excellent financial results in 2021, we also positioned AMETEK for long-term success by continuing to invest in our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives. One important initiative is new product development, as we look to further expand our differentiated technology solutions in attractive growth markets. In 2021, we invested $300 million in research, development and engineering or approximately 5.5% of sales. This level of investment was up 22% over 2021. One way we measure the success of new product development efforts is through our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past three years. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 25%. These investments are driving outstanding innovation, including a growing number of important solutions in support of our customers' sustainability initiatives. We're supporting the development and expansion of renewable energy solutions, providing important technologies used to monitor, measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assisting scientists and the understanding of the impacts of climate change and supporting the development and testing of electric vehicles, to name just a few of the important applications AMETEK plays a key role in supporting. We are expanding our research, development and engineering investments and expect to invest approximately $340 million or 5.5% of sales in RD&E in 2022. This is a 13% increase over 2021 RD&E spend. We are also deploying our capital and strategic acquisitions, adding to our portfolio of market-leading industrial technology businesses and driving excellent returns for our shareholders. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of six businesses. Our latest acquisition, Alphasense, was completed in the fourth quarter. Alphasense develops and manufactures gas and particulate sensors for use in environmental, health and safety and air quality applications. Their sensors are used in both fixed and portable systems to detect a variety of gases, including oxygen, volatile organic compounds and harmful toxic gases. Alphasense's sensor projects and technologies are highly complementary with our MOCON business and provide our sensor offering serving and broaden our sensor offering, serving critical health, safety and environmental applications. Alphasense is based in Essex, U.K. and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, and we expect to remain very busy in 2022. As our results reflect, our businesses are doing an excellent job managing the ongoing operational challenges caused by the pandemic. AMETEK's flexible, agile operating structure including our global supply chain capabilities, provide us the ability to quickly adjust and react to challenges. These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing given our differentiated product offering. Overall, the operating environment remains similar to what we experienced during the third quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, along with logistics and labor availability issues. We remain focused in the short-term on managing our supply chain and ensuring we can safely operate our factories, while also continuing to drive long-term operational excellence initiatives across our businesses. Moving to our outlook for 2022. We remain cautious in the short-term, given ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges. However, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid- to high-single digits versus 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.42, up 9% to 12% compared to 2021. For the first quarter, overall sales are expected to be up approximately 20% compared to the same period last year, and first quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.28 per diluted share up 16% to 20% versus the prior year. In summary, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts this past year. AMETEK's fourth quarter and full year results were excellent and reflective of the resilience and strength of our workforce and the AMETEK growth model. Our strong orders and record backlog position us nicely for 2022, and we look forward to the New Year and continuing to build on the momentum gained in 2021. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2021 with outstanding operating performance leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2022. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $23.7 million, up $6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $19 million, also driven largely by higher compensation costs. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% down from 20.1% in the fourth quarter 2020. This lower tax rate was due to return to provision adjustments. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was excellent at 15.2% of sales; this reflects the strong work from our teams in managing working capital. We have also strategically added inventory in certain areas to help address the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the fourth quarter and $111 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be approximately $125 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million and for the full year was $292 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. Operating cash flow was $282 million in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $238 million in the quarter and $1.05 billion or 106% of net income for the full year. Total debt at the year-end was $2.54 billion, up only $131 million from the end of 2020 despite having deployed approximately $2 billion on acquisitions in 2021. Despite the record level of capital deployment, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 1.8 times at the end of 2020 to 1.5 times at the end of 2021, a testament to the strength of our operating model. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $347 million. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2022 remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nBill Burke: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: It's a great order backlog numbers. I would just like to get maybe a little bit more color in terms of how this backlog might be looking differently than historical, I think we've talked about duration extending a little bit. Is that still happening? Are you seeing any orders sort of getting pushed to the right because of your customers, maybe their labor issues? Just any color on how that's sort of evolving over the past year for you?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I mean the orders have been very strong and I think it reflects organic growth initiatives and also the recovery of the economy. And we're doing very well, and if you look at our portfolio the one aspect that hasn't fully recovered is really our aerospace and defense business and our oil and gas businesses. But the rest of the portfolio, their mid-cycle businesses are doing incredibly well and I call out our automation business, which is doing extremely well, and I'd also call out our process business, which has really got momentum. But it's across the board and on top of that, it was \u2013 for the quarter, the way the quarter played out, it was each month of the quarter got better. And on orders, December was the highest month we had in the whole year. So we ended on strength and we have a very healthy backlog. And the one thing I mentioned a few calls ago is I think our customers, because of some supply chain challenges across all the market, are giving us a look into what their demand patterns are. So we're seeing orders earlier, but that doesn't take away from the strength that we're feeling in the business.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. No, that's helpful. And then a nice investment or dollars being allocated towards investment this year and then you talked to some high-level thoughts there. Any specific verticals that maybe you're more focused on than others? I know you highlighted a few product capabilities. Just any color there?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think the \u2013 we're making broad-based growth investments, and we're getting tremendous return from our engineering investment and it's across the board. You understand the way we manage our portfolio, but the sustainability opportunities for us are growing, and we're investing them. This year, we'll put about $110 million of incremental growth investments in our business. So that's on top of last year's incremental investments and those are in RD&E in sales and marketing. But fundamentally, we see opportunities and we're going to invest in additional $110 million, and we're going to keep the momentum going.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much. I will pass along.\nDave Zapico: Thanks, Allison.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nBill Burke: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Hey, it's very impressive giving the understanding of how tough the supply chain issues are inflation, labor shortages and everything and you're still able to deliver these numbers because a lot of your peers are struggling here. And maybe \u2013 look, I know its lots and lots of hard work. Your business mix tends to have a bit more what I'll call medium technology that has microprocessors, chips and we're seeing companies that are saying, \"Look, that's the biggest chokepoint for them\", but we're not hearing that from you. But just what is it about either your mix or your dual supply? You've done something very well here given what your exposures might have been. So maybe kind of help us there.\nDave Zapico: Yes. I'll try to give you some more color there. I mean, everything that you said is true and we're experiencing the same challenges as everyone is with supply chain, logistics, labor availability. And the Omicron variant certainly added a lot fourth quarter and Q1. But our overall response to these challenges has been outstanding. And I think the first point is our distributed business model, where we have committed P&L managers running their business units with their own supply chain teams, which allows them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time we have these business teams; we have a corporate centralized supply chain team that acts with all the combined leverage in the forte of AMETEK. And these teams work seamlessly together, and this overall approach has been extremely effective for us. As I mentioned in the last quarter and this quarter, it's directly what you said semiconductor chip availability, we have a lot of shortages, but that's the biggest area. And that's the one that's the most challenging and we're going after that a few ways. I mean, we're using our leverage of AMETEK. We have relationships built-up over a long period of time with the supply base. Our engineering capability is second to none, and we use it to qualify second sources, find alternatives, do redesigns and we've also taken a team of people across the company. Some of them are based on our Bangalore engineering office. Some of them are based in Germany. Some of them are based in the U.S., and that team is available to quickly help our business units for shortages and find alternatives, and that's working quite well. So we don't really improve \u2013 anticipate improvements and availability of semiconductor chips until the second half of 2022 at the earliest, and it's certainly a challenge. But I think we've had an effective response to it for the reasons that I just mentioned.\nDeane Dray: That's great. I really appreciate that additional color. And maybe if you could just take us through your key end markets for updates there and regions, if you could?\nDave Zapico: Sure. I'll start with the Process business. The Process overall sales were up 20% \u2013 low 20% in the quarter driven by strong organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Magnetrol and Alphasense. Organic sales were up high teens for process. Our Materials Analysis businesses showed the strongest growth, they were driven by as I said in my prepared remarks, like Gatan and CAMECA. The businesses have leading positions providing high-end instrumentation into life sciences and semiconductor markets. And looking ahead for Process, we expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up mid- to high-single digits for the full year. Now I'll switch to Aerospace. Overall sales for Aerospace & Defense businesses were up over 40% in the fourth quarter, driven by the acquisition of Abaco and mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Our commercial businesses led to growth in the quarter driven by strong aftermarket and business jet growth, while our defense businesses were down slightly in the quarter due to some shipment delays, it still had another strong year. Shifting to 2020, while we remain cautious about the patient the commercial aerospace recovery we're still well positioned to benefit from the recovery, given our attractive positions in a diverse set of commercial and business jet platforms. So for 2022, we expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Aerospace & Defense businesses with both defense and commercial expected to be up mid-single digits. And I go to our Power & Industrial market segment next. Overall sales for Power & Industrial were up over 25% in the fourth quarter and a very good fourth quarter, driven by mid-teens organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisition of NSI-MI. And for all of 2022, we expect Power & Industrial to be up mid-single digits with similar growth across our Power and Industrial segments. And finally our Automation & Engineered Solutions. both overall and organic growth for Automation & Engineered Solutions were up low 20% in the quarter. Automation businesses delivered outstanding growth in the quarter and full year with continued solid demand across our end markets. And in 2022, we expect organic sales for Automation and Engineered Solutions to be up mid- to high-single digits with similar growth across our Automation & Engineered Solutions. So if you look at the big picture, our Process and Automation & Engineered Solutions, market segments are going to be up mid- to high-single digits and Aerospace and Power and Industrial will be up mid-single digits.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.\nAndrew Shlosh: Hi, guys. It's Andrew Shlosh on for Jeff. How are you?\nDave Zapico: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Shlosh: Good. Good. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly on price cost, do you kind of have a view on the cadence if at all, any improvement of price cost throughout the year? I mean what's your view there?\nDave Zapico: Throughout 2021 or 2022?\nAndrew Shlosh: 2022, another \u2013 yes.\nDave Zapico: Yes. For some context, we had \u2013 for 2021, we had about 3.5% of price and inflation, total inflation in our business was in the mid-2s. And for next year, we're expecting inflation to tick up a bit. So instead of the 3.5%, maybe 3.5% to 4% \u2013 excuse me, we're expecting our pricing to pick up a bit to 3.5% to 4%, and inflation 3% to 3.5%. So we'll see \u2013 we budgeted a 50 basis point spread for a positive price inflation spread. And we see it a bit higher in Q1, and we're expecting it to level off after that. But end of the day, it's about \u2013 price is about 3.5% to 4% for 2022. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio. That's the way we're able to get price in excess of inflation in our business. We have leadership positions in our niche markets around the globe. So does that answer your question?\nAndrew Shlosh: Absolutely. No, that's great color. The only other one I had just on margins for 2022, I mean, I think it's fair to assume some pretty modest expansion, I mean, given just what you just said on price cost. But would you say it's accurate? I know you don't want to get to the business that's guiding margins for the full year?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I'd say that \u2013 I think we're going to have another good margin year. Our, I think core operating margins will be up in that 30 to 40 basis point range. And I think core and reported incrementals will be in that 30% range. I mean in the \u2013 and in Q4, we had really healthy margins. Our core incrementals, our reported incrementals are 21%, but when you back out the acquisitions, we had healthy core incrementals of 32%. And I think that's going to continue into 2022. So I'm pretty bullish about the things that we're doing on cost management and improvement in the cost structure.\nAndrew Shlosh: Great. Thanks for the color. I will pass it on.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning Dave, Bill, Kevin, how are you?\nDave Zapico: Good morning.\nScott Graham: Hey, Dave, would you mind giving us a split of organic orders by segment for the quarter?\nDave Zapico: Sure. I can do that. If you look at Q4, our organic orders for the total company were up 22%, and EIG orders were up 21% and EMG orders were up 23%. So really strong growth across both growth groups of the company and the book-to-bill was 1.07.\nScott Graham: Right. And that's actually a perfect dovetail into my next question. Over the years, through acquisitions and just streamlining and investments, the EMG segment has really caught up a lot to the EIG in terms of our organic growth profile. So I'm wondering how does that work in what you're looking at in acquisitions. Is it more equal \u2013 and it's not going to be equally split because I know EIG is a lot larger segment than EMG. But I mean are you spending a lot of time in both segments on deals?\nDave Zapico: Absolutely, absolutely, Scott. I mean we'd love to put more M&A to our EMG segment, specifically in our automation businesses. We're just knocking it out of the park there, and we made some good acquisitions in the past years and couple that with some really good organic growth and an excellent engineering capability. In fact, we did a really small acquisition in 2021 to add some robotic capability to that business. But that's an area we also like our thermal management system business, commercial and defense business, but they're \u2013 we have a good leadership position, and we have some \u2013 we're looking hard there. So EMG is going to \u2013 EMG is getting looked at very hardly in terms of M&A, and their past performance has been fantastic.\nScott Graham: That's great. Thank you. Just if I could squeeze this one last one in. It's an easy one. The research markets, as you know, hard to always study the trends in those markets from outside the four walls of AMETEK. How is research going for you? Are you being aided by sort of the reopenings? Are you \u2013 how are your investments working? That's a pretty important market for you. How is it \u2013 how's it going there?\nDave Zapico: Now research is about 10% of our sales in the process group and you're right, it's an important market for us. And what we saw mainly in the beginning of 2021 is the industrial research market was very good, but the universities took time to pick up because of the impacts of the pandemic. And what you're seeing right now is, I highlighted in my talk, the Gatan business, and that's more life sciences research and they're doing extremely well. And other parts of that business or the research market are picking up nicely. So it's not going to be as big of a growth driver because of the nature of the funding, but we're clearly transitioning from a more difficult funding environment during \u2013 and at the start of the pandemic to a better funding environment at this stage of the pandemic where I'd say all aspects of the research market are getting back to business.\nScott Graham: Got it. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Good morning, everybody.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: So you managed through a really, really choppy 4Q better than many and admirably. And I guess the question is going to be on the short-term, how does it feel now versus then? I don't know what you can say on underlying indicators of Omicron, whether that's crested or not and whether you feel you've conquered some of the difficulties out there, whether it gets better or worse? And then I'll just put the other one in there now. Just on long-term runway, it seems like there's a ton of momentum in automation and semiconductors. Maybe that's evident in your backlog a little bit. I don't know how far out your visibility goes on projects and bidding and quoting and just what your feel for those end markets is throughout the year? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Great questions, Rob, I mean, the first one is the Omicron variant. I believe we have a lot of statistics when you look at outside the world, and we also have our own internal statistics for AMETEK. And it looks like the peak infections are cresting. So I think the last two weeks, we were down a bit, and we had the highest level of infections prior to that. So it's clearly the same things that are happening outside of AMETEK are happening inside of AMETEK, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing through it. But it does cause absenteeism and it does cause labor availability and it's a challenge every day when something changes to manage through that. So that's clearly \u2013 that's part of the issue we're dealing with Q1. And our guide range is a little bit broader because of that. But our people are doing a fantastic job. When you talk about the long-term and runway and automation and semiconductors, we're seeing that. And if you think \u2013 I talked a little about the automation market and how we've done past acquisitions to acquire pieces of the automation, motion control, subassemblies that we've now put together, and we're very capable of quickly develop custom designs for our customers. We're kind of unique in that capability and we're winning a lot there. And I think that's going to continue. And when you look at the semiconductor market, really solid growth in Q4, but it's continuing. And we're competing in two parts of that market. We work in the research market. And I mentioned our CAMECA business did very well. That business is benefiting from the research side of semiconductors. And then you got some new technology that are going into the ramp in chip production. And some of the new technology uses something called EUV optics, and our Zygo business is an expert in that and there's only a couple of people in the world that are an expert in that. So, we're benefiting from the transition to EUV optics in the semiconductor industry, and that trend is just getting started. So, I'm not saying there's going to be some ups and downs as we go forward, but we're really well positioned in both automation and semiconductors as we look forward.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks for the teaching there. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Hello Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Can you talk a little bit more broadly regionally? And specifically, I'm looking for maybe some context around China, just given \u2013 it seems like there's some increased risk there, maybe not direct risk but indirect impact from a number of things, supply chain risk and, yes, component shortages, et cetera.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Sure. I'll talk to that. The first point is I'll give a whole geographical look at our business first in Q4. It was a strong, broad-based growth across all geographies. In the U.S., we were up mid-teens and notable strength in our Automation businesses. In Europe, we were up mid-30s. So, we bounced back nicely there, and we had notable strength in both our Automation and Process businesses. And in Asia, we were up 4% and notable strength in Process and Automation there also. So broad-based firing on all cylinders. Your point is a good one. The reaction that COVID is handled differently in parts of the world. So, you can have, semiconductor plants are being shut down or blocking access to certain countries at times, and we've been managing through that at the start of the pandemic. But in particular, you asked about China, and we were up 2% in China, very solid because we had a really strong comparison, and we had a really strong year. So notable strength in Zygo, notable strength in process and China is strong for us, it has been strong all year and then put in a strong quarter. So as the outlook, we see for our types of businesses in our niche markets where we're competing solid pipeline of growth in China continuing.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And maybe one last one with commercial aerospace, that was strong, and I see that really strong growth exiting the year. I might have asked this question every other quarter for like the past two years. But what is kind of your sense with this demand building for like a reopening in the back half of the year? Is it kind of more of the same?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I think we're seeing some strength in our commercial businesses for sure. They were up low double digits in the quarter driven by aftermarket and business yet. But we're being cautious for the year because of the pandemic's impact on travel and different impacts in different parts of the world. And we think we're still going to have a good year. We're going to be up mid-single digits. And we're ready for that market to inflect upwards. It might happen in the second half of this year but it might be 2023 also. We're not sure.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Is that aftermarket typically a leading indicator for that \u2013 for you guys when that starts to pick up?\nDave Zapico: I think you see two things. I mean the aftermarket is a leading indicator, and the industry went through a hard shutdown and now it's recovering, and we're seeing good aftermarket. And business jets are a function of people deciding to travel differently.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes.\nDave Zapico: And good position in both of those and seeing strong demand. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey good morning, everybody. This is Brian on for Nigel.\nDave Zapico: Hey Brian.\nUnidentified Analyst: So maybe just the growth investment, the $110 million. Any more color on where that's going, like within R&D and engineering, just any specific kind of initiatives or new products?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I'll start with the money first. We're putting about $40 million into increased R&D, and we're putting about $70 million into increased sales and marketing. And on the R&D side, it's across a wide range of platforms. We're not dependent on any one platform, and our business leaders put forth where they want to spend our incremental growth investments. So, it's spread out amongst good opportunities across our business. And in terms of the sales and marketing, we're doing a lot of work on e-commerce on digitization, and those are investments that will pay off very quickly, and they're already providing return for us because we sell to our customers different now through the pandemic, and we're expanding on our capability in that area.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for that. And then when I think about the bridge into 2022, outside of kind of the price cost dynamics and this growth investment, is there anything else to be thinking about at the margin? And then also just kind of on a similar note, do you expect kind of normal seasonality to hold because some of your peers are kind of talking about a tale of two halves as far as depressed margins in the first half, but it just feels like you're navigating the supply chain better. So, you might not see that same dynamic. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think with our budget and increases sequentially each quarter, which is typical of an AMETEK budget, but we're seeing strong growth in Q1. So, your point is taken. When I look at our budget, just based on simple economics, we've guided to be up about 10%, and that's about $500 million. And if you apply a 30% to 35% contribution margin on that increase. You'll get a number that's in the range of the guidance that we gave you. Now in that number, there is a lot of new investments, there's cost savings, there's acquisitions that we did last year, there are some headwinds with below-the-line type things, taxes, shares, a little bit higher interest cost. But when you bake the cake and you put it all together, it's a pretty simple picture. Sales are up 10%. That's about $500 million, and we're going to get a 30% to 35% contribution margin on. So, it's pretty clear from that perspective.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano : Yes. Apologies if I ask questions that have already been asked or answered. It's been a bit of a busy one this morning. But on the order side, I mean, obviously, really strong and it has been so, like what's your view on book-to-bill as the year progresses? And I know you are less susceptible to this than others. But like how the early ordering \u2013 kind of like what are you seeing? Is there any kind of like inventory at customers or like ordering so far in advance that it could set up like a vacuum at some point? Like how are you kind of thinking about your customer order patterns here?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I mean we have customized products.\nJoe Giordano : Yes.\nDave Zapico: So, I don't think that people are investing in \u2013 we're not going to run into a distributor problem or things like that. But at the same time, we've talked about our customers being aware of the supply chain issues and giving us increased visibility and placing orders on us to go out to the future. So, we're seeing that in our backlog. And at some point, that may roll over. But right now, it looks very strong. We mentioned in the prior remarks before you got on our organic orders were up 26%, and it was both strong in EIG and EMG. EIG orders organically were up, similar spread across the businesses. So, we are \u2013 I think the month of January was strong, and it supports our guide. But the order rates have not changed into January. Anything else?\nJoe Giordano : Okay interesting. Maybe, and again, you might have answered this, but did you give the core incremental ex like M&A dilution for EIG in 4Q?\nDave Zapico: Yes. We did talk about the \u2013 it was 32% core for the whole company, and it was reported 2021. So, we really had a good performance core. And you had...\nBill Burke: It was up 50 basis points margins ex acquisitions in EIG.\nDave Zapico: Yes, yes. It was up 50 basis points ex acquisitions\u2026\nJoe Giordano : Is that\u2026\nDave Zapico: [Indiscernible] business was up two sixty or two thirty, so it was good. So, the margins across the board were good for the company. And you look at EIG, you look at EMG, there are some acquisitions that depress EIGs but the incrementals were 32% for the whole company. The EIG core incrementals were 33% and the EMG core incrementals were 38%. So, the reported incrementals for EIG were a little bit lower because of the acquisitions, but really strong core incremental margins across the company.\nJoe Giordano : Very good. Thanks guys.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Mason: Just maybe to stick on the topic around acquisitions. I'm just curious what the acquisition \u2013 I could probably do this math at some point. But just what did the acquisitions contribute to earnings in 2021? And what's the component in the bridge in 2022 in terms of EPS?\nDave Zapico: I believe it was 16% in the bridge for EPS for 2022. And I believe it was about the same for 2021. But that $0.16 is included in the economics of the budgets that I talked about just a few minutes ago.\nRob Mason: Sure, sure. And Dave, I mean, you noted it was a very busy year for you\u2026\nDave Zapico: Rob, Kevin just told me, I said $0.16. It's actually $0.18. So, its $0.18 in 2022 and it happened to be $0.18 in 2021. So it's $0.18 for both of them.\nRob Mason: Okay, understand. You had, as you mentioned, a very busy year on the acquisition front. And I'm just curious, integration-wise with all the challenges around supply chain. Has that helped or hurt you in terms of your ability to integrate that? Has it forced you to move a little bit faster on the supply chain front?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think it's forced us to move faster and getting the AMETEK culture installed and getting the AMETEK processes installed. So, the differences are obvious, and we're working with the teams, and the integration of AMETEK is going very well. And it's early in the ownership, and we usually take it slower, but the environment made us go faster and they're integrating nicely into the company. And the benefits of our distributed operating models, we can take on a bunch of deals like that and be able to integrate them all. And they are fantastic businesses. I mean they each fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. They are leaders in niche markets. Each have strong differentiated technology positions and they are expanding our presence in attractive markets. So, the acquisitions are going very well. And myself, and Bill and the group presidents have been spending a lot of time on them.\nRob Mason: Yes, yes. And just one last one, just to follow on there. Abaco was your largest one, largest one ever, I think. And I noticed a nine-digit order recently. Within a business like that, what does an order like that or win, I should say, what would that shift \u2013 over what time frame would something like that shift?\nDave Zapico: It can be years. It really could be years. And specifically with Abaco, I mean, that team there is really talented, and were into the high 90% of the integration, and it's a high-quality management team. In terms of the org structure, we've combined it with our AMETEK Aerospace PDS business unit. So, when we looked at this business, we think there's a lot of synergies. So, we formed one division, and we now have a seasoned AMETEK P&L leader running the division along with the seasoned AMETEK CFO and along with a seasoned AMETEK HR person. So, we've installed some people there to help them \u2013 Abaco understand the AMETEK Ultera \u2013 at the same time, we're learning a lot from Abaco also because they have a lot of talent. So, I think this combination over the long run is going to be good for both businesses, and it's going to drive sales and cost synergy for both the AMETEK PDS business and Abaco.\nRob Mason: Excellent. Excellent, I\u2019ll pass it back. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Kevin Coleman, for any closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you again, Andrew. And thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast may be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK concluded 2021 with an excellent fourth quarter. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operating performance resulted in robust profit and earnings growth. Demand remains strong and broad-based across our end markets, leading to superb order growth and a record backlog as we enter 2022. We are integrating six recent acquisitions into the AMETEK growth model and are well positioned to deploy capital on additional acquisitions, given our excellent cash flow generation and strong balance sheet. We asked a lot of our teams in 2021 and as the pandemic and supply chain tightness led to disruption and uncertainty. As always, our colleagues stepped up to these challenges and delivered tremendous results. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your hard work and tremendous contributions to our success. Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.50 billion, up 25% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectation. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added nine points and foreign currency was a one point headwind in the quarter. Overall, orders in the fourth quarter were $1.61 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 22% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.73 billion, which is up over 50% from the start of the year driven by strong, underlying orders across our businesses, plus the contributions from acquisitions. Fourth quarter operating income was a record $361 million, up 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 24%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 25.8%, up a very strong 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $437 million, up 21% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 29.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.37 per diluted share, up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.28 to $1.30. Our record performance in the fourth quarter speaks to the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to drive strong growth throughout economic cycles. While the pandemic impacted results in 2020, we have quickly recovered and are now running well above pre-pandemic levels. For example, AMETEK's fourth quarter 2021 sales were 15% higher than our sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic, while core operating margins were up 300 basis points and earnings were up 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group, sales for EIG were a record $1.06 billion, up 29% compared to last year's fourth quarter, organic sales were up 17%, acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency was a one point headwind. Growth remains strong and broad-based across EIG with particularly strong growth in our Gatan and CAMECA businesses. EIG's fourth quarter operating income was a record $280 million up 18% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 29.3% up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020. The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $447 million up 18% versus the prior year driven by broad-based organic sales growth. Our Automation businesses saw continued strong demand across a wide range of end markets. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $105 million, up 32% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 260 basis points to 23.6%. Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2021, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $5.5 billion up 22% from 2020. Organic sales increased 15%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency, a modest tailwind. Overall orders were up 40% versus the prior year with 26% organic orders growth leading to a record backlog and providing us solid visibility as we look ahead to 2022. Operating income for 2021 was $1.3 billion up 22%. And operating margins were 23.6% with core margins up 110 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $1.6 billion, up 20% from 2020. And full year 2021 earnings were $4.85 per diluted share, up 23% versus the prior year. In addition to the excellent financial results in 2021, we also positioned AMETEK for long-term success by continuing to invest in our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives. One important initiative is new product development, as we look to further expand our differentiated technology solutions in attractive growth markets. In 2021, we invested $300 million in research, development and engineering or approximately 5.5% of sales. This level of investment was up 22% over 2021. One way we measure the success of new product development efforts is through our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past three years. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 25%. These investments are driving outstanding innovation, including a growing number of important solutions in support of our customers' sustainability initiatives. We're supporting the development and expansion of renewable energy solutions, providing important technologies used to monitor, measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assisting scientists and the understanding of the impacts of climate change and supporting the development and testing of electric vehicles, to name just a few of the important applications AMETEK plays a key role in supporting. We are expanding our research, development and engineering investments and expect to invest approximately $340 million or 5.5% of sales in RD&E in 2022. This is a 13% increase over 2021 RD&E spend. We are also deploying our capital and strategic acquisitions, adding to our portfolio of market-leading industrial technology businesses and driving excellent returns for our shareholders. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of six businesses. Our latest acquisition, Alphasense, was completed in the fourth quarter. Alphasense develops and manufactures gas and particulate sensors for use in environmental, health and safety and air quality applications. Their sensors are used in both fixed and portable systems to detect a variety of gases, including oxygen, volatile organic compounds and harmful toxic gases. Alphasense's sensor projects and technologies are highly complementary with our MOCON business and provide our sensor offering serving and broaden our sensor offering, serving critical health, safety and environmental applications. Alphasense is based in Essex, U.K. and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, and we expect to remain very busy in 2022. As our results reflect, our businesses are doing an excellent job managing the ongoing operational challenges caused by the pandemic. AMETEK's flexible, agile operating structure including our global supply chain capabilities, provide us the ability to quickly adjust and react to challenges. These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing given our differentiated product offering. Overall, the operating environment remains similar to what we experienced during the third quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, along with logistics and labor availability issues. We remain focused in the short-term on managing our supply chain and ensuring we can safely operate our factories, while also continuing to drive long-term operational excellence initiatives across our businesses. Moving to our outlook for 2022. We remain cautious in the short-term, given ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges. However, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid- to high-single digits versus 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.42, up 9% to 12% compared to 2021. For the first quarter, overall sales are expected to be up approximately 20% compared to the same period last year, and first quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.28 per diluted share up 16% to 20% versus the prior year. In summary, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts this past year. AMETEK's fourth quarter and full year results were excellent and reflective of the resilience and strength of our workforce and the AMETEK growth model. Our strong orders and record backlog position us nicely for 2022, and we look forward to the New Year and continuing to build on the momentum gained in 2021. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill? Good morning, Allison. Yes. I mean the orders have been very strong and I think it reflects organic growth initiatives and also the recovery of the economy. And we're doing very well, and if you look at our portfolio the one aspect that hasn't fully recovered is really our aerospace and defense business and our oil and gas businesses. But the rest of the portfolio, their mid-cycle businesses are doing incredibly well and I call out our automation business, which is doing extremely well, and I'd also call out our process business, which has really got momentum. But it's across the board and on top of that, it was \u2013 for the quarter, the way the quarter played out, it was each month of the quarter got better. And on orders, December was the highest month we had in the whole year. So we ended on strength and we have a very healthy backlog. And the one thing I mentioned a few calls ago is I think our customers, because of some supply chain challenges across all the market, are giving us a look into what their demand patterns are. So we're seeing orders earlier, but that doesn't take away from the strength that we're feeling in the business. Yes. I think the \u2013 we're making broad-based growth investments, and we're getting tremendous return from our engineering investment and it's across the board. You understand the way we manage our portfolio, but the sustainability opportunities for us are growing, and we're investing them. This year, we'll put about $110 million of incremental growth investments in our business. So that's on top of last year's incremental investments and those are in RD&E in sales and marketing. But fundamentally, we see opportunities and we're going to invest in additional $110 million, and we're going to keep the momentum going. Thanks, Allison. Good morning, Deane. Yes. I'll try to give you some more color there. I mean, everything that you said is true and we're experiencing the same challenges as everyone is with supply chain, logistics, labor availability. And the Omicron variant certainly added a lot fourth quarter and Q1. But our overall response to these challenges has been outstanding. And I think the first point is our distributed business model, where we have committed P&L managers running their business units with their own supply chain teams, which allows them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time we have these business teams; we have a corporate centralized supply chain team that acts with all the combined leverage in the forte of AMETEK. And these teams work seamlessly together, and this overall approach has been extremely effective for us. As I mentioned in the last quarter and this quarter, it's directly what you said semiconductor chip availability, we have a lot of shortages, but that's the biggest area. And that's the one that's the most challenging and we're going after that a few ways. I mean, we're using our leverage of AMETEK. We have relationships built-up over a long period of time with the supply base. Our engineering capability is second to none, and we use it to qualify second sources, find alternatives, do redesigns and we've also taken a team of people across the company. Some of them are based on our Bangalore engineering office. Some of them are based in Germany. Some of them are based in the U.S., and that team is available to quickly help our business units for shortages and find alternatives, and that's working quite well. So we don't really improve \u2013 anticipate improvements and availability of semiconductor chips until the second half of 2022 at the earliest, and it's certainly a challenge. But I think we've had an effective response to it for the reasons that I just mentioned. Sure. I'll start with the Process business. The Process overall sales were up 20% \u2013 low 20% in the quarter driven by strong organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Magnetrol and Alphasense. Organic sales were up high teens for process. Our Materials Analysis businesses showed the strongest growth, they were driven by as I said in my prepared remarks, like Gatan and CAMECA. The businesses have leading positions providing high-end instrumentation into life sciences and semiconductor markets. And looking ahead for Process, we expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up mid- to high-single digits for the full year. Now I'll switch to Aerospace. Overall sales for Aerospace & Defense businesses were up over 40% in the fourth quarter, driven by the acquisition of Abaco and mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Our commercial businesses led to growth in the quarter driven by strong aftermarket and business jet growth, while our defense businesses were down slightly in the quarter due to some shipment delays, it still had another strong year. Shifting to 2020, while we remain cautious about the patient the commercial aerospace recovery we're still well positioned to benefit from the recovery, given our attractive positions in a diverse set of commercial and business jet platforms. So for 2022, we expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Aerospace & Defense businesses with both defense and commercial expected to be up mid-single digits. And I go to our Power & Industrial market segment next. Overall sales for Power & Industrial were up over 25% in the fourth quarter and a very good fourth quarter, driven by mid-teens organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisition of NSI-MI. And for all of 2022, we expect Power & Industrial to be up mid-single digits with similar growth across our Power and Industrial segments. And finally our Automation & Engineered Solutions. both overall and organic growth for Automation & Engineered Solutions were up low 20% in the quarter. Automation businesses delivered outstanding growth in the quarter and full year with continued solid demand across our end markets. And in 2022, we expect organic sales for Automation and Engineered Solutions to be up mid- to high-single digits with similar growth across our Automation & Engineered Solutions. So if you look at the big picture, our Process and Automation & Engineered Solutions, market segments are going to be up mid- to high-single digits and Aerospace and Power and Industrial will be up mid-single digits. Thank you, Deane. Hi, Andrew. Throughout 2021 or 2022? Yes. For some context, we had \u2013 for 2021, we had about 3.5% of price and inflation, total inflation in our business was in the mid-2s. And for next year, we're expecting inflation to tick up a bit. So instead of the 3.5%, maybe 3.5% to 4% \u2013 excuse me, we're expecting our pricing to pick up a bit to 3.5% to 4%, and inflation 3% to 3.5%. So we'll see \u2013 we budgeted a 50 basis point spread for a positive price inflation spread. And we see it a bit higher in Q1, and we're expecting it to level off after that. But end of the day, it's about \u2013 price is about 3.5% to 4% for 2022. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio. That's the way we're able to get price in excess of inflation in our business. We have leadership positions in our niche markets around the globe. So does that answer your question? Yes. I'd say that \u2013 I think we're going to have another good margin year. Our, I think core operating margins will be up in that 30 to 40 basis point range. And I think core and reported incrementals will be in that 30% range. I mean in the \u2013 and in Q4, we had really healthy margins. Our core incrementals, our reported incrementals are 21%, but when you back out the acquisitions, we had healthy core incrementals of 32%. And I think that's going to continue into 2022. So I'm pretty bullish about the things that we're doing on cost management and improvement in the cost structure. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. I can do that. If you look at Q4, our organic orders for the total company were up 22%, and EIG orders were up 21% and EMG orders were up 23%. So really strong growth across both growth groups of the company and the book-to-bill was 1.07. Absolutely, absolutely, Scott. I mean we'd love to put more M&A to our EMG segment, specifically in our automation businesses. We're just knocking it out of the park there, and we made some good acquisitions in the past years and couple that with some really good organic growth and an excellent engineering capability. In fact, we did a really small acquisition in 2021 to add some robotic capability to that business. But that's an area we also like our thermal management system business, commercial and defense business, but they're \u2013 we have a good leadership position, and we have some \u2013 we're looking hard there. So EMG is going to \u2013 EMG is getting looked at very hardly in terms of M&A, and their past performance has been fantastic. Now research is about 10% of our sales in the process group and you're right, it's an important market for us. And what we saw mainly in the beginning of 2021 is the industrial research market was very good, but the universities took time to pick up because of the impacts of the pandemic. And what you're seeing right now is, I highlighted in my talk, the Gatan business, and that's more life sciences research and they're doing extremely well. And other parts of that business or the research market are picking up nicely. So it's not going to be as big of a growth driver because of the nature of the funding, but we're clearly transitioning from a more difficult funding environment during \u2013 and at the start of the pandemic to a better funding environment at this stage of the pandemic where I'd say all aspects of the research market are getting back to business. Thank you, Scott. Good morning, Rob. Great questions, Rob, I mean, the first one is the Omicron variant. I believe we have a lot of statistics when you look at outside the world, and we also have our own internal statistics for AMETEK. And it looks like the peak infections are cresting. So I think the last two weeks, we were down a bit, and we had the highest level of infections prior to that. So it's clearly the same things that are happening outside of AMETEK are happening inside of AMETEK, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing through it. But it does cause absenteeism and it does cause labor availability and it's a challenge every day when something changes to manage through that. So that's clearly \u2013 that's part of the issue we're dealing with Q1. And our guide range is a little bit broader because of that. But our people are doing a fantastic job. When you talk about the long-term and runway and automation and semiconductors, we're seeing that. And if you think \u2013 I talked a little about the automation market and how we've done past acquisitions to acquire pieces of the automation, motion control, subassemblies that we've now put together, and we're very capable of quickly develop custom designs for our customers. We're kind of unique in that capability and we're winning a lot there. And I think that's going to continue. And when you look at the semiconductor market, really solid growth in Q4, but it's continuing. And we're competing in two parts of that market. We work in the research market. And I mentioned our CAMECA business did very well. That business is benefiting from the research side of semiconductors. And then you got some new technology that are going into the ramp in chip production. And some of the new technology uses something called EUV optics, and our Zygo business is an expert in that and there's only a couple of people in the world that are an expert in that. So, we're benefiting from the transition to EUV optics in the semiconductor industry, and that trend is just getting started. So, I'm not saying there's going to be some ups and downs as we go forward, but we're really well positioned in both automation and semiconductors as we look forward. Thank you. Hello Andrew. Yes. Sure. I'll talk to that. The first point is I'll give a whole geographical look at our business first in Q4. It was a strong, broad-based growth across all geographies. In the U.S., we were up mid-teens and notable strength in our Automation businesses. In Europe, we were up mid-30s. So, we bounced back nicely there, and we had notable strength in both our Automation and Process businesses. And in Asia, we were up 4% and notable strength in Process and Automation there also. So broad-based firing on all cylinders. Your point is a good one. The reaction that COVID is handled differently in parts of the world. So, you can have, semiconductor plants are being shut down or blocking access to certain countries at times, and we've been managing through that at the start of the pandemic. But in particular, you asked about China, and we were up 2% in China, very solid because we had a really strong comparison, and we had a really strong year. So notable strength in Zygo, notable strength in process and China is strong for us, it has been strong all year and then put in a strong quarter. So as the outlook, we see for our types of businesses in our niche markets where we're competing solid pipeline of growth in China continuing. Yes, I think we're seeing some strength in our commercial businesses for sure. They were up low double digits in the quarter driven by aftermarket and business yet. But we're being cautious for the year because of the pandemic's impact on travel and different impacts in different parts of the world. And we think we're still going to have a good year. We're going to be up mid-single digits. And we're ready for that market to inflect upwards. It might happen in the second half of this year but it might be 2023 also. We're not sure. I think you see two things. I mean the aftermarket is a leading indicator, and the industry went through a hard shutdown and now it's recovering, and we're seeing good aftermarket. And business jets are a function of people deciding to travel differently. And good position in both of those and seeing strong demand. Thank you. Hey Brian. Yes. I'll start with the money first. We're putting about $40 million into increased R&D, and we're putting about $70 million into increased sales and marketing. And on the R&D side, it's across a wide range of platforms. We're not dependent on any one platform, and our business leaders put forth where they want to spend our incremental growth investments. So, it's spread out amongst good opportunities across our business. And in terms of the sales and marketing, we're doing a lot of work on e-commerce on digitization, and those are investments that will pay off very quickly, and they're already providing return for us because we sell to our customers different now through the pandemic, and we're expanding on our capability in that area. Yes. I think with our budget and increases sequentially each quarter, which is typical of an AMETEK budget, but we're seeing strong growth in Q1. So, your point is taken. When I look at our budget, just based on simple economics, we've guided to be up about 10%, and that's about $500 million. And if you apply a 30% to 35% contribution margin on that increase. You'll get a number that's in the range of the guidance that we gave you. Now in that number, there is a lot of new investments, there's cost savings, there's acquisitions that we did last year, there are some headwinds with below-the-line type things, taxes, shares, a little bit higher interest cost. But when you bake the cake and you put it all together, it's a pretty simple picture. Sales are up 10%. That's about $500 million, and we're going to get a 30% to 35% contribution margin on. So, it's pretty clear from that perspective. Yes, thank you. Good morning, Joe. Yes. I mean we have customized products. So, I don't think that people are investing in \u2013 we're not going to run into a distributor problem or things like that. But at the same time, we've talked about our customers being aware of the supply chain issues and giving us increased visibility and placing orders on us to go out to the future. So, we're seeing that in our backlog. And at some point, that may roll over. But right now, it looks very strong. We mentioned in the prior remarks before you got on our organic orders were up 26%, and it was both strong in EIG and EMG. EIG orders organically were up, similar spread across the businesses. So, we are \u2013 I think the month of January was strong, and it supports our guide. But the order rates have not changed into January. Anything else? Yes. We did talk about the \u2013 it was 32% core for the whole company, and it was reported 2021. So, we really had a good performance core. And you had... Yes, yes. It was up 50 basis points ex acquisitions\u2026 [Indiscernible] business was up two sixty or two thirty, so it was good. So, the margins across the board were good for the company. And you look at EIG, you look at EMG, there are some acquisitions that depress EIGs but the incrementals were 32% for the whole company. The EIG core incrementals were 33% and the EMG core incrementals were 38%. So, the reported incrementals for EIG were a little bit lower because of the acquisitions, but really strong core incremental margins across the company. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Rob. I believe it was 16% in the bridge for EPS for 2022. And I believe it was about the same for 2021. But that $0.16 is included in the economics of the budgets that I talked about just a few minutes ago. Rob, Kevin just told me, I said $0.16. It's actually $0.18. So, its $0.18 in 2022 and it happened to be $0.18 in 2021. So it's $0.18 for both of them. Yes. I think it's forced us to move faster and getting the AMETEK culture installed and getting the AMETEK processes installed. So, the differences are obvious, and we're working with the teams, and the integration of AMETEK is going very well. And it's early in the ownership, and we usually take it slower, but the environment made us go faster and they're integrating nicely into the company. And the benefits of our distributed operating models, we can take on a bunch of deals like that and be able to integrate them all. And they are fantastic businesses. I mean they each fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. They are leaders in niche markets. Each have strong differentiated technology positions and they are expanding our presence in attractive markets. So, the acquisitions are going very well. And myself, and Bill and the group presidents have been spending a lot of time on them. It can be years. It really could be years. And specifically with Abaco, I mean, that team there is really talented, and were into the high 90% of the integration, and it's a high-quality management team. In terms of the org structure, we've combined it with our AMETEK Aerospace PDS business unit. So, when we looked at this business, we think there's a lot of synergies. So, we formed one division, and we now have a seasoned AMETEK P&L leader running the division along with the seasoned AMETEK CFO and along with a seasoned AMETEK HR person. So, we've installed some people there to help them \u2013 Abaco understand the AMETEK Ultera \u2013 at the same time, we're learning a lot from Abaco also because they have a lot of talent. So, I think this combination over the long run is going to be good for both businesses, and it's going to drive sales and cost synergy for both the AMETEK PDS business and Abaco. Thank you, Rob."

            "name": "Bill Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2021 with outstanding operating performance leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2022. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $23.7 million, up $6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $19 million, also driven largely by higher compensation costs. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% down from 20.1% in the fourth quarter 2020. This lower tax rate was due to return to provision adjustments. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was excellent at 15.2% of sales; this reflects the strong work from our teams in managing working capital. We have also strategically added inventory in certain areas to help address the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the fourth quarter and $111 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be approximately $125 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million and for the full year was $292 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. Operating cash flow was $282 million in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $238 million in the quarter and $1.05 billion or 106% of net income for the full year. Total debt at the year-end was $2.54 billion, up only $131 million from the end of 2020 despite having deployed approximately $2 billion on acquisitions in 2021. Despite the record level of capital deployment, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 1.8 times at the end of 2020 to 1.5 times at the end of 2021, a testament to the strength of our operating model. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $347 million. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2022 remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin? Good morning, Allison. Good morning. It was up 50 basis points margins ex acquisitions in EIG."

Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin (ph), and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another outstanding quarter, with better-than-expected sales growth, strong operating performance, and earnings above our expectations. We established records for sales, EBITDA, operating income, and earnings per share in the quarter. Demand remains strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth and a record backlog. While the global supply chain and logistics networks remains challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results which exceeded our expectations. Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues, as well as the strength, flexibility, and sustainability of the Grand AMETEK growth model. AMETEK 's proven business model was central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. We're very proud of the important steps we are taking to further sustainability across AMETEK. And last week, we published our latest corporate sustainability report to highlight our efforts in this area. This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made, and the commitments we are making to create a better future. I welcome you all to read our latest corporate sustainability report, which is located on our website.\nDave Zapico: Now, let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% of the same period in 2020 and above our expectations. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 11 points, and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Overall, orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior-year period. While organic orders were up an impressive 31% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year. Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020, and operating margins were 23.4%.  Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 28.8%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, up 25% over the third quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of a $1.16 to $1.18. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow with third quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion of 109% of Net Income. Overall, tremendous results in a challenging operating environment.  Next, let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter. Organic sales were up 15%, acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency was a modest [indiscernible] While growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our ultra-precision technologies and our Power and Industrial businesses. EIG third quarter operating income was a record $245 million up 20% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 25%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG 's core margins were excellent at 27.2% in line with prior year margins.  The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Third quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million. Organic sales were up 20% and currency added 1 point to growth. Growth remains strong across all of the EMG with our automation businesses, again, delivering notably strong growth in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior-year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. AMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of capital deployment, lean to the acquisition of 5 highly strategic businesses.  AMETEK has deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK 's acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies. Our proven operating capabilities allow us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital. Generating strong returns on capital deployed is critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK 's strategy. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy. Our acquisition pipeline remains very active.  Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters. We also remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support the organic growth initiatives, including in support of their new product development efforts. In the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in RD&E, and for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. Through these investments, our businesses develop unique and highly differentiated solutions to help solve our customers most complex challenges. One such example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan.  Gatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy supporting high-end research and materials on life sciences applications. Gatan recently introduced the Stela hybrid pixel camera. The only fully integrated hybrid pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy suite. This new product reinforces Gatan 's leadership position, providing the highest quality TEM diffraction camera, allowing the user to perform 4D stem analysis for the [Indiscernible] and high dynamic range.  Gatans 's new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology. In August, the Stela camera was awarded the 2021 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and called one of the 10 game - changing products and methods. I would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of the Stela camera, and broader support of important research applications. Now, let me touch on the supply chain issues. The global supply chain remains challenging.  We see extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, with logistics issues and labor availability adding to the complexity. While these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for the quarter, and are navigating the challenging environment well, given our agile operating approach. This supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, given our differentiation we we're able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread. While we expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well-positioned to navigate the issues given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model.  Moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, and the continuous strong order to momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guides. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20% range versus our previous guide of two up approximately 20%. Organic sales are now expected to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis over 2020 as compared to our previous [indiscernible] of approximately 10%. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020 as comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.68 per diluted share.  For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30, up 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter. In summary, AMETEK 's third quarter results were excellent. Our teams continued to execute and our businesses are performing well. Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model. The asset led nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success.  The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of the AMETEK stakeholders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill.\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, with continued strong sales growth, and orders growth, and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter, general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter unchanged from the prior year.  For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million driven by higher compensation costs or approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year. Third quarter, other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter. The gain -- this gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%.  Actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales down 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in managing working capital. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million.  For all of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million and free cash flow was $281 million, with free cash flow conversion 109% of Net Income. Total debt at quarter-end was $2.65 billion, up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far in 2021.  Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $359 million. In the quarter end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times and our net debt to rate -- EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first 9 months of 2021. Our Balance Sheet and tremendous cash flow generation have positioned the Company for significant growth in the coming quarters and years. Kevin (ph).\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill (ph). Angie (ph), we're now ready to open up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. A couple of questions. First, Dave, can you talk about where you were with realized pricing in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, what the spread looked like? You mentioned that it seemed pretty favorable. And then what your thoughts are in terms of how much price you might need to take in '22?\nDave Zapico: Sure Matt (ph). In the third quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. As I said in the prepared remarks, pricing was about 3.5% of sales and inflation was about 2.5% of sales. So we got a spread of about 100 basis points. And we expect in Q4 that'll be similar to Q3 with slightly higher pricing and inflation. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK 's product portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets around the world. In terms of next year, we haven't done the detailed planning, but a key for me is that we're going to stay out ahead of inflation, and I expect that to be true next year. So we'll stay ahead of inflation with price. Did I answer your question, Matt (ph)?\nMatt Summerville: Yes. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, if I just look over the last two years, EMG margins have really migrated into a completely different zip code versus where they were at. I know divesting Reading is a component to that. You did some structural cost outs during when -- due to COVID outbreak. Is there still leverage to drive margins higher in that business? Help me think about how we should think about that going forward.\nDave Zapico: EMG has done a fantastic job in margin development and you mentioned some of the key drivers. We've divested Reading. But fundamentally, we have an automation business that's firing on all cylinders, it's very profitable. We have a thermal management system as part of our defense industry -- defense businesses. It's doing well and has high margin. And we have some part of our [Indiscernible] business that's accelerating. So it is in a new zip-code, but I expect it to stay there and there's still room for margin expansion.\nMatt Summerville: Great. Thank you, Dave (ph).\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Matt (ph).\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: This is actually [Indiscernible] on for Josh. So looking at backlog, where it stands today, how much of that would you call it excess backlog, kind of, based on supply chain issues? And how much should we expect that to contribute to 2022 growth here?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. We have a record backlog of $2.62 billion and -- I wouldn't categorize as excess. I mentioned in an earlier call that customer behavior is to give you more visibility into future months and quarters because there's so many issues in the supply chain. So you have more visibility, but I would not consider as excess, and I would not view us as not keeping up with demand. So really you have a situation where there's strong underlying demand, its resulting in a higher backlog, it's giving us further insight into 2022, and we feel really good about it.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. So what are the biggest inflation and supply-chain issues that we should watch for AMETEK as conditions potentially do start to improve? Is it on the material side, freight, or labor? Just kind of what should we keep our eyes on?\nDave Zapico: That's a good question. During the quarter, we continue to experience challenges with our supply chain, logistics, inflation, labor availability, and it was one of the more dynamic environments I can recall. And these conditions were a bit worse in Q3 than Q2, and we expect those conditions to persist in the fourth quarter. And I would characterize our overall effort in response to these challenges as outstanding. We're clearly showing the agility necessary to navigate these supply chain disruptions. A key, for my view, is the distributed nature of our business model where we have committed P&L managers running their businesses with their own supply chain teams, which allow them to react quickly to changing conditions.  And at the same time, these dedicated business unit teams are working seamlessly with our overall corporate supply chain team that acts with a combined leverage and the authority of all of AMETEK. And this overall approach has been effective for us. I mean, you asked where we had some -- the biggest issues we had. As I mentioned last quarter, it's in semiconductor chip availability. It's an area that's particularly challenging because we use a lot of electronics in our businesses, obviously. And we're using our purchasing leverage to relationships that we build up over decades. Our engineering capability in terms of qualifying second sources in terms of changing designs to solve problems. And we don't expect -- anticipate improvements in the availability of semiconductors until sometime in late 2022.  It's a tough environment and -- but we're reacting well to it, and I was very pleased with our teams. And I point to one thing is distributed business model, where we have very experienced P&L leaders making sure that they're going to satisfy their customers and not letting the supply chain get in the way.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: That's helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Hello, Allison (ph), and good morning.\nAllison Poliniak: I just want to keep in line with the supply chain because obviously you guys are a bit unique in that you've certainly been managing this quite well. Is there a sense, I mean, organic looks very strong, your organic orders are very strong. Is there any tempering of maybe what growth could have been because of some of these supply chain issues or they're really not impactful to you guys in terms of what that expected growth could be or the volume that you were anticipating this quarter?\nDave Zapico: That's a good question, Allison (ph), because what we do is we set our plan based on material availability. And we executed that plan extremely well. In fact, we beat our expectations, but we did, at the end of the quarter, I look at it as if the stars aligned, what could we have shipped without some of the material availability issues? And it was about an additional $50 million that shifted out of Q3 to Q4.  And I feel like we're going to have the same kind of shift out of Q4 into Q1. So we're able to meet demand, we're able to juggle the schedule. Once we lock into the schedule, we're very good at executing it. But there was about $50 million that slipped out. Now, we're not a big labor business. We have a -- labor is not a big cost driver for us. So labor availability is tough, but we're able to get the products manufactured with the labor available. So your answer is $50 million in an ideal world.\nAllison Poliniak: That's helpful, thank you. And then just on the acquisition environment, you obviously deployed a significant amount at the beginning of the year. It sounds like the pipeline as always is pretty active. Any color on, kind of, what you're a little bit more focused on, or what we could see, maybe near-term over the next few months, if the stars align there?\nDave Zapico: Yes. We are very focused on some deals right now, and I don't know if they're going to happen next month or three months from now, but we're very active over the next few months. I mean, the thing you have to be careful of right now is there's a lot of businesses that are out there and you have to sort through them and find the quality, find the gems within those pipelines. And we're good at that. And I just feel the pipeline remains strong. We're very active on exploring opportunities. As Bill mentioned, we have a meaningful level of financing capacity and strong cash flows.  And we also have -- so I think 2022 is going to be a good year for us and we're going to have a tailwind from some of the deals we got done this year. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about what we've got done this year, the quality of businesses that we acquired, and we're feeling good about our pipeline for 2022.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Allison.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deanne Drey with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeanne Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning. Deanne (ph).\nDeanne Dray: Hey. Really solid execution this quarter when many of your peers have struggled.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nDeanne Dray: It was interesting on Allison 's (ph) question there we actually had to drag it out of you that there was a 50 million push out on revenues. We've seen that. And also we've seen where that is like a rolling push-out in -- from 4Q into the first quarter, but I like how the fact that wasn't an excuse. You still put-up strong numbers, so congrats there.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nDeanne Dray: A couple of questions. There is this thought here on the supply chain issues for companies like AMETEK that are higher up the value chain, you're not doing raw material conversions. You're more final test and assembly. So it's the components supply might be -- the impact, might be felt later, so that it -- this might become more of an issue for component supply in the coming quarters. We know it's chip-related already, but is there any sense we think it gets worse from here? Again, where you are on the value chain?\nDave Zapico: Yeah, I don't see it getting worse. As I mentioned, it was worse in Q3 than Q2, but things seem to have stabilized. The comment that I'd make is, it's a good one of your question. And inflation is a concern related to our backlog, but we think it's manageable even with the high-level components. And the first key for me is that you have firm supplier pricing for items in the backlog as much as possible, so you know what your costs are going to be. And then we do have some commodities that we use in various areas, and when possible and we have firm orders, we'll buy forward certain key commodities to locking costs where appropriate.  We're using surcharges to handle increases in shipping costs, increases in transportation costs, higher energy costs, etc. We shortened the length of our quotation validity, the valid time our quotations are out there. So items can be repriced if necessary. And then you take into account the higher costs. And when you can and it's necessary, our customers have been fairly receptive to get to get a price increase due to what's happening right now. So I put that all package together and if we're a bit later than some of the component businesses that may be true.  But at the same time, we're willing -- running well ahead of inflation with our pricing and we plan to stay there and that's going to be a big part of our budgeting process that we're going through. And to understand what's happening in the market, to understand inflation and with 3.5% of price and 2.5% inflation across our entire businesses, I think we're focused on it, and I think we're doing a good job of it, and I think we'll stay in front of it.\nDeanne Dray: That's really helpful. And you mentioned budgeting process. I'd be interested in hearing how the budgeting process for 2022 might be tempered given these circumstances on the supply chain. Would it be the top line being these rolling push outs? Would it also be margins with the labor issues? Just how does this all change your planning assumptions for 2022? And then maybe if you could just give us a comment on October, that would be helpful also.\nDave Zapico: Okay. I will talk about the, I guess our preliminary thoughts on 2022 and, you know, Deanne, we operate in niche markets and we have a comprehensive budgeting process that allows us to understand the market dynamics of these niches in a detailed level. And we begin that process later this month and that process is going to inform our guidance for 2022. In terms of the macro setup, we believe the economic recovery continues. We think overall it's a good macro environment for us. We think the mid-cycle recovery continues.  We think that we'll start to see longer cycle improvement and our Commercial Aero business, our process industries will continue to recover. We're expecting a stable defense spending environment. In terms of some of the headwinds that you mentioned, the challenges from inflation are going to continue and we're going to have to continue to offset inflation with price. And the supply chain may constrain growth. Mainly in the first half of the year. And as I mentioned before, semiconductor availability is a key issue for us. And we remain the final thing as we remain active in capital deployment with significant Balance Sheet capacity with a primary focus on M&A.  So we're really bullish about what we're going to be able to accomplish in 2022 and there's a couple of challenges out there, headwinds, mainly the supply chain that we're actively managed now, but we're still feeling good about 2022.\nDeanne Dray: And comments on October?\nDave Zapico: The comments on the cadence throughout the quarter in October. September was the strongest month of the quarter. It was also the strongest month of the year-to-date and sale -- in the orders. And sales grew sequentially through the quarter with September being strongest month of the quarter. And October was very solid. It was supported of the trend required to meet our guide for Q4, so we're very pleased with how October turned out, and it showed no slowdown at all.\nDeanne Dray: Really helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Deanne.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nDavid: Good morning. This is David Ridley -Lane on for Andrew. Can you give us some additional color on revenue by end-markets and geographies?\nDave Zapico: Sure. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that was a broad-based growth and I'll take a walk around the Company, David. And you look at our process businesses, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter, and they were driven by low teens or organic sales growth, and the contribution from the acquisition of Magnetrol. And our process businesses continue to see broad-based growth, with particularly strong growth within our ultra-precision technologies businesses as new products and differentiated measurement technologies are really driving solid demand across a wide range of markets, including the semiconductor and optics market.  For the full year for process, we now expect to be up low double-digits versus the prior year. Our next major market segment is the aerospace and defense market. And overall, we were up 55% in the third quarter driven by solid organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Abaco.  Organic sales were up high single-digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year. And solid growth in our commercial aftermarket business and our business ship businesses. Those were the 2 areas of strong growth. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for aerospace to -- and defense businesses. And we expect our defense businesses to be up high single-digits and our commercial businesses to be up low single.  So the defense business is still stronger, but it's moderating a bit, and the commercial businesses had a good quarter. Go to the power and industrial market segment next, up nearly 40% in the quarter, driven by mid-20s organic sales growth, so they had a very good quarter. Also, acquisitions from NSI and Crank Software contributed. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-teens organic growth for our power and industrial businesses. And finally, our Automation and Engineered Solutions business and both overall and organic sales were up approximately 25% accelerating from the prior quarter. Sales across our automation businesses remained robust with strong demand continuing in their end markets.  And for all the 2021, we now expect organic sales for our automation in the engineer solutions businesses to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with stronger growth across our automation businesses than our engineered solutions businesses. The automation business is doing very well, as customers want to remove labor from the processes, they want to move things contamination free. We're at capacity. We've invested in the past in the late technologies that are winning share so -- and we're very good at moving things quickly and precisely.  So the automation business is in a really good position with a strong backlog and we're bullish about the future. You mentioned geography. I'll go around the geographies -- a strong broad-based growth across geographies where every geography was up. The U.S. was up 15%, Europe was up 15%, and the star for the quarter was Asia. It was up 25% with broad-based strength and -- notable strength in our process and automation businesses in Asia. That answer your question, David?\nDavid: Perfectly. And then just a quick follow-up, You sort of alluded to it earlier in talking about mid-cycle. This is a pretty strange cycle, so maybe just -- you talk about some of the areas that you are looking for better organic growth in 2022 versus '21. I Imagine there would be some traditional longer-cycle areas like commercial Aero and oil and gas, but also maybe in this particular cycle, things that are tied to patient volumes and that sort of stuff.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, it's -- you mentioned 3 of the areas that I think that we're improving, our commercial aerospace business, so we'll definitely improve our oil and gas business. It's only about 5% of AMETEK now, but it was up mid-teens in the quarter. And given where oil and gas prices are, we're beginning to see the signaling of the project business returning in 2022. So we're feeling good about that and in terms of the healthcare business.  Healthcare is 15% of AMETEK now, so it's our largest end market vertical. We're up mid-teens in the quarter. We had really solid growth in our rolling business, in our record business, really driven by new products and record. And the electrosurgery business, it picked up for us in Q3, so we were up in the quarter. It wasn't up 15%, it was up high single-digits, and we're benefiting from elective surgeries and things like neurostimulation, cardiac mapping, catheters, all that stuff as people are going back to hospitals getting those procedures done, and we expect that to grow -- this quarter was high single-digit number. We expect that to grow more next year.  So you've hit the key issues. Commercial, aerospace, oil and gas, the medical elective surgeries. But I don't think the mid-cycle is done growing yet either, and we're starting to see acceleration in that business across some of our process businesses.\nDavid: Perfect. Thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glenn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Glenn: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Glenn: Hey, Dave. So results really answer a lot of questions in principle. I was actually curious. Any particular areas of share gain or areas of market space creation you want to comment on? You mentioned automation a little bit, just kind of looking to expand on those.\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I would say that when you can deliver your customers give you more orders. And that's the key issue driving our business right now. And when I look at the automation business, I talked about that earlier, that business is doing extremely well. Because of the broader macro, people want to remove labor from the processes. They don't want to be dependent on labor because in some places you can't hire labor and difficult to maintain. You\u2019re at-capacity now, so there's more automation in both discrete automation and factory automation.  We've invested in the right technologies in the last few years, and acquired the right businesses, and we put them together. We have a really compelling value proposition, and we can design customized sub-assemblies that do automation very quickly and efficiently. And that business is doing the right things right now. So we're pretty bullish on the outlook for it. Does that answer your question, Chris (ph)?\nChristopher Glenn: I was curious if there are any other particular areas even if more illustrative than moving the top line by themselves because maybe it's in a discrete niche business, but might speak to illustrate the AMETEK growth model,\nDave Zapico: Right. I think another area that we're starting to see traction in is some of our sustainability solutions. And if you look at our sustainability report, we've done some good work highlighting them. But in the case of greenhouse gas emissions and trying to understand that, we have some instrumentation that's very unique in helping researchers understand the trajectories, In terms of China, the pollution generated from heavy industrial processes requires very durable emissions equipment. That emissions equipment is selling very well for us now in China. So the sustainability solutions will be another thing that we're starting to get our hands around, but it's growing pretty rapidly.\nChristopher Glenn: Great. Thanks for the [Indiscernible]\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nSufia Abdul Rauf: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Good morning.\nSufia Abdul Rauf: Congrats on the awesome quarter. I'm on for Nigel Coe. So really around M&A, do you see any updated thoughts around M&A accretion in fiscal year '22 from your deals this year?\nDave Zapico: No, I think the -- we had talked about the M&A accretion being about $0.18 from deals this year. And I think that we're still in line to deliver that. And Akhil's businesses that we have acquired, we're very pleased with them and they are -- each of these businesses is going to benefit from custom play book developed for them as part of our integration process. And we'll also benefit from AMETEK 's global footprint. And it's early in the ownership, but so far they're integration nicely and we're very bullish with all the businesses. I think in terms of 2022 I'm going to throw that in the bucket of we're going to go through and analyze everything from the all of our business units with our detailed budgeting process. And once we understand everything, we'll come back and communicate that to you.\nSufia Abdul Rauf: Gotcha. And then around EIG sales for the quarter. Do you see that normal seasonal uptick in sales for fourth quarter?\nDave Zapico: There is a bit of seasonality for EIG in the fourth quarter, so you'll see a bit of that.\nSufia Abdul Rauf: All right. Well, that's it from me. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Shlosh with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Shlosh: Hey, there. This is Andrew Shlosh on for Jeff Sprague. How are you?\nDave Zapico: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Shlosh: Just have a couple of quick ones for me, You said the elective surgery business is up high single digits. Do you have a great feel for where electric -- elective procedure volumes are versus 2019?\nDave Zapico: I can't comment on that right now. I can tell you that the business in the first half of the year was -- it was about flattish for us to down a bit. It picked up in Q3 and that high single-digit range, and we expect further growth from here. And that's probably the best I am going to be able to give you.\nAndrew Shlosh: No, that makes sense. I apologize if I missed it. Did you give rattle off some of the end-market detail on the research business?\nDave Zapico: I didn't specifically give the research, is within our process segment. The research business is about 10% of AMETEK. And what you see in that business is it's starting to grow again as people -- industrial research has been strong, but the university research has been impacted by COVID. And people are getting back to the university research environment and is starting to perform -- function normally. And I think the product introduction than we talked about with the Gatan is perfectly targeted at that market. So it's a good market for us. It's not up as much as the AMETEK average, but we're bullish on that market as it begins to heal and they get back to more normal business after COVID.\nAndrew Shlosh: That's great. Appreciate the color there.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.\nKen Newman: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Ken Newman on for Steve.\nDave Zapico: Oh, Ken, how are you doing?\nKen Newman: Good. How are you?\nDave Zapico: Good.\nKen Newman: I think you had mentioned an increase in the RD&E guidance for the year. I'm curious if you just talk about how much growth was driven by new products in the quarter and any color on where the vitality index has been?\nDave Zapico: Right. It's a good question, Ken. In the quarter, our vitality index was 24%, so pretty healthy level for us. And as I mentioned last quarter, we increased our spending on R&D and also on the sales and marketing initiatives that we have. And we have a lot of things that we're funding, and we're bullish and optimistic on them. So we're spending about 5.5% of sales. It's a healthy amount for an industrial business, but we think it gives us a couple of things. One is these new sales from -- new product sales, but also.  it gives us the ability to raise price because we're investing for our customers and we're going to have the latest products that have the most value for our customers. So the investments that we make, we also link to the pricing capability in our business. So that's an important factor for us.\nKen Newman: Okay. And when I think about the impact of shifting sales from out of the third quarter into the next one because of supply chain issues, does that impact the mix of new products coming to market at all or would you still expect any kind of material expansion in that vitality index?\nBill Burke: I think 24% is a pretty good level, but I'd like to see it, mid-twenties are probably what we're targeting and I think the -- in terms of new product introductions, to the extent that a new product introduction relies on electronics or semiconductors, it could be delayed, but it's broader than new products. It's across a semiconductor chip availability is the one area in particular that we're very focused on because of the challenges with the constrained supply.\nKen Newman: Right. And that kind of Segway\u2019s pretty well into my next -- in my follow-up question. Just on the semiconductor shortage, obviously you've got a very diverse set of businesses that spreads the gamut of computing needs. As we think of the kinds of chips needed for the embedded computer business in Abaco versus your automation business, can you just give us an idea of how much of the semi exposure is toward more of the bleeding edge chips versus the trailing edge?\nBill Burke: Yeah, I think the microprocessors and the higher-end chips are the ones that are particularly -- the cheap availability is particularly an issue right now. But we have such a broad-based portfolio of products\nDave Zapico: and we're using different chips in different businesses so there's really not one chip or one product. It's just an -- it's not in the passive component, it's an active component, and it's in more of the microprocessors. But it affects our EIG business more than EMG. But that's something that we're focused on and we did a great job managing it in Q3. And as I said, we have a lot of people that we're -- have relationships that are over a long period of time. We're using our purchasing leverage and probably most importantly, if our product is not available, we use our engineering capability to qualify second sources, to find alternatives, we set up a group within our Company. It's both our Bangalore engineers and some of our engineers in Europe, and some of our engineers in the U.S. and there's a team that's quickly going through these things when product availability comes through. The one of the things that we've been able to differentiate versus maybe some other people in the market is we have the strong engineering capability that can work on these problems that they come up and solve them quickly.\nKen Newman: Good color. Thank you very much.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back to Kevin Coleman for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Angie (ph). And thank everyone for joining our call today.

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin (ph), and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another outstanding quarter, with better-than-expected sales growth, strong operating performance, and earnings above our expectations. We established records for sales, EBITDA, operating income, and earnings per share in the quarter. Demand remains strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth and a record backlog. While the global supply chain and logistics networks remains challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results which exceeded our expectations. Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues, as well as the strength, flexibility, and sustainability of the Grand AMETEK growth model. AMETEK 's proven business model was central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. We're very proud of the important steps we are taking to further sustainability across AMETEK. And last week, we published our latest corporate sustainability report to highlight our efforts in this area. This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made, and the commitments we are making to create a better future. I welcome you all to read our latest corporate sustainability report, which is located on our website. Now, let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% of the same period in 2020 and above our expectations. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 11 points, and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Overall, orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior-year period. While organic orders were up an impressive 31% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year. Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020, and operating margins were 23.4%.  Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 28.8%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, up 25% over the third quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of a $1.16 to $1.18. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow with third quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion of 109% of Net Income. Overall, tremendous results in a challenging operating environment.  Next, let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter. Organic sales were up 15%, acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency was a modest [indiscernible] While growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our ultra-precision technologies and our Power and Industrial businesses. EIG third quarter operating income was a record $245 million up 20% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 25%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG 's core margins were excellent at 27.2% in line with prior year margins.  The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Third quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million. Organic sales were up 20% and currency added 1 point to growth. Growth remains strong across all of the EMG with our automation businesses, again, delivering notably strong growth in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior-year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. AMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of capital deployment, lean to the acquisition of 5 highly strategic businesses.  AMETEK has deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK 's acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies. Our proven operating capabilities allow us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital. Generating strong returns on capital deployed is critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK 's strategy. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy. Our acquisition pipeline remains very active.  Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters. We also remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support the organic growth initiatives, including in support of their new product development efforts. In the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in RD&E, and for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. Through these investments, our businesses develop unique and highly differentiated solutions to help solve our customers most complex challenges. One such example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan.  Gatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy supporting high-end research and materials on life sciences applications. Gatan recently introduced the Stela hybrid pixel camera. The only fully integrated hybrid pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy suite. This new product reinforces Gatan 's leadership position, providing the highest quality TEM diffraction camera, allowing the user to perform 4D stem analysis for the [Indiscernible] and high dynamic range.  Gatans 's new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology. In August, the Stela camera was awarded the 2021 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and called one of the 10 game - changing products and methods. I would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of the Stela camera, and broader support of important research applications. Now, let me touch on the supply chain issues. The global supply chain remains challenging.  We see extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, with logistics issues and labor availability adding to the complexity. While these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for the quarter, and are navigating the challenging environment well, given our agile operating approach. This supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, given our differentiation we we're able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread. While we expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well-positioned to navigate the issues given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model.  Moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, and the continuous strong order to momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guides. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20% range versus our previous guide of two up approximately 20%. Organic sales are now expected to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis over 2020 as compared to our previous [indiscernible] of approximately 10%. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020 as comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.68 per diluted share.  For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30, up 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter. In summary, AMETEK 's third quarter results were excellent. Our teams continued to execute and our businesses are performing well. Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model. The asset led nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success.  The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of the AMETEK stakeholders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill. Sure Matt (ph). In the third quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. As I said in the prepared remarks, pricing was about 3.5% of sales and inflation was about 2.5% of sales. So we got a spread of about 100 basis points. And we expect in Q4 that'll be similar to Q3 with slightly higher pricing and inflation. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK 's product portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets around the world. In terms of next year, we haven't done the detailed planning, but a key for me is that we're going to stay out ahead of inflation, and I expect that to be true next year. So we'll stay ahead of inflation with price. Did I answer your question, Matt (ph)? EMG has done a fantastic job in margin development and you mentioned some of the key drivers. We've divested Reading. But fundamentally, we have an automation business that's firing on all cylinders, it's very profitable. We have a thermal management system as part of our defense industry -- defense businesses. It's doing well and has high margin. And we have some part of our [Indiscernible] business that's accelerating. So it is in a new zip-code, but I expect it to stay there and there's still room for margin expansion. Thank you, Matt (ph). Yeah. We have a record backlog of $2.62 billion and -- I wouldn't categorize as excess. I mentioned in an earlier call that customer behavior is to give you more visibility into future months and quarters because there's so many issues in the supply chain. So you have more visibility, but I would not consider as excess, and I would not view us as not keeping up with demand. So really you have a situation where there's strong underlying demand, its resulting in a higher backlog, it's giving us further insight into 2022, and we feel really good about it. That's a good question. During the quarter, we continue to experience challenges with our supply chain, logistics, inflation, labor availability, and it was one of the more dynamic environments I can recall. And these conditions were a bit worse in Q3 than Q2, and we expect those conditions to persist in the fourth quarter. And I would characterize our overall effort in response to these challenges as outstanding. We're clearly showing the agility necessary to navigate these supply chain disruptions. A key, for my view, is the distributed nature of our business model where we have committed P&L managers running their businesses with their own supply chain teams, which allow them to react quickly to changing conditions.  And at the same time, these dedicated business unit teams are working seamlessly with our overall corporate supply chain team that acts with a combined leverage and the authority of all of AMETEK. And this overall approach has been effective for us. I mean, you asked where we had some -- the biggest issues we had. As I mentioned last quarter, it's in semiconductor chip availability. It's an area that's particularly challenging because we use a lot of electronics in our businesses, obviously. And we're using our purchasing leverage to relationships that we build up over decades. Our engineering capability in terms of qualifying second sources in terms of changing designs to solve problems. And we don't expect -- anticipate improvements in the availability of semiconductors until sometime in late 2022.  It's a tough environment and -- but we're reacting well to it, and I was very pleased with our teams. And I point to one thing is distributed business model, where we have very experienced P&L leaders making sure that they're going to satisfy their customers and not letting the supply chain get in the way. Thank you. Hello, Allison (ph), and good morning. That's a good question, Allison (ph), because what we do is we set our plan based on material availability. And we executed that plan extremely well. In fact, we beat our expectations, but we did, at the end of the quarter, I look at it as if the stars aligned, what could we have shipped without some of the material availability issues? And it was about an additional $50 million that shifted out of Q3 to Q4.  And I feel like we're going to have the same kind of shift out of Q4 into Q1. So we're able to meet demand, we're able to juggle the schedule. Once we lock into the schedule, we're very good at executing it. But there was about $50 million that slipped out. Now, we're not a big labor business. We have a -- labor is not a big cost driver for us. So labor availability is tough, but we're able to get the products manufactured with the labor available. So your answer is $50 million in an ideal world. Yes. We are very focused on some deals right now, and I don't know if they're going to happen next month or three months from now, but we're very active over the next few months. I mean, the thing you have to be careful of right now is there's a lot of businesses that are out there and you have to sort through them and find the quality, find the gems within those pipelines. And we're good at that. And I just feel the pipeline remains strong. We're very active on exploring opportunities. As Bill mentioned, we have a meaningful level of financing capacity and strong cash flows.  And we also have -- so I think 2022 is going to be a good year for us and we're going to have a tailwind from some of the deals we got done this year. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about what we've got done this year, the quality of businesses that we acquired, and we're feeling good about our pipeline for 2022. Thank you, Allison. Good morning. Deanne (ph). Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I don't see it getting worse. As I mentioned, it was worse in Q3 than Q2, but things seem to have stabilized. The comment that I'd make is, it's a good one of your question. And inflation is a concern related to our backlog, but we think it's manageable even with the high-level components. And the first key for me is that you have firm supplier pricing for items in the backlog as much as possible, so you know what your costs are going to be. And then we do have some commodities that we use in various areas, and when possible and we have firm orders, we'll buy forward certain key commodities to locking costs where appropriate.  We're using surcharges to handle increases in shipping costs, increases in transportation costs, higher energy costs, etc. We shortened the length of our quotation validity, the valid time our quotations are out there. So items can be repriced if necessary. And then you take into account the higher costs. And when you can and it's necessary, our customers have been fairly receptive to get to get a price increase due to what's happening right now. So I put that all package together and if we're a bit later than some of the component businesses that may be true.  But at the same time, we're willing -- running well ahead of inflation with our pricing and we plan to stay there and that's going to be a big part of our budgeting process that we're going through. And to understand what's happening in the market, to understand inflation and with 3.5% of price and 2.5% inflation across our entire businesses, I think we're focused on it, and I think we're doing a good job of it, and I think we'll stay in front of it. Okay. I will talk about the, I guess our preliminary thoughts on 2022 and, you know, Deanne, we operate in niche markets and we have a comprehensive budgeting process that allows us to understand the market dynamics of these niches in a detailed level. And we begin that process later this month and that process is going to inform our guidance for 2022. In terms of the macro setup, we believe the economic recovery continues. We think overall it's a good macro environment for us. We think the mid-cycle recovery continues.  We think that we'll start to see longer cycle improvement and our Commercial Aero business, our process industries will continue to recover. We're expecting a stable defense spending environment. In terms of some of the headwinds that you mentioned, the challenges from inflation are going to continue and we're going to have to continue to offset inflation with price. And the supply chain may constrain growth. Mainly in the first half of the year. And as I mentioned before, semiconductor availability is a key issue for us. And we remain the final thing as we remain active in capital deployment with significant Balance Sheet capacity with a primary focus on M&A.  So we're really bullish about what we're going to be able to accomplish in 2022 and there's a couple of challenges out there, headwinds, mainly the supply chain that we're actively managed now, but we're still feeling good about 2022. The comments on the cadence throughout the quarter in October. September was the strongest month of the quarter. It was also the strongest month of the year-to-date and sale -- in the orders. And sales grew sequentially through the quarter with September being strongest month of the quarter. And October was very solid. It was supported of the trend required to meet our guide for Q4, so we're very pleased with how October turned out, and it showed no slowdown at all. Thank you, Deanne. Sure. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that was a broad-based growth and I'll take a walk around the Company, David. And you look at our process businesses, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter, and they were driven by low teens or organic sales growth, and the contribution from the acquisition of Magnetrol. And our process businesses continue to see broad-based growth, with particularly strong growth within our ultra-precision technologies businesses as new products and differentiated measurement technologies are really driving solid demand across a wide range of markets, including the semiconductor and optics market.  For the full year for process, we now expect to be up low double-digits versus the prior year. Our next major market segment is the aerospace and defense market. And overall, we were up 55% in the third quarter driven by solid organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Abaco.  Organic sales were up high single-digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year. And solid growth in our commercial aftermarket business and our business ship businesses. Those were the 2 areas of strong growth. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for aerospace to -- and defense businesses. And we expect our defense businesses to be up high single-digits and our commercial businesses to be up low single.  So the defense business is still stronger, but it's moderating a bit, and the commercial businesses had a good quarter. Go to the power and industrial market segment next, up nearly 40% in the quarter, driven by mid-20s organic sales growth, so they had a very good quarter. Also, acquisitions from NSI and Crank Software contributed. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-teens organic growth for our power and industrial businesses. And finally, our Automation and Engineered Solutions business and both overall and organic sales were up approximately 25% accelerating from the prior quarter. Sales across our automation businesses remained robust with strong demand continuing in their end markets.  And for all the 2021, we now expect organic sales for our automation in the engineer solutions businesses to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with stronger growth across our automation businesses than our engineered solutions businesses. The automation business is doing very well, as customers want to remove labor from the processes, they want to move things contamination free. We're at capacity. We've invested in the past in the late technologies that are winning share so -- and we're very good at moving things quickly and precisely.  So the automation business is in a really good position with a strong backlog and we're bullish about the future. You mentioned geography. I'll go around the geographies -- a strong broad-based growth across geographies where every geography was up. The U.S. was up 15%, Europe was up 15%, and the star for the quarter was Asia. It was up 25% with broad-based strength and -- notable strength in our process and automation businesses in Asia. That answer your question, David? Yeah. I mean, it's -- you mentioned 3 of the areas that I think that we're improving, our commercial aerospace business, so we'll definitely improve our oil and gas business. It's only about 5% of AMETEK now, but it was up mid-teens in the quarter. And given where oil and gas prices are, we're beginning to see the signaling of the project business returning in 2022. So we're feeling good about that and in terms of the healthcare business.  Healthcare is 15% of AMETEK now, so it's our largest end market vertical. We're up mid-teens in the quarter. We had really solid growth in our rolling business, in our record business, really driven by new products and record. And the electrosurgery business, it picked up for us in Q3, so we were up in the quarter. It wasn't up 15%, it was up high single-digits, and we're benefiting from elective surgeries and things like neurostimulation, cardiac mapping, catheters, all that stuff as people are going back to hospitals getting those procedures done, and we expect that to grow -- this quarter was high single-digit number. We expect that to grow more next year.  So you've hit the key issues. Commercial, aerospace, oil and gas, the medical elective surgeries. But I don't think the mid-cycle is done growing yet either, and we're starting to see acceleration in that business across some of our process businesses. Thank you. Good morning, Chris. Yeah. I would say that when you can deliver your customers give you more orders. And that's the key issue driving our business right now. And when I look at the automation business, I talked about that earlier, that business is doing extremely well. Because of the broader macro, people want to remove labor from the processes. They don't want to be dependent on labor because in some places you can't hire labor and difficult to maintain. You\u2019re at-capacity now, so there's more automation in both discrete automation and factory automation.  We've invested in the right technologies in the last few years, and acquired the right businesses, and we put them together. We have a really compelling value proposition, and we can design customized sub-assemblies that do automation very quickly and efficiently. And that business is doing the right things right now. So we're pretty bullish on the outlook for it. Does that answer your question, Chris (ph)? Right. I think another area that we're starting to see traction in is some of our sustainability solutions. And if you look at our sustainability report, we've done some good work highlighting them. But in the case of greenhouse gas emissions and trying to understand that, we have some instrumentation that's very unique in helping researchers understand the trajectories, In terms of China, the pollution generated from heavy industrial processes requires very durable emissions equipment. That emissions equipment is selling very well for us now in China. So the sustainability solutions will be another thing that we're starting to get our hands around, but it's growing pretty rapidly. Thank you. Good morning. No, I think the -- we had talked about the M&A accretion being about $0.18 from deals this year. And I think that we're still in line to deliver that. And Akhil's businesses that we have acquired, we're very pleased with them and they are -- each of these businesses is going to benefit from custom play book developed for them as part of our integration process. And we'll also benefit from AMETEK 's global footprint. And it's early in the ownership, but so far they're integration nicely and we're very bullish with all the businesses. I think in terms of 2022 I'm going to throw that in the bucket of we're going to go through and analyze everything from the all of our business units with our detailed budgeting process. And once we understand everything, we'll come back and communicate that to you. There is a bit of seasonality for EIG in the fourth quarter, so you'll see a bit of that. Okay, thank you. Hi, Andrew. I can't comment on that right now. I can tell you that the business in the first half of the year was -- it was about flattish for us to down a bit. It picked up in Q3 and that high single-digit range, and we expect further growth from here. And that's probably the best I am going to be able to give you. I didn't specifically give the research, is within our process segment. The research business is about 10% of AMETEK. And what you see in that business is it's starting to grow again as people -- industrial research has been strong, but the university research has been impacted by COVID. And people are getting back to the university research environment and is starting to perform -- function normally. And I think the product introduction than we talked about with the Gatan is perfectly targeted at that market. So it's a good market for us. It's not up as much as the AMETEK average, but we're bullish on that market as it begins to heal and they get back to more normal business after COVID. Thank you. Oh, Ken, how are you doing? Good. Right. It's a good question, Ken. In the quarter, our vitality index was 24%, so pretty healthy level for us. And as I mentioned last quarter, we increased our spending on R&D and also on the sales and marketing initiatives that we have. And we have a lot of things that we're funding, and we're bullish and optimistic on them. So we're spending about 5.5% of sales. It's a healthy amount for an industrial business, but we think it gives us a couple of things. One is these new sales from -- new product sales, but also.  it gives us the ability to raise price because we're investing for our customers and we're going to have the latest products that have the most value for our customers. So the investments that we make, we also link to the pricing capability in our business. So that's an important factor for us. and we're using different chips in different businesses so there's really not one chip or one product. It's just an -- it's not in the passive component, it's an active component, and it's in more of the microprocessors. But it affects our EIG business more than EMG. But that's something that we're focused on and we did a great job managing it in Q3. And as I said, we have a lot of people that we're -- have relationships that are over a long period of time. We're using our purchasing leverage and probably most importantly, if our product is not available, we use our engineering capability to qualify second sources, to find alternatives, we set up a group within our Company. It's both our Bangalore engineers and some of our engineers in Europe, and some of our engineers in the U.S. and there's a team that's quickly going through these things when product availability comes through. The one of the things that we've been able to differentiate versus maybe some other people in the market is we have the strong engineering capability that can work on these problems that they come up and solve them quickly. Thank you."

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, with continued strong sales growth, and orders growth, and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter, general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter unchanged from the prior year.  For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million driven by higher compensation costs or approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year. Third quarter, other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter. The gain -- this gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%.  Actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales down 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in managing working capital. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million.  For all of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million and free cash flow was $281 million, with free cash flow conversion 109% of Net Income. Total debt at quarter-end was $2.65 billion, up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far in 2021.  Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $359 million. In the quarter end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times and our net debt to rate -- EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first 9 months of 2021. Our Balance Sheet and tremendous cash flow generation have positioned the Company for significant growth in the coming quarters and years. Kevin (ph). I think 24% is a pretty good level, but I'd like to see it, mid-twenties are probably what we're targeting and I think the -- in terms of new product introductions, to the extent that a new product introduction relies on electronics or semiconductors, it could be delayed, but it's broader than new products. It's across a semiconductor chip availability is the one area in particular that we're very focused on because of the challenges with the constrained supply. Yeah, I think the microprocessors and the higher-end chips are the ones that are particularly -- the cheap availability is particularly an issue right now. But we have such a broad-based portfolio of products"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization, and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of 2020, and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance let to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations. We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income, and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery, and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams. We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid and long cycle business profile. The five acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely, and are well-positioned to drive strong growth. Given our second quarter results and outlook for back-half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Now, let me turn to our second quarter results. Our businesses saw robust broad-based sales growth in the quarter. Overall, sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020. Organic sales growth was 25%; acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added two points. Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year. Our businesses also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter. While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges, as is reflected in our results. Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020, and operating margins expanded 40 basis points, to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points of 24%. EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%. This operating performance let to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020, and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10. Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% in income. Let me revise some additional details of the operating group level. Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter. Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 27%, recent acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency added nearly two points. EIG's second quarter operating income was $227 million, up 42% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 24.3%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus their prior year, to $452 million. Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added three points to the quarter. Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses, with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 32% compared to the prior-year period and EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to record 24.9%. Now switching to our acquisition strategy, as we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter. These acquisitions, as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software, and EGS are performing very well, and the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year. Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products, and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications. In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E and for the full-year we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments. In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our finance sales and marketing functions, along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth. As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion, despite having to absorb the return of temporary costs into our cost structure. While we were seeing higher levels of inflation, due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we're capturing higher levels of price given our differentiated solutions, allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread. Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives. For the full-year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings. Now, moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021, given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our order momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. For the full-year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis, and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb with excellent sales and order growth and high quality earnings growth exceeded expectations. Our strong operating performance in the first-half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated technology solutions and market leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time. The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders. I'll now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter and we'll be glad to take your questions, Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance, and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior-year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter, versus 1.7% in the same period last year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6%, compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year. The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. range and the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full-year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share. As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow was $264 million, with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income. Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion, offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million. As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems, and NSI-MI. This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software, and Magnetrol which were completed in the first quarter of the year. Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on five strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021. At quarter end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio and our net debt to EBITDA ratio were 1.9 times and 1.6 times, respectively. Remain well-positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy given our strong financial capacity and flexibility. At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations. The performance of our businesses through the first-half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation, and the dedication of our world-class workforce has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021, and beyond. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Michelle, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. A couple of questions, Dave, you mentioned price costs, but could you talk about what sort of spread you actually experienced in Q2? What your realization was in terms of price year-on-year, and whether you're contemplating any incremental pricing actions or surcharges in the back-half?\nDave Zapico: Great question, Matt. In the second quarter, we were very pleased that our pricing continues to offset inflation. We achieved about 3% of price across our entire portfolio, and total inflation was about two points. So, we had about a 100 basis point positive spread. And we want to stay in front of it. We want to stay there. And with all the acquisitions that we did and all the costs from those acquisitions, it showed up. We had 170 basis points of core margin expansion. And that pricing really helped us deliver that. So, we're ahead of the game now, we plan on staying there. There is increasing inflation, but with the 3% pricing and the 2% inflation, we were very pleased with our performance during the quarter.\nMatt Summerville: And then just as a follow-up, can you speak to the organic order cadence you experienced over the course of the quarter? And if you can give us a read on maybe what you saw in July? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes, sure. I mean as we said before, the organic orders were up substantially. During the quarter, they grew every month, with June being the strongest month of the quarter. Sales also grew every month sequentially. And June was also the strongest month of the quarter, and so a very strong trend during the quarter. And then with July, it was a very solid month, and was supportive of our forecast and guide. So, we feel real good about the orders trend in the business.\nMatt Summerville: Great. Thank you, guys.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Dave, just on the inflation discussion, I guess the material side is only one piece of it. You have labor, you have logistics costs, there's kind of a cocktail of things in there.\nDave Zapico: Right.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: How should we think of 2Q as being kind of the high watermark of inflation for the year relative to the back-half? Like when does that [indiscernible] or perhaps get a little easier?\nDave Zapico: Yes, the number that I gave you, the 2%, is total inflation in our business, so that's not just material, that's total inflation. And then in terms of peaking out, I mean it's -- inflation is increasing, we're staying in front of it. I don't think we're ready to say it's peaked yet. I think that there is an element of temporary cost spiking, but it's very difficult to bifurcate that between the underlying inflation and what's happening on a temporary basis. So, the honest answer is we're not sure, but we're going to stay ahead it. And that's the way we're managing the business.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just in terms of the end markets or customer behaviors that are standing out. This recovery seems unusual in a few different ways, but are you guys seeing kind of the classic more CapEx-facing applications or industries bounce back or is it all just sort of in the mix together? Or anything you could sort of comment on that would be helpful.\nDave Zapico: Yes, great. Yes, what we're seeing is kind of -- we saw this quarter the beginning of what I think is classic mid cycle recovery. So, we're mainly mid cycle and long cycle businesses, and we're seeing the beginning of a mid cycle recovery. And what we saw on our businesses are our automation and engineered solution businesses, those were classic mid cycle. That picked up earlier in the year, and it's staying strong. But we saw during the quarter, our power business really picked up. And the organic growth of our power business was a strong mid 30% organic growth, so that's -- I think the cycle is kind of following along what we think, where our automation businesses would kind of lead us in, and then we have the process and power businesses. And then down the road, maybe even a year or two we have our commercial aerospace business. So, the cycle is kind of following what we think. It's a little bit difficult to bifurcate the classic cycle from customers trying to get in the queue and reacting to supply chain issue, and the COVID rebound that we're all seeing. But I'm feeling really confident. And the underlying demand strength can have a longer tail as part of a broader cycle, because I think the industrial world has not invested a lot over the last five years, and we're well-positioned to benefit from that investment. So, I'm kind of seeing beneath this COVID recovery the -- a classic cyclical recovery, and it's really hitting our businesses at the part of the cycle where we think it would be. Does -- so that help you out a little bit?\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Perfect, great color. Thanks, Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning.\nAllison Poliniak: I just want to go back to your comment on the incremental investment into the business. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of where that incremental investment is going, is it specific verticals or is it much more broad spread, just any additional color would be helpful?\nDave Zapico: Sure. As we said, we're putting about $100 million of incremental investment in our P&L. And that was raised about $5 million from the last quarter, so some new opportunities are coming up. And I'd put it in several areas. I mean we're investing in core product development. That's the future of our business, and we want to stay with the best benefits in our products with our customers. That's happening, that's about probably a third of that $100 million. And then the other two-thirds is in sales and marketing and our digitization effort. So, we're doing a lot of things to improve our customer-facing capability. We're doing a lot of things around digital marketing, our sales force effectiveness. And teams are motivated and is working well, and we've able to do continued investing during the depths of the virus, and we're accelerating now. So, it's $100 million, it's in product development, and it's in sales and marketing, but a lot of it is in the digital space.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. And then just a little bit -- see if you could give a little color on maybe more the commercial aerospace marketing. I know we're getting a lot of concerns with the Delta variant. Has that altered your view in terms of the recovery of either the MRO or just the commercial aerospace market in general?\nDave Zapico: Great question. The commercial aerospace is about 7% of our portfolio now. And we're obviously watching that Delta variant very closely, because we're not sure exactly what's going to happen. We haven't seen a downturn yet from the Delta variant. And our commercial aerospace business had a very good quarter. I mean we were up 25% in commercial aerospace. Our aftermarket business and our business jet market were stronger than our OEM markets. And that business, for the year, we haven't changed our outlook for the year. For our whole aerospace and defense business, we're still staying up low-to-mid single digits, so we're not seeing the same kind of traction in that business right now, partially because the aftermarket is doing better than the OE business. But it's stabilized for sure, it's 7% of our business, and we're watching it closely with the Delta variant. I mean we haven't seen a change yet in passenger model, but that could happen. So, that's the best information I can give you.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nScott Graham: Thank you. Hi, Dave, Bill, and Kevin.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Graham: Good morning to you. So, I was just wondering, could you kind of quantify what the add-backs of the temporary reduction costs from last year were in the second quarter and maybe a feel for the second-half?\nDave Zapico: Yes, the best way I can answer is we talked about, last year; we had about $90 million in temporary costs that we removed from the P&L. Now we're at, fast-forward to the end of Q2, so about a month ago, they came in during the quarter. But by the end of the quarter they were pretty much all backend, except out travel expenses. So there was about $10 million or $15 million of travel expenses. They're bleeding in slower than we anticipated earlier in the year, but largely all the expenses, besides travel, are back in the P&L.\nScott Graham: So, correct me, if you would, on the math on that. So, we will see some add-backs in the third quarter and fourth quarter, but on a declining basis?\nDave Zapico: Yes, that there'll definitely be add-backs because we'll get full quarter effects, and there will also be some headwinds from our compensation system. We're -- we budget, we target our compensation systems, and we're having a good year, so there's a headwind from that too. So, there'll be some additional costs in the second-half of the year that will impact that.\nScott Graham: Got it, thank you. Would you mind giving us, Dave, a sketch of what your research market looks like right now?\nDave Zapico: Yes, the research market is doing well. It's starting to pick up a bit. But that market is probably more impacted than the classic industrial market, because a lot of the research institutions were slow to start up. There's difficulty getting access to the facilities. So, the market is hanging in there, it's doing well. But it's certainly not inflecting up as much as in the general industrial markets.\nScott Graham: Okay, thank you. And then, lastly, on the acquisition pipeline. I know you talked about the $2 billion of availability. What does that number look like in terms of the capacity, because, certainly, you can borrow some more, and what have you, and -- but more importantly, what does the quality of the pipeline look like right now? You talked about, on the last call, the possibility of doing in the second-half something close to what you did in the first-half. Could you update us on that thinking? Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Yes, our teams are very active now. And we certainly -- we'd like to get a deal done between now and the end of the year, but there's no guarantee on that. There's a lot of properties in the market, there's a lot of activity going on right now for sure, but finding those gems that we acquire and end up becoming a part of the AMETEK portfolio is a different story. As we told you before many times, our acquisition strategy is not capital-limited, it's finding the right acquisitions to acquire, and we're very active now, and our teams are doing a great job. In terms of the capacity to-do deals, maybe I'll have Bill comment on that.\nBill Burke: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Yes, certainly, you made the point, we could go borrow more, and our banks and others tell us they're more than happy to lend to us. That couple of billion dollars would still only give us a mid-twos kind of leverage. So, still you could even say somewhat underleveraged for the company. So, plenty of opportunity and plenty of resources available to us to do even more than the $2 billion, and I think as Dave mentioned, this isn't a capital-constrained strategy, this is finding the right businesses to fit with our portfolio that we think can generate value for our shareholders over the long-term.\nScott Graham: Yes. Okay. Thank you, both.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Hi. Yes, good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question, just putting a couple of things together, you've said, you are adding to growth investments. And I know what it takes for AMETEK to sort of loosen its first strings. You did talk about underinvestment among the industrials over the past five years. Looking forward, do you see structurally high need for CapEx over the next couple of years from your customers?\nDave Zapico: Yes, there could be. There could be yet a situation where you had the industrial recession in the 2015-2016 timeframe. And then we had a few years of good growth, but then we had the pandemic. So, clearly, supply chains are stressed and people are going to put -- they're dealing with the current issues, but there's going to be some capacity put in. And I think that that could be one of the outcomes of this economic cycle that we're in. So, we're pretty bullish on the industrial cycle right now. And we think there -- as I mentioned earlier, there is a COVID bounce, and it's pretty difficult to bifurcate the COVID bounce from the long-term growth, but we certainly are seeing customers planning in a way that's different than just a bounce.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you. And then the follow-up question, I mean people ask me about Delta variant impact on aerospace, but I think there are also some headlines in Asia, people trying to figure out if Delta variant is having any impact on rate of growth in Asia, and China specifically. Could you just talk about what it is you're seeing in China, Asia, not only as end market, but also what are you hearing from your supply chain? Is Delta variant sort of something that you're tracking in that region? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes, during the second quarter we had a pretty good month in Asia -- pretty good quarter in Asia, we were up about 30%. And it was a broad-based strength. It was notable strength in many of our businesses, but our automation business and our process instruments business stood out. And specifically within Asia, China growth was up 27%. So, it remains strong. And in China, our process instrumentation businesses did very well. So, we're still seeing solid growth in China. We've understand the press reports as well as anybody about what's going on in those regions. We're still operating all of our plants. We do have pockets where we're dealing with some COVID issues right now. But it's not unlike it's been the past three or four months, except the fact that there's probably a little more spread in China now. So, we're watching that closely, and -- but to your point, the China growth remains strong for us, 27% was the growth in the quarter.\nAndrew Obin: Really appreciate the answers. Great quarter, thanks a lot.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Just coming around to the deals and actually what you've done year-to-date, I think you were previously thinking about $0.18 or so accretion this year and a carryover benefit of $0.35 to $0.38 and into next year. Just wondering now that these assets are actually fully in-house and you're betting them down, does that outlook change much and does anything in particular stand out?\nBill Burke: No, I think the same outlook. It's we haven't changed it at all. And we said, we get about $0.18 of benefit in 2021, and it's looking like that's going to be a good number for us.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And then just coming back to kind of supply chains that, I'm sorry, I was on the call a few minutes late, but was there any place in the portfolio where you were unable to kind of meet demand or there was issues up and down the supply chain somewhere else where perhaps even you could deliver, but the customer didn't necessarily want it because of their own issues with deliverability and availability?\nDave Zapico: Yes. There were issues like that going on all over Jeff, but I'd say that in general, in the second quarter, our teams did an excellent job and we had the material and we had the labor and we had the execution to get out what we needed to. There are certainly challenges in that broader materials and logistics right now, our guidance reflects the known risks. These issues are going to be with us for some period of time. And we're managing the issue with dedicated business unit personnel. So, each business unit has a team on their supply chain, but we also have an overlay over company-wide resources or global sourcing team and they're doing an effective job right now. The big area of focus for us right now is on semiconductor chip availability. And we're looking at that very closely trying to do secure our supply chains. And you can end up with a situation where you think you have a firm delivery and the day comes from the delivery and it's not there. I think everybody in the industrial world is delivering with that right now. And it causes with me a game of Whac-A-Mole where you're scrambling to get your output out but our people did a good job in the second quarter. And there is an element of prudent judgment in our second-half guide. But our guidance reflects all of our known risks.\nJeff Sprague: Great. I appreciate the perspective. Thanks a lot.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question on the line of Christopher Glenn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glenn: Thanks. Good morning, Dave, Bill, and Kevin. So I just wanted to clarify Dave, I think you said June had the highest rate of year-over-year orders and sales organic growth. I would've thought the comps got, got steeper from April through June. So one just wanted to clarify and two what's implied there if you're accelerating on steeper comps.\nDave Zapico: Yes. I may have said the wrong thing if I said acceleration of the orders, both orders and sales grew sequentially every month, but June being the highest strongest month of the quarter. So, that doesn't mean that they're ready to change; accelerated, that means that June was higher the May, May was higher than April, for both orders, and we had a very strong trend in July also.\nChristopher Glenn: Okay. Thanks. I might've heard you right. And then just wanting to go into your advanced motion controls, motion solutions, you talked about front end investment there. I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of the types of automation architectures. There are changes going there. Is that coming your way in particular, had increasing front end competitiveness, just curious kind of panoramic of that automation space?\nDave Zapico: Yes. A lot of what we're doing is discrete automation and we've also done some factory automation and we've invested heavily over the past few years. So position our product portfolio and our capability at the top of the market, and we're benefiting from it now because as customers ramp up, our automation technology is helping them better serve their customer bases and the demand has been strong for many quarters. And we don't expect that to change.\nChristopher Glenn: Okay. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: So I actually also had a question just on the comments on industrial investment in CapEx, etcetera. I'm a little bit curious if you flush it out. Are you hearing the desire to spend coming back from your customers? There may be some technology changes that are encouraging automation, localization and so forth. And I'm just curious if that's kind of where you think things will go based or whether you're hearing it strongly. And then just maybe a comment on breadth of industry, I don't know if that's focused a little bit more on pharma and medical or wide across the businesses, do you have an insight into. Thank you. Bye.\nDave Zapico: Yes, the first point is I think localization of manufacturing and people developing more durable supply chains is definitely one of the drivers of the demand we're seeing. What was your second question Rob? It was the \nRob Wertheimer: Well, so whether technology changes are also doing it and then breadth of portfolio.\nDave Zapico: Breadth of portfolio, so again, the first part of the question, we're definitely seeing localization drive demand. Those people look for more durable, more local supply chains. What we're really seeing it, if you go through our portfolio, look let's start with our process businesses with our largest business. It grew mid-20s organic during the quarter. Really strong levels demand essentially all MRs, leading to really robust sales and orders. Our growth was particularly strong in one of our instrumentation businesses called our ultra precision technology business that had a great quarter and they're benefiting from a metrology measurement technology related to automation. And you think about the power and industrial business, that business was up 30% organic in the quarter. The businesses that did well there, both segments power and industrial and particularly strong growth in our Brookfield business and our [indiscernible] business. Again, that was broad-based. And the power and industrial business was kind of one of the lagers on orders to pick up. And we were really pleased to see that. And then we talked about our automation and engineer solutions business. They were up low-20s organic and that's been strong for a period of time with a robust and strong demand continuing. So, all of those are strong. Our aerospace and defense business had a really good quarter. The sales were up high teens on a percentage basis versus the prior year. So this is about 19% of our portfolio. Organic sales were up high teens on a percentage basis, a solid growth across all segments. As I mentioned as an answer to Allison's question earlier, our commercial business was up 25% and our defense business was up about 10%. And for all the 21 that business, we're still not changing. We're continuing to expect low-to-mid single digit organic growth. So if I pulled the aerospace and defense business outside of the portfolio, I'd say that's the one that's, it's bottomed and it's doing well. But we're still looking at that commercial OEM business and watching it bottom, but everything else besides that is showing an uptrend.\nRob Wertheimer: Great, thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thanks, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys, good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Yes. I was interested in the growth investments, the $100 million and you talked about like, two thirds of it going towards like the sales and marketing and digital aspects of your business. Are you seeing kind of coming out of COVID just given like the kind of bespoke nature of your products and like specialized nature of your products? Is there like a fundamental change in how you sell these? Like, is it going to be, you finding it easier to do it digitally and less like in-person and it just kind of like a -- see change in how you do business going forward?\nDave Zapico: I think there is a change Joe, and I think that digital transformation is impacting all elements of our business, and we have these different niche of businesses, but some of the technology and the sales and marketing functions applies to all of them. So from digital marketing to e-commerce to augmented reality use to a demo and service our products to the efficiency we're getting out of automating routine clerical tasks and remote process improvement. There's a lot of things going into the digital plans that we have, the digital transformation. So we have and they do impact all of our businesses. And it's kind of a theme across all of our independent niches. So we're focused a lot on improving the business in that area. And we did learn a lot during the pandemic downturn and or taking what we learned and we're making it better and we're institutionalizing some of our best practices.\nJoe Giordano: And then, just a follow-up, in your Asia businesses, at least on the margins more recently, have you seen anything that kind of reflects the macro data, at least in China getting a little weaker here? Are you seeing anything like on the margins that that kind of mirror that, are you kind of changing the way you're operating there a little bit to kind of get ahead of that?\nDave Zapico: Yes, we're not changing anything yet. And we're not seeing a downturn. But China has been very strong, they were one of the first economies out of the pandemic. So we're looking at it closely. And as I mentioned, our growth was up about 27%. It remains strong, and we have strong quotation activity. I've seen all the reports about the Chinese economy slowing down, and there's probably some of that going on. But in our particular niches where we're playing, we have notable strength.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks guys.\nDave Zapico: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, just in terms of some of the second-half dynamics, on some of the temporary costs coming back in, as well as higher incentive compensation, what does that do for expectations on incrementals?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I think the core incrementals for the year are 35%. But in that second-half, we're going to have some costs coming back into the P&L. So the margins during the second-half can be down a bit, that is reflected in our guidance, but the acquisitions are margin dilutive, our temporary costs are coming back into the cost structure. And also, there's a bit of us being cautious in terms of our guide related to the dynamics of the supply chain. And as you may remember, Deane, we had a very tough, very difficult tough comparison in Q4. I think our EBITDA margins were over 30%. So we have tough comp also. So, there's going to be -- there can be a bit of margin dilution in that second-half, we got some of the one-time costs for the acquisitions working through the system. Those temporary costs we talked about are coming back in, but it's all reflected in our guidance.\nDeane Dray: That's very helpful. And Dave, I think the key question that everyone would love to hear your comments on the supply chain challenges and you said, you expected to last for some period of time, just from what you're seeing today, across your businesses, how do you think this plays out, is this a multiple quarter, is it carry in to 2022, you're handling it well on price costs. But just your expectation here, how long these conditions last?\nDave Zapico: That's a great question, Deane, I think the semiconductor element of it can last longer, so that can go out to two, three, four quarters as capacity gets put in place. Not specific to semiconductor, but to broader supply chain challenges. Yes, I can see those moderating in a couple of quarters. But semiconductor could last a little bit longer.\nDeane Dray: And are you carrying any more buffer inventory in your businesses just to kind of protect yourself from the surprises about, you expected the delivery, and it's not there. But is that and are we seeing that in the working capital?\nDave Zapico: Yes, the working capital was down about more than 500 basis points, but actually embedded in that was about $50 million more in inventory. So, we've allowed the operating teams guide and secure the parts that they need, and we're certainly not scrimping in that area. But at the same time, it's tough. They get the parts that you need. So we're managing it closely and as I said, we have a good team, both within our local business units combined with our corporate oversight, we're getting good results. But that is a big challenge for us right now.\nDeane Dray: That's all good to hear. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKen Newman: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Ken Newman on for Steve.\nDave Zapico: Hey, Ken good to hear you.\nKen Newman: Thanks. I just wanted to touch back on the semiconductor market comments you just made. Can you just remind us how big that market is for you today? And I'm curious if you just talk to the outlook for the sub sector in terms of capital investments from your customers?\nDave Zapico: I'll do that, Ken. But I want to be clear, what I was talking about was the semiconductor chips that are supplied to AMETEK, when I was talking about the supply chain tightness, but the semiconductor market is an important market for AMETEK. So we do participate in it from the viewpoint of sales and it's about 6% of our business. So, little under $300 million and we're seeing some solid growth there because we participate both in the research market and the ramp in chip production and application areas we're seeing particular strength would be the EUV optics market, the semiconductor research market, our businesses named CAMECA and ZYGO are doing quite well there and we expect our semiconductor sales to be up in the mid-teen 20% level this year.\nKen Newman: Understood. And then, just touching back on the incremental R&D investments for new product development for the year, can you give us some color on where your Vitality Index has trended through the quarter? And I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on how are you seeing that, how you see that the Vitality Index change, as these new investments start to monetize?\nDave Zapico: Yes, our Vitality Index in the quarter was a little better than 23%. So it was a good number. And we have to get our system put in place with some of these acquisitions that we've done. So there's the tracking systems that we put in place aren't in all the acquisitions yet. So we can't look at those businesses the same way, we look at our current businesses, but in general, we have a strong vitality, we have a number of in the low 20s, we're happy. And we think there's good opportunities for our businesses, and we're funding them and it's a big area for us is important for us as they get our product development teams, working together, introducing new products, because that's fundamental for both the AMETEK pricing story to be able to stay in front of inflation and also growing organic growth in the niche markets that we're leaders in. So it's really important to us.\nKen Newman: Thanks for the color.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Coleman for any further remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Michelle. Thank you everyone for joining our call today. Have a wonderful day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance let to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations. We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income, and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery, and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams. We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid and long cycle business profile. The five acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely, and are well-positioned to drive strong growth. Given our second quarter results and outlook for back-half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Now, let me turn to our second quarter results. Our businesses saw robust broad-based sales growth in the quarter. Overall, sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020. Organic sales growth was 25%; acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added two points. Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year. Our businesses also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter. While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges, as is reflected in our results. Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020, and operating margins expanded 40 basis points, to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points of 24%. EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%. This operating performance let to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020, and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10. Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% in income. Let me revise some additional details of the operating group level. Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter. Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 27%, recent acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency added nearly two points. EIG's second quarter operating income was $227 million, up 42% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 24.3%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus their prior year, to $452 million. Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added three points to the quarter. Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses, with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 32% compared to the prior-year period and EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to record 24.9%. Now switching to our acquisition strategy, as we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter. These acquisitions, as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software, and EGS are performing very well, and the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year. Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products, and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications. In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E and for the full-year we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments. In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our finance sales and marketing functions, along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth. As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion, despite having to absorb the return of temporary costs into our cost structure. While we were seeing higher levels of inflation, due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we're capturing higher levels of price given our differentiated solutions, allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread. Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives. For the full-year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings. Now, moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021, given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our order momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. For the full-year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis, and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb with excellent sales and order growth and high quality earnings growth exceeded expectations. Our strong operating performance in the first-half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated technology solutions and market leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time. The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders. I'll now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter and we'll be glad to take your questions, Bill? Great question, Matt. In the second quarter, we were very pleased that our pricing continues to offset inflation. We achieved about 3% of price across our entire portfolio, and total inflation was about two points. So, we had about a 100 basis point positive spread. And we want to stay in front of it. We want to stay there. And with all the acquisitions that we did and all the costs from those acquisitions, it showed up. We had 170 basis points of core margin expansion. And that pricing really helped us deliver that. So, we're ahead of the game now, we plan on staying there. There is increasing inflation, but with the 3% pricing and the 2% inflation, we were very pleased with our performance during the quarter. Yes, sure. I mean as we said before, the organic orders were up substantially. During the quarter, they grew every month, with June being the strongest month of the quarter. Sales also grew every month sequentially. And June was also the strongest month of the quarter, and so a very strong trend during the quarter. And then with July, it was a very solid month, and was supportive of our forecast and guide. So, we feel real good about the orders trend in the business. Thank you, Matt. Good morning, Josh. Right. Yes, the number that I gave you, the 2%, is total inflation in our business, so that's not just material, that's total inflation. And then in terms of peaking out, I mean it's -- inflation is increasing, we're staying in front of it. I don't think we're ready to say it's peaked yet. I think that there is an element of temporary cost spiking, but it's very difficult to bifurcate that between the underlying inflation and what's happening on a temporary basis. So, the honest answer is we're not sure, but we're going to stay ahead it. And that's the way we're managing the business. Yes, great. Yes, what we're seeing is kind of -- we saw this quarter the beginning of what I think is classic mid cycle recovery. So, we're mainly mid cycle and long cycle businesses, and we're seeing the beginning of a mid cycle recovery. And what we saw on our businesses are our automation and engineered solution businesses, those were classic mid cycle. That picked up earlier in the year, and it's staying strong. But we saw during the quarter, our power business really picked up. And the organic growth of our power business was a strong mid 30% organic growth, so that's -- I think the cycle is kind of following along what we think, where our automation businesses would kind of lead us in, and then we have the process and power businesses. And then down the road, maybe even a year or two we have our commercial aerospace business. So, the cycle is kind of following what we think. It's a little bit difficult to bifurcate the classic cycle from customers trying to get in the queue and reacting to supply chain issue, and the COVID rebound that we're all seeing. But I'm feeling really confident. And the underlying demand strength can have a longer tail as part of a broader cycle, because I think the industrial world has not invested a lot over the last five years, and we're well-positioned to benefit from that investment. So, I'm kind of seeing beneath this COVID recovery the -- a classic cyclical recovery, and it's really hitting our businesses at the part of the cycle where we think it would be. Does -- so that help you out a little bit? Thank you, Josh. Good morning. Sure. As we said, we're putting about $100 million of incremental investment in our P&L. And that was raised about $5 million from the last quarter, so some new opportunities are coming up. And I'd put it in several areas. I mean we're investing in core product development. That's the future of our business, and we want to stay with the best benefits in our products with our customers. That's happening, that's about probably a third of that $100 million. And then the other two-thirds is in sales and marketing and our digitization effort. So, we're doing a lot of things to improve our customer-facing capability. We're doing a lot of things around digital marketing, our sales force effectiveness. And teams are motivated and is working well, and we've able to do continued investing during the depths of the virus, and we're accelerating now. So, it's $100 million, it's in product development, and it's in sales and marketing, but a lot of it is in the digital space. Great question. The commercial aerospace is about 7% of our portfolio now. And we're obviously watching that Delta variant very closely, because we're not sure exactly what's going to happen. We haven't seen a downturn yet from the Delta variant. And our commercial aerospace business had a very good quarter. I mean we were up 25% in commercial aerospace. Our aftermarket business and our business jet market were stronger than our OEM markets. And that business, for the year, we haven't changed our outlook for the year. For our whole aerospace and defense business, we're still staying up low-to-mid single digits, so we're not seeing the same kind of traction in that business right now, partially because the aftermarket is doing better than the OE business. But it's stabilized for sure, it's 7% of our business, and we're watching it closely with the Delta variant. I mean we haven't seen a change yet in passenger model, but that could happen. So, that's the best information I can give you. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. Yes, the best way I can answer is we talked about, last year; we had about $90 million in temporary costs that we removed from the P&L. Now we're at, fast-forward to the end of Q2, so about a month ago, they came in during the quarter. But by the end of the quarter they were pretty much all backend, except out travel expenses. So there was about $10 million or $15 million of travel expenses. They're bleeding in slower than we anticipated earlier in the year, but largely all the expenses, besides travel, are back in the P&L. Yes, that there'll definitely be add-backs because we'll get full quarter effects, and there will also be some headwinds from our compensation system. We're -- we budget, we target our compensation systems, and we're having a good year, so there's a headwind from that too. So, there'll be some additional costs in the second-half of the year that will impact that. Yes, the research market is doing well. It's starting to pick up a bit. But that market is probably more impacted than the classic industrial market, because a lot of the research institutions were slow to start up. There's difficulty getting access to the facilities. So, the market is hanging in there, it's doing well. But it's certainly not inflecting up as much as in the general industrial markets. Yes, our teams are very active now. And we certainly -- we'd like to get a deal done between now and the end of the year, but there's no guarantee on that. There's a lot of properties in the market, there's a lot of activity going on right now for sure, but finding those gems that we acquire and end up becoming a part of the AMETEK portfolio is a different story. As we told you before many times, our acquisition strategy is not capital-limited, it's finding the right acquisitions to acquire, and we're very active now, and our teams are doing a great job. In terms of the capacity to-do deals, maybe I'll have Bill comment on that. Thank you, Scott. Good morning, Andrew. Yes, there could be. There could be yet a situation where you had the industrial recession in the 2015-2016 timeframe. And then we had a few years of good growth, but then we had the pandemic. So, clearly, supply chains are stressed and people are going to put -- they're dealing with the current issues, but there's going to be some capacity put in. And I think that that could be one of the outcomes of this economic cycle that we're in. So, we're pretty bullish on the industrial cycle right now. And we think there -- as I mentioned earlier, there is a COVID bounce, and it's pretty difficult to bifurcate the COVID bounce from the long-term growth, but we certainly are seeing customers planning in a way that's different than just a bounce. Yes, during the second quarter we had a pretty good month in Asia -- pretty good quarter in Asia, we were up about 30%. And it was a broad-based strength. It was notable strength in many of our businesses, but our automation business and our process instruments business stood out. And specifically within Asia, China growth was up 27%. So, it remains strong. And in China, our process instrumentation businesses did very well. So, we're still seeing solid growth in China. We've understand the press reports as well as anybody about what's going on in those regions. We're still operating all of our plants. We do have pockets where we're dealing with some COVID issues right now. But it's not unlike it's been the past three or four months, except the fact that there's probably a little more spread in China now. So, we're watching that closely, and -- but to your point, the China growth remains strong for us, 27% was the growth in the quarter. Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. There were issues like that going on all over Jeff, but I'd say that in general, in the second quarter, our teams did an excellent job and we had the material and we had the labor and we had the execution to get out what we needed to. There are certainly challenges in that broader materials and logistics right now, our guidance reflects the known risks. These issues are going to be with us for some period of time. And we're managing the issue with dedicated business unit personnel. So, each business unit has a team on their supply chain, but we also have an overlay over company-wide resources or global sourcing team and they're doing an effective job right now. The big area of focus for us right now is on semiconductor chip availability. And we're looking at that very closely trying to do secure our supply chains. And you can end up with a situation where you think you have a firm delivery and the day comes from the delivery and it's not there. I think everybody in the industrial world is delivering with that right now. And it causes with me a game of Whac-A-Mole where you're scrambling to get your output out but our people did a good job in the second quarter. And there is an element of prudent judgment in our second-half guide. But our guidance reflects all of our known risks. Thank you, Jeff. Yes. I may have said the wrong thing if I said acceleration of the orders, both orders and sales grew sequentially every month, but June being the highest strongest month of the quarter. So, that doesn't mean that they're ready to change; accelerated, that means that June was higher the May, May was higher than April, for both orders, and we had a very strong trend in July also. Yes. A lot of what we're doing is discrete automation and we've also done some factory automation and we've invested heavily over the past few years. So position our product portfolio and our capability at the top of the market, and we're benefiting from it now because as customers ramp up, our automation technology is helping them better serve their customer bases and the demand has been strong for many quarters. And we don't expect that to change. Welcome. Good morning, Rob. Yes, the first point is I think localization of manufacturing and people developing more durable supply chains is definitely one of the drivers of the demand we're seeing. What was your second question Rob? It was the Breadth of portfolio, so again, the first part of the question, we're definitely seeing localization drive demand. Those people look for more durable, more local supply chains. What we're really seeing it, if you go through our portfolio, look let's start with our process businesses with our largest business. It grew mid-20s organic during the quarter. Really strong levels demand essentially all MRs, leading to really robust sales and orders. Our growth was particularly strong in one of our instrumentation businesses called our ultra precision technology business that had a great quarter and they're benefiting from a metrology measurement technology related to automation. And you think about the power and industrial business, that business was up 30% organic in the quarter. The businesses that did well there, both segments power and industrial and particularly strong growth in our Brookfield business and our [indiscernible] business. Again, that was broad-based. And the power and industrial business was kind of one of the lagers on orders to pick up. And we were really pleased to see that. And then we talked about our automation and engineer solutions business. They were up low-20s organic and that's been strong for a period of time with a robust and strong demand continuing. So, all of those are strong. Our aerospace and defense business had a really good quarter. The sales were up high teens on a percentage basis versus the prior year. So this is about 19% of our portfolio. Organic sales were up high teens on a percentage basis, a solid growth across all segments. As I mentioned as an answer to Allison's question earlier, our commercial business was up 25% and our defense business was up about 10%. And for all the 21 that business, we're still not changing. We're continuing to expect low-to-mid single digit organic growth. So if I pulled the aerospace and defense business outside of the portfolio, I'd say that's the one that's, it's bottomed and it's doing well. But we're still looking at that commercial OEM business and watching it bottom, but everything else besides that is showing an uptrend. Thanks, Rob. Good morning, Joe. I think there is a change Joe, and I think that digital transformation is impacting all elements of our business, and we have these different niche of businesses, but some of the technology and the sales and marketing functions applies to all of them. So from digital marketing to e-commerce to augmented reality use to a demo and service our products to the efficiency we're getting out of automating routine clerical tasks and remote process improvement. There's a lot of things going into the digital plans that we have, the digital transformation. So we have and they do impact all of our businesses. And it's kind of a theme across all of our independent niches. So we're focused a lot on improving the business in that area. And we did learn a lot during the pandemic downturn and or taking what we learned and we're making it better and we're institutionalizing some of our best practices. Yes, we're not changing anything yet. And we're not seeing a downturn. But China has been very strong, they were one of the first economies out of the pandemic. So we're looking at it closely. And as I mentioned, our growth was up about 27%. It remains strong, and we have strong quotation activity. I've seen all the reports about the Chinese economy slowing down, and there's probably some of that going on. But in our particular niches where we're playing, we have notable strength. Okay, thank you. Good morning, Deane. Yes, I think the core incrementals for the year are 35%. But in that second-half, we're going to have some costs coming back into the P&L. So the margins during the second-half can be down a bit, that is reflected in our guidance, but the acquisitions are margin dilutive, our temporary costs are coming back into the cost structure. And also, there's a bit of us being cautious in terms of our guide related to the dynamics of the supply chain. And as you may remember, Deane, we had a very tough, very difficult tough comparison in Q4. I think our EBITDA margins were over 30%. So we have tough comp also. So, there's going to be -- there can be a bit of margin dilution in that second-half, we got some of the one-time costs for the acquisitions working through the system. Those temporary costs we talked about are coming back in, but it's all reflected in our guidance. That's a great question, Deane, I think the semiconductor element of it can last longer, so that can go out to two, three, four quarters as capacity gets put in place. Not specific to semiconductor, but to broader supply chain challenges. Yes, I can see those moderating in a couple of quarters. But semiconductor could last a little bit longer. Yes, the working capital was down about more than 500 basis points, but actually embedded in that was about $50 million more in inventory. So, we've allowed the operating teams guide and secure the parts that they need, and we're certainly not scrimping in that area. But at the same time, it's tough. They get the parts that you need. So we're managing it closely and as I said, we have a good team, both within our local business units combined with our corporate oversight, we're getting good results. But that is a big challenge for us right now. Thank you, Deane. Hey, Ken good to hear you. I'll do that, Ken. But I want to be clear, what I was talking about was the semiconductor chips that are supplied to AMETEK, when I was talking about the supply chain tightness, but the semiconductor market is an important market for AMETEK. So we do participate in it from the viewpoint of sales and it's about 6% of our business. So, little under $300 million and we're seeing some solid growth there because we participate both in the research market and the ramp in chip production and application areas we're seeing particular strength would be the EUV optics market, the semiconductor research market, our businesses named CAMECA and ZYGO are doing quite well there and we expect our semiconductor sales to be up in the mid-teen 20% level this year. Yes, our Vitality Index in the quarter was a little better than 23%. So it was a good number. And we have to get our system put in place with some of these acquisitions that we've done. So there's the tracking systems that we put in place aren't in all the acquisitions yet. So we can't look at those businesses the same way, we look at our current businesses, but in general, we have a strong vitality, we have a number of in the low 20s, we're happy. And we think there's good opportunities for our businesses, and we're funding them and it's a big area for us is important for us as they get our product development teams, working together, introducing new products, because that's fundamental for both the AMETEK pricing story to be able to stay in front of inflation and also growing organic growth in the niche markets that we're leaders in. So it's really important to us. Thank you, Ken."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance, and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior-year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter, versus 1.7% in the same period last year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6%, compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year. The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. range and the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full-year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share. As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow was $264 million, with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income. Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion, offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million. As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems, and NSI-MI. This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software, and Magnetrol which were completed in the first quarter of the year. Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on five strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021. At quarter end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio and our net debt to EBITDA ratio were 1.9 times and 1.6 times, respectively. Remain well-positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy given our strong financial capacity and flexibility. At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations. The performance of our businesses through the first-half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation, and the dedication of our world-class workforce has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021, and beyond. Kevin? Yes. Thanks, Dave. Yes, certainly, you made the point, we could go borrow more, and our banks and others tell us they're more than happy to lend to us. That couple of billion dollars would still only give us a mid-twos kind of leverage. So, still you could even say somewhat underleveraged for the company. So, plenty of opportunity and plenty of resources available to us to do even more than the $2 billion, and I think as Dave mentioned, this isn't a capital-constrained strategy, this is finding the right businesses to fit with our portfolio that we think can generate value for our shareholders over the long-term. No, I think the same outlook. It's we haven't changed it at all. And we said, we get about $0.18 of benefit in 2021, and it's looking like that's going to be a good number for us."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kevin, the floor is yours.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Jake. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK\u2019s filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization, and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of 2020, and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. We\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. I\u2019ll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter with stronger than expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution leading to earnings above our expectations. We returned to organic sales growth earlier than expected and as the economy continues its recovery, we're experiencing strong orders growth resulting in a record backlog.  Operationally, our businesses are performing at a high level, delivering impressive margin expansion and strong cash flows. Additionally, we started the year with a notable level of acquisition activity, deploying a record $1.85 billion on five acquisitions thus far in 2021. These acquisitions, combined with our strong first quarter results and solid orders momentum, led us to substantially increase our full year sales and earnings guidance.  Before I get into the results for the quarter, I wanted to again thank all AMETEK colleagues for their continued hard work and efforts over the last year as we manage through the pandemic. AMETEK\u2019s success in navigating this difficult environment is a testament to the dedicated and highly talented employees across the company.  While we are encouraged with the acceleration of the vaccine rollout, we remain focused on the health and well being of our employees and we'll remain vigilant in ensuring proper safety protocols are being followed.  Now, let me turn to the first quarter results. Overall, sales in the quarter were up 1% versus the prior year to $1.22 billion. Organic sales were up 1% with a divestiture of Reading Alloys being offset by a 2 point foreign currency tailwind.  Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.4 billion, up 16% compared to the same period last year with organic orders up 9%. This led to a book to bill of 1.15 and a record backlog of $2 billion.  We are encouraged by the strong orders as many of our businesses are seeing improved demand conditions across their markets, while some of our longer cycle businesses have yet to return to growth.  Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $356 million, up 4% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.2%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.07 per diluted share, up 5% versus the first quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02. Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong, with operating cash flow up 5% to $284 million and free cash flow conversion of 122% of net income.  Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group reported outstanding results in the first quarter, with both groups delivering positive organic sales growth and impressive margin expansion.  Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group in the quarter were $791 million, up 2% over last year's first quarter, driven by modest organic sales growth and a 1.5% foreign currency tailwind. EIG\u2019s operating income in the first quarter was $207 million, up 7% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 26.2%.  The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter with positive organic sales growth driven by strong demand in our automation business. EMG\u2019s first quarter sales were $425 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, while the divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 5 point headwind and foreign currency was a 2 point tailwind.  EMG\u2019s operating income was a record $105 million in the quarter, up 8% compared to the same quarter last year. And EMG\u2019s operating margins expanded an exceptional 190 basis points to a record 24.7%.  Now turning to acquisitions. As we have discussed, acquisition activity slowed considerably in 2020 due to the pandemic. During this time, we acted swiftly to appropriately align our cost structure with the demand environment and to protect and further strengthen our balance sheet to support a meaningful return of M&A in 2021.  At the same time, we communicated that our business and acquisition teams remain very active in managing our pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These actions positioned us to capitalize on an improving acquisition environment in a significant manner, deploying $1.85 billion to acquire five excellent businesses thus far this year.  Now, let me take a moment to provide additional color on these deals. I'll start with AMETEK\u2019s largest ever acquisition, Abaco Systems. Headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, Abaco is the leading provider of mission critical embedded computing systems used on key aerospace and defense platforms, along with specialized industrial applications.  Abaco\u2019s open architecture of computing and electronic systems are ruggedized to meet military standards and withstand harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures, altitude and high vibration.  As a leading provider of differentiated technology solutions serving attractive high growth applications, Abaco nicely complements and expands our existing aerospace and defense platform. Abaco has approximately 325 million in annual sales, and we deployed $1.35 billion on the acquisition.  Next, Magnetrol International. Based in Aurora, Illinois, Magnetrol is the leading provider of level and flow control solutions for challenging process applications across a diverse set of end markets, including medical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, food and beverage and general industrial markets. Magnetrol is an outstanding strategic fit with our sensors, test and calibration business. Combined, these businesses form an industry leading sensor platform with a broad range of level and flow measurement solutions. Magnetrol has annual sales of approximately $100 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition.  Today, we announced the acquisition of NSI-MI Technologies, a leading provider of radio frequency and microwave test and measurement solutions based in Suwanee, Georgia. NSI-MI is an exciting addition to our test and measurement platform, given their deep expertise in advanced RF and microwave technologies.  Their highly differentiated test and measurement solutions are uniquely positioned to support the continued development of advanced RF and microwave technologies for critical high growth applications, including 5G wireless communications, autonomous vehicles and specialized defense systems. NSI-MI has annual sales of approximately $90 million, and we deployed 230 million on the acquisition.  In addition to these acquisitions, AMETEK also acquired two smaller yet highly strategic businesses, Crank Software and EGS Automation. Crank Software, which is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, is the provider of embedded graphical user interface software and services. Crank\u2019s award winning storyboard software platform is ideally positioned to capitalize on the accelerating demand for smart digitally enabled devices. And EGS Automation is an attractive bolt-on acquisition for our Dunkermotoren business, expanding our presence in the attractive automation market. Located near Dunkers, German headquarters, EGS designs and manufactures highly engineered and customized robotic solutions for niche medical, food and beverage and general industrial markets.  We would like to welcome the Abaco, Magnetrol, NSI-MI, Crank Software and EGS teams to AMETEK and look forward to working closely with them and supporting their continued growth. Combined, these acquisitions add approximately 535 million in annual sales aligned with attractive secular growth markets. Additionally, they provide AMETEK with excellent returns in line with our stated hurdle rates. Each of these integrations is going very well in the early stages of our ownership.  AMETEK\u2019s decentralized operating structure and proven operating capability provides us the flexibility to successfully integrate the businesses, while continuing to pursue additional acquisitions. We're still working through a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. And as Bill will discuss in a moment, we have ample balance sheet capacity with approximately $1.8 billion available to support our acquisition strategy.  In addition to continued capital deployment on acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our businesses. For all of 2021, we expect to invest approximately 95 million in incremental growth investments. These investments are largely centered around our research and development and sales and marketing functions, including targeted investments in support of our digital transformation strategy.  Our investments in RD&E continued to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. For all of 2021, we expect to spend approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales on RD&E for our base businesses before adding in our recent acquisitions. This level of spend is up 10% over last year's RD&E spend.  Now shifting to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the first quarter, including solid orders growth and a record backlog, along with contributions from our recent acquisitions, we've increased our full year sales and earnings guidance. For 2021, we now expect overall sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis while organic sales are expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.56, which is an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's comparable basis. This new range is a $0.28 midpoint increase from our previous adjusted earnings guidance of $4.18 to $4.30 per diluted share.  For the second quarter, overall sales are anticipated to be up in the low 30% range versus last year's quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, up 29% to 31% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Our revised guidance includes each of the five completed acquisitions.  To summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent first quarter with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and meaningful capital deployment. These outstanding results speak to the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model along with the resilience of our world class workforce.  With our differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of niche end markets aligned with attractive secular growth opportunities, we remain firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  I will now turn it over to Bill who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then, we will be glad to take your questions. \nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK began the year with outstanding results highlighted by strong sales and orders growth and a high quality of earnings. With that, I'll provide additional financial highlights for the quarter.  First quarter general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million, up $3 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% in the quarter. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be up approximately $12 million on a return of temporary costs, including compensation. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%, which was essentially in line with the adjusted 19.4% reported in the same period last year. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.  Our businesses continue to do an outstanding job managing their working capital. For the quarter, operating working capital was 14.2%, down 470 basis points from the 18.9% reported in the first quarter of 2020, just excellent work by our teams on the working capital front. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $18 million. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter was $65 million. For all of 2021, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $140 million or $0.60 per diluted share.  As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the first quarter, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 5% over last year's first quarter to $284 million and $267 million, respectively. Free cash flow conversion was very strong at 122% of net income in the quarter.  Total debt at quarter end was $2.35 billion, down from $2.41 billion at the end of 2020. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.7x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9x.  As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we deployed approximately $270 million on the acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS Automation. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in 1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far this year.  Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced we entered into a five-year delayed draw bank term loan for up to $800 million with existing lenders under our revolving credit facility. Proceeds from the term loan will be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility following the recent acquisition activities, and to provide capital to further support our acquisition growth strategy.  Following the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected to be 1.9x and 1.7x, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. We continue to have an excellent financial capacity with approximately $1.8 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter with high quality results that outpaced our expectations. We remain poised for significant growth in 2021, given our strong balance sheet, outstanding cash flows and the efforts of our talented workforce. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Jake, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, could you maybe parse out the $0.28 change in guidance for the year? How much of that is being driven by a better than expected performance in the core business versus the M&A-driven accretion and all the deal flow as of late?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, Matt. That's an excellent question. And it's really driven by a mix of different items. So we have the stronger than expected organic growth that drove Q1 of our guide. And then we have an improved guide for Q2. And both of those two together are about $0.10, $0.10 of the $0.28. Really, our second half is unchanged on a core basis. It's too early to change that. And then we have an additional $0.18 from the deal. So the way to think about that is [10%] (ph) from the core business, $0.18 from the deals, $0.28 in total. \nMatt Summerville: Perfect. And then just in terms of price realization, maybe where you're at in Q1, and then where you were at in terms of price cost spread and what you expect for the balance of the year. Thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Thanks, Matt. We're very pleased with our pricing. It continues to offset inflation. We achieved a bit more than 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation was a bit less than 1%. So we're maintaining a positive spread between the two, which is our intention. And when you look out for all of '21, we expect to achieve slightly higher pricing than the 1.5% with slightly higher inflation. So we see both our pricing and inflation building a bit, and we'll strive to maintain a positive spread between price and inflation for the full year. And it's really -- it's driven by the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio. We have leadership positions in these markets around the globe and provide excellent value to our customers. So when we get cost increases, more than likely we can pass them on.\nMatt Summerville: Great. Thank you, Dave.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Dave, I\u2019d love to get some context of this. And I\u2019m not sure I'm supposed to use the word M&A spree, but it just -- a logjam has been broken here and maybe can you give us some context. Did the pricing get reasonable? You probably had all these assets on your radar screen before we went into COVID. So the lifting of COVID uncertainty certainly was a factor here. But just give us a context, because you don't often see a volume of deals that look to be great fits, but just happening in such a short amount of time.\nDavid Zapico: Right. It's a great question. And I'll try to give you an overlay the way that we think about it. We've managed through many economic cycles and seeing the impact on M&A from the economic cycles. And it was no surprise then this particular downturn that deal activity dramatically slowed in 2020, and pent-up demand would drive a quick recovery. We talked about that last year. So our focus in 2020 was to make sure that we were well positioned for the rebound. And one of the ways we would be well positioned is we strengthen our balance sheet. And we built up our cash balances during the worst of the pandemic, and we exited the year with 1.2 billion in cash and net debt to EBITDA of 0.9.  Look, as we talked about last year, we also focused on expanding our pipeline of opportunities. And we told you last year, we were busier than ever with pipeline development. And as you stated we've been working with these companies for over a year on these deals. And just through the first four months, the sellers wanted to sell the businesses like we thought and we have a dedicated team of people that are working for them. So we acquired five companies, deployed 1.85 billion in capital and they're highly strategic. And we're really excited for each of the companies we acquired. They fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. Each has strong differentiated technology positions. They allow us to expand in attractive growth areas like embedded systems for aerospace and defense, testing for autonomous vehicles, 5G satellite communications, expanding our IoT capability, more capability in automation business, software for embedded systems. So we're really happy with the set of companies that we acquired. And importantly, each of these businesses are going to benefit from being part of AMETEK. We've developed a custom playbook for each of the businesses. And they're going to benefit from our global footprint to help them accelerate the efficiencies.  Importantly for us, we were able to get the deals done. We\u2019re meeting our traditional financial hurdles, which are a return on invested capital of 10% and an IRR of 15%. So these are important thresholds for us. And we want to ensure that we're providing strong level of returns on our capital deployed for shareholders. And one of the benefits of AMETEK\u2019s distributed operating model is that we can handle a bunch of acquisitions like this to acquire and integrate multiple businesses, while remaining active and acquiring other businesses. These are coming into different parts of AMETEK, and there's a senior AMETEK leader responsible for the integration. And our pipeline of opportunities remains strong. And we have a meaningful level of capacity, as Bill talked about, with strong cash flow. So I hope we're talking to you before the end of year about some other things, but we felt real good about it. And it wasn't just -- it all happened at once. It's a lot of hard work over the course of the pandemic and of course of greater than a year.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And you answered my question about the additional management capacity, because I can see you've got the capital to do more deals. And you did answer the question about the management capacity, that was really helpful. And I may have missed this, but within the increased guidance, what is the earnings contribution from the deals?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. If you think about the $0.28 midpoint rise on our guidance, $0.18 is from the deals this year and the other $0.10 is from the organic operations of the company.\nDeane Dray: Got it. I appreciate it. Congrats on all that work.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Josh.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Dave, just to stick with the deals, I guess your first, Abaco, I guess we're getting to the point now where bolt-ons are starting to look a little bit less bolt-on and pretty large. Can you talk about maybe the complexion of the pipeline or maybe your own appetite to kind of be in that range maybe more consistently going forward? I think you've said it yourself that needle moving deals for AMETEK sort of have to get bigger over time, is that something that as you look out over kind of the range of properties that you think is possible, achievable, kind of consistent with the strategy here?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, good questions. A few years ago, we let our investors know that we were expanding our deal pipeline to include slightly bigger businesses. And we included businesses that will be in the 200 million to 400 million range. And we deploy 1 billion plus capital on them, and Abaco is in that range. And we talked about doing a deal like that every so often. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to become our core, but those businesses are still working in our pipeline. But there are still many businesses that are, I\u2019ll call them medium size that are the $100 million deals similar to NSI-MI and Magnetrol. Those are probably the most businesses of that size. And then we also had some smaller deals that they're really important strategically to operate and augment our internal growth. So you're going to see a mix of deals of those sizes. AMETEK is not going to buy a company our size or buy a company half our size. We just don't think that you can create value like that, but the size of the company now I think those companies in the $200 million to $400 million revenue makes sense, and you'll see those from us occasionally.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. And then just moving over to the core business, it seems like order intake picked up pretty nicely here. You talked about record backlog. I guess the perception out there or maybe the history of AMETEK has been slightly longer cycle than maybe some of these book-and-turn only businesses and orders that tend to develop along with a recovery, but not necessarily day one. It seems like you've built up a little bit of momentum here. Can you maybe talk about where is that backlog growth stemming from, or what out there fundamentally in the marketplace has maybe picked up a little quicker than you otherwise would have expected?\nDavid Zapico: Right. When you -- I\u2019ll first unpack the orders a bit. We had a 9% organic order growth and it was broad-based in the company and EIG organic orders was 10%, EMG organic orders was 8%. So it was good to see broad-based orders. When you think about our portfolio, both EIG and EMG, we raised from mid single digits to high single digits. That's another indication of broad-based growth. I think that the overall company will grow sales sequentially each quarter. And as we look at our four market segments, process improved high single digits; power and industrial improved high single digits; automation and engineering improved high single digits; but the aerospace and defense segment, we continue to expect low to mid single digits with defense growing better than commercial. So when you think about the entire business, it really is going well. And I carve out the two long cycle businesses, oil and gas that we think will trend up in the second half of this year and the commercial aerospace business which will not trend up until 2023, maybe 2022, 2023. But the key point is, we have properly sized that business for the current level of activity and any small improvements along the way are going to be very profitable for us. So we look at it as really attractive. We're going to have the long cycle businesses kicking in down the road and we're already seeing the mid cycle pick up. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about the recovery.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. Congrats on the quarter, all the deals and best of luck.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: And just sort of in line with that, sort of the mid and long cycle businesses, could you maybe talk about the core operating leverage that you expect to see this year based on some of the orders that are coming in for you, any color there?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, that's a good question. We had excellent margin performance in the first quarter, strong margin improvements in both EIG and EMG, a strong execution, solid price inflation, excellent productivity. We're going to see for the year core incrementals of 35%, and that includes bringing all the temporary costs back into the business. And core operating margins will increase about 40 basis points. So we\u2019ll grow margins. A key point though is the acquisitions are margin dilutive. So our reported margins will be down a bit, and that's kind of what we do. We acquire businesses that are lower margin than AMETEK. And over the course of a couple of years, three years, we bring them up to the AMETEK level when it's pretty hard to acquire businesses that are at the profitability level of AMETEK worth 29%, 30% EBITDA, and we have some room with all these businesses to improve profitability. So that's the way I think about the -- the core operating leverage on the business will be positive. And then the reported margins with the acquisitions will be margin dilutive.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it, thanks. And then working capital, obviously, an impressive number at 14.2% of sales. Would we expect that to maybe slip a little bit with the increase or is that sort of a sustainable level as you think about it?\nBill Burke: Yes. Allison, I would expect that -- we'd expect that to probably come back. It would be adding some cost back to the balance sheet. Particularly as the sales grow, you're going to see some more receivables come on the balance sheet and we're going to be focused on making sure that we've got all the right inventory levels in the business to support the growth and make sure we're good to go and can support our customers as we move forward. So I think we did really well in the first quarter. I think -- while we did put receivables and inventories back up on the balance sheet, our teams did a great job getting advanced payments from customers and the like. So that was a good result, but I'd expect to see that trend up a bit over the course of the balance of the year.\nAllison Poliniak: Understood. Thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Allison.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Good morning. So I want to go back to deal flow, because it's obviously -- by the way, congratulations on all the deals. You source and buy a lot of private companies, family held companies, and I've got to think there's got to be an increased interest in selling businesses ahead of any cap gains, tax rate changes and [inherent] (ph) tax changes. Are you seeing that yet? Have you seen more interest in maybe pulling the trigger on some disposables with these changes on the horizon?\nDavid Zapico: They're a little bit of that, Nigel. But what I see is a lot of private owners -- and there were some private owners in this suite of businesses that we bought, they got through the pandemic and they're looking at a world that's changed, and they're looking at someone larger to provide some stability and some capital and some access to things that they didn't have access to. So I think it's more the uncertainty in the macro environment, the uncertainty driven by the pandemic, has certainly made private company owners more likely to consider the exit that they were maybe going to do a couple of years from now. That's what I think is happening and we're seeing a little bit of that.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that makes sense. And then EMG margins moving notably higher, pre-pandemic we\u2019re sort of in the high teens, maybe 20% range, and now we're moving into the mid 20s. Do you think that that level is sustainable? I understand Reading Alloys came out, but do you think mid 20s is sort of the range for EMG from here.\nDavid Zapico: They were a record margin this quarter at 24.7%, up 190 basis points and their margins have been growing nicely for a period of time. And when you look at that part of the business and you dissect what happened, the two very profitable parts of that business, our automation business and our defense businesses, both are firing on all cylinders and that drove the margins up. So it's really a mix among businesses within the EMG group that is driving the margins. And as long as those businesses stay strong, I would expect the margins to be good.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Dave.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nScott Graham: Hi. Good morning, Dave and Bill.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Scott. How are you doing?\nScott Graham: All good. Always nice to wake up to this type of report. So I think we're about $50 million of temporary cost-outs last year. Bill, you touched on this a little bit within SG&A. How do you see those layering in this year?\nBill Burke: Yes, I think there was 90 actually that was the temporary cost from last year, and we got the benefit of 50 million into 2021 for the structural restructuring, Scott. \nScott Graham: Okay, sorry. \nBill Burke: But what I\u2019d say is in the second half of the year, you're going to see those temporary costs come back in. And a little bit came in, in the first quarter, a little more in the second quarter. But in the second half of the year, you're going to have -- they're all back in. So that's how we\u2019ve modeled the year and we look at it.\nScott Graham: Thank you for that. And I read your press release, I listened to your prepared remarks and really nary a peep on supply chain. And it's kind of like all the rage this quarter on conference calls and nothing from you guys. So could you maybe give us sort of your view of what you're seeing both internally and externally, things that could maybe not happening in the first quarter but maybe could back up into you -- again, not internally, but something externally that could back up into you? And in fact, does that as a concern plus the add backs of the costs, is that what's keeping the second half guidance in check?\nDavid Zapico: You're right on, Scott. The supply chain -- there are certainly challenges in materials and logistics right now. Specifically, the semiconductor shortages have our attention and our supply chain team are working this issue aggressively. Our guidance reflects all known risks. This is a serious issue, and one that will likely be with us for some period of time. And we're managing this with our dedicated business unit supply chain personnel with an overlay of our company-wide global sourcing, and they're an effective team and we've done an effective job on it so far. But it is a serious issue. Our guidance reflects the known risks and we're confident we can deliver it. But it really -- we just felt it was too early in the year to improve the second half earnings and sales guidance because of that. We think it's a nice balance.\nScott Graham: Makes sense. My last question is a question you've heard me ask before. I know you kind of went through the four big segments on their organic. Could you also throw in your outlooks for those segments?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, sure. In process, we talked about it and it was up mid single digits in the quarter and returned to positive organic growth earlier than we expected. A little extra color there. Ultra Precision Technologies and our Materials Analysis divisions really had good quarters and they're seeing improving demand across a broad set of end markets. They\u2019re in the research, semiconductor and industrial markets.  We're also seeing very strong growth in orders across our process businesses. Organic quarters were up low double digit, so a little bit higher than AMETEK\u2019s overall. And for the full year, we now expect those organic sales for our process businesses to be up high single digits versus the prior year. It was mid single digits in the original guide for the year and we\u2019ve raised it to high single digits. So process orders look good, process is doing very well in Asia. And certain divisions are starting to fire on all cylinders.  In our aerospace and defense business, our overall sales for A&D were down approximately 10% in the first quarter, modestly ahead of our expectation. And really there's a bifurcation going on there. The defense businesses remained robust with sales up low double digits on a percentage basis. Commercial aerospace are still feeling the effects of the pandemics. Year-on-year rates have declined or continuing to improve. But in the first quarter, commercial aerospace sales were down approximately 25%. So for all of '21, like I said before, we continue to expect low to mid single digit organic sales growth from our aerospace and defense business. We did not change the outlook on that segment as we did the other three.  Power and industrial overall sales were up slightly from the prior year's first quarter. Very strong orders, up mid teens on orders. We now expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be up high single digits and we changed that from up mid single digits in the first outlook for the year. And finally, our automation and engineered solutions, up modestly versus the prior year, while organic sales were up mid single digits. Overall, sales were impacted by the divestiture of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of last year. Sales across our automation businesses, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, remained strong and we're seeing solid demand conditions across their international markets, in Asia and China in particular. And for all of 2021, we now expect automation and engineered solution businesses organic sales growth to be up high single digits with stronger growth in our automation businesses than our engineered solutions business. And so you end up with both EIG and EMG being up high single digits raised from mid single digits. Okay, Scott?\nScott Graham: Awesome. Thank you for that summary, Dave.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Qualitatively, do you think there was any pull forward or precautionary orders there in the first quarter? And were those a bit of a tailwind for the 9% organic orders growth you had in the quarter?\nDavid Zapico: Good question. We have highly engineered products. So I don't think people are stocking them. But certainly in the current macro environment, people want to get their orders -- customers want to get their orders placed to make sure that they can get the products that they need. So we're seeing confident customers concerned about the global supply chain, and placing their orders earlier than expected.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: And then the other question I have is on the trends by geography. We've heard Europe has been relatively slower. Interested in where you saw the largest inflection in your organic trends?\nDavid Zapico: All of the geographies showed improvements. The U.S. was down mid single digits, improvements in most areas but the decline was driven by commercial aerospace and oil and gas. Really, it was the same picture in Europe where we were down mid single digits with good improvement, but weaknesses in commercial aero and oil and gas. And Asia was the star for us, a broad-based strength up mid 20s led by our automation business and our process business.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi. Good morning.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: My question is kind of a follow up on the supply chain question that was asked earlier. Your margin performance was quite good in the quarter on revenues that hadn't come back yet. I'm wondering how big, if any, you can quantify the supply chain drag. And maybe more importantly, do you have a sense as to whether you've reached the kind of maximum disruption point in 1Q and 2Q? Are things getting better or did folks pull out all the stops in 1Q to get stuff done throughout the supply chain that leaves more risk out there, just when can we sort of stop worrying about the issue? Thanks.\nDavid Zapico: In Q1, we did an excellent job and we didn't have any inability to ship because of supply chain. And our teams are going to work on the full year and there are certainly challenges, but we have a good team working on them and going to solve them. I don't think we've seen the worst of it yet, just based on what's happening on semiconductors. I think some of the logistics issues we think will moderate during midyear, but the semiconductor shortages could continue into 2022. And there are higher prices you're dealing with or issues with the global supply chain recovering from a V-shaped recovery, and we have a really good supply chain capability. We're dealing with it effectively, but we're not immune to it. So we're doing our best to stay on top of it. In Q1, we didn't have any issues and our guidance reflects the known issues, and we're confident in our guidance.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nBrett Linzey: Hi. Good morning, all.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: Hi. My first question is just on the defense business. It continues to grow with these acquisitions. And it's been an area that you've seen very strong growth. I'm just curious what that growth rate looks like over the next two to three years? I know you're on a variety of platforms. And then also just if you could maybe parse out U.S. versus international for defense specifically?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, great questions, Brett. The first thing, defense is about 12% of the sales of AMETEK. And when we looked at Abaco, we wanted to make sure that we have a changing administration, we wanted to make sure we were able to grow through this. And if you look back at Abaco over the last three or four years, they grew about 16% and that's very, very excellent. It's healthy. We feel that embedded computing is among the most compelling growth opportunities in A&D to the substantial DoD focus on modernization and upgrades of existing defense platforms, because there's a focus on processing intensive and data intensive mission capabilities in the future. We also got comfortable with -- they've amassed over $1 billion in design wins that underpin the growth over the next several years. So that's all good. But at the same time, we think they're well positioned to offset any overall DoD funding headwinds, because of those factors. And we\u2019ve modeled our top line as a high single digit grower versus the mid teens in the recent past. So we think we got a conservative model there. The management team of the business is still driving to those higher growth rates. But we modeled it conservatively. And when you look at AMETEK\u2019s broader defense exposure beyond Abaco, right now, we're kind of in the right areas. There's a lot of electronics going in and we're in cooling and heating electronics in terms of the environmental controls, and it's been doing well for us. And we think this year for 2021 outside of Abaco, our core business will be up into high single digits in the defense market. And we went into the year saying mid single digits, but we had a very strong first quarter. So we improved the defense business to mid to high single digits.\nBrett Linzey: Great. Thanks for that. And just back to M&A, great to see the velocity of deals pick back up. But given the potential tax changes and the fact that interactions are improving here, is the 1.8 billion of available capital the optimal range, but maybe you'd be comfortable flexing up even above that opportunistically as volumes pick back up and the fact we\u2019re early in the recovery? Just curious on your flex up capacity.\nBill Burke: Yes, sure. If you look at -- if we spent that 1.8 billion that we talked about, certainly there'd be more capacity available. Our leverage would still only be below 2.5 at that point in time. So we'd have additional room to flex up from there if the right deals came along. So from a balance sheet capacity, that's not an issue and it's always, as we say, it's all about making sure that we have the management capability to be able to bring in those deals effectively, and Dave touched on that earlier in his comments. \nDavid Zapico: Yes. Our strategy is really not capacity constrained. Even at 2.5, we're well below our covenants. Our strategy is constrained by finding good deals that are differentiated that meet our requirements, so we can improve. So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to do that. And hopefully, we're talking to you again later this year. And we have a good pipeline, but it's really finding those deals that we get confident we can get a return. That's the key issue, Brett, not finding them.\nBrett Linzey: Yes. Congrats on the quarter and the deal flow.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoseph Giordano: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nDavid Zapico: Hi, Joe. How are you doing?\nJoseph Giordano: Good. So we touched on supply chain a couple of times and you guys are doing a good job there. Just curious when you went through your diligence on all these deals, how did you get comfortable that you weren't bringing in potential problems? Like when I think about embedded computing and things like that, how do you get comfortable that the supply chains and the requirements there of the new businesses, or things that you can pop into your existing framework and not stress it too much?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, that's a great question. And we obviously spent a lot of time on that. And based on our questions and Abaco in particular, they have all their -- they have committed order for their plan on 2021. So we pushed it and they responded, and it was an area of heavy focus on our diligence. You don't have full access to the business, but it's understood by the Abaco team, they were very good. And I think that we're well positioned to deal with the supply chain issues in that business. \nJoseph Giordano: And when I think about overall AMETEK now pro forma, not to give you guys more work, but how do we think about the segmentation structure? We got two segments, they're getting pretty large. Are they providing in your opinion like adequate transparency into the total company, or maybe do we have to think about a new structure? \nDavid Zapico: Yes, we're not thinking about a new structure. We got the four sub-segments under the two reporting segments externally. So we have EIG and EMG. EIG is about two-thirds of the size of the company. EMG is about one-third. And we provide insight in revenue disaggregation into process, which is about 46% of the company pro forma. Aerospace and defense was about 19% of the company pro forma. Power and industrial which is about 14% of the company and automation and engineered solutions is about 22%. And power and industrial is 14%. So we're comfortable with it. And we think this structure is going to let us go and grow for the next few years.\nJoseph Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nDavid Zapico: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Bill Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK began the year with outstanding results highlighted by strong sales and orders growth and a high quality of earnings. With that, I'll provide additional financial highlights for the quarter.  First quarter general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million, up $3 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% in the quarter. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be up approximately $12 million on a return of temporary costs, including compensation. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%, which was essentially in line with the adjusted 19.4% reported in the same period last year. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.  Our businesses continue to do an outstanding job managing their working capital. For the quarter, operating working capital was 14.2%, down 470 basis points from the 18.9% reported in the first quarter of 2020, just excellent work by our teams on the working capital front. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $18 million. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter was $65 million. For all of 2021, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $140 million or $0.60 per diluted share.  As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the first quarter, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 5% over last year's first quarter to $284 million and $267 million, respectively. Free cash flow conversion was very strong at 122% of net income in the quarter.  Total debt at quarter end was $2.35 billion, down from $2.41 billion at the end of 2020. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.7x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9x.  As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we deployed approximately $270 million on the acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS Automation. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in 1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far this year.  Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced we entered into a five-year delayed draw bank term loan for up to $800 million with existing lenders under our revolving credit facility. Proceeds from the term loan will be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility following the recent acquisition activities, and to provide capital to further support our acquisition growth strategy.  Following the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected to be 1.9x and 1.7x, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. We continue to have an excellent financial capacity with approximately $1.8 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter with high quality results that outpaced our expectations. We remain poised for significant growth in 2021, given our strong balance sheet, outstanding cash flows and the efforts of our talented workforce. Kevin? Yes. Allison, I would expect that -- we'd expect that to probably come back. It would be adding some cost back to the balance sheet. Particularly as the sales grow, you're going to see some more receivables come on the balance sheet and we're going to be focused on making sure that we've got all the right inventory levels in the business to support the growth and make sure we're good to go and can support our customers as we move forward. So I think we did really well in the first quarter. I think -- while we did put receivables and inventories back up on the balance sheet, our teams did a great job getting advanced payments from customers and the like. So that was a good result, but I'd expect to see that trend up a bit over the course of the balance of the year. Yes, I think there was 90 actually that was the temporary cost from last year, and we got the benefit of 50 million into 2021 for the structural restructuring, Scott. But what I\u2019d say is in the second half of the year, you're going to see those temporary costs come back in. And a little bit came in, in the first quarter, a little more in the second quarter. But in the second half of the year, you're going to have -- they're all back in. So that's how we\u2019ve modeled the year and we look at it. Yes, sure. If you look at -- if we spent that 1.8 billion that we talked about, certainly there'd be more capacity available. Our leverage would still only be below 2.5 at that point in time. So we'd have additional room to flex up from there if the right deals came along. So from a balance sheet capacity, that's not an issue and it's always, as we say, it's all about making sure that we have the management capability to be able to bring in those deals effectively, and Dave touched on that earlier in his comments."

            "name": "David Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter with stronger than expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution leading to earnings above our expectations. We returned to organic sales growth earlier than expected and as the economy continues its recovery, we're experiencing strong orders growth resulting in a record backlog.  Operationally, our businesses are performing at a high level, delivering impressive margin expansion and strong cash flows. Additionally, we started the year with a notable level of acquisition activity, deploying a record $1.85 billion on five acquisitions thus far in 2021. These acquisitions, combined with our strong first quarter results and solid orders momentum, led us to substantially increase our full year sales and earnings guidance.  Before I get into the results for the quarter, I wanted to again thank all AMETEK colleagues for their continued hard work and efforts over the last year as we manage through the pandemic. AMETEK\u2019s success in navigating this difficult environment is a testament to the dedicated and highly talented employees across the company.  While we are encouraged with the acceleration of the vaccine rollout, we remain focused on the health and well being of our employees and we'll remain vigilant in ensuring proper safety protocols are being followed.  Now, let me turn to the first quarter results. Overall, sales in the quarter were up 1% versus the prior year to $1.22 billion. Organic sales were up 1% with a divestiture of Reading Alloys being offset by a 2 point foreign currency tailwind.  Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.4 billion, up 16% compared to the same period last year with organic orders up 9%. This led to a book to bill of 1.15 and a record backlog of $2 billion.  We are encouraged by the strong orders as many of our businesses are seeing improved demand conditions across their markets, while some of our longer cycle businesses have yet to return to growth.  Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $356 million, up 4% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.2%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.07 per diluted share, up 5% versus the first quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02. Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong, with operating cash flow up 5% to $284 million and free cash flow conversion of 122% of net income.  Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group reported outstanding results in the first quarter, with both groups delivering positive organic sales growth and impressive margin expansion.  Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group in the quarter were $791 million, up 2% over last year's first quarter, driven by modest organic sales growth and a 1.5% foreign currency tailwind. EIG\u2019s operating income in the first quarter was $207 million, up 7% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 26.2%.  The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter with positive organic sales growth driven by strong demand in our automation business. EMG\u2019s first quarter sales were $425 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, while the divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 5 point headwind and foreign currency was a 2 point tailwind.  EMG\u2019s operating income was a record $105 million in the quarter, up 8% compared to the same quarter last year. And EMG\u2019s operating margins expanded an exceptional 190 basis points to a record 24.7%.  Now turning to acquisitions. As we have discussed, acquisition activity slowed considerably in 2020 due to the pandemic. During this time, we acted swiftly to appropriately align our cost structure with the demand environment and to protect and further strengthen our balance sheet to support a meaningful return of M&A in 2021.  At the same time, we communicated that our business and acquisition teams remain very active in managing our pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These actions positioned us to capitalize on an improving acquisition environment in a significant manner, deploying $1.85 billion to acquire five excellent businesses thus far this year.  Now, let me take a moment to provide additional color on these deals. I'll start with AMETEK\u2019s largest ever acquisition, Abaco Systems. Headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, Abaco is the leading provider of mission critical embedded computing systems used on key aerospace and defense platforms, along with specialized industrial applications.  Abaco\u2019s open architecture of computing and electronic systems are ruggedized to meet military standards and withstand harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures, altitude and high vibration.  As a leading provider of differentiated technology solutions serving attractive high growth applications, Abaco nicely complements and expands our existing aerospace and defense platform. Abaco has approximately 325 million in annual sales, and we deployed $1.35 billion on the acquisition.  Next, Magnetrol International. Based in Aurora, Illinois, Magnetrol is the leading provider of level and flow control solutions for challenging process applications across a diverse set of end markets, including medical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, food and beverage and general industrial markets. Magnetrol is an outstanding strategic fit with our sensors, test and calibration business. Combined, these businesses form an industry leading sensor platform with a broad range of level and flow measurement solutions. Magnetrol has annual sales of approximately $100 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition.  Today, we announced the acquisition of NSI-MI Technologies, a leading provider of radio frequency and microwave test and measurement solutions based in Suwanee, Georgia. NSI-MI is an exciting addition to our test and measurement platform, given their deep expertise in advanced RF and microwave technologies.  Their highly differentiated test and measurement solutions are uniquely positioned to support the continued development of advanced RF and microwave technologies for critical high growth applications, including 5G wireless communications, autonomous vehicles and specialized defense systems. NSI-MI has annual sales of approximately $90 million, and we deployed 230 million on the acquisition.  In addition to these acquisitions, AMETEK also acquired two smaller yet highly strategic businesses, Crank Software and EGS Automation. Crank Software, which is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, is the provider of embedded graphical user interface software and services. Crank\u2019s award winning storyboard software platform is ideally positioned to capitalize on the accelerating demand for smart digitally enabled devices. And EGS Automation is an attractive bolt-on acquisition for our Dunkermotoren business, expanding our presence in the attractive automation market. Located near Dunkers, German headquarters, EGS designs and manufactures highly engineered and customized robotic solutions for niche medical, food and beverage and general industrial markets.  We would like to welcome the Abaco, Magnetrol, NSI-MI, Crank Software and EGS teams to AMETEK and look forward to working closely with them and supporting their continued growth. Combined, these acquisitions add approximately 535 million in annual sales aligned with attractive secular growth markets. Additionally, they provide AMETEK with excellent returns in line with our stated hurdle rates. Each of these integrations is going very well in the early stages of our ownership.  AMETEK\u2019s decentralized operating structure and proven operating capability provides us the flexibility to successfully integrate the businesses, while continuing to pursue additional acquisitions. We're still working through a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. And as Bill will discuss in a moment, we have ample balance sheet capacity with approximately $1.8 billion available to support our acquisition strategy.  In addition to continued capital deployment on acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our businesses. For all of 2021, we expect to invest approximately 95 million in incremental growth investments. These investments are largely centered around our research and development and sales and marketing functions, including targeted investments in support of our digital transformation strategy.  Our investments in RD&E continued to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. For all of 2021, we expect to spend approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales on RD&E for our base businesses before adding in our recent acquisitions. This level of spend is up 10% over last year's RD&E spend.  Now shifting to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the first quarter, including solid orders growth and a record backlog, along with contributions from our recent acquisitions, we've increased our full year sales and earnings guidance. For 2021, we now expect overall sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis while organic sales are expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.56, which is an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's comparable basis. This new range is a $0.28 midpoint increase from our previous adjusted earnings guidance of $4.18 to $4.30 per diluted share.  For the second quarter, overall sales are anticipated to be up in the low 30% range versus last year's quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, up 29% to 31% over last year\u2019s second quarter. Our revised guidance includes each of the five completed acquisitions.  To summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent first quarter with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and meaningful capital deployment. These outstanding results speak to the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model along with the resilience of our world class workforce.  With our differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of niche end markets aligned with attractive secular growth opportunities, we remain firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  I will now turn it over to Bill who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then, we will be glad to take your questions. Yes, Matt. That's an excellent question. And it's really driven by a mix of different items. So we have the stronger than expected organic growth that drove Q1 of our guide. And then we have an improved guide for Q2. And both of those two together are about $0.10, $0.10 of the $0.28. Really, our second half is unchanged on a core basis. It's too early to change that. And then we have an additional $0.18 from the deal. So the way to think about that is [10%] (ph) from the core business, $0.18 from the deals, $0.28 in total. Thanks, Matt. We're very pleased with our pricing. It continues to offset inflation. We achieved a bit more than 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation was a bit less than 1%. So we're maintaining a positive spread between the two, which is our intention. And when you look out for all of '21, we expect to achieve slightly higher pricing than the 1.5% with slightly higher inflation. So we see both our pricing and inflation building a bit, and we'll strive to maintain a positive spread between price and inflation for the full year. And it's really -- it's driven by the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio. We have leadership positions in these markets around the globe and provide excellent value to our customers. So when we get cost increases, more than likely we can pass them on. Thank you, Matt. Good morning, Deane. Right. It's a great question. And I'll try to give you an overlay the way that we think about it. We've managed through many economic cycles and seeing the impact on M&A from the economic cycles. And it was no surprise then this particular downturn that deal activity dramatically slowed in 2020, and pent-up demand would drive a quick recovery. We talked about that last year. So our focus in 2020 was to make sure that we were well positioned for the rebound. And one of the ways we would be well positioned is we strengthen our balance sheet. And we built up our cash balances during the worst of the pandemic, and we exited the year with 1.2 billion in cash and net debt to EBITDA of 0.9.  Look, as we talked about last year, we also focused on expanding our pipeline of opportunities. And we told you last year, we were busier than ever with pipeline development. And as you stated we've been working with these companies for over a year on these deals. And just through the first four months, the sellers wanted to sell the businesses like we thought and we have a dedicated team of people that are working for them. So we acquired five companies, deployed 1.85 billion in capital and they're highly strategic. And we're really excited for each of the companies we acquired. They fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. Each has strong differentiated technology positions. They allow us to expand in attractive growth areas like embedded systems for aerospace and defense, testing for autonomous vehicles, 5G satellite communications, expanding our IoT capability, more capability in automation business, software for embedded systems. So we're really happy with the set of companies that we acquired. And importantly, each of these businesses are going to benefit from being part of AMETEK. We've developed a custom playbook for each of the businesses. And they're going to benefit from our global footprint to help them accelerate the efficiencies.  Importantly for us, we were able to get the deals done. We\u2019re meeting our traditional financial hurdles, which are a return on invested capital of 10% and an IRR of 15%. So these are important thresholds for us. And we want to ensure that we're providing strong level of returns on our capital deployed for shareholders. And one of the benefits of AMETEK\u2019s distributed operating model is that we can handle a bunch of acquisitions like this to acquire and integrate multiple businesses, while remaining active and acquiring other businesses. These are coming into different parts of AMETEK, and there's a senior AMETEK leader responsible for the integration. And our pipeline of opportunities remains strong. And we have a meaningful level of capacity, as Bill talked about, with strong cash flow. So I hope we're talking to you before the end of year about some other things, but we felt real good about it. And it wasn't just -- it all happened at once. It's a lot of hard work over the course of the pandemic and of course of greater than a year. Yes. If you think about the $0.28 midpoint rise on our guidance, $0.18 is from the deals this year and the other $0.10 is from the organic operations of the company. Thank you, Deane. Good morning, Josh. Yes, good questions. A few years ago, we let our investors know that we were expanding our deal pipeline to include slightly bigger businesses. And we included businesses that will be in the 200 million to 400 million range. And we deploy 1 billion plus capital on them, and Abaco is in that range. And we talked about doing a deal like that every so often. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to become our core, but those businesses are still working in our pipeline. But there are still many businesses that are, I\u2019ll call them medium size that are the $100 million deals similar to NSI-MI and Magnetrol. Those are probably the most businesses of that size. And then we also had some smaller deals that they're really important strategically to operate and augment our internal growth. So you're going to see a mix of deals of those sizes. AMETEK is not going to buy a company our size or buy a company half our size. We just don't think that you can create value like that, but the size of the company now I think those companies in the $200 million to $400 million revenue makes sense, and you'll see those from us occasionally. Right. When you -- I\u2019ll first unpack the orders a bit. We had a 9% organic order growth and it was broad-based in the company and EIG organic orders was 10%, EMG organic orders was 8%. So it was good to see broad-based orders. When you think about our portfolio, both EIG and EMG, we raised from mid single digits to high single digits. That's another indication of broad-based growth. I think that the overall company will grow sales sequentially each quarter. And as we look at our four market segments, process improved high single digits; power and industrial improved high single digits; automation and engineering improved high single digits; but the aerospace and defense segment, we continue to expect low to mid single digits with defense growing better than commercial. So when you think about the entire business, it really is going well. And I carve out the two long cycle businesses, oil and gas that we think will trend up in the second half of this year and the commercial aerospace business which will not trend up until 2023, maybe 2022, 2023. But the key point is, we have properly sized that business for the current level of activity and any small improvements along the way are going to be very profitable for us. So we look at it as really attractive. We're going to have the long cycle businesses kicking in down the road and we're already seeing the mid cycle pick up. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about the recovery. Thank you, Josh. Good morning, Allison. Yes, that's a good question. We had excellent margin performance in the first quarter, strong margin improvements in both EIG and EMG, a strong execution, solid price inflation, excellent productivity. We're going to see for the year core incrementals of 35%, and that includes bringing all the temporary costs back into the business. And core operating margins will increase about 40 basis points. So we\u2019ll grow margins. A key point though is the acquisitions are margin dilutive. So our reported margins will be down a bit, and that's kind of what we do. We acquire businesses that are lower margin than AMETEK. And over the course of a couple of years, three years, we bring them up to the AMETEK level when it's pretty hard to acquire businesses that are at the profitability level of AMETEK worth 29%, 30% EBITDA, and we have some room with all these businesses to improve profitability. So that's the way I think about the -- the core operating leverage on the business will be positive. And then the reported margins with the acquisitions will be margin dilutive. Thank you, Allison. Good morning, Nigel. They're a little bit of that, Nigel. But what I see is a lot of private owners -- and there were some private owners in this suite of businesses that we bought, they got through the pandemic and they're looking at a world that's changed, and they're looking at someone larger to provide some stability and some capital and some access to things that they didn't have access to. So I think it's more the uncertainty in the macro environment, the uncertainty driven by the pandemic, has certainly made private company owners more likely to consider the exit that they were maybe going to do a couple of years from now. That's what I think is happening and we're seeing a little bit of that. They were a record margin this quarter at 24.7%, up 190 basis points and their margins have been growing nicely for a period of time. And when you look at that part of the business and you dissect what happened, the two very profitable parts of that business, our automation business and our defense businesses, both are firing on all cylinders and that drove the margins up. So it's really a mix among businesses within the EMG group that is driving the margins. And as long as those businesses stay strong, I would expect the margins to be good. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. How are you doing? You're right on, Scott. The supply chain -- there are certainly challenges in materials and logistics right now. Specifically, the semiconductor shortages have our attention and our supply chain team are working this issue aggressively. Our guidance reflects all known risks. This is a serious issue, and one that will likely be with us for some period of time. And we're managing this with our dedicated business unit supply chain personnel with an overlay of our company-wide global sourcing, and they're an effective team and we've done an effective job on it so far. But it is a serious issue. Our guidance reflects the known risks and we're confident we can deliver it. But it really -- we just felt it was too early in the year to improve the second half earnings and sales guidance because of that. We think it's a nice balance. Yes, sure. In process, we talked about it and it was up mid single digits in the quarter and returned to positive organic growth earlier than we expected. A little extra color there. Ultra Precision Technologies and our Materials Analysis divisions really had good quarters and they're seeing improving demand across a broad set of end markets. They\u2019re in the research, semiconductor and industrial markets.  We're also seeing very strong growth in orders across our process businesses. Organic quarters were up low double digit, so a little bit higher than AMETEK\u2019s overall. And for the full year, we now expect those organic sales for our process businesses to be up high single digits versus the prior year. It was mid single digits in the original guide for the year and we\u2019ve raised it to high single digits. So process orders look good, process is doing very well in Asia. And certain divisions are starting to fire on all cylinders.  In our aerospace and defense business, our overall sales for A&D were down approximately 10% in the first quarter, modestly ahead of our expectation. And really there's a bifurcation going on there. The defense businesses remained robust with sales up low double digits on a percentage basis. Commercial aerospace are still feeling the effects of the pandemics. Year-on-year rates have declined or continuing to improve. But in the first quarter, commercial aerospace sales were down approximately 25%. So for all of '21, like I said before, we continue to expect low to mid single digit organic sales growth from our aerospace and defense business. We did not change the outlook on that segment as we did the other three.  Power and industrial overall sales were up slightly from the prior year's first quarter. Very strong orders, up mid teens on orders. We now expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be up high single digits and we changed that from up mid single digits in the first outlook for the year. And finally, our automation and engineered solutions, up modestly versus the prior year, while organic sales were up mid single digits. Overall, sales were impacted by the divestiture of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of last year. Sales across our automation businesses, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, remained strong and we're seeing solid demand conditions across their international markets, in Asia and China in particular. And for all of 2021, we now expect automation and engineered solution businesses organic sales growth to be up high single digits with stronger growth in our automation businesses than our engineered solutions business. And so you end up with both EIG and EMG being up high single digits raised from mid single digits. Okay, Scott? Thank you. Good question. We have highly engineered products. So I don't think people are stocking them. But certainly in the current macro environment, people want to get their orders -- customers want to get their orders placed to make sure that they can get the products that they need. So we're seeing confident customers concerned about the global supply chain, and placing their orders earlier than expected. All of the geographies showed improvements. The U.S. was down mid single digits, improvements in most areas but the decline was driven by commercial aerospace and oil and gas. Really, it was the same picture in Europe where we were down mid single digits with good improvement, but weaknesses in commercial aero and oil and gas. And Asia was the star for us, a broad-based strength up mid 20s led by our automation business and our process business. Thank you. Good morning, Rob. In Q1, we did an excellent job and we didn't have any inability to ship because of supply chain. And our teams are going to work on the full year and there are certainly challenges, but we have a good team working on them and going to solve them. I don't think we've seen the worst of it yet, just based on what's happening on semiconductors. I think some of the logistics issues we think will moderate during midyear, but the semiconductor shortages could continue into 2022. And there are higher prices you're dealing with or issues with the global supply chain recovering from a V-shaped recovery, and we have a really good supply chain capability. We're dealing with it effectively, but we're not immune to it. So we're doing our best to stay on top of it. In Q1, we didn't have any issues and our guidance reflects the known issues, and we're confident in our guidance. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, Brett. Yes, great questions, Brett. The first thing, defense is about 12% of the sales of AMETEK. And when we looked at Abaco, we wanted to make sure that we have a changing administration, we wanted to make sure we were able to grow through this. And if you look back at Abaco over the last three or four years, they grew about 16% and that's very, very excellent. It's healthy. We feel that embedded computing is among the most compelling growth opportunities in A&D to the substantial DoD focus on modernization and upgrades of existing defense platforms, because there's a focus on processing intensive and data intensive mission capabilities in the future. We also got comfortable with -- they've amassed over $1 billion in design wins that underpin the growth over the next several years. So that's all good. But at the same time, we think they're well positioned to offset any overall DoD funding headwinds, because of those factors. And we\u2019ve modeled our top line as a high single digit grower versus the mid teens in the recent past. So we think we got a conservative model there. The management team of the business is still driving to those higher growth rates. But we modeled it conservatively. And when you look at AMETEK\u2019s broader defense exposure beyond Abaco, right now, we're kind of in the right areas. There's a lot of electronics going in and we're in cooling and heating electronics in terms of the environmental controls, and it's been doing well for us. And we think this year for 2021 outside of Abaco, our core business will be up into high single digits in the defense market. And we went into the year saying mid single digits, but we had a very strong first quarter. So we improved the defense business to mid to high single digits. Yes. Our strategy is really not capacity constrained. Even at 2.5, we're well below our covenants. Our strategy is constrained by finding good deals that are differentiated that meet our requirements, so we can improve. So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to do that. And hopefully, we're talking to you again later this year. And we have a good pipeline, but it's really finding those deals that we get confident we can get a return. That's the key issue, Brett, not finding them. Thank you. Hi, Joe. How are you doing? Yes, that's a great question. And we obviously spent a lot of time on that. And based on our questions and Abaco in particular, they have all their -- they have committed order for their plan on 2021. So we pushed it and they responded, and it was an area of heavy focus on our diligence. You don't have full access to the business, but it's understood by the Abaco team, they were very good. And I think that we're well positioned to deal with the supply chain issues in that business. Yes, we're not thinking about a new structure. We got the four sub-segments under the two reporting segments externally. So we have EIG and EMG. EIG is about two-thirds of the size of the company. EMG is about one-third. And we provide insight in revenue disaggregation into process, which is about 46% of the company pro forma. Aerospace and defense was about 19% of the company pro forma. Power and industrial which is about 14% of the company and automation and engineered solutions is about 22%. And power and industrial is 14%. So we're comfortable with it. And we think this structure is going to let us go and grow for the next few years. Thanks, Joe."

AMETEK's continued excellent performance reflects the quality of our niche-differentiated businesses, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, and the expanding impact of our organic growth initiatives, and most importantly, the outstanding efforts of our global employees. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your many contributions to our success. We have navigated many challenges over the last few years only to emerge stronger and even better positioned for sustained growth. Our results in the fourth quarter were outstanding. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and excellent operating performance led to a high quality of earnings which exceeded our expectations in the quarter. We ended the year with a record backlog as demand remains solid across our diverse end markets. Organic growth was again very strong in the quarter as our teams are successfully driving key organic growth initiatives across their businesses and expanding their presence serving attractive growth markets. Operationally, we're performing exceptionally well and offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in strong margin expansion. Additionally, cash flow in the quarter was outstanding, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and deploy capital on strategic acquisitions. Now, on to the results of the fourth quarter and all of 2022, fourth quarter sales were $1.63 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 9%, acquisitions added two points. And foreign currency was a three-point headwind in the quarter. Orders were solid in the fourth quarter against a challenging comparison, resulting in a record backlog of $3.22 billion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $398 million, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.5% in the quarter, up 50 basis points [technical difficulty] from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $489 million, up 12% over the prior year. And EBITDA margins were an impressive 30.1%. This outstanding operating performance led to record earnings of $1.52 per diluted share, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, and above our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.47 per share. Now, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level; first, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered continued strong sales growth and excellent operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 9%, acquisitions added 3%, and foreign currency was a three-point headwind. EIG growth was broad-based with particularly strong growth across our Aerospace & Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses in the quarter. EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter was a record $307 million, up 10% versus the prior year, while EIG margins were a very strong 26.5% in the quarter. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with outstanding performance. EMG's fourth quarter sales were $466 million, up 4% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 8%, and foreign currency a three-point headwind. Growth was again broad-based across EMG, with our Aerospace & Defense businesses leading the growth. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $115 million, up 9% compared to the prior year period. EMG's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.6%, up an impressive 100 basis points versus the prior year. Now for the full-year results; overall, performance was outstanding in 2022, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.15 billion, up 11% from 2021. Organic sales increased 11%, acquisitions added 2%, and foreign currency was a three-point headwind. Operating income for 2022 was $1.5 billion, up 15%. And operating margins were 24.4%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year. While core margins up and impressive 130 basis points, reflecting our ability to successfully manage inflation and supply chain challenges. EBITDA for the year was $1.83 billion, up 15% from 2021, with EBITDA margins a very strong 29.7%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. Full-year earnings were $5.68 per diluted share, up an impressive 17% versus the prior year. AMETEK's performance in a challenging operating environment highlights the proven strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to successfully navigate through uncertain economic times. Our businesses continue to leverage the key elements of the AMETEK growth model to accelerate global growth, develop innovative new products, and identify and execute on operational efficiency improvements. Additionally, our businesses worked closely with our corporate development team to manage our acquisition pipeline, resulting in a continued strong deployment of capital on strategic acquisitions. In 2021 and 2022 combined, we deployed over $2.4 billion in capital on eight acquisitions, and acquired over $600 million in annual sales. We expect to remain active in 2023 as our deal pipeline remains very strong, and our balance sheet provides us significant financial capacity to deploy capital. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain committed to investing in organic growth initiatives and are very pleased with the impact these investments are having on AMETEK's growth. As I highlighted during our last earnings call, AMETEK's portfolio has strategically evolved with increased exposure to higher growth market segments. This portfolio evolution has been driven by our acquisition strategy and by the organic investments we are making in our businesses. In 2023, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments across research, development, and engineering, and sales and marketing. One way we measure the success of these investments is through our Vitality Index, which was an outstanding 27% of sales in 2022. Our increased investments in RD&E continue to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, including within our Zygo business. Zygo, which is based in Middlefield, Connecticut, designs and manufactures advanced optical metrology systems and ultra-precise optical components and assembles for a diverse set of end markets, including defense, research, and semiconductor. Zygo partnered with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility to provide high-end precision optics in support of their inertial fusion energy testing program, which provides a significant leap forward in the realization of sustainable fusion energy. Achieving these heights of energy production requires the use of highly precise optics and scalable manufacturing processes which were developed in partnership with Zygo. I want to congratulate the Zygo team for their tremendous contributions supporting important advancements in research and technology. Lastly, let me briefly touch on the supply chain issues and inflation. While tightness remains in certain areas, we're seeing improvements in the global supply and logistics. Additionally, although inflation remains elevated, we are also seeing modest improvements versus levels experienced in 2022. As we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to proactively manage our supply chain and remain confident in our ability to offset inflation with price increases. Now, shifting to our outlook for the year ahead, while macroeconomic uncertainties remain, we are confident in the quality of our businesses, the flexibility of the AMETEK growth model, and our ability to navigate through these uncertain times. Additionally, given our record backlog and proven operating capability, we are confident in our outlook for 2023. For 2023, we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single-digits versus 2022. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.84 to $6, up 3% to 6% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales up mid-single-digits with adjusted earnings up $1.38, of the $1.38 to $1.42, up 4% to 7% versus the prior-year. In summary, AMETEK's fourth quarter and full-year results were excellent, our record backlog, the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model and a world class workforce position us nicely for 2023. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions, Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong fourth quarter to complete an outstanding year. In the quarter, we delivered record level operating performance at a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and for the full-year along with some additional guidance for 2023. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were essentially flat versus the prior-year and for the full-year general and administrative expenses were up $6 million, driven largely by higher compensation costs. And as a percentage of sales were 1.5% versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and remain at approximately 1.5% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 18.9%, up from 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For 2023, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% and as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $58 million in the fourth quarter, and $139 million for the full-year. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be approximately $114 million, or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $89 million, and for the full-year was $320 million. In 2023, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $325 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $154 million or $0.66 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.9% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was excellent with operating cash flow of $385 million, up 37% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was also up 37% to $327 million in the quarter, while free cash flow conversion was 106% of net income. Total debt at year-end was $2.39 billion down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $345 million and during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $240 million on the acquisition of RTDS Technologies. Gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at year-end was 1.2 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. As Dave noted, we remain active on the acquisition front with a solid pipeline of acquisition candidates. Given our strong cash flow and modest levels of leverage, we're well-positioned to deploy additional capital. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022 delivering strong growth and high quality of earnings in a challenging operating environment. AMETEK is well-positioned for 2023, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model, and our world-class workforce. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Rocco, can we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Can we turn organic investments, the $90 million, if I recall, I think that's a step-down from what you did in '22, just any color there, is there just some conservative nature just given the uncertainty out there, are there unusual projects in '22, just any thoughts on that side?\nDave Zapico: Yes, that's to start off the year, and there a potential to do more, and -- but the $90 million was a good number, and it's incremental; Keep in mind, incremental over what we've done in 2022. So, it's incremental, and we're making healthy investments in RD&E, it's up double digits for the year, and healthy investments for sales and marketing. So, we think the $90 million is appropriate. And, obviously, that can be flexed up or down if required.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. And then a lot of concerns, I mean, out there about potentially some weakness showing up in H2. Just any thoughts on your end, what you're seeing in terms of that? Is there anything concerning or sort of popping out that has you a bit worried as we enter the back-half of '23 and into '24?\nDave Zapico: Not really. I mean, the -- obviously, our growth is slowing, but the record backlogs and we're executing very well, we're getting the price, and it still feels good to us. It feels strong and good. And when you get out to the second-half of 2023, I mean this is a -- there's less visibility because you're further out, but our backlog is at a record level. It's usually at about 30% of annual sales. And right now, it's running at about 50% of annual sales. So, we feel really good. And we don't see a slowdown yet.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect, thank you.\nDave Zapico: Okay, thank you, Allison.\nOperator: And the next question today comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: I was hoping you'd take us through the key end markets. And then also on the regional updates, it's been interesting, maybe people got too negative on Europe. So, like to know how Europe did. And then China reopening, how does that impact you all?\nDave Zapico: Sure, Deane. I'll start with your second question, the geographical outlook. Strong, broad-based growth across most geographies. Our Asia region was flat on China headwinds. And to your point, our fastest growing market was Europe. Europe was up 12% with notable strength in both our process and aerospace defense markets. And then we had a really strong performance in the U.S., up 10% organically; broad-based strength, notable strength in our process businesses. And in Asia, as I said, it was flat, with notable strength in aerospace and defense, and process. And China was down for us low double digits in the quarter on a difficult prior-year comp, and the impact of the Zero COVID policy. And Asia, we think that the China situation is going to turn around as the reopening occurs. And we're pretty optimistic for it in the second-half. But that's the picture in Q4, really strong broad-based growth, strongest Europe, and second U.S. Most of Asia was really good, and in China there was some weakness. Okay, and the second question was in market segment's summery. I'll take a walk around the company. In our process area, our overall process businesses, they were up high-single digits in the quarter. Organic sales were up 10%, and you also had the contributions from the acquisition of Navitar and it was offset by foreign currency headwinds. And as we saw throughout last year, growth across our process businesses was particularly -- was broad-based, but it was particularly strong in our Ultra Precision Technologies businesses in the quarter. And as we look ahead to 2023, we expect organic sales for process businesses to be up mid-single digits for the year. Next I'll talk about Aerospace & Defense. Our Aerospace & Defense businesses had a very strong finish to the year, and with overall and organic sales up mid teens. So, that was the strongest growth rate of the year for Aerospace & Defense. Our commercial businesses led the growth in the quarter. We had sales of high teens on a percentage business in the commercial business. And Defense was also strong in the quarter, growing low double digits. And for all of 2023, we expect organic sales for our Aerospace & Defense businesses to be up mid-to-high single digits, with commercial aerospace growth expected to be modestly stronger than defense growth. I'll next go to our Power & Industrial, overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up high single digits in the fourth quarter, driven by mid single-digit organic growth and the contributions from the acquisition of RTDS. Growth in the quarter was particularly strong across our programmable power business. For all of 2023, we expect organic sales for our Power & Industrial business to be up mid single digits, with similar growth across both the Power & Industrials segments. And finally, I'll talk about our Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment. And overall sales were up low single digits in the fourth quarter, with very solid mid single-digit organic sales growth, had some currency headwind in that segment. I was very pleased with the overall growth and the performance of Automation & Engineered Solutions in 2022. They're continuing to expand exposures in attractive niche markets. And in particular, our Engineered Medical Components business saw strong growth in the quarter. And in 2023, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be up mid single digits, with similar growth expected across both our Automation and Engineered Solutions business. That's a walk around the company. Deane, do you have any more questions?\nDeane Dray: Yes, just as a follow-up, just how would you characterize the pace of orders, industrial demand, the size of orders, is there -- just with respect to how normalization might be happening for AMETEK's businesses?\nDave Zapico: That's a great question, Deane. Our overall orders were up 1.5% in the quarter. And the overall demand environment, as I answered Allison's questions, feels really solid. We had our 10th straight positive book-to-bill quarter. And we ended with an all-time record backlog as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And this level of backlog, as I said, was 50% of our annual sales, well above the normal level of 30%. And it's up 78% from the end of 2020. So, we're in a really strong position as we enter 2023. So, your question on some of the nuances, if you recall, over the last couple of earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact our order growth. But the first was the difficult comparisons we're facing because as orders have been strong for an extended period of time. To give some context, over the prior nine quarters, our orders grew over 20% a quarter. So, it's been sizable and sustained that that helped build the backlog. The second dynamic we highlighted was the expectation of customers to return to more normalized ordering patterns. Now that the supply chain is improving and -- we started to see that dynamic play out in the fourth quarter. So, overall, we're comfortable with our order levels in Q4. After starting off in January and we just finished January, we had another sold orders a month, ahead of our expectations, and solidly up from January 2022 order levels. So, again, we're feeling pretty good with a strong backlog and our orders are hanging in there. So, we think that we're in -- looking at a pretty good year.\nDeane Dray: It's all really helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Okay, thank you, Deane.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning, all.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: Hey. And just wanted to come back to the inventories, some of your peers have been talking about some elevated inventory in some of the OEM channels. Just curious what you're seeing there in some of your serve businesses, serve markets, and if there's any area of concern there?\nDave Zapico: Yes, the first point I'd like to make is that when you're looking at customer inventories, a lot of our products are customized, and they're high-value products. So, we don't really have a lot of distributor stocking issues to worry about. That's particularly true in EIG. In EMG, there's more of an OEM deal with the customer base, and that's where you're seeing a bit of the customer ordering patterns normalize. But overall, we think we've got a good handle on it, and we feel pretty good about where we're at.\nBrett Linzey: Yes, okay, that's great. And just shifting to the 2023 outlook, I was hoping maybe you could put a finer point on just the underlying assumptions. How much price do you expect verses volume? And then anything specific on the quarterly phasing, I mean do you think you'll get growth in both the first-half, second-half, or as you work down the backlog, does it begin to decline there in the second-half?\nDave Zapico: Yes, great question. I mean with our budget model, we pretty much have a traditional first quarter. So, it's not really second-half-biased. And we think we'll grow in each of the quarters of the year. And in terms of pricing, in our budget model we have about four points of price. And we assume that we assume that we have about 3.5 points of inflation. So, we are going to offset price and inflation by about 50 basis points. Now, that\u2019s down a bit from 2022 where six points of price. And we offset about 5 points of inflation. But, it\u2019s the guide for the entire year. And we are being a bit conservative now. And, we will probably start out a little better than that. But, that\u2019s our plan for 2023. Also in 2023, I mean in addition to staying in front of inflation with price, we think supply chain shortages are going to abate. And we believe our working capital levels will decrease to more normalized levels to a very healthy 110% to 115% conversion to net income on the free cash flow. We also think that in terms of vertical markets we do expect our longer cycle aerospace and defense businesses to be a bit stronger than the balance of the portfolio. So, one through the mortgage segment commentary, Deane, it was a little bit higher, was -- had a mid- to-high outlook. So, we think that\u2019s going to be true. And that was accelerating as we -- each quarter of 2022 really. We expect both of our groups to grow mid single digits. We talked about the historically strong backlog. And, that\u2019s some assumptions that went into our budget. Do you have any questions, Brett?\nBrett Linzey: No, that\u2019s it. Great quarter, and I appreciate all the insight.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Brett.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next questioner today is Scott Graham from Loop. Please go ahead.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning all. And really congrats on that Zygo, that\u2019s a pretty big deal.\nDave Zapico: Hey, that\u2019s a really interesting, that's really helping, but that team did a great job. And it\u2019s working on fusion energy is a great thing. And, it just shows our capability.\nScott Graham: Yes, for sure. Thank you. The orders gave you said up 1.5 in the quarter. Was that organic? And can you also tell the split by segment?\nDave Zapico: Yes. That was overall worse. Organic was down minus 2. And so, overall orders were up 1.5. Organic was minus 2. And both segments were about at that same 1:1 book-to-bill. So, wasn\u2019t a distinct difference between the segments, and as I said, overall demand environment showed a solid 10 straight quarter of book-to-bill. So, we have a strong backlog. And as we have this dynamic of customers returning to more normalized ordering patterns, we have a strong backlog. So, we feel pretty good about it.\nScott Graham: Okay, great. Thank you. Based on your answer to the prior question, is it possible then that sales volumes could sort of flatten out in the second half of the year. And your growth organic is essentially all price? Is that what you are what you are thinking cadence wise?\nBill Burke: I don\u2019t think in the second half of the year. I mean we are going to have some healthy price. But I think it\u2019s going to actually increase a bit in the second-half. And, if you think about our order rates we have that mid single digit sales growth forecasted. We think we are going to grow orders also. So, orders are going to grow a little bit less than sales as our forecast. But, they are going to grow. And really by the end of the year, our backlog is still going to be at elevated levels. It will be down a bit, but at elevated levels historically. So, we are clearly done with our strong backlog which will provide a buffer is there is some kind of downturn. We don\u2019t see it right now. And our orders will be up, but it will be up a little less than sales. And again, at the end of 2023, we have historically elevated levels of backlog similar to now.\nScott Graham: Yes, great. Hey, thank you.\nBill Burke: Yes, Scott.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matt Summerville at D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nWill Jellison: Hi, good morning. This is Will Jellison on for Matt Summerville today.\nDave Zapico: Hello, good morning.\nWill Jellison: I was curious about your recent acquisitions with Navitar and RTDS. And just about your first observations with those companies as part of the AMETEK portfolio. How did things unfold related to expectations? And how are things going with bringing them into the fold?\nDave Zapico: Yes, they are going very well. I mean Bill and I have met with both of the acquisition integration teams and really positive. Just to recap a little bit, RTDS provides real-time power simulations used by utilities and various strategic acquisitions that broadens our power instruments businesses with differentiated testing and measurement and simulation capabilities. So, it's attractive position and high growth market. Really good team, I mean, just experts in the field. And it's kind of fun interacting with them. And they're really adopting AMETEK and feel good about that one. Same with Navitar, Navitar is in some good growth markets. The optics market is doing quite well with us. And even in the semiconductor space, where they play their main customers is one that's very differentiated and has unique capabilities. So, that along with Life Sciences along with machine vision, there's a very good outlook there. And that business is a little bit different as being integrated into our Zygo business. So, it has new capability for Zygo. Much needed capacity for Zygo and the integration is going very well.\nWill Jellison: Great, thank you. And then, as a follow-up, staying on the theme of M&A, you mentioned your pipeline is very strong at this juncture. And I'm curious about what your observations are in the market overall, with respect to the level of competition for assets and where multiples seem to be moving in your observation?\nDave Zapico: Right, yes, I think with the interest rates increasing, and with money, not as free as it was, is actually an advantage to us. So, we have a good pipeline and a good balance sheet. And we remain very active with a solid pipeline of deals, the valuations have come in a bit. We're looking at some quality assets, though. So, they're still a bit elevated from historical levels, but no doubt they've come in. And important for us in our pipeline, we have a very disciplined acquisition process. And these deals are going to meet our traditional financial hurdles, which is primarily a return on invested capital of 10% by the third year of ownership. These are important thresholds for us as we want to ensure we're providing a strong level returns on the capital we deploy for our shareholders. And that's been a hallmark of AMETEK's acquisition program for a long period of time. We do this all with cash and debt, don't use equity. And there's a bigger pipeline right now than has been historically because when there's less, less money around the system to bid up deals. So, we feel pretty good with where we're at. And if we do something, and I believe we will be talking to you about deals in the near future, they're going to be, they're going to meet all of our traditional hurdles. And we're committed to have an investment grade credit rating, and we got plenty of about $2.3 billion of capital and financing capacity available. So, in this environment, discipline is going to be a key word as it's always been for AMETEK. But have been very key in terms of executing our forward-looking M&A strategy.\nWill Jellison: That's great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nDave Zapico: Yes, okay.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Hi, this is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin.\nDave Zapico: Hi, David.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. How much of the one-time costs around supply chain disruptions last year, the higher freight costs, the spot buys and electronics, all those things fall-off in 2023? I'm guessing I'm wondering is this a meaningful tailwind in kind of your forecasts?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I think that what you're going to see, there's still an elevated level of inflation. But at the same time, some of the one-time distributor purchases of inventory are going to go away. So, there's going to be some natural tailwinds for us in terms of margins, we expect that working in the P&L in our budget model, our productivity/cost savings of about $110 million. So, we think it'll be substantial. And that's where we're starting out the year but we think there's maybe even some upside to that. And it's largely related to a, and there is a couple of opposing forces, you're dealing with inflation and some costs of things are still going up. But at the same time, some of the supply chain issues are working the other way and especially the higher prices that we paid on a one-time basis to some of the electronics distributors to continue shipping products.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it and then you have been adding capacity through 2022, I guess in the CapEx, what's kind of growth versus maintenance or whatever framework you want to use to discuss kind of how you're thinking about capacity additions here in 2022?\nDave Zapico: We added a lot of capacity in 2022, we brought some low cost region facilities online, we've talked about that. For 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be flat, a little bit more than 2% of sales, as we've done historically. So, and it's a good balance between growth CapEx, maintenance CapEx and CapEx funding cost reductions.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Then, if I could get one more in, what is your expected EPS contribution from Navitar and RTDS?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I'm not going to break out the deal, but there'll be slightly accretive.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nDave Zapico: Okay, thank you, David.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Yes, you mentioned -- you mentioned customers kind of getting normalized on their behavior and their ordering patterns, like, can you maybe get a little bit finer point on that? And like, what you're seeing, are actual things getting pushed out, or are they just ordering more real times?\nDave Zapico: Yes, if you think about it from the customer's view, they've kind of got trained by the pandemic, to order things early. And now, most companies are getting including AMETEK is getting back to being able to deliver in lead time. And in fact, that's part of the reason that we grow our businesses at a faster rate during the pandemic period, we were able to ship and deliver and we had the inventory buffer. So, what's happening is, as customers normalize their buying patterns, they don't have to order early anymore. And that's what's really happening, I think across the broader supply chain, and we're seeing that. So, that's the main normalization that we're talking about.\nJoe Giordano: And then when you mentioned the M&A pipeline looks good. How do you think about timing of execution, just given the macro year, given it looks like industrial is getting lighter, is getting weaker and are you relying on trailing 12 results that might be different than forward 12 for acquired for companies that you're looking at. So, how does it impact your desire to do be actionable right now, given where we are in the business cycle?\nDave Zapico: AMETEK has historically bought through both upcycles and down cycles. And sometimes you can get your best deals during a down cycle. And you have to be cognizant of what the forward-looking EBITDA is not really the trailing, but the forward. So, it's something that we've been keenly aware of for years, and we're focused on it.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Rob Mason of Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning.\nDave Zapico: Hello, Rob.\nRob Mason: Hey, Dave. Good morning, good morning. Dave, I'm just going to see if you could drill into the process segment a little more, you called out Ultra Precision with relative stronger growth, does that carry forward into '23 just in terms of what leads that part of the business? And then just maybe higher level anyway to cut the mix of what that process segment, that sales into more of an R&D function versus more of a production environment?\nDave Zapico: Yes, that's a good way to think about it. And I'll try to put some more color into that. I mean, if you look at 2022, what stood out was our healthcare component. And our healthcare component is a big part of process across all of AMETEK, it's about 50% of sales, but it's a big part of the process. And I'll give you an idea. And Q4, our rolling business was up 20% organically, so they're really doing a good job. And that market has -- hospital spending has been fantastic for us, and people were putting in new systems post-pandemic. Also the semiconductor markets about 6% of sales, and the vast majority of that is in process and the semiconductor market was up high single-digits in the Q4. And we think in 2023, there'll be a slight downtick there, that'll be up low-to-mid but still growing because we have a lot of applications and research and also in the areas that are continuing to grow. So, we're in the right places in semiconductor. So, you got healthcare, you got semiconductor. You got the research market where we've had with our CAMECA business just every lab in the world has to have one of our atom probes, every lab in the world has to have some of our SIMS products. So, their backlog is really good. And they're doing well. And then, you got the old traditional oil and gas part of process. And that's doing very well in Q4, it was up high-single-digits. And for all '22, it was up low double-digits. And for '23, we expect plus high-single-digits. So, process is doing very well. And we think it's going to continue in the future.\nRob Mason: Excellent. That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up, could you speak to how you think the incrementals will look for EIG versus EMG, in '23 they were, EMG was certainly very strong in '22. But just how did those look going forward comparatively?\nDave Zapico: Good question. In terms of incrementals, in both groups, I think the core incrementals will be up 30% to 35%. And I think the core and reported margins will be up 30 to 40 Bps. So, we really think we have a clear line of sight to grow margins. Again, there'll be healthy incrementals. And we'll be able to increase our core margins as we go forward.\nRob Mason: Very good. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Steve Barger at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Hey, good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Hello, Steve.\nSteve Barger: Some automation and robotics OEMs have recently talked about distribution channel bottlenecks being a hindrance to growth, can you just talk about what you're seeing in that market, both near-term and expectations for how that market grows in the future?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I think for 2023, we think that business will be at mid-single-digits. And both our automation and our engineering solutions will be up mid-single-digits, I think that we're selling to mainly OEM customers there. So, you're going to have a bit of the effect of the ordering patterns, a change in ordering patterns there, but we have a really healthy backlog. So, it's really what we talked about customers are changing ordering patterns. We're really good at delivery. So, we're meeting our customer commitments, so they're now ordering at normal lead times. So, you'll see a little bit of the order corrections that we talked about in Q4 continuing. But we still have a record backlog and all the comments that I made hold for that part of the business also.\nSteve Barger: Got it. Thanks. And obviously semiconductor demand has been under pressure, especially on the memory side. But you just said you're in the right places to grow. That mean, you're supplying the makers of tools that go to foundry and logic or just how will you grow this year in the context of what's a pretty tough memory side?\nDave Zapico: Right, it's pretty tough. And again, we grew mid-teens in 2022. So, that growth for 2023 is up low-to-mid. So, it's a substantial decline. But we're still growing and the reason we're growing the key application areas, at our CAMECA business, they're really involved in semiconductor research and development and staying ahead and getting the next generation. And we have some tools that are must haves for the semiconductor market, and really strong backlogs and orders are continuing well. And then, the second area is we're in the EUV optics area for used in semiconductor fabrication. So, the EUV market is kind of separate from the memory market and really strong. So, those two areas are the good part of our semiconductor business and they're really strong. And that's why we think we'll still be able to grow low to mid-single-digits in an environment where you have some of the headwinds.\nSteve Barger: That's great detail. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Okay, thank you, Steve.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Great. Thank you again, Rocco. And thank you, everyone for joining us for our conference call. As a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with AMETEK's results in the fourth quarter, and for all of 2022. AMETEK's continued excellent performance reflects the quality of our niche-differentiated businesses, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, and the expanding impact of our organic growth initiatives, and most importantly, the outstanding efforts of our global employees. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your many contributions to our success. We have navigated many challenges over the last few years only to emerge stronger and even better positioned for sustained growth. Our results in the fourth quarter were outstanding. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and excellent operating performance led to a high quality of earnings which exceeded our expectations in the quarter. We ended the year with a record backlog as demand remains solid across our diverse end markets. Organic growth was again very strong in the quarter as our teams are successfully driving key organic growth initiatives across their businesses and expanding their presence serving attractive growth markets. Operationally, we're performing exceptionally well and offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in strong margin expansion. Additionally, cash flow in the quarter was outstanding, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and deploy capital on strategic acquisitions. Now, on to the results of the fourth quarter and all of 2022, fourth quarter sales were $1.63 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 9%, acquisitions added two points. And foreign currency was a three-point headwind in the quarter. Orders were solid in the fourth quarter against a challenging comparison, resulting in a record backlog of $3.22 billion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $398 million, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.5% in the quarter, up 50 basis points [technical difficulty] from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $489 million, up 12% over the prior year. And EBITDA margins were an impressive 30.1%. This outstanding operating performance led to record earnings of $1.52 per diluted share, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, and above our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.47 per share. Now, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level; first, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered continued strong sales growth and excellent operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 9%, acquisitions added 3%, and foreign currency was a three-point headwind. EIG growth was broad-based with particularly strong growth across our Aerospace & Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses in the quarter. EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter was a record $307 million, up 10% versus the prior year, while EIG margins were a very strong 26.5% in the quarter. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with outstanding performance. EMG's fourth quarter sales were $466 million, up 4% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 8%, and foreign currency a three-point headwind. Growth was again broad-based across EMG, with our Aerospace & Defense businesses leading the growth. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $115 million, up 9% compared to the prior year period. EMG's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.6%, up an impressive 100 basis points versus the prior year. Now for the full-year results; overall, performance was outstanding in 2022, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.15 billion, up 11% from 2021. Organic sales increased 11%, acquisitions added 2%, and foreign currency was a three-point headwind. Operating income for 2022 was $1.5 billion, up 15%. And operating margins were 24.4%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year. While core margins up and impressive 130 basis points, reflecting our ability to successfully manage inflation and supply chain challenges. EBITDA for the year was $1.83 billion, up 15% from 2021, with EBITDA margins a very strong 29.7%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. Full-year earnings were $5.68 per diluted share, up an impressive 17% versus the prior year. AMETEK's performance in a challenging operating environment highlights the proven strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to successfully navigate through uncertain economic times. Our businesses continue to leverage the key elements of the AMETEK growth model to accelerate global growth, develop innovative new products, and identify and execute on operational efficiency improvements. Additionally, our businesses worked closely with our corporate development team to manage our acquisition pipeline, resulting in a continued strong deployment of capital on strategic acquisitions. In 2021 and 2022 combined, we deployed over $2.4 billion in capital on eight acquisitions, and acquired over $600 million in annual sales. We expect to remain active in 2023 as our deal pipeline remains very strong, and our balance sheet provides us significant financial capacity to deploy capital. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain committed to investing in organic growth initiatives and are very pleased with the impact these investments are having on AMETEK's growth. As I highlighted during our last earnings call, AMETEK's portfolio has strategically evolved with increased exposure to higher growth market segments. This portfolio evolution has been driven by our acquisition strategy and by the organic investments we are making in our businesses. In 2023, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments across research, development, and engineering, and sales and marketing. One way we measure the success of these investments is through our Vitality Index, which was an outstanding 27% of sales in 2022. Our increased investments in RD&E continue to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, including within our Zygo business. Zygo, which is based in Middlefield, Connecticut, designs and manufactures advanced optical metrology systems and ultra-precise optical components and assembles for a diverse set of end markets, including defense, research, and semiconductor. Zygo partnered with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility to provide high-end precision optics in support of their inertial fusion energy testing program, which provides a significant leap forward in the realization of sustainable fusion energy. Achieving these heights of energy production requires the use of highly precise optics and scalable manufacturing processes which were developed in partnership with Zygo. I want to congratulate the Zygo team for their tremendous contributions supporting important advancements in research and technology. Lastly, let me briefly touch on the supply chain issues and inflation. While tightness remains in certain areas, we're seeing improvements in the global supply and logistics. Additionally, although inflation remains elevated, we are also seeing modest improvements versus levels experienced in 2022. As we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to proactively manage our supply chain and remain confident in our ability to offset inflation with price increases. Now, shifting to our outlook for the year ahead, while macroeconomic uncertainties remain, we are confident in the quality of our businesses, the flexibility of the AMETEK growth model, and our ability to navigate through these uncertain times. Additionally, given our record backlog and proven operating capability, we are confident in our outlook for 2023. For 2023, we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single-digits versus 2022. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.84 to $6, up 3% to 6% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales up mid-single-digits with adjusted earnings up $1.38, of the $1.38 to $1.42, up 4% to 7% versus the prior-year. In summary, AMETEK's fourth quarter and full-year results were excellent, our record backlog, the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model and a world class workforce position us nicely for 2023. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions, Bill? Good morning, Allison. Yes, that's to start off the year, and there a potential to do more, and -- but the $90 million was a good number, and it's incremental; Keep in mind, incremental over what we've done in 2022. So, it's incremental, and we're making healthy investments in RD&E, it's up double digits for the year, and healthy investments for sales and marketing. So, we think the $90 million is appropriate. And, obviously, that can be flexed up or down if required. Not really. I mean, the -- obviously, our growth is slowing, but the record backlogs and we're executing very well, we're getting the price, and it still feels good to us. It feels strong and good. And when you get out to the second-half of 2023, I mean this is a -- there's less visibility because you're further out, but our backlog is at a record level. It's usually at about 30% of annual sales. And right now, it's running at about 50% of annual sales. So, we feel really good. And we don't see a slowdown yet. Okay, thank you, Allison. Good morning, Deane. Sure, Deane. I'll start with your second question, the geographical outlook. Strong, broad-based growth across most geographies. Our Asia region was flat on China headwinds. And to your point, our fastest growing market was Europe. Europe was up 12% with notable strength in both our process and aerospace defense markets. And then we had a really strong performance in the U.S., up 10% organically; broad-based strength, notable strength in our process businesses. And in Asia, as I said, it was flat, with notable strength in aerospace and defense, and process. And China was down for us low double digits in the quarter on a difficult prior-year comp, and the impact of the Zero COVID policy. And Asia, we think that the China situation is going to turn around as the reopening occurs. And we're pretty optimistic for it in the second-half. But that's the picture in Q4, really strong broad-based growth, strongest Europe, and second U.S. Most of Asia was really good, and in China there was some weakness. Okay, and the second question was in market segment's summery. I'll take a walk around the company. In our process area, our overall process businesses, they were up high-single digits in the quarter. Organic sales were up 10%, and you also had the contributions from the acquisition of Navitar and it was offset by foreign currency headwinds. And as we saw throughout last year, growth across our process businesses was particularly -- was broad-based, but it was particularly strong in our Ultra Precision Technologies businesses in the quarter. And as we look ahead to 2023, we expect organic sales for process businesses to be up mid-single digits for the year. Next I'll talk about Aerospace & Defense. Our Aerospace & Defense businesses had a very strong finish to the year, and with overall and organic sales up mid teens. So, that was the strongest growth rate of the year for Aerospace & Defense. Our commercial businesses led the growth in the quarter. We had sales of high teens on a percentage business in the commercial business. And Defense was also strong in the quarter, growing low double digits. And for all of 2023, we expect organic sales for our Aerospace & Defense businesses to be up mid-to-high single digits, with commercial aerospace growth expected to be modestly stronger than defense growth. I'll next go to our Power & Industrial, overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up high single digits in the fourth quarter, driven by mid single-digit organic growth and the contributions from the acquisition of RTDS. Growth in the quarter was particularly strong across our programmable power business. For all of 2023, we expect organic sales for our Power & Industrial business to be up mid single digits, with similar growth across both the Power & Industrials segments. And finally, I'll talk about our Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment. And overall sales were up low single digits in the fourth quarter, with very solid mid single-digit organic sales growth, had some currency headwind in that segment. I was very pleased with the overall growth and the performance of Automation & Engineered Solutions in 2022. They're continuing to expand exposures in attractive niche markets. And in particular, our Engineered Medical Components business saw strong growth in the quarter. And in 2023, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be up mid single digits, with similar growth expected across both our Automation and Engineered Solutions business. That's a walk around the company. Deane, do you have any more questions? That's a great question, Deane. Our overall orders were up 1.5% in the quarter. And the overall demand environment, as I answered Allison's questions, feels really solid. We had our 10th straight positive book-to-bill quarter. And we ended with an all-time record backlog as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And this level of backlog, as I said, was 50% of our annual sales, well above the normal level of 30%. And it's up 78% from the end of 2020. So, we're in a really strong position as we enter 2023. So, your question on some of the nuances, if you recall, over the last couple of earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact our order growth. But the first was the difficult comparisons we're facing because as orders have been strong for an extended period of time. To give some context, over the prior nine quarters, our orders grew over 20% a quarter. So, it's been sizable and sustained that that helped build the backlog. The second dynamic we highlighted was the expectation of customers to return to more normalized ordering patterns. Now that the supply chain is improving and -- we started to see that dynamic play out in the fourth quarter. So, overall, we're comfortable with our order levels in Q4. After starting off in January and we just finished January, we had another sold orders a month, ahead of our expectations, and solidly up from January 2022 order levels. So, again, we're feeling pretty good with a strong backlog and our orders are hanging in there. So, we think that we're in -- looking at a pretty good year. Okay, thank you, Deane. Good morning, Brett. Yes, the first point I'd like to make is that when you're looking at customer inventories, a lot of our products are customized, and they're high-value products. So, we don't really have a lot of distributor stocking issues to worry about. That's particularly true in EIG. In EMG, there's more of an OEM deal with the customer base, and that's where you're seeing a bit of the customer ordering patterns normalize. But overall, we think we've got a good handle on it, and we feel pretty good about where we're at. Yes, great question. I mean with our budget model, we pretty much have a traditional first quarter. So, it's not really second-half-biased. And we think we'll grow in each of the quarters of the year. And in terms of pricing, in our budget model we have about four points of price. And we assume that we assume that we have about 3.5 points of inflation. So, we are going to offset price and inflation by about 50 basis points. Now, that\u2019s down a bit from 2022 where six points of price. And we offset about 5 points of inflation. But, it\u2019s the guide for the entire year. And we are being a bit conservative now. And, we will probably start out a little better than that. But, that\u2019s our plan for 2023. Also in 2023, I mean in addition to staying in front of inflation with price, we think supply chain shortages are going to abate. And we believe our working capital levels will decrease to more normalized levels to a very healthy 110% to 115% conversion to net income on the free cash flow. We also think that in terms of vertical markets we do expect our longer cycle aerospace and defense businesses to be a bit stronger than the balance of the portfolio. So, one through the mortgage segment commentary, Deane, it was a little bit higher, was -- had a mid- to-high outlook. So, we think that\u2019s going to be true. And that was accelerating as we -- each quarter of 2022 really. We expect both of our groups to grow mid single digits. We talked about the historically strong backlog. And, that\u2019s some assumptions that went into our budget. Do you have any questions, Brett? Thank you, Brett. Hey, that\u2019s a really interesting, that's really helping, but that team did a great job. And it\u2019s working on fusion energy is a great thing. And, it just shows our capability. Yes. That was overall worse. Organic was down minus 2. And so, overall orders were up 1.5. Organic was minus 2. And both segments were about at that same 1:1 book-to-bill. So, wasn\u2019t a distinct difference between the segments, and as I said, overall demand environment showed a solid 10 straight quarter of book-to-bill. So, we have a strong backlog. And as we have this dynamic of customers returning to more normalized ordering patterns, we have a strong backlog. So, we feel pretty good about it. Hello, good morning. Yes, they are going very well. I mean Bill and I have met with both of the acquisition integration teams and really positive. Just to recap a little bit, RTDS provides real-time power simulations used by utilities and various strategic acquisitions that broadens our power instruments businesses with differentiated testing and measurement and simulation capabilities. So, it's attractive position and high growth market. Really good team, I mean, just experts in the field. And it's kind of fun interacting with them. And they're really adopting AMETEK and feel good about that one. Same with Navitar, Navitar is in some good growth markets. The optics market is doing quite well with us. And even in the semiconductor space, where they play their main customers is one that's very differentiated and has unique capabilities. So, that along with Life Sciences along with machine vision, there's a very good outlook there. And that business is a little bit different as being integrated into our Zygo business. So, it has new capability for Zygo. Much needed capacity for Zygo and the integration is going very well. Right, yes, I think with the interest rates increasing, and with money, not as free as it was, is actually an advantage to us. So, we have a good pipeline and a good balance sheet. And we remain very active with a solid pipeline of deals, the valuations have come in a bit. We're looking at some quality assets, though. So, they're still a bit elevated from historical levels, but no doubt they've come in. And important for us in our pipeline, we have a very disciplined acquisition process. And these deals are going to meet our traditional financial hurdles, which is primarily a return on invested capital of 10% by the third year of ownership. These are important thresholds for us as we want to ensure we're providing a strong level returns on the capital we deploy for our shareholders. And that's been a hallmark of AMETEK's acquisition program for a long period of time. We do this all with cash and debt, don't use equity. And there's a bigger pipeline right now than has been historically because when there's less, less money around the system to bid up deals. So, we feel pretty good with where we're at. And if we do something, and I believe we will be talking to you about deals in the near future, they're going to be, they're going to meet all of our traditional hurdles. And we're committed to have an investment grade credit rating, and we got plenty of about $2.3 billion of capital and financing capacity available. So, in this environment, discipline is going to be a key word as it's always been for AMETEK. But have been very key in terms of executing our forward-looking M&A strategy. Yes, okay. Hi, David. Yes, I think that what you're going to see, there's still an elevated level of inflation. But at the same time, some of the one-time distributor purchases of inventory are going to go away. So, there's going to be some natural tailwinds for us in terms of margins, we expect that working in the P&L in our budget model, our productivity/cost savings of about $110 million. So, we think it'll be substantial. And that's where we're starting out the year but we think there's maybe even some upside to that. And it's largely related to a, and there is a couple of opposing forces, you're dealing with inflation and some costs of things are still going up. But at the same time, some of the supply chain issues are working the other way and especially the higher prices that we paid on a one-time basis to some of the electronics distributors to continue shipping products. We added a lot of capacity in 2022, we brought some low cost region facilities online, we've talked about that. For 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be flat, a little bit more than 2% of sales, as we've done historically. So, and it's a good balance between growth CapEx, maintenance CapEx and CapEx funding cost reductions. Yes, I'm not going to break out the deal, but there'll be slightly accretive. Okay, thank you, David. Yes, if you think about it from the customer's view, they've kind of got trained by the pandemic, to order things early. And now, most companies are getting including AMETEK is getting back to being able to deliver in lead time. And in fact, that's part of the reason that we grow our businesses at a faster rate during the pandemic period, we were able to ship and deliver and we had the inventory buffer. So, what's happening is, as customers normalize their buying patterns, they don't have to order early anymore. And that's what's really happening, I think across the broader supply chain, and we're seeing that. So, that's the main normalization that we're talking about. AMETEK has historically bought through both upcycles and down cycles. And sometimes you can get your best deals during a down cycle. And you have to be cognizant of what the forward-looking EBITDA is not really the trailing, but the forward. So, it's something that we've been keenly aware of for years, and we're focused on it. Thank you, Joe. Hello, Rob. Yes, that's a good way to think about it. And I'll try to put some more color into that. I mean, if you look at 2022, what stood out was our healthcare component. And our healthcare component is a big part of process across all of AMETEK, it's about 50% of sales, but it's a big part of the process. And I'll give you an idea. And Q4, our rolling business was up 20% organically, so they're really doing a good job. And that market has -- hospital spending has been fantastic for us, and people were putting in new systems post-pandemic. Also the semiconductor markets about 6% of sales, and the vast majority of that is in process and the semiconductor market was up high single-digits in the Q4. And we think in 2023, there'll be a slight downtick there, that'll be up low-to-mid but still growing because we have a lot of applications and research and also in the areas that are continuing to grow. So, we're in the right places in semiconductor. So, you got healthcare, you got semiconductor. You got the research market where we've had with our CAMECA business just every lab in the world has to have one of our atom probes, every lab in the world has to have some of our SIMS products. So, their backlog is really good. And they're doing well. And then, you got the old traditional oil and gas part of process. And that's doing very well in Q4, it was up high-single-digits. And for all '22, it was up low double-digits. And for '23, we expect plus high-single-digits. So, process is doing very well. And we think it's going to continue in the future. Good question. In terms of incrementals, in both groups, I think the core incrementals will be up 30% to 35%. And I think the core and reported margins will be up 30 to 40 Bps. So, we really think we have a clear line of sight to grow margins. Again, there'll be healthy incrementals. And we'll be able to increase our core margins as we go forward. Thank you, Rob. Hello, Steve. Yes, I think for 2023, we think that business will be at mid-single-digits. And both our automation and our engineering solutions will be up mid-single-digits, I think that we're selling to mainly OEM customers there. So, you're going to have a bit of the effect of the ordering patterns, a change in ordering patterns there, but we have a really healthy backlog. So, it's really what we talked about customers are changing ordering patterns. We're really good at delivery. So, we're meeting our customer commitments, so they're now ordering at normal lead times. So, you'll see a little bit of the order corrections that we talked about in Q4 continuing. But we still have a record backlog and all the comments that I made hold for that part of the business also. Right, it's pretty tough. And again, we grew mid-teens in 2022. So, that growth for 2023 is up low-to-mid. So, it's a substantial decline. But we're still growing and the reason we're growing the key application areas, at our CAMECA business, they're really involved in semiconductor research and development and staying ahead and getting the next generation. And we have some tools that are must haves for the semiconductor market, and really strong backlogs and orders are continuing well. And then, the second area is we're in the EUV optics area for used in semiconductor fabrication. So, the EUV market is kind of separate from the memory market and really strong. So, those two areas are the good part of our semiconductor business and they're really strong. And that's why we think we'll still be able to grow low to mid-single-digits in an environment where you have some of the headwinds. Okay, thank you, Steve."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong fourth quarter to complete an outstanding year. In the quarter, we delivered record level operating performance at a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and for the full-year along with some additional guidance for 2023. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were essentially flat versus the prior-year and for the full-year general and administrative expenses were up $6 million, driven largely by higher compensation costs. And as a percentage of sales were 1.5% versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and remain at approximately 1.5% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 18.9%, up from 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For 2023, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% and as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $58 million in the fourth quarter, and $139 million for the full-year. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be approximately $114 million, or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $89 million, and for the full-year was $320 million. In 2023, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $325 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $154 million or $0.66 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.9% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was excellent with operating cash flow of $385 million, up 37% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was also up 37% to $327 million in the quarter, while free cash flow conversion was 106% of net income. Total debt at year-end was $2.39 billion down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $345 million and during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $240 million on the acquisition of RTDS Technologies. Gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at year-end was 1.2 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. As Dave noted, we remain active on the acquisition front with a solid pipeline of acquisition candidates. Given our strong cash flow and modest levels of leverage, we're well-positioned to deploy additional capital. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022 delivering strong growth and high quality of earnings in a challenging operating environment. AMETEK is well-positioned for 2023, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model, and our world-class workforce. Kevin? I don\u2019t think in the second half of the year. I mean we are going to have some healthy price. But I think it\u2019s going to actually increase a bit in the second-half. And, if you think about our order rates we have that mid single digit sales growth forecasted. We think we are going to grow orders also. So, orders are going to grow a little bit less than sales as our forecast. But, they are going to grow. And really by the end of the year, our backlog is still going to be at elevated levels. It will be down a bit, but at elevated levels historically. So, we are clearly done with our strong backlog which will provide a buffer is there is some kind of downturn. We don\u2019t see it right now. And our orders will be up, but it will be up a little less than sales. And again, at the end of 2023, we have historically elevated levels of backlog similar to now. Yes, Scott."

I\u2019ll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered record results in the third quarter, with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings above our expectations. Operationally, our businesses are performing exceptionally well and successfully offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in impressive margin expansion. We are also seeing continued strong and broad-based demand across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record backlog of $3.2 billion. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of two excellent businesses, Navitar and RTDS Technologies, expanding our presence in high-end precision optics and in testing solutions for the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly. Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now, let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.55 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 11%. Acquisitions added one point and foreign currency was an approximate four-point headwind in the quarter. Demand also remains solid across our niche markets with organic orders growing 9% in the quarter, while book-to-bill was 1.07, our ninth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3.2 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was a record $385 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2021, while operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter, up a robust 140 basis points from the prior year, with strong margin expansion in each operating group. Our ability to drive meaningful margin expansion despite the inflationary environment reflects the differentiation of our technology solutions and our flexible operating model. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record of $463 million, up 12% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins a record 29.8%. This outstanding performance led to a record of earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, up 15% versus the third quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered excellent operating performance with continued strong and broad-based growth. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.05 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 10% with a 1-point contribution from acquisitions being more than offset by an approximate 3-point foreign currency headwind. Growth was again broad-based across our EIG businesses with particularly strong growth within our Rauland, TMC Precitech and Thermal Process Management businesses. Third quarter operating income was $272.7 million, up 11% versus the prior year. And operating margins were 25.9% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year. The performance of our Electromechanical Group in the quarter was exceptional, with excellent sales growth and record operating results. EMG's third quarter sales were a record $497.7 million, up 8% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 13% in the quarter and foreign currency at four-point headwind. Growth was very broad-based across all of our EMG businesses. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was a record $136.5 million, up 19% compared to the prior year period. EMG's third quarter operating margins were a record 27.4%, up an impressive 240 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter, allowing us to manage an uncertain macro environment, meaningfully expand margins and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of two highly strategic businesses. Navitar and RTDS Technologies are both excellent businesses and highly strategic acquisitions for AMETEK, expanding our presence with -- in attractive secular growth markets. Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on both these acquisitions, starting with Navitar. Navitar is a leading provider of optical solutions for critical applications across several markets, including medical and life sciences research, machine vision and robotics, semiconductor and industrial automation. Their comprehensive suite of high-precision, custom optical solutions includes fully integrated imaging systems, sensors, cameras, optics and software. Navitar is an excellent strategic and complementary fit with our Zygo business unit as their technical capabilities around cameras and optical systems further expand Zygo's product offering. Additionally, Navitar is a high-growth business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for precision optical solutions across attractive growth markets. Navitar was privately held and is based in Rochester, New York. Now switching to RTDS Technologies. RTDS provides real-time digital simulation systems used by utilities and research and educational institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Their simulation solutions allow engineers to rapidly prototype, verify and test the performance of the electric grid, power instruments and networks and close-looped systems to help accelerate product development life cycles and decreased testing costs. RTDS' simulation solutions are playing a key role in the modernization of the electric grid infrastructure, as well as supporting secular growth drivers, including renewable energy, distributed power generation and energy storage. The acquisition of RTDS broadens our Power Instruments businesses testing and simulation capabilities, while expanding our exposure to the renewable energy space. RTDS is privately held and based in Winnipeg, Canada. We are very excited to welcome the Navitar and RTDS teams to the AMETEK family. We deployed approximately $430 million on these acquisitions, acquiring approximately $100 million in annual sales. Over the past two years, we deployed more than $2.4 billion in capital and acquisitions and acquired eight businesses. Our acquisition pipeline remains solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital on strategic acquisitions. In addition to the recent acquisitions, we continue to focus on ensuring AMETEK is strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. Our businesses are driving broader adoption of our organic growth initiatives, including growth presence, digitalization and new product development. This includes making strategic growth investments across our businesses to help support and accelerate growth. For all of 2022, we now expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives. We are seeing great results from these efforts over both the short-term and long-term. In the third quarter, sales from new products introduced over the last three years was 27%, a record level for our Vitality Index, reflecting the great work of our teams. These efforts have helped lead to double-digit organic sales growth in each of the past six quarters. Now, turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. While we remain cautious in the short-term, given the dynamic macro environment, we are highly confident in the quality of our businesses and our ability to manage through these challenging times. Given our strong third quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall and organic sales to be up approximately 10% versus our prior guidance of up high single-digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.63, up 16% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.46 to $5.54 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, overall sales are expected to be up mid-single-digits compared to the same period last year, and fourth quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.47 per diluted share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. To summarize, AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered record performance, strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, increased our earnings guidance for the year and acquired two strategic businesses. The strength of the AMETEK growth model and our talented global workforce is evident in our results, thus far this year and will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through challenging market conditions. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $3 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense in the quarter. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the third quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $28 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $76 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $310 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.4% of sales. We generated strong levels of cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $327 million, up 7% versus the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $299 million in the third quarter, up 6% from the prior year and free cash flow to net income conversion was 100%. Total debt ended the third quarter at $2.36 billion, down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $310 million. At the end of the third quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. As Dave noted, we've been active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we acquired Navitar and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired RTDS Technologies. Combined, we deployed approximately $430 million on these two acquisitions. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have no material debt maturities due until 2024 and modest levels of leverage. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and a strong balance sheet. Following our two recent acquisitions, we still have over $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our business has performed exceptionally well in the third quarter and through the first nine months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and world-class workforce. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Kate, could we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, maybe could you talk a little bit about the organic performance you saw by geographic region and what, if anything, for lack of a better word, your canary type of businesses might be telling you about the macro environment? And then I have a follow-up.\nDave Zapico: Okay. Yes. Regarding the geographic storyline, it was really strong broad-based growth across all geographies and very balanced growth. I mean the US was up about 11%. We had broad-based growth there, notable performance in our process and automation businesses. The US was the strongest, up 11%. Europe was up 9%, notable strength in process in our aerospace business. And Asia was up 9%, notable strength in our Process businesses. So, no canaries in the coal mine for us. Orders are strong. Sales were strong geographically and all regions showed a solid broad-based growth, very balanced.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then, Dave, could you maybe comment a little bit on what your price realization was in the third quarter? What your price/cost sort of ratio look like and how we should be thinking about incremental price actions for 2023? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes. In the third quarter, our price continued to more than offset inflation and the pricing was very consistent across our portfolio. Pricing was about 6% and inflation was about 5%. So we had a positive spread of approximately 100 basis points. And we expect a similar price inflation spread for Q4 of 100 basis points. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio and our leadership position in niches. In terms of next year, really not ready to talk about pricing and inflation next year. I will say that, we do expect that we will be able to offset inflation with price in 2023 from a philosophy and an operating capability. But we're going to refrain from discussing 2023 until we get to -- go through our bottoms-up reviews with each of our businesses. So, there's no ranges and think it's not going to be positive next year, but we don't have the data yet. So I'm going to hold off on that one. But really good performance on pricing in Q3, and we expect it to continue in Q4. Did that answer your question, Matt?\nMatt Summerville: Very good. Thanks, David.\nDave Zapico: Sure.\nMatt Summerville: Yes, it did. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: So Dave, you talked a little bit -- certainly some caution out there. Your orders are really strong. Just maybe give your perspective of this cycle and maybe more importantly, how you think AMETEK's relative position is entering maybe a next downturn prior to relative past cycles? Just any thoughts there?\nDave Zapico: Those are great questions. I mean the -- I think in terms of AMETEK; I think our underlying demand remains strong. As I answered Matt's question, we're not seeing weakness yet. It's really broad-based. Our organic orders are strong. They were up 9%. It was -- both groups had positive organic growth. Both groups are strong. We're growing a healthy growth rates in all major regions of the world as I just went through. And so we feel good about that, and we ended the quarter with a record backlog. So that is really good. And you talk about 2023, I think our portfolio is in much better shape to -- as we're going forward because if you think about what's happened, we've continued to shift our portfolio to exposures in attractive growth markets, growth markets like automation, healthcare, power. This recent acquisition is more renewables. And the market shifts are attractive for us. And our technology, our differentiation is stronger than it was six or seven years ago. And we see that playing out in our organic growth in both relative and absolute performance, we think. And the big picture, we've incrementally improved our portfolio without sacrificing a couple of years of growth to do it and have delivered an exceptional way along the path. I'll give you some examples. Our healthcare portfolio, it was about 10% six years ago. Now, it's 15%. Aerospace and defense, it was about -- it was low double-digits part of the business about six or seven years ago. Now, it's high-teens. Our automation business went from about 7% to 12%. So good improvements in all those areas as a percentage of our total portfolio. And on the flip side, more cyclical businesses like our oil and gas and metals, they were more than 20% of sales six years ago. And right now, combined, these sales are about 8%. So we feel good about the portfolio, and it's performing now and we think it's going to perform in any kind of economic environment that we run into.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. That's helpful. And then just on the acquisitions. I know you said at least Navitar, high growth. Could you maybe give a little bit more color on is it -- are the growth of these acquisitions sort of in line with AMETEK a little better? And just any color on the margin performance relative to AMETEK core? Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Right, right. I think the -- both acquisitions are going to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. So they're both good growers. And both acquisitions are very profitable businesses. The blended multiple was about 11 times. So both very profitable, growing businesses and a fair price paid. We're excited to have each of these companies, each fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. They're leaders in niche markets, each has very strong technology differentiation positions that are backed by excellent engineering capabilities. And they expand our presence in attractive growth markets. Navitar is in the high-growth optical solutions, in life sciences, machine vision, robotics. And RTDS is really well positioned to benefit from the modernization and electrical power grid and the investments being made there with excellent exposure to the renewables market. So we've been working on these businesses for good period of time, and I'm just really glad to have them in the portfolio.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks, so much.\nDave Zapico: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Dean.\nDeane Dray: We touched on it a bit so far in the earlier questions, but maybe just more methodically take us through the key end markets. Sounded like Process, aero were strong. But can you just kind of go from the strongest or the weakest and we'll take it from there. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Sure, Dean. I'd be glad to do that. The strongest was Process. They had the strongest growth in the third quarter. Organic sales, up low teens on a percentage basis. The growth is really broad-based. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it was particularly strong growth across our Roland Healthcare business, TMC Pressitech and our thermal process management businesses. And for all of 2022, we now expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up approximately 10%. The segment that grew the fast -- second fastest was our Automation & Engineered solutions. Very strong third quarter with organic sales up low double digits, a balanced growth across both Automation & Engineered Solutions. And for that sub-segment, we now expect organic sales to be up approximately 10%, up from high single-digits, up to 10% for the full year with similar growth across each segment. Then, I take you to the Power & Industrial business, up mid-single-digits on a percentage basis in the quarter. We saw a notable strength across our power instruments and programmable power business. And we now expect that sub-segment to grow 10% also. So that was -- we rose that from high single-digits to 10%. And I'll talk about the Aerospace & Defense business. Organic sales for our Aerospace & Defense businesses were up mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Commercial sales were really strong, up mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strong underlying demands across the industry. Commercial OE, aftermarket and business jet all grew nicely. The strongest were aftermarket in business jet. And defense sales were up low single-digits in the quarter. And for the full year, we expect organic sales for A&D to be up high single-digits on a percentage basis with our commercial aerospace business to -- growth to be stronger than the defense growth. That's a walk around the company, Dean.\nDeane Dray: That's fabulous. How about just the idea of any changes at the margin in customer buying behavior. In some cases, we've seen as supply chains are normalizing a bit, lead times come in a bit. They don't have to put -- customers will have to give you the bigger orders just to get in line. Is there any kind of change there and maybe share with us the cadence of the quarter in terms of orders?\nDave Zapico: Right. I'll start with the cadence. We had strong orders in each month with the strongest being September. We had a very strong September and for that matter, our October results are consistent with our outlook showing a solid performance. Yes, a good question about the underlying orders. And the way I think about it, we'll certainly be running into more difficult comparisons for order input in the coming quarters. And we do expect our orders to moderate due to the fact that you're talking about, our customers placed orders early due to supply chain dynamics. And we believe that the return to more normalized ordering patterns and -- but even with these factors, I expect our backlog to be in an excellent position as we enter 2023.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes. No problem.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, guys.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Josh.\nBill Burke: Good morning.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Dave, I want to follow-up on Dean's last question and your last comment about backlog. With supply chain starting to improve and really some of this kind of extra backlog really being more supply side driven than anything else, what would you say is sort of the amount of backlog you think you could convert next year? I guess how should we think about the time frame for getting from where we are today, maybe down to more typical levels because the entire business isn't long cycle, just kind of pockets of it?\nDave Zapico: That's a good question. And the way -- one way that I think about it, it may help you, if you go back a few years, our annual sales were about 30% in backlog. So that was a typical year for us. We had about 30% of annual sales in backlog. Right now, we have a little more than 50% of annual sales in backlog. So there's a 20% difference there. And that's why I think we have solid visibility and that's in place because of the ordering patterns or our customers have changed, and we've had really strong order input and we had to protect our customers with inventory because of the supply chain prices. So, the increase of backlog went from about 30% of annual sales to 50% of annual sales, and that's the kind of way I think about it, that helps you.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: That is helpful. I guess how fungible should we think of backlog? So let's say, book-to-bill starts to trend well below one for a couple of quarters between comps and maybe a little bit of a demand slowdown. Are you guys able to pull that in sort of in real time? Or does that have specific dates associated with it where you can't really pull it in as much?\nBill Burke: Yes, Josh, I'd say as you look at the backlog we have, I mean, almost all of it could be shipped -- there'll be a small portion of it that would flip over into 2024. But when you look at what's coming due over the next 12 months, next -- well, really, if you look at it 15 months to get you through the balance of 2023, there's a large portion of it, the great majority of it will ship in the next year.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just going back to the acquisitions. I'm guessing these are more North American-centric acquisition. So, just wondering if there's a globalization sort of angle to this? And just want to confirm some numbers. It sounds like these are high 30% EBITDA margins combined. Is there any difference between the two acquisitions? Or would you say they are you quite consistent across both of them? And can they go even higher than that? I mean, are there any sort of easy synergies from supply chain, et cetera, that can actually move the needle on those margins?\nDave Zapico: Yes, you're right about the profitability. They're high profitability businesses. Navitar is maybe -- has a little higher growth rate and a little lower profitability than RTDS that has higher profitability and still is a healthy growth rate, but maybe slower than Navitar's. We -- there's a normal amount of synergy for us in these deals. They're both private businesses and there's excellent opportunities for us to improve the cost and revenue generation capabilities of the business. And there is a globalization theme. RTDS is more globalized already than Navitar, but both of them will benefit from AMETEK's global scale. So, good insight on your part.\nNigel Coe: That's great. And then my follow-on is as we dig into the EMG margins, which were pretty exceptional. Did a disproportionate amount of price cost land in EMG? Or are we seeing some mix impact from commercial aero aftermarket? Any details there would be great.\nDave Zapico: Yes. I mean the -- EMG's performance was excellent in the quarter, as you mentioned. They had record margins of 27.4%. And the biggest factor when you look at it is our higher-margin businesses are growing faster in the quarter in particular. And EMG is pretty much done what AMETEK continues to do and moving up the differentiation curve with their product portfolio. And we exited some of the lower-margin consumer businesses over time. So, they're really good book of business as we go forward up the differentiation curve and they're getting better pricing because of that. But in terms of pricing, it was really broad-based across all of AMETEK. So it wasn't -- EIG and EMG were similar in terms of price. It's really -- if you want to think about it, the -- certain mix effect because the higher-margin businesses grew faster in the quarter.\nNigel Coe: Very clear. Thanks, David.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Graham of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Graham: Hey good morning, David, Bill, Kevin.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Graham: I wanted to talk a little bit more about the backlog, piggyback on to Josh's question. Bill, you indicated, I think it was Bill, that 15 months is kind of like the shippable. So are you also saying that customers can't push that back, that these are sort of contracted shipment dates? What's the dynamic look like there?\nBill Burke: Yes. The reason I took the 15 months was to get us to the end of next year. That's really the point I was making there. And you always have to work with your customers on pushouts or pull-ins. And -- but I think the point I was trying to make is that much of that backlog is due and shippable next year, and we'll work through it. But as Dave said, it's only half of next year's shipments, we're going to continue to book orders and be able to ship against those.\nScott Graham: Okay. So when you say you talked about -- talked with customers about this, there is a chance that some of these things could be pushed out a quarter or two?\nBill Burke: Yes.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Yes. And it's a typical business. I mean, there -- it's a firm backlog backed by firm POs, but we work with our customers on both pull-ins and push-outs and inevitably, that happens every quarter.\nScott Graham: Got it. Thank you. My other question is around acquisitions. So two deals, it's been quiet this year, at least. So, maybe is this a situation hopes brings eternal? Is it -- are you starting to see bid-ask spreads close in to a point where there might be an acceleration? Or was this just something that a couple of deals? And I'm asking the question because it's two, it's not one, right? Right. So what does that mean for like the next six months, do you think?\nDave Zapico: When I look at our backlog and deals and potential deals, I feel very optimistic that over the next, say, 12 months, we're going to be able to deploy our free cash flow and acquisitions. We -- the pipeline is very, very strong. There's a -- we're working with quite a few businesses right now and actively exploring some exciting opportunities. So can we have the financing to do it? I mean the pricing is starting to come in on deals now and our relative position versus some other competitive buying, like private equity has improved. So I'm looking -- I'm pretty optimistic about deals for 2023. And our backlog is going to support and our balance sheet supports, strong cash flow support it. So it's going to be a big part of the future AMETEK story.\nScott Graham: So you're saying, Dave, you're confident that over the next 12 months, you can deploy 100% of your free cash flow on deals?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I believe that to be true.\nScott Graham: Great. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Okay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi, thanks.\nDave Zapico: Hey, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: My question is -- hey, on at Navitar. I don't know if you can expand on the niches they participate in. And the reason for the question is just there's some very large changes in the way the world's working with reshoring with investment battery factories and semiconductor factories in North America and so on. And I'm wondering about that historical growth rate, future growth rate and where they really attack and whether that's helped by some of the ongoing investments?\nDave Zapico: Right. Yes. I think some of the reshoring is going to help them. I mean the largest market segment is in the medical and life sciences area, where they're very -- they have very successful penetration in the optics used in various types of microscopes. There are also -- their optics are very, very good, and they're in a lot of machine vision and robotics applications. They sell to some big name semiconductor companies at the high-end of the market. And we just think the combination of this business with our Zygo business, that's the primary optical business, just puts it together and gives us some additional tools to go to our customers with. And it's -- and I'm very optimistic on the future and very low-risk deal for us.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Great. And if I may, can I ask the same sort of question on RTDS with some of the upcoming changes to Power Grids, maybe that's a longer-term\u2026\nDave Zapico: Yes.\nRob Wertheimer: \u2026situation, but I don't know if you're seeing opportunity and inflection there.\nDave Zapico: We are. And I think we got this business at the right time because as people put renewable energy on the grid and whether it's a wind farm or a field of solar panels, or on the electrification, they have charging devices for electric vehicles, each one of those things that they add to the grid is not simple. There has to be a lot of analysis done and they have to understand the impact of -- they're adding to the grid. And at the same time, there's a lot of investment in the grid. Some of the infrastructure act is putting investment in the grid. And RTDS is really used to help simulate and modernize the grid. So they have a high market share and they're used by all the utilities to understand what's going to happen with modernizing their electric grid. So, they're really well positioned for the future. And they have an excellent team of technical people. So we're optimistic on what that business can do with under AMETEK.\nRob Wertheimer: Great. Thank you for the answers.\nDave Zapico: Okay.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Hey guys, good morning. Can you hear me?\nDave Zapico: Yes. Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question on RTDS. As you guys move into more software, I know some of your peers as they were making a transition, you try to apply the business system, but how do you fit something like churn into your framework and to optimizing the business. Clearly, you have an amazing playbook for integrating assets and taking the margins up. How do you apply your playbook to a more digital asset like RTDS? And what adjustments have you had to make because that seems very interesting? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes. In the case of RTDS, it's like many AMETEK businesses. It's a combination of hardware and then software to operate the business. So it's really not different, and it's not a software-only business. And we've largely stayed away from software-only businesses because the pricing has been very high, and we couldn't get a good return on it. And to your point, we don't see the synergy that we'll add to the businesses. So -- but at the same time, software is very important to AMETEK. It's in these combined systems, very complex hardware systems that need software, and that's our specialty and RTDS gets right into that.\nAndrew Obin: No, that's a great way to get smart on software. And then another question for you. Are there any businesses where AMETEK has added capacity or has plans to add capacity, given what's happening out there? Just to follow-up on some of the questions were asked before.\nDave Zapico: Yes. We have -- we're bringing on a lot of capacity in low-cost regions. And we -- during this year, I mean, we've expanded our facilities in Mexico. We expanded our facility in Serbia. We expanded our facility in Malaysia. And we have more in the works, but those were all put in place this year to add additional capacity. So we're dealing with our volume in low-cost regions, and it provides a synergy to -- and local market access for us. So, we've been investing heavily in low-cost production manufacturing. And Malaysia is becoming a good facility for us. Again, Eastern Europe, Serbia and Mexico for the US. So it's -- we have these regional hubs that we're building up, and it's very successful for us. And we've put a lot of capacity in place this year.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank. Good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: Was curious about the Vitality Index, 27%, a record level. I think that ties into some of the discussion on the EMG margins. But is there a level you think of it as a mature level of vitality for the business? And I don't mean that as a negative, but you've got an entrenched market for a lot of your products and I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about that.\nDave Zapico: Yes. The first thing is not only is the Vitality Index, it helps us with our pricing, because we're continually adding new features and benefits to our products and our customers, and it enables us to garner a higher price because of the engineering investment that we're making, very consistent engineering investment over 5% over many years. We first started tracking the Vitality, it was in the mid-teens. And over the past 10 or 15 years, it got into the 20s and the mid-20s. And now, I'm just very pleased with 27% Vitality. Clearly, our new product development process is working. We're developing products our customers want to buy. And 27% of sales for our end markets, we think that's a really good number. And in general, I put a range around it, I think between 20% and 30% is a very good number for AMETEK. And again, the vitality helps not only from new products, having fresh new products that you can win share with, but it also helps with pricing -- realized pricing.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thanks. And then I just wanted to go into the process markets a little bit. It's -- you called out some of your brands. I'm curious if you're seeing any particular inflection in certain end markets or applications really stepping out whether it's leaning towards capacity investments or maybe modernizations?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I would say the -- strong across the board and process, but the healthcare space and the energy space are two areas that stood out in the quarter. And then with TMC Precitech, it's just a precision technology where we're doing things that other people can't do and -- our orders have been high for multiple quarters. Now, the sales are catching up.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thanks for the color.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDave Zapico: Hi, Joe.\nTristan Margot: Hey, guys, good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'd like to go back to Allison's question a little bit and maybe ask it a little bit differently. But if we were to have an industrial recession, the likes of 2016, for example, how do you think your current portfolio would fare versus your portfolio six years ago? Just trying to get a sense of the magnitude there. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes. I mean it's difficult to understand the specifics until you're in a recession because they're all different. But as I said, I think our portfolio has been improved dramatically. And I think that when you think about all the other things that I mentioned, we would stay in front of inflation with pricing. I think in 2023 as the supply chain shortages abate, we believe our working capital will decrease to a more normalized level. In the vertical markets, I'm going to wait and see what we learn from our businesses but we do expect our longer cycle businesses to be strong in both A&D and energy, and we do expect to have a historically strong backlog when we enter 2023. And in terms of a recession playbook, let's say we do see slowing and we start to see a recession, we'll react and manage our business appropriately as we have done in the past. And we think we have a proven model that works well in both up markets and down markets. And the most recent example of this was during the COVID-driven recession in 2020. And if you look at how we performed through that, despite the weakness in sales during the time, our margins actually grew 80 basis points and decremental margins were only 17%. So we've got the capability to manage in both up cycles and down cycles. And I believe that the next recession will be no different whenever it comes.\nTristan Margot: Awesome. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Okay.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Great. Thank you again, Kate, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our conference call. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered record results in the third quarter, with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings above our expectations. Operationally, our businesses are performing exceptionally well and successfully offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in impressive margin expansion. We are also seeing continued strong and broad-based demand across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record backlog of $3.2 billion. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of two excellent businesses, Navitar and RTDS Technologies, expanding our presence in high-end precision optics and in testing solutions for the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly. Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now, let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.55 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 11%. Acquisitions added one point and foreign currency was an approximate four-point headwind in the quarter. Demand also remains solid across our niche markets with organic orders growing 9% in the quarter, while book-to-bill was 1.07, our ninth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3.2 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was a record $385 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2021, while operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter, up a robust 140 basis points from the prior year, with strong margin expansion in each operating group. Our ability to drive meaningful margin expansion despite the inflationary environment reflects the differentiation of our technology solutions and our flexible operating model. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record of $463 million, up 12% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins a record 29.8%. This outstanding performance led to a record of earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, up 15% versus the third quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered excellent operating performance with continued strong and broad-based growth. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.05 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 10% with a 1-point contribution from acquisitions being more than offset by an approximate 3-point foreign currency headwind. Growth was again broad-based across our EIG businesses with particularly strong growth within our Rauland, TMC Precitech and Thermal Process Management businesses. Third quarter operating income was $272.7 million, up 11% versus the prior year. And operating margins were 25.9% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year. The performance of our Electromechanical Group in the quarter was exceptional, with excellent sales growth and record operating results. EMG's third quarter sales were a record $497.7 million, up 8% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 13% in the quarter and foreign currency at four-point headwind. Growth was very broad-based across all of our EMG businesses. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was a record $136.5 million, up 19% compared to the prior year period. EMG's third quarter operating margins were a record 27.4%, up an impressive 240 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter, allowing us to manage an uncertain macro environment, meaningfully expand margins and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of two highly strategic businesses. Navitar and RTDS Technologies are both excellent businesses and highly strategic acquisitions for AMETEK, expanding our presence with -- in attractive secular growth markets. Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on both these acquisitions, starting with Navitar. Navitar is a leading provider of optical solutions for critical applications across several markets, including medical and life sciences research, machine vision and robotics, semiconductor and industrial automation. Their comprehensive suite of high-precision, custom optical solutions includes fully integrated imaging systems, sensors, cameras, optics and software. Navitar is an excellent strategic and complementary fit with our Zygo business unit as their technical capabilities around cameras and optical systems further expand Zygo's product offering. Additionally, Navitar is a high-growth business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for precision optical solutions across attractive growth markets. Navitar was privately held and is based in Rochester, New York. Now switching to RTDS Technologies. RTDS provides real-time digital simulation systems used by utilities and research and educational institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Their simulation solutions allow engineers to rapidly prototype, verify and test the performance of the electric grid, power instruments and networks and close-looped systems to help accelerate product development life cycles and decreased testing costs. RTDS' simulation solutions are playing a key role in the modernization of the electric grid infrastructure, as well as supporting secular growth drivers, including renewable energy, distributed power generation and energy storage. The acquisition of RTDS broadens our Power Instruments businesses testing and simulation capabilities, while expanding our exposure to the renewable energy space. RTDS is privately held and based in Winnipeg, Canada. We are very excited to welcome the Navitar and RTDS teams to the AMETEK family. We deployed approximately $430 million on these acquisitions, acquiring approximately $100 million in annual sales. Over the past two years, we deployed more than $2.4 billion in capital and acquisitions and acquired eight businesses. Our acquisition pipeline remains solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital on strategic acquisitions. In addition to the recent acquisitions, we continue to focus on ensuring AMETEK is strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. Our businesses are driving broader adoption of our organic growth initiatives, including growth presence, digitalization and new product development. This includes making strategic growth investments across our businesses to help support and accelerate growth. For all of 2022, we now expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives. We are seeing great results from these efforts over both the short-term and long-term. In the third quarter, sales from new products introduced over the last three years was 27%, a record level for our Vitality Index, reflecting the great work of our teams. These efforts have helped lead to double-digit organic sales growth in each of the past six quarters. Now, turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. While we remain cautious in the short-term, given the dynamic macro environment, we are highly confident in the quality of our businesses and our ability to manage through these challenging times. Given our strong third quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall and organic sales to be up approximately 10% versus our prior guidance of up high single-digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.63, up 16% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.46 to $5.54 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, overall sales are expected to be up mid-single-digits compared to the same period last year, and fourth quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.47 per diluted share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. To summarize, AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered record performance, strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, increased our earnings guidance for the year and acquired two strategic businesses. The strength of the AMETEK growth model and our talented global workforce is evident in our results, thus far this year and will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through challenging market conditions. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill? Okay. Yes. Regarding the geographic storyline, it was really strong broad-based growth across all geographies and very balanced growth. I mean the US was up about 11%. We had broad-based growth there, notable performance in our process and automation businesses. The US was the strongest, up 11%. Europe was up 9%, notable strength in process in our aerospace business. And Asia was up 9%, notable strength in our Process businesses. So, no canaries in the coal mine for us. Orders are strong. Sales were strong geographically and all regions showed a solid broad-based growth, very balanced. Yes. In the third quarter, our price continued to more than offset inflation and the pricing was very consistent across our portfolio. Pricing was about 6% and inflation was about 5%. So we had a positive spread of approximately 100 basis points. And we expect a similar price inflation spread for Q4 of 100 basis points. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio and our leadership position in niches. In terms of next year, really not ready to talk about pricing and inflation next year. I will say that, we do expect that we will be able to offset inflation with price in 2023 from a philosophy and an operating capability. But we're going to refrain from discussing 2023 until we get to -- go through our bottoms-up reviews with each of our businesses. So, there's no ranges and think it's not going to be positive next year, but we don't have the data yet. So I'm going to hold off on that one. But really good performance on pricing in Q3, and we expect it to continue in Q4. Did that answer your question, Matt? Sure. Good morning, Allison. Those are great questions. I mean the -- I think in terms of AMETEK; I think our underlying demand remains strong. As I answered Matt's question, we're not seeing weakness yet. It's really broad-based. Our organic orders are strong. They were up 9%. It was -- both groups had positive organic growth. Both groups are strong. We're growing a healthy growth rates in all major regions of the world as I just went through. And so we feel good about that, and we ended the quarter with a record backlog. So that is really good. And you talk about 2023, I think our portfolio is in much better shape to -- as we're going forward because if you think about what's happened, we've continued to shift our portfolio to exposures in attractive growth markets, growth markets like automation, healthcare, power. This recent acquisition is more renewables. And the market shifts are attractive for us. And our technology, our differentiation is stronger than it was six or seven years ago. And we see that playing out in our organic growth in both relative and absolute performance, we think. And the big picture, we've incrementally improved our portfolio without sacrificing a couple of years of growth to do it and have delivered an exceptional way along the path. I'll give you some examples. Our healthcare portfolio, it was about 10% six years ago. Now, it's 15%. Aerospace and defense, it was about -- it was low double-digits part of the business about six or seven years ago. Now, it's high-teens. Our automation business went from about 7% to 12%. So good improvements in all those areas as a percentage of our total portfolio. And on the flip side, more cyclical businesses like our oil and gas and metals, they were more than 20% of sales six years ago. And right now, combined, these sales are about 8%. So we feel good about the portfolio, and it's performing now and we think it's going to perform in any kind of economic environment that we run into. Right, right. I think the -- both acquisitions are going to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. So they're both good growers. And both acquisitions are very profitable businesses. The blended multiple was about 11 times. So both very profitable, growing businesses and a fair price paid. We're excited to have each of these companies, each fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. They're leaders in niche markets, each has very strong technology differentiation positions that are backed by excellent engineering capabilities. And they expand our presence in attractive growth markets. Navitar is in the high-growth optical solutions, in life sciences, machine vision, robotics. And RTDS is really well positioned to benefit from the modernization and electrical power grid and the investments being made there with excellent exposure to the renewables market. So we've been working on these businesses for good period of time, and I'm just really glad to have them in the portfolio. Okay. Thank you. Good morning, Dean. Sure, Dean. I'd be glad to do that. The strongest was Process. They had the strongest growth in the third quarter. Organic sales, up low teens on a percentage basis. The growth is really broad-based. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it was particularly strong growth across our Roland Healthcare business, TMC Pressitech and our thermal process management businesses. And for all of 2022, we now expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up approximately 10%. The segment that grew the fast -- second fastest was our Automation & Engineered solutions. Very strong third quarter with organic sales up low double digits, a balanced growth across both Automation & Engineered Solutions. And for that sub-segment, we now expect organic sales to be up approximately 10%, up from high single-digits, up to 10% for the full year with similar growth across each segment. Then, I take you to the Power & Industrial business, up mid-single-digits on a percentage basis in the quarter. We saw a notable strength across our power instruments and programmable power business. And we now expect that sub-segment to grow 10% also. So that was -- we rose that from high single-digits to 10%. And I'll talk about the Aerospace & Defense business. Organic sales for our Aerospace & Defense businesses were up mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Commercial sales were really strong, up mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strong underlying demands across the industry. Commercial OE, aftermarket and business jet all grew nicely. The strongest were aftermarket in business jet. And defense sales were up low single-digits in the quarter. And for the full year, we expect organic sales for A&D to be up high single-digits on a percentage basis with our commercial aerospace business to -- growth to be stronger than the defense growth. That's a walk around the company, Dean. Right. I'll start with the cadence. We had strong orders in each month with the strongest being September. We had a very strong September and for that matter, our October results are consistent with our outlook showing a solid performance. Yes, a good question about the underlying orders. And the way I think about it, we'll certainly be running into more difficult comparisons for order input in the coming quarters. And we do expect our orders to moderate due to the fact that you're talking about, our customers placed orders early due to supply chain dynamics. And we believe that the return to more normalized ordering patterns and -- but even with these factors, I expect our backlog to be in an excellent position as we enter 2023. Yes. No problem. Good morning, Josh. That's a good question. And the way -- one way that I think about it, it may help you, if you go back a few years, our annual sales were about 30% in backlog. So that was a typical year for us. We had about 30% of annual sales in backlog. Right now, we have a little more than 50% of annual sales in backlog. So there's a 20% difference there. And that's why I think we have solid visibility and that's in place because of the ordering patterns or our customers have changed, and we've had really strong order input and we had to protect our customers with inventory because of the supply chain prices. So, the increase of backlog went from about 30% of annual sales to 50% of annual sales, and that's the kind of way I think about it, that helps you. Thank you. Yes, you're right about the profitability. They're high profitability businesses. Navitar is maybe -- has a little higher growth rate and a little lower profitability than RTDS that has higher profitability and still is a healthy growth rate, but maybe slower than Navitar's. We -- there's a normal amount of synergy for us in these deals. They're both private businesses and there's excellent opportunities for us to improve the cost and revenue generation capabilities of the business. And there is a globalization theme. RTDS is more globalized already than Navitar, but both of them will benefit from AMETEK's global scale. So, good insight on your part. Yes. I mean the -- EMG's performance was excellent in the quarter, as you mentioned. They had record margins of 27.4%. And the biggest factor when you look at it is our higher-margin businesses are growing faster in the quarter in particular. And EMG is pretty much done what AMETEK continues to do and moving up the differentiation curve with their product portfolio. And we exited some of the lower-margin consumer businesses over time. So, they're really good book of business as we go forward up the differentiation curve and they're getting better pricing because of that. But in terms of pricing, it was really broad-based across all of AMETEK. So it wasn't -- EIG and EMG were similar in terms of price. It's really -- if you want to think about it, the -- certain mix effect because the higher-margin businesses grew faster in the quarter. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. Yes. Yes. And it's a typical business. I mean, there -- it's a firm backlog backed by firm POs, but we work with our customers on both pull-ins and push-outs and inevitably, that happens every quarter. When I look at our backlog and deals and potential deals, I feel very optimistic that over the next, say, 12 months, we're going to be able to deploy our free cash flow and acquisitions. We -- the pipeline is very, very strong. There's a -- we're working with quite a few businesses right now and actively exploring some exciting opportunities. So can we have the financing to do it? I mean the pricing is starting to come in on deals now and our relative position versus some other competitive buying, like private equity has improved. So I'm looking -- I'm pretty optimistic about deals for 2023. And our backlog is going to support and our balance sheet supports, strong cash flow support it. So it's going to be a big part of the future AMETEK story. Yes, I believe that to be true. Okay. Hey, Rob. Right. Yes. I think some of the reshoring is going to help them. I mean the largest market segment is in the medical and life sciences area, where they're very -- they have very successful penetration in the optics used in various types of microscopes. There are also -- their optics are very, very good, and they're in a lot of machine vision and robotics applications. They sell to some big name semiconductor companies at the high-end of the market. And we just think the combination of this business with our Zygo business, that's the primary optical business, just puts it together and gives us some additional tools to go to our customers with. And it's -- and I'm very optimistic on the future and very low-risk deal for us. Yes. We are. And I think we got this business at the right time because as people put renewable energy on the grid and whether it's a wind farm or a field of solar panels, or on the electrification, they have charging devices for electric vehicles, each one of those things that they add to the grid is not simple. There has to be a lot of analysis done and they have to understand the impact of -- they're adding to the grid. And at the same time, there's a lot of investment in the grid. Some of the infrastructure act is putting investment in the grid. And RTDS is really used to help simulate and modernize the grid. So they have a high market share and they're used by all the utilities to understand what's going to happen with modernizing their electric grid. So, they're really well positioned for the future. And they have an excellent team of technical people. So we're optimistic on what that business can do with under AMETEK. Okay. Yes. Good morning, Andrew. Yes. In the case of RTDS, it's like many AMETEK businesses. It's a combination of hardware and then software to operate the business. So it's really not different, and it's not a software-only business. And we've largely stayed away from software-only businesses because the pricing has been very high, and we couldn't get a good return on it. And to your point, we don't see the synergy that we'll add to the businesses. So -- but at the same time, software is very important to AMETEK. It's in these combined systems, very complex hardware systems that need software, and that's our specialty and RTDS gets right into that. Yes. We have -- we're bringing on a lot of capacity in low-cost regions. And we -- during this year, I mean, we've expanded our facilities in Mexico. We expanded our facility in Serbia. We expanded our facility in Malaysia. And we have more in the works, but those were all put in place this year to add additional capacity. So we're dealing with our volume in low-cost regions, and it provides a synergy to -- and local market access for us. So, we've been investing heavily in low-cost production manufacturing. And Malaysia is becoming a good facility for us. Again, Eastern Europe, Serbia and Mexico for the US. So it's -- we have these regional hubs that we're building up, and it's very successful for us. And we've put a lot of capacity in place this year. Good morning, Chris. Yes. The first thing is not only is the Vitality Index, it helps us with our pricing, because we're continually adding new features and benefits to our products and our customers, and it enables us to garner a higher price because of the engineering investment that we're making, very consistent engineering investment over 5% over many years. We first started tracking the Vitality, it was in the mid-teens. And over the past 10 or 15 years, it got into the 20s and the mid-20s. And now, I'm just very pleased with 27% Vitality. Clearly, our new product development process is working. We're developing products our customers want to buy. And 27% of sales for our end markets, we think that's a really good number. And in general, I put a range around it, I think between 20% and 30% is a very good number for AMETEK. And again, the vitality helps not only from new products, having fresh new products that you can win share with, but it also helps with pricing -- realized pricing. Yes. I would say the -- strong across the board and process, but the healthcare space and the energy space are two areas that stood out in the quarter. And then with TMC Precitech, it's just a precision technology where we're doing things that other people can't do and -- our orders have been high for multiple quarters. Now, the sales are catching up. Thank you, Chris. Hi, Joe. Yes. I mean it's difficult to understand the specifics until you're in a recession because they're all different. But as I said, I think our portfolio has been improved dramatically. And I think that when you think about all the other things that I mentioned, we would stay in front of inflation with pricing. I think in 2023 as the supply chain shortages abate, we believe our working capital will decrease to a more normalized level. In the vertical markets, I'm going to wait and see what we learn from our businesses but we do expect our longer cycle businesses to be strong in both A&D and energy, and we do expect to have a historically strong backlog when we enter 2023. And in terms of a recession playbook, let's say we do see slowing and we start to see a recession, we'll react and manage our business appropriately as we have done in the past. And we think we have a proven model that works well in both up markets and down markets. And the most recent example of this was during the COVID-driven recession in 2020. And if you look at how we performed through that, despite the weakness in sales during the time, our margins actually grew 80 basis points and decremental margins were only 17%. So we've got the capability to manage in both up cycles and down cycles. And I believe that the next recession will be no different whenever it comes. Okay."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $3 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense in the quarter. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the third quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $28 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $76 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $310 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.4% of sales. We generated strong levels of cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $327 million, up 7% versus the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $299 million in the third quarter, up 6% from the prior year and free cash flow to net income conversion was 100%. Total debt ended the third quarter at $2.36 billion, down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $310 million. At the end of the third quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. As Dave noted, we've been active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we acquired Navitar and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired RTDS Technologies. Combined, we deployed approximately $430 million on these two acquisitions. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have no material debt maturities due until 2024 and modest levels of leverage. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and a strong balance sheet. Following our two recent acquisitions, we still have over $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our business has performed exceptionally well in the third quarter and through the first nine months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and world-class workforce. Kevin? Good morning. Yes, Josh, I'd say as you look at the backlog we have, I mean, almost all of it could be shipped -- there'll be a small portion of it that would flip over into 2024. But when you look at what's coming due over the next 12 months, next -- well, really, if you look at it 15 months to get you through the balance of 2023, there's a large portion of it, the great majority of it will ship in the next year. Yes. The reason I took the 15 months was to get us to the end of next year. That's really the point I was making there. And you always have to work with your customers on pushouts or pull-ins. And -- but I think the point I was trying to make is that much of that backlog is due and shippable next year, and we'll work through it. But as Dave said, it's only half of next year's shipments, we're going to continue to book orders and be able to ship against those. Yes."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question and answer session [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Coleman, you may begin.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Richard. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2021 or 2022 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization.

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings. Importantly, demand remains strong and broad-based across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record $3.1 billion backlog. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2022, we have increased our earnings guidance for the year. Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were a record $1.51 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 12%. Acquisitions added a point and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind in the quarter. Organic orders were up a very strong 11%, despite a highly challenging prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.09 in the second quarter, our eighth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Operating income in the quarter was a record $365 million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.1% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from the prior year with strong incremental margins. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $444 million, about 15% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.3%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up 20% versus the second quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30, driven by stronger-than-expected sales and excellent operating performance. Now let provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.03 billion, up 10% from last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 12% in the quarter, with foreign currency headwinds more than offsetting acquisition contributions. Organic growth remains very strong across our EIG businesses with particularly impressive growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies and P&I division. EIG's operating performance was impressive, resulting in record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $265.1 million, up 70% versus the prior year and operating income margins were 25.8% in the quarter. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $486.3 million, up 7% versus the prior year with organic sales growing 11% in the quarter. EMG's growth was also broad-based, with strong growth across both our EMIP and automation businesses. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was $124.4 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second margins were excellent at 25.6%, up 70 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, outstanding results in the quarter, reflecting the quality of our differentiated businesses, the strength of our operating model and the tremendous efforts of our employees. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your commitment to AMETEK and for the many important contributions you make to our sustained success. Now let me touch on the supply chain. Overall, the global supply chain remains constrained, with the largest challenging -- challenges continuing to be the availability of electronic components. As we noted previously, we have strategically decided to hold additional inventory of select components to support the strong customer demand and as a hedge against the tight supply chain. Additionally, AMETEK's global sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job working to identify additional sources of supply. While these supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation, we have been able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread again this quarter and outstanding margin expense. The combination of our global supply chain capabilities and pricing power provides us the confidence in our ability to manage through these uncertain times. During our first quarter earnings call, we noted that the COVID driven lockdowns across parts of China were expected to delay some China sales from the second quarter into the second half of the year. These lockdowns caused less impact on the business in the quarter than we anticipated. Due to the excellent efforts of our China team, we were able to operate in a closed loop system and adjust our logistics and supply chain networks to support production and shipments. Additionally, during the last two weeks of the quarter, as restrictions were lifted, we were able to resumed multi-ship production and recover much of the delayed shipments. The impact of China's zero-COVID policy is something we are closely watching as we need to react and adjust in the future. Thank you to our entire team in China for your tremendous commitment and resilience during this time. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. Our top priority for capital allocation remains the value-enhancing strategic acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline is very strong. Our business unit and corporate development teams are busy managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. As Bill will highlight in a moment, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow providing us with meaningful capacity to support our acquisition strategy, and we expect to be active in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on driving higher levels of organic growth by consistently investing in our businesses to support their strategic growth initiatives. We're seeing the benefits of these investments in stronger organic growth. Our investments in research, development and engineering continues to yield advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. One measure of the success of these efforts is our vitality index, which was a very strong 26% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality reflects our business' ability to develop new products aligned with compelling growth opportunities. One example of this is AMETEK's expansion into the high-growth areas of precision optics. AMETEK's Zygo business, based in Middlefield, Connecticut, provides leading-edge extreme precision optics for the design and protection of very large complicated aspheric lenses. These capabilities supported the manufacture of 18 hexagonal-shaped mirrors, which make up the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror. The James Webb Telescope very recently produced the deepest and sharpest infrared images of the deep universe. Truly amazing images due in part to Zygo's capability. Zygo also provides advanced optical systems for use in the next generation of semiconductor production equipment. Their incredibly precised mirrors are playing an important role in supporting the development of EUV extreme ultraviolet optics, for the next generation of semiconductor technologies. Just two of the many examples across AMETEK of the unique and highly differentiated capabilities and technologies we provide our customers. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the second quarter, continued solid order momentum and record backlog, we have increased our full year earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up high single digits, with organic sales now also expected to be up high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid-to high single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.54, up 13% to 14% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.34 to $5.44 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we expect overall sales to be up in the high single digits compared to the same period last year, and third quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.38 per diluted share, up 8% to 10% versus the prior year. While we are closely monitoring the various macroeconomic headwinds, we are not seeing slowing in our businesses as demand remains solid and our businesses are operating level. We are confident in our ability and improved outlook for the year, given our strong backlog, ability to offset inflation with price increases and outstanding operating capability. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses are well positioned with differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of growing niche markets. Our organic growth initiatives are driving higher levels of growth, and our portfolio is aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. Additionally, our asset-light business model and strong cash flow provides us the flexibility to navigate challenging environments, while continuing to deploy capital and drive increased shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million, up $2 million from the prior year. And as a percentage of total sales was 1.6%, in line with the second quarter of 2021. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18.5%, down from 20.6% in the second quarter of 2021. The lower rate this quarter was driven by lower tax on foreign income. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million for the full year, or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $77 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18% of sales. Operating cash flow was $236 million and free cash flow was $210 million in the second quarter. We expect approximately 100% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. Our working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add select inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and to hedge against the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.44 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $173 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares, for a total of $330 million. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. Total debt ended the second quarter at $2.5 billion, down slightly from the $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $349 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times. As Dave noted, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2024, modest levels of leverage and strong cash flows. As a result, we are well positioned to deploy meaningful capital investment in our acquisition strategy with approximately $2.3 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To conclude, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned going into the back half of the year, and we'll continue to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bill. Richard, could we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question on the line comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Just going back to you, and obviously, very strong orders. You mentioned you're really not seeing any slowing. But has there been any change in the cadence intra-quarter in terms of what you're seeing coming in, whether region or end market? Just any color there?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I mean we had strong orders each month of the quarter with the strongest month being June, so pretty typical. And we just ended July, and our results were strong in July and very consistent with our outlook. So there's really continue order strength that was -- we had strength in both groups. EIG was up 11 and EMG was up 9. Overall, organic growth was up 11. We're growing at healthy rates in all major regions of the world. All subsegments that we operate in are growing nicely. So it feels pretty good from where we sit. In addition to that, we have, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a record backlog of $3.1 billion, and that's up about 80% from just to -- prior to the start of the COVID pandemic. And we're feeling good, and we're not seeing any weakness anywhere right now.\nAllison Poliniak: And then there was obviously a step-up in inventory again this quarter sequentially. I suspect that's due to some of the orders that you're seeing coming in. How should we think about inventory level as we look to the back half of the year? Is it stabilized? Or is it really just dependent on the orders coming in and some of that supply chain issues that are still out there?\nBill Burke: Yes, I think you've hit on it there, Allison. We've got -- with the strong order rate coming in, we've got to make sure we have the inventory to support those orders. And we are still concerned about supply chain, and we're going to continue to react to that. So I would say you've hit the nail on the head, and I think we've increased them now. And we'll continue to manage it closely. Obviously, you know we're very focused on running lean, but we've got to make sure we're supporting the orders that are in place.\nOperator: Our next question on line comes from Mr. Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Just I guess first question on Europe. I guess the totality of AMETEK is doing well. You mentioned the orders growth. Anything, I guess, underneath the surface or a KPI that you're watching there? Because obviously, more than macro challenges, things like energy costs just up a lot. Just wondering any way that, that's manifesting itself in your business?\nDavid Zapico: Last quarter, orders were up 9% in Europe. And we had notable strength in our automation and aerospace businesses, and the aerospace businesses really started to accelerate. So it feels pretty good from a demand perspective right now, but with the geopolitical things going on in Russia and Ukraine and the fuel costs in Germany, we're certainly looking -- watching that very closely as that may be a sign of the first place for it to turn down for us. But right now, it's not. And Europe is strong, and we had a good quarter there. Again, Europe was up 9%.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: And then -- just on the aerospace & defense side. I think a lot of supply chain bottlenecks starting to get worse in there. Not necessarily for the stuff that you guys are producing, but are you seeing that at all either in your supply chain or being told by your customers to kind of throttle back delivery because they're waiting for some other component to come in and don't want to just kind of be building gliders or accumulating inventory in the meantime?\nDavid Zapico: I mean, right now it\u2019s quite the opposite. Our orders in our aerospace & defense business were up low double digits in the quarter. Our commercial business was up stronger, and it grew mid-teens and the strongest growth within the commercial aftermarket. And defense market was up low single digits for us, better than in the first quarter. So we're looking at a very strong second half, and most of the interactions we have with our customers are asking us for more. So we're not seeing any slowdown in demand or anything. And I think that market is because of pent-up demand has got a long cycle of growth ahead of it.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Then just one more question if you don't mind. What was price in the quarter?\nDavid Zapico: Right. So in the second quarter, our price continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was about 6% and inflation was about 5% of sales. So we maintained about 100 basis point spread. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets. And we think about it as we had 6% volume growth and 6% price growth and 12% organic growth. So we think it was a really good quarter from that viewpoint.\nOperator: Our next question on line comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: I certainly echo those comments. So just on the third quarter outlook for mid-single-digit sales growth in context of 12% this quarter. Just wondering, especially with the order rates pretty strong as well, what's covering that mid-single-digit outlook? I'm just wondering if we should be looking at the upper end of the mid-singles if you can be a bit more specific there.\nDavid Zapico: If you dig into it, the guide actually reflects mid-to high single digits because we have some currency headwinds. And really, quarter three is kind of a carbon copy of quarter two. And we have a little bit of seasonality in quarter three because of the European exposure. But the difference between quarter two and quarter three, we're expecting a little higher tax rate. So we would consider it appropriately conservative, but there are some dynamics with tax sequentially and the organic rate is mid-to-high. So it's not mid currencies holding us back a bit.\nNigel Coe: And the comp is tougher, but I think if you just comp adjust it, 12% goes to maybe 9%. So just wondering if that was how you sort of manage. And then on the margins, it's obviously very strong. It seems like price cost is at least neutral to margin rates, not dollars, but margin rates. Can you just maybe confirm that? And then just wondering if there's any geographic impact from -- obviously, Europe is pretty strong, but was there any geo impacts to the margin this quarter?\nDavid Zapico: No. I mean, when I look at the margins for the whole business, it was up 130 basis points as reported and 140 basis points core. So you really see strong flow-through through price. And when you look at total cost of sales, I think the margins improved there. EMG -- strong in both groups, EMG margins were up 70 basis points and EIG margins were up 150 basis points as reported, and we had very healthy core incrementals of 40% and reported 38 core incrementals of 38%, 40%. So it feels like we're more than offsetting inflation with price, and we're getting margin expansion. So I think it's a great margin story. And our teams are really executing in their business as well.\nOperator: Our next question on line comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho Americas.\nBrett Linzey: First question is just on inventories and more channel inventories. I know a lot of your businesses tend to be two to three linkages, upstream from end use or final assembly. Just curious what level of visibility you might have into some of those value chains and your assessment versus those levels relative to end demand?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. If you think about our Electronic Instruments Group, we're largely selling 10 users there. So we have a good view of the end user and our products are customized. So we don't have the problem of people double ordering they're going to be over ordering, but they're not ordering to put stuff on the shelf just in case because of your expensive customized, highly engineered products. When you think about our EMG business, that has more of a -- we're back on the food chain a couple of levels like you talked about. And you could have a backup there, but we're not seeing it right now, and it's indicated by our strong orders growth. So it feels like we're in the right areas and demand is still growing, and we're pretty optimistic about the second half of the year.\nBrett Linzey: And then just back to price cost. So price 6%. How are you thinking about some of the wraparound price into early '23 based on some of the mid-year actions? And just curious on price cost, what that might look like in terms of a tailwind as we get into '23 and what the kind of volume or incrementals or decrementals could look like for the algorithm for '23?\nDavid Zapico: Right. It's a little early to start talking about 2023, but the same pricing strategy that we've employed will continue. When we think about the second half of the year, we want to maintain that 100 basis point spread that we had in the second quarter. So the difference between 6% and 5% of sales is 100 basis points. We want to continue that. And second half of the year, and the future pricing is going to be a big part of our budget discussions, and we think inflation is going to be here for a while. So that's going to influence our thought process. So I would expect to main positive spread into next year also.\nBrett Linzey: And just a quick follow-up. Would you say the complexion of a lot of your pricing actions is more list normal course versus surcharges? Or anything you can share there?\nDavid Zapico: It's a combination of both. I mean it's list, but in a lot of situations, there are -- we're tied to certain indexes and for shipping and things like that where commodities there could be a retracement a bit, but most of it is in the base price. So we try to get it in base price. But in some situations, it's obvious, it's transparent with your customer, and you have to give it back when things go down. But at the same time, we're saying we'll maintain that 100 basis point spread for the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question on line comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: I just want to talk about the kind of the deals that were done last year that have sort of kind of anniversary here in the last month or two or three. How they're performing now as they kind of last year and our anniversary into the portfolio? And any change in your view of kind of the accretion outlook for those businesses?\nDavid Zapico: No. I think the outlook for all the businesses is positive, and we're really pleased to have bought them all. And the management teams are now getting embedded into AMETEK. I'd make a -- the business has had the same problems with supply chain that we experienced across our businesses, and those problems were more experienced in the Electronic Instruments Group. They were impact us a lot. And -- but the second half of the year, we took the opportunity to realign those businesses, get them integrated into AMETEK. And for the second half of the year, I really think we're going to have some significant momentum in H2 related to those deals. So we made a lot of progress during the first year. And I think, into the second half of this year and also 2023, I really see significant momentum.\nJeffrey Sprague: And I missed the first couple of minutes of the call, David. Did you say anything about kind of the current deal pipeline or kind of potential actionability on things as you look here into the balance of the year?\nDavid Zapico: No, that's a good question, Jeff. I mean we remain very active. We mentioned that in our prepared remarks. We're looking at multiple deals. As always, we're focused on long-term returns. One of the things I'm excited about is our debt profile. About 86% of our debt is long term and fixed at a 3.2% interest rate. So if there's a -- if interest rates rise, it's really going to have limited effect on us. As Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have no debt maturities in the next couple of years. We recently upsized our revolver. So we're in a very good position to be in terms of executing our M&A strategy. And as I said, our pipeline is strong, and I expect you'll be hearing from us in the second half of the year regarding M&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question on the line comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just another question on price and volume. In terms of your guide raise, how much of it was price and how much was better volumes in the second half? And I appreciate that there is a FX headwind there as well.\nDavid Zapico: Yes. So, we're not giving that information out. It's really tough to understand that. What we're saying is we'll maintain a spread of 100 basis points positive. And it's a very complicated when you take into account FX and our different mix of businesses and what's happening in the market with some commodity starting to come down. So -- but what we're saying is we'll maintain a 100 basis point spread between price and inflation in the second half of the year.\nAndrew Obin: And just to follow up on Jeff's question on M&A. You have a sort of bottoms up a lot of your M&A activity is sort of bottoms up in the organization. Are you hearing anything new from your business units as they chase these market leaders? Do you take a look at stacks? Are you seeing private equity back away, any change in behavior, anything different about this market versus where we were maybe 6 to 12 months ago?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. The -- I mentioned in a prior call that the multiples were very high. And for quality assets, they're still attracting a bit of a premium. But the multiples between public and private markets are coming in, they're coming closer together. And if you have to go and finance a deal and AMETEK can pay from its balance sheet, it gives us an advantage right now because there is some difficulty in getting financing impacting some private equity potential buyers and sellers for that matter.\nOperator: Our next question on line comes from Mr. Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson.\nWill Jellison: This is Will Jellison on for Matt Summerville. So on the call, you mentioned the supply chain actions that you're taking, including some supply diversification. And I was wondering, bigger picture across the last year plus of supply chain challenges you faced. Are there any best practices that you've learned about throughout the organization that you would want to sustain even when supply chains reach more normalized levels in the future?\nDavid Zapico: It's a great question. And I think we learned several things. We learned that -- our business model is fundamentally sound because our distributed business model, having those committed P&L managers running their business units, they really drive their businesses and there's a good interaction between them and the centralized corporate supply chain team. We also learned that our engineering capability is first rate, and they saw shortages through redesign and qualified component substitutions through this whole time. We did probably one thing that will change is how we purchase electronics going forward. We're looking for -- to leverage our spend more and develop closer relationships with both the semiconductor chip manufacturers and the distributors for that matter. So it will be a little bit of a change in that area. That's one thing I can put to. We're being more direct as opposed to relying on distribution. But fundamentally, it's navigating through this as we did, dealing with these challenges, we've had excellent results. And it's -- as I said, key from my view is our distributed business model. We have people owning these businesses and making good decisions. And our strong engineering capability is also a key factor to help us solve these shortages and redesigning, find qualified component substitutions. So -- did that answer your question?\nNigel Coe: Yes, that was great. And absolutely. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering to the point that you made about having content on the James Webb Telescope, I was wondering if events like that, that are highly visible of historic nature, do those start to meaningfully increase the visibility of what a business like Zygo offers to the extent that it catalyzes more orders than you might otherwise have?\nDavid Zapico: I think in the research community, it really stands out and it does drive customers to us. And the other thing I mentioned in the EUV market, designing and developing optics there there's really only a couple of people that can do it. So Zygo already well known. But those type of events do help us, and they drive customers to us because they see our expertise. And it also is positive for our employees to see that kind of thing and how we're improving the world. So it does help, and we have a lot of businesses like that around AMETEK.\nOperator: Our next question online comes from Mr. Joe Giordano from Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Just curious, just the way you guys are set off. Like when we think about the chips, what does that have to -- how do you think about the impact? Are you kind of agnostic as to where a plant is built globally? Or is this helpful that the U.S. isn't incentivizing it specifically?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I'd say in general, we're agnostic. Wherever it's built in the world, we're going to have our shot at it. But what's happening now is there's probably going to be some incremental capacity put in to satisfy things like security and national defense. And with more opportunities, we'll certainly get a fair share of our business there.\nJoe Giordano: And then, Dave, can you go through kind of like any changes in the outlook by market?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, I think on our process businesses, organic sales for process were up low double digits in the quarter. They had a very broad-based growth across essentially all process businesses. And growth in the quarter was particularly strong across Taylor Hobson, Zygo, and our fluid analysis businesses. And you take that all in, and now we're expecting organic sales for process businesses to be up high single digits. So we raised that. Aerospace & defense. Organic sales for our aerospace & defense businesses were up low double digits growth across each segment. Total commercial sales were up mid-teens in the quarter, with strong growth across commercial OEM and aftermarket, and defense sales were up low single digits. So stronger in commercial, but defense was growing also. And for the full year, we now expect organic sales to be up high single digits for our A&D businesses with growth in both commercial and also defense. And if you look at our power power & industrial businesses, excellent in the quarter, up mid-teens on a percentage basis with notable strength in our grammable power business. And we now expect organic sales in our power & industrial business to be up high single digits. So that was raised also. And then finally, our automation & engineered solutions, a really solutions, both seeing strong growth. And we raised the year for that segment also to be high single digits. So we're reflecting the strength of our businesses and an improved organic guide for the rest of the year. And really all those subsegments are now forecasted to grow at high single digits.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Graham from Loop Capital Markets.\nScott Graham: Yes, so thanks for doing that just now. You saved me a question. Dave, can you just give us the productivity number in the quarter and the expectation for the year?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. Cost savings in the quarter was $35 million. So a really good quarter. And we're getting a lot of that through value engineering. We're redesigning some of these things and getting them designed at a lower cost level. So that's helping us a lot. And for the year, the cost savings number is $125 million.\nScott Graham: No change there?\nDavid Zapico: No change. About half of it's OpEx and half of it's materials.\nScott Graham: You went through a longer sort of acquisition response than I've heard you before. It sounds to me like you're even signaling that more than even expect second half deals. Could you kind of -- is this a situation where things have just sort of been lined up at the gate and there's there's going to be a couple of different closings of deals? Do you think perhaps your comment was directed more at One in particular, just I mean, how close are we on; some? Did we lose any? Just maybe a little bit more color on what you're thinking on the second half.\nDavid Zapico: Yes. You never can tell with deals, Scott. And things can happen and things can change. But I feel really confident right now because the volume of deals that we're looking at and processing and having some positive interactions are high. And they're both the typical deals that AMETEK has and there are some that are on the bigger size within the constraint of the types of deals we look at. So the -- we're busy with deals. We're busy, and we get -- our people are real busy. And the situation that I talked about with our strong balance sheet, the fixed debt, the strong cash flow, we think that's going to be a differentiator for us as we look into the second half of the year.\nScott Graham: Just one more, if I may. The unbundling of the organic and for the full year, the digits really for all four. Could you tell us of those for which ones are maybe a little bit more that you're optimistic on in the second half? Because obviously, in the second quarter, you did better than we all expected on organic. So sort of how much of those raises were because the second quarter was better versus what you're seeing in the second half?\nDavid Zapico: Good question. In general, we had a good second quarter across the board. The one area that I'd point out is the order growth rates in the commercial aerospace market were one of the things that caught my attention. So I'm looking for some positives there in the second half of the year and into 2023.\nOperator: Next question on line comes from Mr. Brett Hardman from Melis Research.\nBrett Hardman: So you've already given good color on price cost, but I just wanted to get more of a sense on what you're seeing in terms of cost inflation, in particular in your outlook going forward. Sorry if I missed this, but inflation impact was 4% last quarter, 5% this quarter. You said supply chain is so bad for electronic components in particular, and that inflation will be here for a while. But I'm just wondering, do you expect the inflation impact in general across your business to continue to increase? Or is it sort of plateauing or decreasing as we move through the rest of the year?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, that's a good question. What you really see is some things are coming back in, decreasing in price like inflation, like the commodities. But at the same time, you have wages and other areas that are increasing. So the net effect is inflation is still increasing. It went from 4% to 5% sequentially in the quarter. Right now, I think that's going to stabilize at that, but it's difficult to predict. That's why we have things in place. We're going to maintain that 100 basis points positive spread. But clearly, there are different dynamics that are happening right now where some things are coming back in and some things are still inflating, but the net is still increasing costs. So -- but we've got a good system to manage that, but that may change over the next quarter, and we'll tell you about it. But right now, that's where it is.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you again, Richard, and thanks, everyone, for joining our conference call today. As a reminder, a replay of today's webcast may be accessed in the investor section of ametek.com. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings. Importantly, demand remains strong and broad-based across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record $3.1 billion backlog. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2022, we have increased our earnings guidance for the year. Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were a record $1.51 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 12%. Acquisitions added a point and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind in the quarter. Organic orders were up a very strong 11%, despite a highly challenging prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.09 in the second quarter, our eighth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Operating income in the quarter was a record $365 million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.1% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from the prior year with strong incremental margins. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $444 million, about 15% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.3%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up 20% versus the second quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30, driven by stronger-than-expected sales and excellent operating performance. Now let provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.03 billion, up 10% from last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 12% in the quarter, with foreign currency headwinds more than offsetting acquisition contributions. Organic growth remains very strong across our EIG businesses with particularly impressive growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies and P&I division. EIG's operating performance was impressive, resulting in record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $265.1 million, up 70% versus the prior year and operating income margins were 25.8% in the quarter. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $486.3 million, up 7% versus the prior year with organic sales growing 11% in the quarter. EMG's growth was also broad-based, with strong growth across both our EMIP and automation businesses. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was $124.4 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second margins were excellent at 25.6%, up 70 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, outstanding results in the quarter, reflecting the quality of our differentiated businesses, the strength of our operating model and the tremendous efforts of our employees. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your commitment to AMETEK and for the many important contributions you make to our sustained success. Now let me touch on the supply chain. Overall, the global supply chain remains constrained, with the largest challenging -- challenges continuing to be the availability of electronic components. As we noted previously, we have strategically decided to hold additional inventory of select components to support the strong customer demand and as a hedge against the tight supply chain. Additionally, AMETEK's global sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job working to identify additional sources of supply. While these supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation, we have been able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread again this quarter and outstanding margin expense. The combination of our global supply chain capabilities and pricing power provides us the confidence in our ability to manage through these uncertain times. During our first quarter earnings call, we noted that the COVID driven lockdowns across parts of China were expected to delay some China sales from the second quarter into the second half of the year. These lockdowns caused less impact on the business in the quarter than we anticipated. Due to the excellent efforts of our China team, we were able to operate in a closed loop system and adjust our logistics and supply chain networks to support production and shipments. Additionally, during the last two weeks of the quarter, as restrictions were lifted, we were able to resumed multi-ship production and recover much of the delayed shipments. The impact of China's zero-COVID policy is something we are closely watching as we need to react and adjust in the future. Thank you to our entire team in China for your tremendous commitment and resilience during this time. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. Our top priority for capital allocation remains the value-enhancing strategic acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline is very strong. Our business unit and corporate development teams are busy managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. As Bill will highlight in a moment, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow providing us with meaningful capacity to support our acquisition strategy, and we expect to be active in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on driving higher levels of organic growth by consistently investing in our businesses to support their strategic growth initiatives. We're seeing the benefits of these investments in stronger organic growth. Our investments in research, development and engineering continues to yield advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. One measure of the success of these efforts is our vitality index, which was a very strong 26% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality reflects our business' ability to develop new products aligned with compelling growth opportunities. One example of this is AMETEK's expansion into the high-growth areas of precision optics. AMETEK's Zygo business, based in Middlefield, Connecticut, provides leading-edge extreme precision optics for the design and protection of very large complicated aspheric lenses. These capabilities supported the manufacture of 18 hexagonal-shaped mirrors, which make up the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror. The James Webb Telescope very recently produced the deepest and sharpest infrared images of the deep universe. Truly amazing images due in part to Zygo's capability. Zygo also provides advanced optical systems for use in the next generation of semiconductor production equipment. Their incredibly precised mirrors are playing an important role in supporting the development of EUV extreme ultraviolet optics, for the next generation of semiconductor technologies. Just two of the many examples across AMETEK of the unique and highly differentiated capabilities and technologies we provide our customers. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the second quarter, continued solid order momentum and record backlog, we have increased our full year earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up high single digits, with organic sales now also expected to be up high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid-to high single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.54, up 13% to 14% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.34 to $5.44 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we expect overall sales to be up in the high single digits compared to the same period last year, and third quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.38 per diluted share, up 8% to 10% versus the prior year. While we are closely monitoring the various macroeconomic headwinds, we are not seeing slowing in our businesses as demand remains solid and our businesses are operating level. We are confident in our ability and improved outlook for the year, given our strong backlog, ability to offset inflation with price increases and outstanding operating capability. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses are well positioned with differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of growing niche markets. Our organic growth initiatives are driving higher levels of growth, and our portfolio is aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. Additionally, our asset-light business model and strong cash flow provides us the flexibility to navigate challenging environments, while continuing to deploy capital and drive increased shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

            "name": "Bill Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million, up $2 million from the prior year. And as a percentage of total sales was 1.6%, in line with the second quarter of 2021. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18.5%, down from 20.6% in the second quarter of 2021. The lower rate this quarter was driven by lower tax on foreign income. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million for the full year, or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $77 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18% of sales. Operating cash flow was $236 million and free cash flow was $210 million in the second quarter. We expect approximately 100% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. Our working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add select inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and to hedge against the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.44 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $173 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares, for a total of $330 million. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. Total debt ended the second quarter at $2.5 billion, down slightly from the $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $349 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times. As Dave noted, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2024, modest levels of leverage and strong cash flows. As a result, we are well positioned to deploy meaningful capital investment in our acquisition strategy with approximately $2.3 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To conclude, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned going into the back half of the year, and we'll continue to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin? Yes, I think you've hit on it there, Allison. We've got -- with the strong order rate coming in, we've got to make sure we have the inventory to support those orders. And we are still concerned about supply chain, and we're going to continue to react to that. So I would say you've hit the nail on the head, and I think we've increased them now. And we'll continue to manage it closely. Obviously, you know we're very focused on running lean, but we've got to make sure we're supporting the orders that are in place."

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the first quarter with strong sales growth and excellent operating performance, driving robust core margin expansion and earnings which exceeded our expectations. We are also seeing continued strong demand. This demand remains broad based across our diverse set of niche markets, leading to outstanding orders growth and a record backlog. I'm very proud of the way our teams are managing a challenging and uncertain macro environment. AMETEK's flexible operating model allows our businesses to quickly adjust and adapt to changing economic conditions and deliver exceptional results. Before I provide more details on the results for the quarter, I wanted to comment on the ongoing geopolitical events in Ukraine. We are deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts and thoughts are with all those affected. To assist with the immediate needs of this mass humanitarian crisis, the AMETEK Foundation has made donations to several charities that are actively providing food, shelter and medical supplies to those impacted. Additionally, many AMETEK colleagues and our businesses have mobilized to help in whatever way they can through donations to charities supporting the crisis. Thank you to all employees who are supporting those in need. Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.46 billion, up 20% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 14%, acquisitions added 7 points and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind in the quarter. Overall orders in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up 18% in the quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.17 in the first quarter, reflecting continued robust and broad based demand. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was $353 million, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.2% in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were 25.5%, up an impressive 140 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021 with strong core margin expansion in each operating group. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating capability and the great work of our teams in managing inflationary and supply chain impacts across our business. EBITDA in the first quarter was $434 million, up 22% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins up 29.7%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.33 per diluted share, up 24% versus the first quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.24 to $1.28. Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $987.8 million, up 25% from last year's first quarter. Organic sales were up 15% in the quarter, while recent acquisitions contributed 11%, and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Organic growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies division with Creaform, Reichert Technologies and TMC Precitech businesses leading the growth. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $244.8 million, up 80% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter. EIG's core margins were up a very strong 130 basis points over the prior year to 27.5%. The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter with excellent organic sales growth driven by broad based demand and strong operating performance. EMGs first quarter sales increased 11% versus the prior year to $470.8 million. Organic sales growth was 12% and foreign currency a 1 point headwind. Demand within our automation businesses remains excellent reflecting AMETEK's highly differentiated motion control capabilities and leadership positions within our niche applications. EMG's operating income in the first quarter was a record $128.2 million, up 22% to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 250 basis points, just 27.2% which includes an approximate $7 million gain on the sale of a facility in the quarter. On a quarter basis excluding this gain, EMG margins were up a very strong 100 basis points versus last year's first quarter. Our teams continue to deliver outstanding performance in a very challenging and dynamic operational environment. In addition to ensuring we successfully navigate the current macro environment, we are focused on ensuring AMETEK is positioned for long-term success and sustainable growth by making investments in our organic growth initiatives. In 2022, we expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives, including strong growth across our Research, Development and Engineering Groups. AMETEK's leadership positions in our niche markets are driven by deep industry expertise, and the differentiation of our technology. Our research and engineering teams do a wonderful job developing innovative, next generation products and technologies to support their customers applications. For the full year, we now expect to invest more than $345 million or over 5.5% of sales in RDE. Our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past three years, was a very strong 26% in the first quarter. One way we recognize and celebrate the great work of our businesses new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award provided annually to the AMETEK businesses who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our Hughes-Treitler/Rotron business unit, a leading provider of advanced thermal management systems for use in support of critical aerospace, defense, industrial and commercial applications. Utilizing various elements of the AMETEK new product development process, the team developed a highly innovative heat exchanger that provides meaningful improvements in aircraft engine performance versus the incumbent technologies. This new product will deliver strong incremental sales for AMETEK while providing important sustainability benefits through the reduction of approximately 1 million tons of carbon dioxide over a 10-year period due to an advanced, more thermally and aerodynamically efficient design of the heat exchanger. Driving such benefits aligned with AMETEK's core value of social responsibility by using innovative solutions to help our customers create a more sustainable future. Congratulations to the Hughes-Treitler/Rotron team and all the AMETEK colleagues contributing to the development of outstanding new products and technologies. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021 deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of six businesses. Those businesses are integrating nicely and we expect contributions from the acquisitions in the coming years as they further implement key elements of the AMETEK growth model. Our acquisition pipeline has remained strong, and our M&A teams remain busy in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. We have ample balance sheet capacity and strong cash flows to support our acquisition strategy, and expect to remain active over the coming quarters. Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. Overall, the global supply chain and logistics channels remained tight and unreliable. The supply chain and logistics environment in the first quarter was similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components. These issues are leading to higher inflation, but given our product differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread and outstanding margin expansion. Now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are bullish on the future, we remain cautious in the short-term given uncertainty related to the supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage these ongoing headwinds. Additionally, our record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid and long cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. For the full year, we continued to expect organic sales growth to be up mid to high single digits, while overall sales growth are expected to be up high single digits, down slightly versus our prior guidance given increased foreign currency headwinds. Given our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44, up 10% to 12% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.30 to $5.42 per diluted share. While confident in our increased outlook for the year, the COVID-19 lockdowns throughout China are expected to shift some sales from the second quarter into the second half. For the second quarter, overall sales are expected to be up low to mid single digits compared to the same period last year, and second quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% versus the prior year. To summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion and a high quality of earnings, allowing us to increase our earnings guidance for the year. These outstanding results speak to the strength of the AMETEK growth model, along with the resilience of our world class workforce. Our differentiated technology solutions and market leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through these difficult economic cycles. While we expect these challenges will continue throughout 22, we remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nWilliam Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results to start the year highlighted by strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance, and a high quality of earnings. I'll provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $19.7 million, up $1 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expenses in the quarter. For 2022 general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels, and approximately 1.5% of sales. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% and as we've stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated range. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $26 million. For the full year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million or approximately 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter operating working capital was 17.1% of sales. Operating cash flow was $201 million and free cash flow was $175 million. Our first quarter working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and as a hedge against longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. While investment resulted in lower cash flows and free cash flow conversion in the first quarter, we continue to expect a strong 110% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $152 million. Total debt ended the first quarter at $2.54 billion unchanged from the end of 2021 and offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of about $340 million. The end of the first quarter gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.5 times and the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities on March 31 to support our growth initiatives. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions, as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. In summary, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter, delivering strong earnings growth in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges. We're continuing to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. John, can we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks, good morning. Dave, could you maybe talk about where you were in Q1 from a price cost standpoint, what that spread looked like and how much realized price you expect for the full year? And then I have a follow up.\nDavid Zapico: Sure, Matt. In the first quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was about 5% and inflation was about 4%, so the spread was a little over 100 basis points. And for 2022, we expect price to be in the 4.5% to 5% range and the inflation to be in the 4% to 4.5% range, so about a 50% positive spread in our guide. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership positions and niches, the investments we're making in our products and technologies. And we've been staying ahead of inflation, as we said we would for probably the last year or so when we saw it coming down the line, so\u2026\nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then Dave, given your second quarter guidance and kind of the normal in a more normal year, typical cadence would dictate second quarter being at least a few cents above where you're at in Q1. Obviously you're not guiding that way this year, so I guess I'm trying to understand maybe how much contingency you're factoring in disruption, if you want to call it that, can you kind of parse that out a little bit? Thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Yes, it's a good observation, Matt and it's fundamentally driven by the China lockdown scenario. You know, we have about 9% of our sales are out of China and we've been successful running a profitable growing operation there for many years. We have tremendous customer base, improving manufacturing processes, making the environment cleaner, improving research and development capabilities, and that's going to continue. But right now, several of our major facilities are in the Shanghai area and they're in a lockdown situation either and not operating or operating in a significantly reduced capacity and that's impacting a lot of our business. And our best assessment of what we know right now is, about a half of our China sales will be impacted in the quarter. So that's about 4% to 5% of our sales or $65 million or $70 million. So if you take that out of the guide, you'll see that the balance of AMETEK is going up in Q2. So it's really the fact that, of lower business activities in China, because of the lockdown situations and because of our proximity to Shanghai and some of our major operations. Now those sales are just going to be delayed. They're going to get delayed from the second quarter to the second half of the year and so we have to get through the lockdown in Q2.\nMatt Summerville: Understood, thank you very much, David.\nDavid Zapico: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I appreciate all the color. Could you take us through the key end markets and regional updates? We certainly just got the China update on the lockdowns. That's understood, but anything else especially European exposures? Thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Sure Deane. I'll take you through the major markets first. Our process businesses were up 20% in the quarter, strong demand organic sales growth, contribution from the acquisitions of Magnetrol or and Alphasense. So organic sales for process were up mid teens in the quarter. Growth broad based, I mentioned in the prepared remarks the Ultra Precision Technologies business really saw excellent growth in the quarter. End market demand remained strong, all key and markets including semiconductor, research and medical are very strong. Additionally, we're seeing increased demand for our solutions serving sustainability initiatives with our instrumentation being used to reduce harmful emissions and process -- and improve process efficiency. So look at process our biggest segment for all of 2022, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be mid to high single digits. Next, our aerospace business. Our aerospace business was organically up low single digits in the quarter up in the mid 20s range for the first quarter in overall sales. In the quarter, we saw strength in commercial aerospace, being partially offset by delays in defense shipments caused by U.S. Government spending. So our commercial side of that business was up low double digits and our defense side of that business was down mid single digits. And for the full year we expect to be up mid single digits with commercial up high single digits and defense up low single digits for aerospace. Next, power and industrial. Overall sales were also up in the mid 20s, so good quarter at power and industrial. We had mid teens organic sales growth and the contributions from our acquisition of NSI-MI, so strong balanced sales growth across both power and industrial. And we expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be up mid single digits with similar growth across both segments. And finally, our automation and engineering solutions, both overall and organic sales for automation and engineered solutions businesses were up mid teens on a percentage basis in the quarter with solid demand continuing across our end markets. For the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to be up for our automation engineered solutions business up mid to high single digits with similar growth across each business. So, strong performance across the entire business. I'll talk about the geography, you asked that question too. Strong broad based growth across all geographies, up mid teens in Europe, U.S. and Asia. China we were up 10% on an as reported basis, so good quarter there also. So when you look across the globe, there's really not a blemish in terms of growth, so we're feeling good about that also. With our orders, we think there's strong growth ahead.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And just last one, just to clarify, I understand the push out from the second quarter that may be China related. I might have missed this, but were there any revenues pushed out of the first quarter?\nDavid Zapico: There really wasn't. The closure of China occurred late in the quarter, very late in the quarter and we had a heads up that that was happening. So we were able to really meet our demand requirements in the first quarter. But at the same time, overall for the company, there was -- there continued to be orders that did not ship in the first quarter and they were in that $50 million plus range. So if we were operating at 100% of supply chain, and everything else that was going on, we probably would have shipped another $50 million plus out in the first quarter.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: And our next question is from Allison Poliniak-Cusic from Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: So just poking on sort of that end market and customer demand, is there any sort of change in behavior that's sort of causing you a little bit of pause with a specific business or vertical, that kind of leading to that things might be shifting a little bit or is it -- it's still quite strong across the board here?\nDavid Zapico: It is quite strong across the board. I think over 90% of our business units had double digit sales and double digit orders and the ones that didn't were in the high single digits. So the orders are good, the sales are good. There's absolutely no slowdown that we see. You know, as I told you, couple of quarters ago, customers are giving us an early look into their demands, that's continuing, and but I really see no slowdown at all on that, at 22% orders and 18% orders growth and it is broad based and I think, on an order basis, organic orders EIG was 19 and EMG was 15, so both very strong.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. And then you talked about the pipeline for M&A being quite filled at this point, which is not atypical for you. Would you describe sort of kind of the things that you're seeing, what's kind of holding things back, is pricing still high at this point? Just any incremental color on the pipeline and what you're seeing out there today?\nDavid Zapico: Sure. We remain active. We're looking at multiple deals. As always, we are focused on long-term returns. The one point that's -- it's a factor right now, if you look at private company multiples, and public company multiples. And with the stock market obviously, public company multiples have come in a bit, but the private company multiples are above public company multiples, and they're being stingy and reflecting what's happening in public markets. So there's a bit of a delay and some of the private businesses were looking at premium multiples. And I think that's causing some transactions to get pushed to the right. The difference between private and public multiples and the fact that the owners of the private businesses are holding on right now to -- for higher multiples from the public market.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Perfect, thank you. I'll pass it on.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Howdy, thank you. I was actually going to follow on the last statement you just made was an interesting one. I just wanted to see if you would characterize acquisition pipeline funnel backlog and size. You guys had a record year last year, maybe some of that was because of 2020 was a little slower. But then was your statement then to imply that things have to kind of normalize between public and private before acquisition activity picks up or is it more situational? And that's a comment on the forecast, if you see the mean on that price line?\nDavid Zapico: No, not a forecast, it is a comment, but it is a factor that is impacting valuations. But we have a very, very good pipeline, both smaller deals, public and private and I expect that you'll be hearing from us this year. And as you know, we're always focused on long-term returns, so we have to see value in what we're buying and we're very active right now.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay, perfect. And then I think your comments have been really clear that 90% and double digits is an amazing stat in some ways. There's a lot of consternation around Europe, whether there's going to be a slide into recession or just uncertainty on spending, et cetera, I assume from your comment you're not seeing any of that in your orders and backlog specific to Europe?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, Europe was up 16% in the quarter, broad base strength. We had notable strength in our process businesses. Clearly there's some impact in the energy area and what the Ukraine crisis, the war in Ukraine, some of our products are used to help people get fuel efficiency, some of our products are used in applications that are actually helping those customers deal with higher energy costs. So right now, we're not seeing a slowdown. We read the press clippings like you have, but right now we're full go in Europe.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nKevin Coleman: Okay.\nOperator: And our next question is from Scott Graham from Loop Capital Markets.\nScott Graham: Hey, good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin, how are you?\nDavid Zapico: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Graham: So I have two questions, one is on the price cost and I know that we came into this year with that fourth quarter, I think you had 100 basis point gap. In the first quarter you had the same. In the fourth quarter, I think you mentioned that you were expecting that gap to start to narrow, and it really didn't in the first quarter. So is it possible that you can get pricing enough to keep it at 100 for the rest of the year?\nDavid Zapico: It is possible, Scott. I mean, that's -- our guidance is it, for it to narrow, but certainly we've been doing an excellent job. And I think our intention will be to try to maintain the same thread, but our guidance is for that to narrow a bit.\nScott Graham: Understood, thank you. Next question is on aerospace. And you know, commercial you said was up low double. And I was hoping maybe you could unbundle that OE versus MRO?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, what drove the growth in our commercial, the low double digits was really the aftermarket and the business jet. Those markets both outperformed the OE.\nScott Graham: Okay. And from -- if I could just extend that last comment, what are you hearing from the big guys? Because they're -- obviously these guys are certainly mum on 2023? Are you hearing any changes in build rates for next year? Certainly costs a lot to take a flight these days, so I'm thinking that they're kind of padding things their -- their pockets a little bit? What is your sense there?\nDavid Zapico: My sense is from our perspective, that market is going to continue to improve and it's one of our longer cycle exposures, and we're looking for a good continued growth in commercial in 2023.\nScott Graham: Got it? And if I could just sneak this last one in, I know that your vitality has been at about 25% for quite some time. Honestly, correct me if I'm wrong, it's the first time I've heard 26%. And I was just -- that's a really awesome number three years and what have you, and I hear you talk more and more about new products on these calls. Could that number continue to creep up this year?\nDavid Zapico: Yes it can continue to creep up and we've got an incredible credible range of new products were being introduced. And they're also you think about, were the heat exchangers I've talked about from our Hughes-Treitler/Rotron business, I mean, we're saving 1 million tons of CO2. That's almost the entire carbon footprint of AMETEK over 10 years. It's an incredible design. It reduces weight. It's just a fantastic thing design and were already designed in and it's really bullish for the future. So we have the engineering capability to meet the needs of the customers in these changing times where sustainability is a more important factor. And I'm very excited about our product development. That's why we're investing heavily in that area and we have good things to come.\nScott Graham: Very good, Dave, thanks.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. I know AMETEK is a sizable U.S. exporter. Given the U.S. dollar appreciation is that a drag on margins and can you remind us of your overall hedging strategy?\nDavid Zapico: Sure, the first point is we are a sizable U.S. exporter and that's a correct statement, but our products are also very differentiated. So as evidenced by our price inflation spread so far, we're able to offset the higher U.S. dollar.\nWilliam Burke: And our cost structure.\nDavid Zapico: The second point is our hedging strategy and actually, we don't have hedging strategy, because we're naturally hedged. So pretty much across the board, we spent a lot of time and this is about tenure all the time, it's a long period of time. We're naturally hedged in each of our locations that we operate. So our revenues and expenses naturally offset. And to give you an example, in this quarter where, you had a strong dollar, and there was some currency implications, it did impact our top line, but our bottom line across the whole enterprise, it was less than a penny impact on earnings. So we've got this natural hedging strategy and through the past tenure, you can go back and look at it, it works very well. We are a U.S. exporter, but we got the pricing leverage through our differentiated technology. So strong dollar is not usually an insurmountable win [ph] for us.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Understood. And quick follow up on Abaco. Are you seeing any sort of incremental demand out there from international defense budgets, which are going up? I know, this is probably more of a 2023, 2024 story, but has the sort of pipeline for your defense businesses change meaningfully? Thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Yes, the pipeline is improving in international markets. We have businesses located in the UK besides Abaco that are also benefiting. So the fact that the international defense market is improving is a good thing for our aerospace and defense business.\nOperator: And our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Michael on for Joe.\nDavid Zapico: Hello, Michael.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, continuing with the defense theme, can you provide any color regarding the new U.S. defense budget now that it's been finalized?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. Yes, the U.S. defense budget is good from our perspective in areas that we're investing. I mean, when you look at the whole thing, it was probably flattish to up a bit. So, but there's ample spending going on for us and we're really, it's a budget that we can work with. What hit us a bit in the first quarter and I talked about our defense businesses being down were the delays from the continuing resolution where no one has funding. So what we're seeing now is an uptick in order patterns and the second half of the year we expect that market to improve substantially.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nDavid Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast may be accessed in the Investor section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for joining ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results to start the year highlighted by strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance, and a high quality of earnings. I'll provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $19.7 million, up $1 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expenses in the quarter. For 2022 general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels, and approximately 1.5% of sales. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% and as we've stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated range. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $26 million. For the full year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million or approximately 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter operating working capital was 17.1% of sales. Operating cash flow was $201 million and free cash flow was $175 million. Our first quarter working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and as a hedge against longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. While investment resulted in lower cash flows and free cash flow conversion in the first quarter, we continue to expect a strong 110% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year.

As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions, as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. In summary, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter, delivering strong earnings growth in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges. We're continuing to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin? And our cost structure."

            "name": "David Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the first quarter with strong sales growth and excellent operating performance, driving robust core margin expansion and earnings which exceeded our expectations. We are also seeing continued strong demand. This demand remains broad based across our diverse set of niche markets, leading to outstanding orders growth and a record backlog. I'm very proud of the way our teams are managing a challenging and uncertain macro environment. AMETEK's flexible operating model allows our businesses to quickly adjust and adapt to changing economic conditions and deliver exceptional results. Before I provide more details on the results for the quarter, I wanted to comment on the ongoing geopolitical events in Ukraine. We are deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts and thoughts are with all those affected. To assist with the immediate needs of this mass humanitarian crisis, the AMETEK Foundation has made donations to several charities that are actively providing food, shelter and medical supplies to those impacted. Additionally, many AMETEK colleagues and our businesses have mobilized to help in whatever way they can through donations to charities supporting the crisis. Thank you to all employees who are supporting those in need. Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.46 billion, up 20% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 14%, acquisitions added 7 points and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind in the quarter. Overall orders in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up 18% in the quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.17 in the first quarter, reflecting continued robust and broad based demand. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was $353 million, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.2% in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were 25.5%, up an impressive 140 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021 with strong core margin expansion in each operating group. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating capability and the great work of our teams in managing inflationary and supply chain impacts across our business. EBITDA in the first quarter was $434 million, up 22% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins up 29.7%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.33 per diluted share, up 24% versus the first quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.24 to $1.28. Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $987.8 million, up 25% from last year's first quarter. Organic sales were up 15% in the quarter, while recent acquisitions contributed 11%, and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Organic growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies division with Creaform, Reichert Technologies and TMC Precitech businesses leading the growth. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $244.8 million, up 80% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter. EIG's core margins were up a very strong 130 basis points over the prior year to 27.5%. The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter with excellent organic sales growth driven by broad based demand and strong operating performance. EMGs first quarter sales increased 11% versus the prior year to $470.8 million. Organic sales growth was 12% and foreign currency a 1 point headwind. Demand within our automation businesses remains excellent reflecting AMETEK's highly differentiated motion control capabilities and leadership positions within our niche applications. EMG's operating income in the first quarter was a record $128.2 million, up 22% to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 250 basis points, just 27.2% which includes an approximate $7 million gain on the sale of a facility in the quarter. On a quarter basis excluding this gain, EMG margins were up a very strong 100 basis points versus last year's first quarter. Our teams continue to deliver outstanding performance in a very challenging and dynamic operational environment. In addition to ensuring we successfully navigate the current macro environment, we are focused on ensuring AMETEK is positioned for long-term success and sustainable growth by making investments in our organic growth initiatives. In 2022, we expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives, including strong growth across our Research, Development and Engineering Groups. AMETEK's leadership positions in our niche markets are driven by deep industry expertise, and the differentiation of our technology. Our research and engineering teams do a wonderful job developing innovative, next generation products and technologies to support their customers applications. For the full year, we now expect to invest more than $345 million or over 5.5% of sales in RDE. Our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past three years, was a very strong 26% in the first quarter. One way we recognize and celebrate the great work of our businesses new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award provided annually to the AMETEK businesses who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our Hughes-Treitler/Rotron business unit, a leading provider of advanced thermal management systems for use in support of critical aerospace, defense, industrial and commercial applications. Utilizing various elements of the AMETEK new product development process, the team developed a highly innovative heat exchanger that provides meaningful improvements in aircraft engine performance versus the incumbent technologies. This new product will deliver strong incremental sales for AMETEK while providing important sustainability benefits through the reduction of approximately 1 million tons of carbon dioxide over a 10-year period due to an advanced, more thermally and aerodynamically efficient design of the heat exchanger. Driving such benefits aligned with AMETEK's core value of social responsibility by using innovative solutions to help our customers create a more sustainable future. Congratulations to the Hughes-Treitler/Rotron team and all the AMETEK colleagues contributing to the development of outstanding new products and technologies. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021 deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of six businesses. Those businesses are integrating nicely and we expect contributions from the acquisitions in the coming years as they further implement key elements of the AMETEK growth model. Our acquisition pipeline has remained strong, and our M&A teams remain busy in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. We have ample balance sheet capacity and strong cash flows to support our acquisition strategy, and expect to remain active over the coming quarters. Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. Overall, the global supply chain and logistics channels remained tight and unreliable. The supply chain and logistics environment in the first quarter was similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components. These issues are leading to higher inflation, but given our product differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread and outstanding margin expansion. Now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are bullish on the future, we remain cautious in the short-term given uncertainty related to the supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage these ongoing headwinds. Additionally, our record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid and long cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. For the full year, we continued to expect organic sales growth to be up mid to high single digits, while overall sales growth are expected to be up high single digits, down slightly versus our prior guidance given increased foreign currency headwinds. Given our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44, up 10% to 12% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.30 to $5.42 per diluted share. While confident in our increased outlook for the year, the COVID-19 lockdowns throughout China are expected to shift some sales from the second quarter into the second half. For the second quarter, overall sales are expected to be up low to mid single digits compared to the same period last year, and second quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% versus the prior year. To summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion and a high quality of earnings, allowing us to increase our earnings guidance for the year. These outstanding results speak to the strength of the AMETEK growth model, along with the resilience of our world class workforce. Our differentiated technology solutions and market leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through these difficult economic cycles. While we expect these challenges will continue throughout 22, we remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill? Sure, Matt. In the first quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was about 5% and inflation was about 4%, so the spread was a little over 100 basis points. And for 2022, we expect price to be in the 4.5% to 5% range and the inflation to be in the 4% to 4.5% range, so about a 50% positive spread in our guide. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership positions and niches, the investments we're making in our products and technologies. And we've been staying ahead of inflation, as we said we would for probably the last year or so when we saw it coming down the line, so\u2026 Yes, it's a good observation, Matt and it's fundamentally driven by the China lockdown scenario. You know, we have about 9% of our sales are out of China and we've been successful running a profitable growing operation there for many years. We have tremendous customer base, improving manufacturing processes, making the environment cleaner, improving research and development capabilities, and that's going to continue. But right now, several of our major facilities are in the Shanghai area and they're in a lockdown situation either and not operating or operating in a significantly reduced capacity and that's impacting a lot of our business. And our best assessment of what we know right now is, about a half of our China sales will be impacted in the quarter. So that's about 4% to 5% of our sales or $65 million or $70 million. So if you take that out of the guide, you'll see that the balance of AMETEK is going up in Q2. So it's really the fact that, of lower business activities in China, because of the lockdown situations and because of our proximity to Shanghai and some of our major operations. Now those sales are just going to be delayed. They're going to get delayed from the second quarter to the second half of the year and so we have to get through the lockdown in Q2. Thanks, Matt. Good morning, Deane. Sure Deane. I'll take you through the major markets first. Our process businesses were up 20% in the quarter, strong demand organic sales growth, contribution from the acquisitions of Magnetrol or and Alphasense. So organic sales for process were up mid teens in the quarter. Growth broad based, I mentioned in the prepared remarks the Ultra Precision Technologies business really saw excellent growth in the quarter. End market demand remained strong, all key and markets including semiconductor, research and medical are very strong. Additionally, we're seeing increased demand for our solutions serving sustainability initiatives with our instrumentation being used to reduce harmful emissions and process -- and improve process efficiency. So look at process our biggest segment for all of 2022, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be mid to high single digits. Next, our aerospace business. Our aerospace business was organically up low single digits in the quarter up in the mid 20s range for the first quarter in overall sales. In the quarter, we saw strength in commercial aerospace, being partially offset by delays in defense shipments caused by U.S. Government spending. So our commercial side of that business was up low double digits and our defense side of that business was down mid single digits. And for the full year we expect to be up mid single digits with commercial up high single digits and defense up low single digits for aerospace. Next, power and industrial. Overall sales were also up in the mid 20s, so good quarter at power and industrial. We had mid teens organic sales growth and the contributions from our acquisition of NSI-MI, so strong balanced sales growth across both power and industrial. And we expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be up mid single digits with similar growth across both segments. And finally, our automation and engineering solutions, both overall and organic sales for automation and engineered solutions businesses were up mid teens on a percentage basis in the quarter with solid demand continuing across our end markets. For the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to be up for our automation engineered solutions business up mid to high single digits with similar growth across each business. So, strong performance across the entire business. I'll talk about the geography, you asked that question too. Strong broad based growth across all geographies, up mid teens in Europe, U.S. and Asia. China we were up 10% on an as reported basis, so good quarter there also. So when you look across the globe, there's really not a blemish in terms of growth, so we're feeling good about that also. With our orders, we think there's strong growth ahead. There really wasn't. The closure of China occurred late in the quarter, very late in the quarter and we had a heads up that that was happening. So we were able to really meet our demand requirements in the first quarter. But at the same time, overall for the company, there was -- there continued to be orders that did not ship in the first quarter and they were in that $50 million plus range. So if we were operating at 100% of supply chain, and everything else that was going on, we probably would have shipped another $50 million plus out in the first quarter. Thank you, Deane. Good morning, Allison. It is quite strong across the board. I think over 90% of our business units had double digit sales and double digit orders and the ones that didn't were in the high single digits. So the orders are good, the sales are good. There's absolutely no slowdown that we see. You know, as I told you, couple of quarters ago, customers are giving us an early look into their demands, that's continuing, and but I really see no slowdown at all on that, at 22% orders and 18% orders growth and it is broad based and I think, on an order basis, organic orders EIG was 19 and EMG was 15, so both very strong. Sure. We remain active. We're looking at multiple deals. As always, we are focused on long-term returns. The one point that's -- it's a factor right now, if you look at private company multiples, and public company multiples. And with the stock market obviously, public company multiples have come in a bit, but the private company multiples are above public company multiples, and they're being stingy and reflecting what's happening in public markets. So there's a bit of a delay and some of the private businesses were looking at premium multiples. And I think that's causing some transactions to get pushed to the right. The difference between private and public multiples and the fact that the owners of the private businesses are holding on right now to -- for higher multiples from the public market. Thank you. No, not a forecast, it is a comment, but it is a factor that is impacting valuations. But we have a very, very good pipeline, both smaller deals, public and private and I expect that you'll be hearing from us this year. And as you know, we're always focused on long-term returns, so we have to see value in what we're buying and we're very active right now. Yes, Europe was up 16% in the quarter, broad base strength. We had notable strength in our process businesses. Clearly there's some impact in the energy area and what the Ukraine crisis, the war in Ukraine, some of our products are used to help people get fuel efficiency, some of our products are used in applications that are actually helping those customers deal with higher energy costs. So right now, we're not seeing a slowdown. We read the press clippings like you have, but right now we're full go in Europe. Good morning, Scott. It is possible, Scott. I mean, that's -- our guidance is it, for it to narrow, but certainly we've been doing an excellent job. And I think our intention will be to try to maintain the same thread, but our guidance is for that to narrow a bit. Yes, what drove the growth in our commercial, the low double digits was really the aftermarket and the business jet. Those markets both outperformed the OE. My sense is from our perspective, that market is going to continue to improve and it's one of our longer cycle exposures, and we're looking for a good continued growth in commercial in 2023. Yes it can continue to creep up and we've got an incredible credible range of new products were being introduced. And they're also you think about, were the heat exchangers I've talked about from our Hughes-Treitler/Rotron business, I mean, we're saving 1 million tons of CO2. That's almost the entire carbon footprint of AMETEK over 10 years. It's an incredible design. It reduces weight. It's just a fantastic thing design and were already designed in and it's really bullish for the future. So we have the engineering capability to meet the needs of the customers in these changing times where sustainability is a more important factor. And I'm very excited about our product development. That's why we're investing heavily in that area and we have good things to come. Thank you, Scott. Sure, the first point is we are a sizable U.S. exporter and that's a correct statement, but our products are also very differentiated. So as evidenced by our price inflation spread so far, we're able to offset the higher U.S. dollar. The second point is our hedging strategy and actually, we don't have hedging strategy, because we're naturally hedged. So pretty much across the board, we spent a lot of time and this is about tenure all the time, it's a long period of time. We're naturally hedged in each of our locations that we operate. So our revenues and expenses naturally offset. And to give you an example, in this quarter where, you had a strong dollar, and there was some currency implications, it did impact our top line, but our bottom line across the whole enterprise, it was less than a penny impact on earnings. So we've got this natural hedging strategy and through the past tenure, you can go back and look at it, it works very well. We are a U.S. exporter, but we got the pricing leverage through our differentiated technology. So strong dollar is not usually an insurmountable win [ph] for us. Yes, the pipeline is improving in international markets. We have businesses located in the UK besides Abaco that are also benefiting. So the fact that the international defense market is improving is a good thing for our aerospace and defense business. Hello, Michael. Yes. Yes, the U.S. defense budget is good from our perspective in areas that we're investing. I mean, when you look at the whole thing, it was probably flattish to up a bit. So, but there's ample spending going on for us and we're really, it's a budget that we can work with. What hit us a bit in the first quarter and I talked about our defense businesses being down were the delays from the continuing resolution where no one has funding. So what we're seeing now is an uptick in order patterns and the second half of the year we expect that market to improve substantially. Thank you."

Before I get into the financial results for the quarter, it is with mixed emotions that I share the news of changes in our financial leadership, which we announced on January 16. After an outstanding 36-year career at AMETEK, our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Burke, has decided to embark on a well-deserved retirement effective April 2, 2024. Bill's tremendous leadership of our finance organization and his strategic guidance has been instrumental in AMETEK's long-term growth and success. His legacy is deeply woven into the fabric of our organization, and we express our heartfelt gratitude for his exceptional contributions. In light of this transition, I'm delighted to announce the appointment of Dalip Puri as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dalip, currently serving as Senior Vice President, Operational Finance, brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role. Dalip joined AMETEK in 2017 as Treasurer and subsequently took on the role of Group Controller, providing financial oversight for over half of AMETEK's businesses before transitioning into his current role of Operational Finance. Dalip's leadership of key financial initiatives at AMETEK, along with a proven track record make him the natural choice to lead our financial organization into the future. I'm confident that under Dalip's leadership, our financial organization will continue to thrive contributing significantly to the success of AMETEK. To ensure a seamless transition, Bill will stay on as a senior adviser until April 2025. Thank you, Bill, for your exceptional service, and congratulations Dalip. I'm truly excited about the future. Now let me turn to this quarter's results. AMETEK delivered exceptional performance in the fourth quarter, delivering record results and outstanding operational execution, leading to results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we set records for sales, operating income, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flow. We also ended the quarter with record backlog. Furthermore, in the quarter, we successfully deployed over $2 billion on strategic acquisitions, enhancing our portfolio with the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. These results cap a record year for acquisitions and underscore the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our businesses and the success of our organic growth initiatives. AMETEK's continued success is also the result of the dedicated efforts of our global employees. I want to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your efforts and significant contributions in 2023. Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.73 billion, up 6.5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was approximately 1.5%. Acquisitions added 4 points and foreign currency added 1 point. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.53 billion which is up 10% from the start of 2023. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was outstanding, with robust margin expansion and strong incremental margins. Operating income in the quarter was a record $445 million, a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up an impressive 120 basis points from the prior year while core margins were up 200 basis points in the quarter. This strong margin expansion reflects the strength and flexibility of our operating model and the quality and differentiation of our businesses. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $526 million, up 8% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 30.4%. Our strong growth and operating performance led to robust cash generation with free cash flow up 47% in the quarter to a record $481 million. This tremendous operating performance led to record diluted earnings per share of $1.68, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments grew by an excellent quarter with strong sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.24 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added three points with currency accounting for the balance. EIG sales growth in the fourth quarter was strongest across our Aerospace & Defense businesses and our Materials Analysis division. EIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and exceptional margin expansion. Operating income was a record $359 million, up 17% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 29%, up and outstanding 250 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with strong performance despite the continued impact from the normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $495 million, up 6% versus the prior year, driven by the contributions from recent acquisitions. EMG's fourth quarter operating income was $112 million, while operating margin -- operating income margins were 22.7% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EMG core margins were up 100 basis points versus the prior year. Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2023, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.6 billion, up 7% from 2022. Organic sales increased 4%, with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. Operating income for 2023 was $1.7 billion, up 14% and operating margins were 25.9% for the full year, with margins up 150 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $2 billion with EBITDA margins are very strong 30.5%. In full year 2023, earnings were $6.38 per diluted share up 12% versus the prior year. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year highlights the strength of the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are strategically aligned with diverse and attractive markets while our organic growth initiatives position us for sustained long-term growth. Our distributed operating structure empowers our businesses to execute on our growth strategies and quickly adapt to evolving market dynamics. This structure is a cornerstone of the success and navigating throughout different economic cycles. Furthermore, our asset-light business model and strong operational execution result in exceptional cash flow generation. This robust cash flow, coupled with our strong balance sheet, provides AMETEK with plenty of firepower to support our growth initiatives and to deploy on acquisitions. Speaking of acquisitions, we were very active in 2023, successfully deploying approximately $2.25 billion on five acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Amplify Research and Paragon Medical in the fourth quarter. I'm very excited to welcome all acquired companies to AMETEK. Each acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK as they help expand our product and technology offerings and highly attractive growth markets and applications including renewable energy development and the modernization of the Power group. In addition, our latest acquisition, Paragon Medical, which we closed in the middle of December, nicely expands our presence in the medical technology market. Paragon is a leading manufacturer specializing in highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Their product portfolio spans crucial medical applications and the reputation for quality and precision has earned on the trust of a diverse customer base, including top-tier medical device OEMs. Looking ahead to 2024. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust. As noted, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet and anticipate remaining active deploying capital and acquisitions. In addition to our acquisition strategy, AMETEK remains committed to making strategic investments in organic growth initiatives. In 2023, we invested an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives. And in 2024, we expect to invest another incremental $100 million. The majority of this investment will be within our research, development and engineering and sales and marketing functions. In the quarter, our vitality index, which reflects sales from new products introduced in the last 3 years was a very healthy 29%. Through these strategic investments and acquisitions, we have seen a steady transition of AMETEK's portfolio, with an expanded presence in secular growth markets and reduced exposures in more cyclical markets. This strategic evolution of the portfolio, combined with our proven operational acumen, positions AMETEK well for continued strong and sustained growth. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. For 2024, we expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.85, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up low double digits with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.60 per share, up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year of 2023 was outstanding. Our businesses delivered exceptional results with all elements of the AMETEK growth model, playing a key role in our success. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I appreciate your kind words at the top of the call. As Dave noted, I have made the decision to retire after 36 years with AMETEK, nearly eight of which I had the privilege of serving as Chief Financial Officer. I want to express my deepest gratitude and thanks to the entire AMETEK family for the incredible journey we've shared. It has been an honor to contribute to the tremendous growth and success of AMETEK. To Dave and the Board of Directors, thank you for your confidence in me. Your support and leadership have been invaluable. And to my colleagues, your dedication has been the driving force behind our share of success and I am truly thankful for the privilege of working closely with you. I look forward to remaining with the company as a senior adviser until April 2025 to ensure a seamless transition. I'm confident in Dalip's leadership and in the very strong and talented financial organization at AMETEK. Before I get into the results for the fourth quarter, Dalip would like to say a few words. Dalip?\nDalip Puri: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to meeting and working with all of you in the new future. I too want to express my thanks to Dave, to Bill, to the Board of Directors and the leadership team for their trust and confidence in me. It is an honor to serve as AMETEK's EVP and CFO and I'm very excited to lead AMETEK's incredible finance organization and to partner with Dave as we continue to deliver sustained and strong growth across our portfolio of businesses. I also want to express my thanks to Bill for his guidance and mentorship over the years and his commitment to a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Bill.\nBill Burke: Thank you, Dalip. Now on to the fourth quarter results. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2023 with outstanding operating performance leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2024. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.3 million, up $3 million from the prior year but unchanged at 1.5% of sales. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $7 million and as a percentage of sales were 1.5%, in line with 2022 levels. In 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales. Fourth quarter other income and expense was additional expense, $7 million compared to the fourth quarter 2022, driven by higher due diligence costs and lower pension income. For 2024, we expect other income and expense to be largely in line with 2023 levels. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, down from 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to statute expirations. For 2024, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $60 million in the fourth quarter and $136 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be approximately $160 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $92 million, and for the full year was $338 million. 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 17.2% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was superb with operating cash flow of record of $541 million, up 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record in the quarter, up 47% to $481 million with free cash flow conversion of 140% for the quarter. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.6 billion, up 58% versus the prior year and 122% of net income. For 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at year-end was $3.31 billion, up from $2.39 billion at the end of 2022 due largely to the Paragon acquisition in December. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $410 million. As Dave noted, during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $2 billion on the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. Our gross leverage was 1.5x at the end of 2023, up from 1.2x at the end of 2022, despite deploying approximately $2.25 billion on acquisitions during the year. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital and have approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2023, delivering strong growth and a high quality of earnings. We are well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024. Thank you once again, and now I'll turn it back to Kevin.\nKevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bill. Tanya, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks, good morning, and congrats, Bill. I wanted to first ask about the EMG business and the inventory normalization you're seeing there. Using a baseball analogy, what inning are we in with respect to that normalization? And when do you start to see inflection in organic orders within EMG. So if you can first maybe start by elaborating there? And then I have a follow-up.\nDavid Zapico: Sure. Sure, Matt. Maybe the first thing I want to do is -- and the outlook for 2024, Kevin told me that it may have not come through clearly. The diluted EPS for the year is $6.70 to $6.85. So that's just maybe a correction of what I had said before, if it didn't come through clearly. And now I'll get to your question, Matt. I mean we think that as we talked about the OEM parts of our business and we think that OEM destocking largely played out as we expected during Q4. We expect it to continue through the first half of the year. We're going to have some difficult comps in Q1 that will finish in Q2, and then we're going -- we're pretty good for the second half of the year, the way we're forecasting. So the -- again, we're working off our backlog right now. So it's not an immediate impact on revenue. But that destock will continue for the first half of the year, probably a bit more in Q1 than Q2, but we think will be good for the second half of the year. And it's already starting to happen. Some customers are having corrected their inventory levels, but it will continue through the first half of the year.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then can you review what you experienced in terms of price capture in '23 over '22 and what we should be thinking about in '24 and ultimately, what that price cost relationship looks like this year?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, sure. In the fourth quarter, price was about 5% of sales. And total inflation was about 3.5%. And when we transition to 2024, we really see inflation decreasing. So the time where we had very significant price increases to be at or above inflation is coming to an end. And we think pricing in 2024 would be about 3% across the entire portfolio, and we think inflation will be at about 2.5%. And so we maintain a positive spread. We have the product differentiation. We're creating value. You see our new products are selling very well. But we budgeted, I would say conservatively at 3% price capture during 2024.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just to add my congrats to Bill and Dalip, that is just the epitome of a distinguished career. So congratulations, and you'll be missed.\nBill Burke: I appreciate that, Deane. Thank you very much.\nDeane Dray: Dave, maybe you can take us through the key end markets and what you're seeing in terms of demand orders. And then what does Paragon do in terms of increasing your percent of medical? Is that in the range that you're comfortable with? And how do you expect to grow it from there?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, I'll start with that. With the Paragon acquisition, our portfolio has about 21% of sales into the med tech space. And we like to see that even larger. So we're still looking for acquisition in that space, and we plan to grow nicely within that space. And in fact, in the fourth quarter Q4, we were up mid-single digits with strong growth on our EMC and Roland businesses before we got Paragon integrated. So we're happy with the space. We want to continue to grow it, and we're still looking for deals in the space. Now I'll go around the horn, per se, I look at our various subsegments and end markets, and I'll start with our Process businesses, which are the largest component of our subsegments. And organic sales for Process were up low single digits in the quarter, completing a strong year that saw a broad-based growth across the segment. Growth was strongest within our CAMECA and Zygo businesses given their strong technology position with attractive research optics and medical applications. We look to 2024, we expect organic sales for the Process businesses to be up low single digits for the full year. So it's a low single digit in 2023, low single digits in 2024. Aerospace & Defense, strong fourth quarter to complete an excellent year. Growth was broad-based across all segments. Organic growth was up high single digits in the quarter. The growth was balanced across our commercial and aerospace businesses. And for 2024, we expect the organic sales of the Aerospace & Defense businesses to again be up high single digits with similar growth across commercial aerospace and defense. I'll move to our power businesses. They were up low double digits in the fourth quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of RTDS, UEI and Amplifier Research being offset by low single-digit organic sales growth. Our power businesses have been very active on the acquisition front with 3 highly strategic acquisitions over the past 15 months. These acquisitions broaden our exposure to attractive applications tied to renewable energy and modernization of the power grid. For 2024, we expect organic sales for the Power & Industrial businesses to be up low to mid-single digits. So there's some project -- that business is more impacted by certain projects, and we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to grow low to mid-single digits in 2024, some positive project evolutions. And then finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions, the segment was up mid-single digits in the quarter, with contributions from the acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering, being offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in organic sales. Results were in line with expectations with the impact of the normalization of inventory levels that Matt asked about across our OEM customer base, and they really continued in the quarter as expected, and we expect them to continue into 2024. In 2024, we expect the Automation & Engineered Solutions business to be up low single digits with stronger growth in the back half of the year as our customer base normalizes inventory levels than in the first half. So the second half for that sun single will be stronger growth in the first half. That's around the horn, Deane.\nDeane Dray: That's fabulous. I appreciate it. And just it's remarkable how we're seeing that momentum from '23 carry into your expectations for '24. And just one quick follow-up on the $100 million in growth investments? How does that stack up in terms of the product categories? Is there anything -- is it skewed in one way or the other? Is it evenly distributed? And where does new product vitality go from here? You're 29% this quarter, your 26% last quarter. Is there a target in mind?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I think anywhere between 20% and 30% is a good number. So that's what we've always said. And we started tracking this, it was back in the 15% range. So we certainly have made tremendous progress with our new product development efforts. In terms of where the $100 million comes from, it's really bottom up. So our business units put plans together. And if they want to go beyond what they invested in the prior year, we will pitch those plans and their budgeting and it's spread across the business. It goes at our best growth opportunities, and it's going to be about $100 million this year.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Congrats, Bill and look forward to working with you, Dalip. Just following on Deane's R&D question. The $100 million is incremental from the '23 that did $1 million that you did $100 million, as you push into this med tech space, does that number need to go up higher? I mean I'm just trying to think through the investment needed to continue those trajectories for those business?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. We're currently investing just under 5.5% of sales on research, development and engineering. And as we buy higher technology businesses, that number will increase modestly. I think this year, we expect to spend $400 million on RD&E, which is up a good healthy double-digit amount on the total R&D spend. So our R&D is a key part of our business. We have a lot of industrial technology products that we want to maintain leadership positions in. It allows us to get the pricing that we can get because we're providing unique value to our customers. I don't think you're going to see a big jump anywhere, but it's happening as we naturally evolve our portfolio to higher technology products.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. And just any color on M&A. You obviously had a record year last year, still in a good position from a leverage standpoint. What are you seeing or what are we expecting? I know you mentioned med tech is sort of a vertical you want to go into? Where are you seeing the greatest opportunities? Any difference in terms of size that we should be thinking through? Just any thoughts there.\nDavid Zapico: No, I think we're looking at the more traditional size deals. And we're also -- we have a few of the larger size deals in our pipeline, and I would characterize Paragon on the outer edge of the larger size. We're very happy with the 5 deals that we got done. We deployed $2.25 billion. We did it across our business in different parts of it. They were high-quality additions. They expanded our presence in attractive growth markets. We have a very clear path to add value to these companies. Each business has a strong technology position. The deals will meet our traditional financial hurdles. Remember, it's a 10% return on invested capital in year 3. In terms of our pipeline, our pipeline remains very strong. And we are actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of markets. As always, we'll remain disciplined when we do this. And I really think that we have the opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A element of our growth strategy, combined with our balance sheet and cash flow positions. I mean we excel and the markets are slowing or choppy because we had great OpEx and great M&A, and we see tremendous values in the market that we're tracking. The way the market is evolving, it's probably going to be 2, 3, 4 -- second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, with the bulk of the opportunities are. So -- but really, this year, the pipeline looks good, and we're optimistic.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Jeffrey Sprague. of Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just on deals, Dave. I think on Paragon, you're expecting most or the accretion to really kick in, in 2025, not so much '24. But can you just give us a little color on what is the EPS impact embedded in your guide for Paragon in '24 and the other deals also?\nDavid Zapico: Well, sure. Related to Paragon specifically, during the first half of the year, we're going to be doing some -- expect some muted growth for a couple of reasons. One, there is an inventory correction going on in the medtech market and we're going to look at the portfolio and potentially prove some less product -- less profitable product areas. So there's a whole process that we're going to go through during this first half. And -- but all that said, we're expecting the second half to be very strong because they got some new product introductions that are very exciting. But we continue to expect within the -- in our guidance is 8% to 10% accretion in 2024. And this is back-end loaded as we layer in the integration costs.\nBill Burke: Is that what clarifying? $0.08 to $0.10?\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes, $0.08 to $0.10. Yes. And then just drilling a little bit further into some of the end markets, thanks for kind of going and doing it around the world. But kind of the semi-related markets in particular, which have kind of been the vein of a lot of people that exist in here recently kind of looking for the bottom and the turn. Like what are you seeing in those markets? What do you see in the quarter specifically? And how does 2024 look?\nDavid Zapico: We have a little different dynamic in semiconductor, and I talked about it on a couple of past calls because we have the memory downturn that a lot of people are seeing. We saw that too. But at the same time, we have some exceptional technology in our CAMECA business. It's a next-generation technology that's really is in demand in just about all fabs. And we also have our Zygo business. We're one of the few companies that can manufacture EUV, extreme ultraviolet optics and semiconductor fabrication. So those are two growing dynamics. It's a good place to be. They were able to offset some of the weakness we had in the -- I'll call it, the core memory part of the portfolio. And for 2023, we ended up 10%. So it was a growing market for us. And for 2024, we expect to additionally grow another plus mid-single digit. So largely because of the technology, we were able to grow in '23, and we think we'll continue to grow in '24.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And, Bill, congratulations on your retirement. So just a few border lines for me for '24. The guidance for revenue growth of low double digits I've got high single digits coming in from M&A, obviously, mainly Paragon. Is that the right kind of ballpark about 9% coming in from M&A, which implies sort of 2%, 3% organic. Is that the right level?\nDavid Zapico: You're in the ballpark, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just anything to call out on incremental margins across both segments. We're coming off some pretty tough comps in EIG. So just curious, how we should think about maybe overall margins, but more importantly, core incremental margins.\nDavid Zapico: Are you talking about for 2024 or 2023?\nNigel Coe: 2024.\nDavid Zapico: 2024?\nNigel Coe: Yes.\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I mean we had a fantastic margin year in 2023 and margins were up. Core margins were up 200 basis points in the fourth quarter, reported margins are up 120 basis points. EIG had a great quarter. EMG, it was dilutive because of acquisitions. And when you peel away what was going on, they're actually up 100 basis points. So really good margins, really good incremental. And we think for 2024, they're going to moderate a bit. They're going to continue to grow them, but they're going to moderate a bit. And for 2024, we believe that core margins are going to be up 30 basis points. We think that the core incremental are going to be up about 30 basis points. And we have built on our model cost reductions and pricing and things like that, but the whole thing that's to the core margins being up 30 and the core incremental is up 30 basis points. When you look at as reported margins for the year, those will be down probably about 50 basis points due to acquisition dilution. So that's the whole story.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just quickly on geographies. You've gone through the end markets but just wondering if there's anything to call out in '24 geographically?\nDavid Zapico: Yes, I'll do a summary of Q4 geographically, so you know where we stand. And we had growth in the quarter led by the U.S. and Asia. So the U.S. has been strong all along. Asia is picking up a bit. The U.S. was up mid-single digits with notable strength in our Materials Analysis division and Aerospace & Defense, Europe was down high single digits, driven in part by our automation business. And Asia was up about a little under 10%, about 9% with strength in our Materials Analysis division and our Ultra Precision Technology division. We have a dynamic that was a little different than what's going on in the general marketplace. Our China sales were up 22% in Q4. So that -- they were up about 14%, 15% in the year, 22% in Q4. Strong growth in our Materials Analysis division and UPT. When we look into 2024, we think we'll grow in Asia, but we think China is going to moderate to more of a flattish market because there was some -- one of project businesses that we benefited from. So it's still going to be good for us, but we are seeing the broader impacts on the economy, and we think it will be flattish on an orders basis in 2024 in China, and we'll grow in Asia.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Scott Graham of Seaport Research Partners.\nScott Graham: Hi, good morning. Bill, congratulations on a great run. It's been a complete pleasure working with you. I hope you remain happy invest to your family. Thank you.\nBill Burke: Thank you very much, Scott. Appreciate it.\nScott Graham: I was hoping, Dave, you could go through the orders a bit for the quarter, both in total and organically?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. Sure. The -- let me make sure I'm looking at the right stuff here. Yes, the orders in total for the quarter we're up 16%. Now that was largely driven by the Paragon acquisition because the orders get booked as backlog the first when you acquire a business. So that 16% orders, EIG orders were up 3% and EMG orders were up 43%. And again, the EMG orders were driven by Paragon. Organically, the orders were minus 2%, and it translated into a book-to-bill of 1.10.\nScott Graham: And would you expect, Bill, that sometime in the first half, perhaps the second quarter that the orders may be really kind of flatten out for you organically and then start to progress into the second half?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I think in the first quarter, we have some pretty difficult comps. So I expect a similar trend with orders trailing sales. But then as we get out in the second half of the year, maybe even in the second quarter, I think the orders will outpace sales. Yes.\nScott Graham: Got it. Thank you. And then might just one other question. Within the guidance, I guess, I was a little bit surprised at the level of organic you're expecting in a good way. And it looks to me off of your summary that, that's stemming from the aerospace and defense businesses. Would you mind parsing out for the total company kind of what you're expecting in sort of Aerospace versus Defense this year and maybe tack on what the drivers are, particularly in commercial?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I mean the overall organic growth for the company is a low to mid-single-digit number, and that's going to be in both groups, EIG and EMG. And in terms of Aerospace, we think we're going to grow about the same level that we did this year at plus high single digits. And we have really good diversity in that business. And the military orders are strong, and the commercial OE aftermarket are strong, and the commercial OE are good, too. So we think largely the -- both the military and the total commercial markets are going to be up high single digits in 2024. Pretty optimistic about that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. So first question is just on growth into '24 and maybe even beyond on the growth algorithm. It seems like your expectations starting out the year is more price-led than volume. And I assume, obviously, some of the destock or channel that you talked about is holding that back. But as we get into 2H, are we looking at return to normal volume growth? And then maybe we're in place environment. I don't know if you have a bigger picture view on where pricing is going? Are we in more of a 3% world and as volume comes back, that kind of ticks up core as we exit the year? That's my first question.\nDavid Zapico: Yes. That very well could happen, Rob. I think the -- I think we're in a 3% pricing world. And I think our volume has the potential to be a little stronger in the second half than the first half. So that -- what you're saying is kind of how we're thinking about it. We've been pretty conservative in our second half outlook. But if there was something that could exceed it, it will be the second half volume. Sales volume organically.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Perfect. And then I wonder, just given the rise of med tech in the portfolio, if you could just give a general thought on your value add there. Is it different from anything in the core, general thoughts on core growth there. And then if the acquisition environment differs at all, if it's more white space, if it's more competing against others and deals? Just a couple of general thoughts there, if you would.\nDavid Zapico: Yes, we've been acquired some good medical businesses. I mean as we go back and look the Rauland business has been a fabulous winner for us and that business is growing in the market. And we made an EMC acquisition, and that business has been very successful. And that business is in the similar market that Paragon that gave us confidence. And it's -- they're classic AMETEK businesses. We win in the market based on technology, based on engineering. They're a little more OEM than end market. But basically, our whole EMG business is more OEM than end market. You have longer looked at your customers in terms of what you're going to be building in the future. So it's a pretty stable market. And we just think the growth in the case of Paragon over the next 3 years will be a little bit slower to get down on that gate because of some of the things that are going on. But we're pretty confident it's going to be a low double-digit grower over the next few years. So we think with those portfolio additions, they're going to grow just a bit greater than the rate of our base portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me? Hey, Bill, congratulations. Yes. So just a little bit more color. You -- I think other automation like short cycle companies expect second half rebound. Your comments sort of indicate something very similar. What kind of visibility do you have on that? And what gives you confidence that things are actually are going to turn in the second half? And I acknowledge that your view is very much consistent with what we hear from everybody else.\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I think that in that second half for Automation, in particular, we're conservative on the input that we're getting from our customers in the marketplace. And I think that for the entire segment, we're forecasting it to be up low single digits. So we're not out. If we just put in there what our customers are telling us it would be higher. So we've been -- as a bit of conservative that we placed in it. And it's largely from talking to customers and understanding their inventory levels and it's the typical work that we do to set a plan for the year. And -- it's -- we think the -- we'll see a positive second half as those orders, those backlogs are depleted.\nAndrew Obin: Excellent. And just maybe a follow-on building on that. You talked about sort of increasing investment, but are there business units that need to start expanding capacity, where are you broadly in capacity utilization? And finally, as you are expanding capacity, what are you going to do differently about your supply chain and where you are putting this capacity versus maybe pre-COVID?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I mean in terms of supply chain, we did a lot of work to eliminate the risks from China, and we did it actually before COVID. So we were well positioned during it. And I think the -- our supply chain is developing naturally around the different regions of the world and it's not as China-centric because of that. So that's 1 item. I think that in terms of capacity, we put significant capacity investments in over the past few years. We're a low CapEx business. And it's not -- we don't have to come to you and get away from our typical 2% of sales. We did it within our 2% of sales guideline. We put incremental capacity in our Mexican facilities. We put incremental capacity in our Malaysian facilities, we put incremental capacity in our Serbian facilities. So I think we're pretty -- we have an asset-light business model and we can usually ramp up pretty quickly, and we have the flexibility to reduce cost very quickly. So that's one of the advantages of the AMETEK model with our low CapEx environment. We can grow sales and adjust sales on the downside without big capacity investments without stringent investments when we downsize. So we're in excellent position to grow and we've done all that work over the past few years or so, I feel really confident that we're going to be able to keep up with the growth through the next growth cycle.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brett Linzey of Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Hey. Good morning, all. Congratulations to everyone. I wanted to come back to the pruning comment on Paragon. So you indicated you're running down some of the less profitable areas makes sense. I guess in the context of the broader portfolio, as you continue to shift towards this higher growth, higher-margin areas, is there more pruning to do on the other side in the context of the total AMETEK portfolio?\nDavid Zapico: This printing process is something that we do with just about every new acquisition. So this is not new. And Paragon is a little bigger business and we're going to be careful with it. And but it's something that we do all the time. So all M&A deals will go through this process. Paragon is going to be going through in the first half. And we look at our own portfolio and we do that kind of thing all the time. So yes, it can continue, and we're pretty good at that portfolio rationalization things. Do you have another question, Brett?\nBrett Linzey: Yes. And then just a second question on OpEx versus CapEx. I guess as you look at the customer spending environment for this year, and if you were to hone in on just those capital spending intensive businesses, have the planning assumptions or the tone changed in the last few months in that capital -- the capital spending type businesses at all?\nDavid Zapico: In the U.S., there's a record number of projects from clean energy, power grid, semiconductor, they're just at a different level than they've been before. And a lot of that is from the government spending and backing. So that's largely continued. And at some point, it's going to provide an optimistic playing field for a lot of people in the industry. And I don't think we have that kind of upside built into our model right now, but it's -- there's planning going on with those projects right now. And that particular dynamic about the U.S. spending is driving the typical projects. So we're tracking to a very high number.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Giordano at TD Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys. How are you doing? So a lot of companies are seeing -- have seen orders kind of decline organically for multiple quarters now. And predominantly, it's all attributed to inventory adjustment and supply chain. And Harvey, anyone has said anything about underlying conditions not being fine. So just curious if one, if you would agree with that. And two, if it worries you that everyone is seeing order declines and no one is saying anything is happening other than supply chain adjustments.\nDavid Zapico: It really doesn't because it's 100-year pandemic. I mean you saw what happened. The supply chains were broken. People put inventory in place. And as I just got done talking to the last call, the project business is so strong. So we have a similar view. We're our businesses in health care, aerospace and defense, power and energy are performing well. They have a lot of projects. And we just think that we're going to work off the inventory and then they're going to be a return to more typical growth for the industrial market. I mean, at the end of the day, though, nobody knows. And if we run into a recession, we have good muscle member in that area. So we'll be able to react as we always react and we can run our business appropriately. And in fact, select businesses have already been doing that during '23 margins in our automation business, those people did a great job of removing excess costs from the business. So we're pretty good at reacting. But right now, we don't see that. We see the inventory being worked off, mainly in our OEM businesses and looking toward the future, we're optimistic with the number of new projects we have in the future.\nOperator: Next question is going to come from Steve Bar with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSteve Barger: Hey, good morning. For the semi business, you mentioned your exposure to optics, which is great, but does that extend to advanced packaging applications, which are expected to show strong growth rates for the next couple of years? And if not, is getting specific exposure there? Something the team is looking at for M&A?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. We have a little bit of exposure to advanced packaging, but it's spread across the business in different places, we're selling some components. So that's one of the items that our M&A teams are looking at, and we have exposure, but we'd like to have more.\nSteve Barger: Okay. And then on the memory side, it seems like pricing is improving finally, and maybe fab utilization rates are starting to improve a bit. Is that translating into product inflection for you yet? Or is there still inventory that needs to be cleared on the memory side specifically?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. I think that market on the memory side, that market is pretty much bottomed. So I don't think there's -- when that ticks up, there's going to be a -- I think that's immediately going to flow to the bottom line. I think the inventory there is mainly cleared out.\nOperator: And our next question will be coming from Rob Mason of Baird.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good morning, and I\u2019ll offer my congratulations as well, Bill. Dave, a lot of questions have been asked. I just circle back to the process business. You talked about that going to be up low single digits for the year. There's a lot in there from a business mix and market standpoint. Could you maybe speak to anything that could outperform that low single digits or anything that would stand out? And just for clarity, say what is the actual process industry exposure there now?\nDavid Zapico: Yes. The process is a broader look at our process and analytical instruments business and the specific process industry would be more the process and analytical instruments business, which is a good part of it. And I think that what you're going to see there is our energy businesses are perhaps -- they grew nicely in Q4, and they have a good outlook for 2024. I think we sell a lot of business to Asia and China is a -- I told you we talked about it being flat. So that's something that we're concerned within the year for process. But as long as we keep developing state-of-the-art projects that are unmatched by our competitors, we're going to be fine in process. And as evidenced by our CAMECA, Zygo, broader UPT, broader MAD sales. So it's the research market. It's the optics market that are driving the business, and there are some medical applications in our rolling business that are in that segment. So there's a mix of different end market drivers. But when you look at the thing in total, we're calling it up low single digits this year. And again, the international parts of the business will be weaker than the U.S. parts.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you again, Tanya, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for the conference call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the financial results for the quarter, it is with mixed emotions that I share the news of changes in our financial leadership, which we announced on January 16. After an outstanding 36-year career at AMETEK, our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Burke, has decided to embark on a well-deserved retirement effective April 2, 2024. Bill's tremendous leadership of our finance organization and his strategic guidance has been instrumental in AMETEK's long-term growth and success. His legacy is deeply woven into the fabric of our organization, and we express our heartfelt gratitude for his exceptional contributions. In light of this transition, I'm delighted to announce the appointment of Dalip Puri as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dalip, currently serving as Senior Vice President, Operational Finance, brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role. Dalip joined AMETEK in 2017 as Treasurer and subsequently took on the role of Group Controller, providing financial oversight for over half of AMETEK's businesses before transitioning into his current role of Operational Finance. Dalip's leadership of key financial initiatives at AMETEK, along with a proven track record make him the natural choice to lead our financial organization into the future. I'm confident that under Dalip's leadership, our financial organization will continue to thrive contributing significantly to the success of AMETEK. To ensure a seamless transition, Bill will stay on as a senior adviser until April 2025. Thank you, Bill, for your exceptional service, and congratulations Dalip. I'm truly excited about the future. Now let me turn to this quarter's results. AMETEK delivered exceptional performance in the fourth quarter, delivering record results and outstanding operational execution, leading to results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we set records for sales, operating income, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flow. We also ended the quarter with record backlog. Furthermore, in the quarter, we successfully deployed over $2 billion on strategic acquisitions, enhancing our portfolio with the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. These results cap a record year for acquisitions and underscore the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our businesses and the success of our organic growth initiatives. AMETEK's continued success is also the result of the dedicated efforts of our global employees. I want to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your efforts and significant contributions in 2023. Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.73 billion, up 6.5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was approximately 1.5%. Acquisitions added 4 points and foreign currency added 1 point. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.53 billion which is up 10% from the start of 2023. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was outstanding, with robust margin expansion and strong incremental margins. Operating income in the quarter was a record $445 million, a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up an impressive 120 basis points from the prior year while core margins were up 200 basis points in the quarter. This strong margin expansion reflects the strength and flexibility of our operating model and the quality and differentiation of our businesses. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $526 million, up 8% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 30.4%. Our strong growth and operating performance led to robust cash generation with free cash flow up 47% in the quarter to a record $481 million. This tremendous operating performance led to record diluted earnings per share of $1.68, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments grew by an excellent quarter with strong sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.24 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added three points with currency accounting for the balance. EIG sales growth in the fourth quarter was strongest across our Aerospace & Defense businesses and our Materials Analysis division. EIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and exceptional margin expansion. Operating income was a record $359 million, up 17% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 29%, up and outstanding 250 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with strong performance despite the continued impact from the normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $495 million, up 6% versus the prior year, driven by the contributions from recent acquisitions. EMG's fourth quarter operating income was $112 million, while operating margin -- operating income margins were 22.7% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EMG core margins were up 100 basis points versus the prior year. Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2023, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.6 billion, up 7% from 2022. Organic sales increased 4%, with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. Operating income for 2023 was $1.7 billion, up 14% and operating margins were 25.9% for the full year, with margins up 150 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $2 billion with EBITDA margins are very strong 30.5%. In full year 2023, earnings were $6.38 per diluted share up 12% versus the prior year. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year highlights the strength of the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are strategically aligned with diverse and attractive markets while our organic growth initiatives position us for sustained long-term growth. Our distributed operating structure empowers our businesses to execute on our growth strategies and quickly adapt to evolving market dynamics. This structure is a cornerstone of the success and navigating throughout different economic cycles. Furthermore, our asset-light business model and strong operational execution result in exceptional cash flow generation. This robust cash flow, coupled with our strong balance sheet, provides AMETEK with plenty of firepower to support our growth initiatives and to deploy on acquisitions. Speaking of acquisitions, we were very active in 2023, successfully deploying approximately $2.25 billion on five acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Amplify Research and Paragon Medical in the fourth quarter. I'm very excited to welcome all acquired companies to AMETEK. Each acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK as they help expand our product and technology offerings and highly attractive growth markets and applications including renewable energy development and the modernization of the Power group. In addition, our latest acquisition, Paragon Medical, which we closed in the middle of December, nicely expands our presence in the medical technology market. Paragon is a leading manufacturer specializing in highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Their product portfolio spans crucial medical applications and the reputation for quality and precision has earned on the trust of a diverse customer base, including top-tier medical device OEMs. Looking ahead to 2024. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust. As noted, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet and anticipate remaining active deploying capital and acquisitions. In addition to our acquisition strategy, AMETEK remains committed to making strategic investments in organic growth initiatives. In 2023, we invested an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives. And in 2024, we expect to invest another incremental $100 million. The majority of this investment will be within our research, development and engineering and sales and marketing functions. In the quarter, our vitality index, which reflects sales from new products introduced in the last 3 years was a very healthy 29%. Through these strategic investments and acquisitions, we have seen a steady transition of AMETEK's portfolio, with an expanded presence in secular growth markets and reduced exposures in more cyclical markets. This strategic evolution of the portfolio, combined with our proven operational acumen, positions AMETEK well for continued strong and sustained growth. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. For 2024, we expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.85, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up low double digits with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.60 per share, up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year of 2023 was outstanding. Our businesses delivered exceptional results with all elements of the AMETEK growth model, playing a key role in our success. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. I appreciate your kind words at the top of the call. As Dave noted, I have made the decision to retire after 36 years with AMETEK, nearly eight of which I had the privilege of serving as Chief Financial Officer. I want to express my deepest gratitude and thanks to the entire AMETEK family for the incredible journey we've shared. It has been an honor to contribute to the tremendous growth and success of AMETEK. To Dave and the Board of Directors, thank you for your confidence in me. Your support and leadership have been invaluable. And to my colleagues, your dedication has been the driving force behind our share of success and I am truly thankful for the privilege of working closely with you. I look forward to remaining with the company as a senior adviser until April 2025 to ensure a seamless transition. I'm confident in Dalip's leadership and in the very strong and talented financial organization at AMETEK. Before I get into the results for the fourth quarter, Dalip would like to say a few words. Dalip? Thank you, Dalip. Now on to the fourth quarter results. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2023 with outstanding operating performance leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2024. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.3 million, up $3 million from the prior year but unchanged at 1.5% of sales. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $7 million and as a percentage of sales were 1.5%, in line with 2022 levels. In 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales. Fourth quarter other income and expense was additional expense, $7 million compared to the fourth quarter 2022, driven by higher due diligence costs and lower pension income. For 2024, we expect other income and expense to be largely in line with 2023 levels. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, down from 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to statute expirations. For 2024, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $60 million in the fourth quarter and $136 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be approximately $160 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $92 million, and for the full year was $338 million. 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 17.2% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was superb with operating cash flow of record of $541 million, up 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record in the quarter, up 47% to $481 million with free cash flow conversion of 140% for the quarter. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.6 billion, up 58% versus the prior year and 122% of net income. For 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at year-end was $3.31 billion, up from $2.39 billion at the end of 2022 due largely to the Paragon acquisition in December. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $410 million. As Dave noted, during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $2 billion on the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. Our gross leverage was 1.5x at the end of 2023, up from 1.2x at the end of 2022, despite deploying approximately $2.25 billion on acquisitions during the year. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital and have approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2023, delivering strong growth and a high quality of earnings. We are well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024. Thank you once again, and now I'll turn it back to Kevin. I appreciate that, Deane. Thank you very much. Is that what clarifying? $0.08 to $0.10? Thank you very much, Scott. Appreciate it."

I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, highlighted by outstanding operational execution, superb margin expansion, strong cash flows and earnings ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for operating income, operating margins, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flows. Given these strong results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have again, increased our earnings guidance for the full year. We have also been very active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of United Electronics Industries and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Amplifier Research. Today, we also announced the signing of a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Paragon Medical, a highly attractive acquisition, which broadens our exposure in the Medical Technology space. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly. Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were $1.62 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was flat. Acquisitions added four points in the quarter and foreign currency added one point. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96. We ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.4 billion, near record levels and down a modest 2% sequentially. Our backlog is up 5% from last year's third quarter and up 23% or $640 million from the end of 2021. AMETEK's operating performance in the third quarter was exceptional. Operating income in the quarter was a record $438 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 27% in the quarter, up a sizable 220 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $511 million, up 10% over the prior year, with EBITDA margin, an impressive 31.5%. Operating cash flow was up 45% in the quarter to a record $473 million. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.64 per diluted share, up 13% versus the third quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.58. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered impressive operating performance, with continued strong and broad-based sales growth. Sales for EIG were $1.14 billion in the quarter, up 8% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added 3.5% and foreign currency added a point. EIG's organic sales growth remains broad-based and reflects our leading position across attractive market segments and the impact of our organic growth initiatives. Growth in the quarter was particularly strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses as well as in our Zygo, Spectro and CAMECA businesses. Third quarter operating income was a record $335 million, up 23% versus the prior year. And operating margins were a record 29.5% in the quarter, up an impressive 360 basis points from the prior year. Tremendous work by our EIG businesses in the third quarter. The Electromechanical Group also delivered solid operating performance in the quarter, despite the impact of normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base. EMG's third quarter sales were $487 million, down 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales down 8% in the quarter. Acquisitions added four points and foreign currency added two points. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $128 million, down 7% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's third quarter operating margins were a very solid 26.2%. Our performance in the third quarter and thus far in 2023, reflects the unique value inherent in the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are aligned with diverse and attractive growth markets, while our organic growth initiatives continue to position us for long-term sustainable growth. Our distributed operating structure provides our businesses with the ability to execute their growth strategy and the flexibility to react quickly to changing market conditions. And our asset-light business model and strong operational execution drive outstanding cash flow generation, which we redeploy on value-enhancing acquisitions. This strong cash flow and our robust balance sheet are key differentiators for AMETEK in this higher interest rate environment. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. As noted, we have been very active in managing a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We are pleased to welcome our most recent acquisitions, United Electronic Industries and Amplifier Research. I'm pleased that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical. I will provide some more color on each of these businesses, starting with Paragon Medical. Paragon Medical is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and instruments serving applications, including orthopedics, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and drug delivery solutions. Paragon's broad product portfolio of single-use and implantable components are sold to a diverse blue-chip customer base of leading medical device OEMs. Paragon is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK. It expands our presence in the med tech space and provides us with access to attractive new market segments with strong growth rates. We are acquiring Paragon in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Paragon has annual sales of approximately $500 million and is headquartered in Pierceton, Indiana. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Now switching to United Electronic Industries, or UEI, which we acquired in August. UEI is a leading provider of ruggedized test, measurement, simulation and control solutions. UEI's custom products cater to diverse data acquisition needs from hardware in the loop testing, to aircraft simulators and automated testing systems and mission-critical applications. With a strong presence in the defense, aerospace nuclear power generation and semiconductor, UEI nicely complements AMETEK's Power Systems and Instruments division, significantly expanding our data acquisition capabilities. UEI has annual sales of approximately $35 million and is based in Norwood, Massachusetts. Next, Amplifier Research is a leading provider of innovative RF and microwave solutions. Its equipment is used for electromagnetic compatibility testing within the defense, industrial, automotive, medical and communication sectors. Amplifier Research is an outstanding strategic acquisition and complementary fit with our existing compliance test solutions business. Their technical capability has broaden our RF instrumentation and testing portfolio. Amplifier Research is a growing business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for electric vehicle research, development and testing. Amplifier Research is based in Souderton, PA and has annual sales of approximately $60 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains very solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital in the coming quarters.  AMETEK also remains committed to investing in our businesses to help position them for long-term sustainable organic growth. In 2023, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in these growth initiatives, including our new product development efforts where our businesses continue to develop highly differentiated technologies to help solve our customers' most complex challenges. In the quarter, our vitality index, which measures sales from products introduced over the prior three years, was a healthy 26%. As a complement to our internal new product development efforts, our ORTEC business recently acquired a Small Technology company, innoRIID, to help broaden their technology capabilities in the Radiation Detection market. InnoRIID, both cutting-edge technology expertise and an exceptional product development team, known for their innovative solutions having developed specialized Artificial Intelligence algorithms, for radiation detection in a range of Nuclear Security, Research, Health and Medical Applications. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, with strong performance in the third quarter and a positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are, once again, raising our earnings guidance. For the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up mid-to-high single-digits, and we continue to expect organic sales to be up mid-single-digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.31 to $6.33, up approximately 11% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $6.18 to $6.26 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single-digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.63 per share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's third quarter results for 2023 were outstanding, with strong growth across our long-cycle businesses, record operating performance and strong acquisition activity. Our businesses continue to excel, driven by our differentiated technology solutions serving diverse and growing markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging economic environments, while actively deploying capital to enhance shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned for long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nWilliam Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter, with exceptional operating performance, robust margin expansion and strong cash flows. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million essentially unchanged from the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's third quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Other income and expense was a headwind of $9 million in the quarter, due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.7%, down from 19% in the third quarter of 2022, due to improved utilization of tax credits. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $29 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $330 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per share. Operating working capital in the third quarter was 19.1% of sales. Cash flow was excellent in the quarter with outstanding growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $473 million, up 45% versus the third quarter of 2022, while free cash flow was also a record at $444 million, up 49% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 131% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion. Total debt at September 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $842 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.6 times, leaving us with significant available cash and financial capacity to deploy on strategic acquisitions. As Dave has noted, we've been very active. During the third quarter, we deployed approximately $150 million on the acquisitions of UEI and innoRIID. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $105 million on the acquisition of Amplifier Research. Also subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical for $1.9 billion, which would be our largest acquisition to-date. Following the acquisition of Paragon, we would still have significant financial capacity with approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities available to support our growth initiatives. In summary, AMETEK had exceptional results in the third quarter. We achieved significant margin expansion and delivered high-quality earnings. Our strong position in key market segments, coupled with a very strong backlog and exceptional operating capabilities, positions us well for continued success. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Abigail, could we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey, congrats on all the M&A successes here. Maybe we can start with Paragon. It looks right in your wheelhouse, precision medical robotics. If you could provide some color on the company in terms of like what percent are consumables? We're really like seeing all those one use applications. So consumables, comment on margins and growth, if you could, please?\nDave Zapico: Yes. Sure. I'll give you my view of Paragon. As you stated, the leading provider of highly engineered medical components and instruments. When you look at the key market drivers of this acquisition, you have the aging population, the demographic shifts, you also have procedure innovation, where the minimally invasive procedures are becoming more percentages of surgeries, and they do a great job with that. And also in this market, there's a continuing trend toward outsourcing the OEMs. And they want to -- the OEMs want to accelerate their time to market, and Paragon is really well positioned with significant new product wins in this space. It serves specialty applications. I talked about the orthopedics, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and drug delivery. Orthopedics is the largest, but they're strong positions in each of the applications. Now, the portfolio is one of your questions, consisted of single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable components, and about 40% of the business is recurring in nature. So the single-use and consumables surgical instruments are about 40% of the revenue. So we really like that. As a blue-chip customer base, over 600 programs, with diverse sources of revenue, about 85% of the business is on sole-source programs. It's a very, very sticky business. When you combine the regulatory environment with lengthy approval processes and the capabilities of Paragon, there's high switching costs. It's a business that has unique value to its customer base. We did a lot of surveys in the market, and they're the highest quality provider. They have excellent customer service. A differentiator for them is their design and development capability. And I really considered a true partner by their customers. And when I look at this from -- that's about Paragon, when I look at what it does for AMETEK, it increases our med tech exposure now to over 20%. It's one of the goals we've been trying to achieve. It adds about $500 million in revenue to EMG, and that revenue is -- comes from Paragon, which is a secular low double-digit grower. It really fits our business model with the highly engineered products that provide unique value to customers. It's a growing, profitable business that provides multiple avenues of growth. And there's really an opportunity for us to improve margins by applying the AMETEK growth model. It's already a profitable business, but there's plenty of room for us to apply the AMETEK growth model and expand margins. Paragon will benefit from the AMETEK's global infrastructure for sure, and we like the management team. They're highly talented team, and we're excited about what we can accomplish together. And importantly, the deal economics meant AMETEK's traditional dealers, and this is on a large deployment of capital. So, our return on invested capital orders are met by this deal. And we paid about 15 times TTM EBITDA for the business. So we're very excited for the business. It's a good business for us. We've been looking at these businesses for some time and a universal excitement amongst Paragon and AMETEK.\nDeane Dray: All right. That was a great overview, and you hit all the key questions on the consumables, margins and growth. So it sounds like a great story. And if I could just -- on a follow-up question on EMG. So we're seeing destocking all over the sector in biopharma and med tech. Be interested in hearing from you, besides the destocking, is there any kind of read-through on the end markets in those businesses? Are you seeing any slowing there? And look, no one's getting -- no one has a crystal ball here in terms of how long you think this lasts, but I'd love to hear your expectation on the duration of this inventory normalization. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Sure, Deane, great questions. For the quarter, we grew our top line 5% on a mid-single-digit guide. Our revenue was in line with the guide. The acquisition performed a bit better. And we maintained, as I said, our full year sales guide mid-to-high single-digits and organic growth of mid-single-digits. To maintain that organic guide for the full year, our Aerospace and Defense business is stronger and our automation is weaker. And they're offsetting. That's one of the benefits of the AMETEK portfolio. And specifically in terms of Q3 revenue, we saw faster destocking in our automation businesses than we anticipated. So that's what we saw there. And we expect the destocking to continue through the end of the year. In terms of your question is, is it a, destock or a downturn? It's very difficult dynamic environment right now and lots of uncertainties, with the geopolitical risk, the interest rate increases. They're factoring in, for sure. But from what we see, this is largely an inventory correction. And demand looks constructive, with many new projects in the offing and the projects are not being delayed or canceled. Our Aerospace and Defense looks solid. Our Medical looks solid, significant projects and semiconductor, clean energy, power grid. So we remain positive post-destocking. And we think that destocking will continue through the end of the year. And in terms of 2024, we're going to sit down with our teams and understand what's going on. But in general, we're constructive.\nDeane Dray: That's all really helpful. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Hi, Matt.\nMatt Summerville: Dave, your EIG margin this quarter really moved into a new ZIP code for AMETEK. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the key drivers as you just think about the sequential performance, right, Rev flat, profitability up $28 million on the OP line as well as kind of the year-over-year dynamics, so maybe if you can just kind of flesh all of that out, that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Sure, Matt. I mean if you'll go back and look at my last quarter or two, I told you EIG, was gaining momentum, and the momentum certainly showed up in Q3. We had an excellent operating quarter. I mean EIG margins were up 360 basis points, driven by high contribution leverage on the growth. We really had excellent price cost. We had strongly performing acquisitions and it all came together to put up record margins.\nMatt Summerville: And then, just as a follow-up. With respect to Paragon, I appreciate the stats you shared. Is there any way to kind of parse out what you think year one cash EPS accretion would look like? And then what the expected closure timing might be for that? Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Great questions, Matt. We think the closure -- it's dependent on regulatory approval, but nothing atypical. But we think -- we'll get the approvals and close sometime in the first quarter. In terms of year one, yes, we'll have a very modest cash EPS accretion. It's going to be impacted by purchase accounting, integration costs, realignment cost to financing costs, we'll pay with this with a mix of cash and debt. And -- but we'll have very strong accretion in year two. And we're excited about getting the business under our wing, improving the business and delivering and we're very excited.\nMatt Summerville: Just real quick, Dave. So you're not planning to non-GAAP those items out, you're just going to run them through the P&L then?\nDave Zapico: We'll make that decision at the time. Historically, we have not broken them out, but with the amount of acquisition activity that we have. It may make sense to do that. We haven't made a decision yet.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. \nDave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Just want to go back to your comments on automation. If I recall, that's typically a canary in the coal mine. But it seems from your comments what I'm reading through, I just want to clarify that it just seems to be more industry destocking for you in that market? Or was it something that -- I want to make sure I understand.\nDave Zapico: Yes. We think it's destocking. We think it's destocking. And the destocking last through the year-end. And -- but post destocking, we remain constructive. We are -- that business automation sells to a lot of markets and the health care part of that market is not doing well right now and some of the other exposures, but we think it's clearly destocking.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then on growth investments, keeping to the $100 million, how should we be thinking about into 2024? Is it something that you think there could be a raise there? And then just even with Paragon, what that R&D? I think you talked about the design piece of it being very -- a big part of that, how does design in R&D? Is it higher than the typical AMETEK? How should we be thinking about?\nDave Zapico: I think you should think about Paragon is matching the AMETEK profile.\nAllison Poliniak: Got it. And then organic investments as we kind of look to 2024 is...\nDave Zapico: Yes. I mean we're going to sit down with each of our teams, discuss 2024 over the next six weeks. We're going to review each of the individual businesses. We do deep dives, as you know, into what they are seeing in their niches, their market dynamics, growth opportunities, cost reduction opportunities, and we want to go through that -- these meetings before there's any commentary in 2024. We'll tell you in early February. But -- so in terms of talking about next year, we'll have the typical things like we expect price to offset inflation and CapEx will be about 2% of sales and things like that. But we're going to defer from talking about the overall plan until we get to meet with our teams and understand at a detailed level.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Allison.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Good morning, Dave. Just to come back to Paragon, maybe one more time. Maybe somebody else will come at it again. I just kind of want to understand the -- maybe the profit improvement plan going forward. Because it looks like rough math right, margins, EBITDA margin is 25% or so. You're doing 800 to 1,000 bps better now than that in EIG. When you talk about kind of the aspirations for the business and the cost cutting and other opportunities, is that the sort of Zip code and margin improvement we should be thinking about here? And if so, over kind of how long a period of time?\nDave Zapico: Yes. That is the Zip code and it's over time. And we're going to build a plan with the management team and show them all the resources that AMETEK has and some of our business processes. But what you're talking about is in the Zip code of what we have planned.\nJeffrey Sprague: And just to elaborate a little bit more on how this fits. Is there a kind of a commercial or operational synergy with other parts of the business? Or should we just think of this as an interesting, healthy kind of stand-alone business that drops into the portfolio?\nDave Zapico: We have an existing business in our EMG business. It's about a $200 million business. It's -- or called our engineered medical components. So we're familiar with these segments. There's completely different end markets, but think about that as additive to that existing position, but in a greater scale.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then maybe just one last one from me. The med tech world has been a little rocky here the last couple of years, procedures post-COVID everything. You characterized it as a double-digit secular grower. But are they kind of sitting in a little bit of a trough here impacted by those sorts of forces? Or maybe just kind of the...\nDave Zapico: Not really. They're growing nicely. I mean you have the market growth that they're benefiting from, and they happen to be in the fastest areas. They've deployed their resources well and they're benefiting from the faster fastest growth areas. The -- there's -- they're winning new business on new programs, it's pretty substantial. And we did surveys on these businesses, and this is a really good business in terms of their capability and how they take care of their customers, and they're definitely winning share. So, it's going to be a low double-digit grower for the next few years, and a lot of that's programmed in. Now that's the way we're looking at. There's going to be ups and downs as we go throughout the years, but this is a solid business with really good growth prospects.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Congrats and good luck with it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open \nScott Graham: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking minute here. Nice quarter.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Scott. Thank you.\nScott Graham: You just -- a couple ideas filled what was the working capital percent last year?\nWilliam Burke: Give me one second on that.\nScott Graham: Sure. Sure. I'll just -- I'll ask another one.\nWilliam Burke: I got it. It was 18.4.\nScott Graham: 18.4. Okay. Thanks. And then the $1.5 billion of availability, just maybe walk us through there. That is net of Paragon, I assume? And is that like an assumption at about 2.5 times leverage?\nWilliam Burke: No, that's the amount of cash and availability under our revolver post-Paragon. The leverage post-Paragon would only be about 1.5 times EBITDA at the gross level. So substantial \u2026\nScott Graham: Okay.\nWilliamBurke: --financial flexibility as well as we're still well under-levered I would say. And as Dave has talked about, lots of other opportunities available to us as we look to continue the acquisition strategy. So again, it's always finding the right businesses for the AMETEK portfolio. It is not capital constrained.\nScott Graham: Right. Right. Yes, that's how you do that as well.\nDave Zapico: Other way to make that--\nScott Graham: I guess--\nDave Zapico: Other way to make that--\nScott Graham: Sure.\nDave Zapico: Other way to make that, as Bill said, post-Paragon, we have 1.5 leverage, we wanted to take at up to 2.5 leverage, which is we've been there before, and that's not a high number for all. We can spend $2.6 billion on acquisitions, above and beyond Paragon. So we're in the M&A game, and our pipeline looks really good. And we have the balance sheet to be able to execute on it and the capability to integrate these businesses.\nScott Graham: Thank you for that. I appreciate it. When you are looking at deals these days in this interest rate environment, you're obviously funding them off of a lot of balance sheet liquidity and admittedly, maybe now higher rates off of the revolver. But are you impute an interest rate that is kind of more market-oriented when you make these decisions?\nDave Zapico: Yes. Our models use current borrowing rates as part of that decision-making process.\nScott Graham: Got it. Thank you. Last question is the typical one, Dave, would you mind kind of maybe unbundling on the four divisions?\nDave Zapico: Sure, Scott, I'll walk around the business. I'll start with our Process business. And -- overall, sales for Process were up mid-single-digits, at low single-digit organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Navitar. And demand across our Process markets remains solid. Our products and technologies are well aligned with important secular growth trends like the energy transition and health care. Growth in the quarter was strongest across these end-markets, while our high-end optics business in Zygo continues to perform very well, with strong demand for our custom optical solutions. And for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Process businesses. Going to Aerospace & Defense Next. Aerospace & Defense continues to perform well. Organic sales were up low-double digits in the quarter. Growth remains strong and broad-based across our A&D sub-segments. Our growth in the quarter was strongest in our defense businesses, while commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses also grew at healthy levels. Given this strong performance, we now expect sales for Aerospace & Defense to increase mid-teens, on a percentage basis for the full year. In Power & Industrial, those businesses delivered solid results in the third quarter, with overall sales up mid-teens. This growth was driven by a low single-digit organic sales growth and the contribution from the acquisition of RTDS technologies. We saw the strongest growth in the quarter across our renewable Energy and Power Simulation businesses, including RTDS. Our Power businesses are well positioned to benefit from long-term investments required to modernize the electric power grid and build-out of the renewable energy infrastructure globally. And for all of 2023, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Power business. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. Overall sales for AE&S, were down mid-single-digits in the quarter, with contributions from the acquisition of Bison Engineering, being more than offset by a low double-digit decrease in organic sales. As we expected, the impact from normalization of inventory levels, which we talked about earlier, across our OEM customer base, combined with the challenging prior year comparisons, created a short-term headwind for our OEM exposed businesses. We believe underlying demand is solid. As we talked about earlier, and across our diverse Automation & Engineered Solutions markets, we remain constructive. But we do expect, as we said before, the inventory normalization is going to recur throughout the OEM customer base will continue through the end of the year. And now for the full year, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be down mid-single-digits versus the prior year. So that's all for the subsegment commentary here, Scott.\nScott Graham: Thanks very much. \nDave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the deal, deals even. Okay. So good morning. Can you hear me?\nDave Zapico: Yes. We can hear you Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Good. I couldn't hear you. Okay. So maybe you could do the same process geographically, talk about what you're seeing by geography. I'd be curious about Europe and China. And also, you gave some perspective on business performance. Maybe you could talk about -- maybe just for a final point on 4Q, maybe talk about core growth and acquisition and contribution for 4Q?\nDave Zapico: Okay. Q4 and geography. Okay. I'll go across the geographies. We had continued solid growth in the US, with the international slowing a bit. So I'll unpack that a bit. The US was up mid-single-digits, with notable strength in our process business. Europe was down low single-digits, notable strength in process and our aerospace business, but weakness in automation. You mentioned China. Our China exposure was down 3%. Strong growth in process weakness in automation. And overall, Asia was down about 10%. So China did better than overall Asia, kind of about 9% of sales. So again, up in the US, slowing in international markets. And the second question you asked was on Q4 and the guide for Q4. And our sales will be up mid-single-digits. We'll grow in revenue. There are two factors impacting the earnings in Q4. One of them is a higher tax rate. And the second one is there's some acquisition, integration costs and they're related to the deals we completed. But we're very confident in our guide for Q4.\nNigel Coe: I'm sorry, David, what is the core growth for 4Q?\nDave Zapico: Core growth for Q4 was low to mid-single-digits.\nNigel Coe: Okay. So that's obviously acceleration from 3Q. What's driving that acceleration?\nDave Zapico: I think we're seeing some good demand on the EIG side from the typical year-end selling -- year-end sales that we typically get of capital spending, plus the EIG business is performing well. So our aerospace and our process businesses are performing well, and that's what driving the organic sales in Q4 to be higher than the organic sales in Q3.\nNigel Coe: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just one more for me. So obviously, Paragon, big deal. You've posed another smaller deal. You sound really bullish on the outlook as well. So it seems like the cut line is still pretty fertile. I mean are we seeing here a change in behavior from sellers that we see more willing sellers? Are we seeing any change in sort of multiples here? Any color on the market would be helpful.\nDave Zapico: Yes, I think it's a little choppy in the market and people are reevaluating. And the interest rates are higher. So financing that debt on a continuing organization may be a challenge. And as I said, in the beginning of the year, our pipeline is strong. I would categorize our pipeline right now is very strong. We have a lot of attractive candidates we're looking at. And I'm just bullish on being able to differentiate AMETEK's performance over the next 12 to 24 months with our OpEx and our M&A.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open \nChristopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. \nDave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Glynn: I want to keep it going on Paragon a little bit. I think you listed as -- for medical components and instruments. I'm wondering if it is the OEM and some of the instrument spaces? And also a little bit on ownership history and the deal process competitiveness and such.\nDave Zapico: Yes. When you think about Paragon, they're largely selling to an OEM customer base, but they do sell some of their surgical instruments directly to the end customer, but it's largely an OEM customer base. We purchased the business from American Securities. And from our view, they did an excellent job running the business and got a fantastic management team in place, a good growth strategy. And they're -- what they did is really position kind of a pure med tech play, by positioning this with some other parts of their portfolio. So we're pretty excited about what we're buying.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks for the added color.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Mizuho. Your line is open \nPeter Costa: Good morning, everyone. This is Peter as on for Brett Linzey. So just coming back to orders. Could you provide some context during the monthly order cadence through the quarter and then moving into October? Have you been seeing anything concerning or anything tracking better than your internal expectations? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: No, I think the quarterly evolution of orders is about what we see. We mentioned our book-to-bill and things like that. And we started out in Q4 in line with what we need to deliver those results. So we had talked -- in our last few earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact orders. And our orders have been very strong for an extended period of time. In fact, we averaged 18% organic growth in 2021 and 2022. And we had 12 consecutive quarters up to this quarter with positive book-to-bill. So as a result, we have a near record backlog. As we said, these dynamics are playing out as we anticipated.\nPeter Costa: Perfect. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Hi. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Wondering, if you've seen \u2026\nDave Zapico: Good morning, David.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. Wondering, if you've seen any impact from the higher interest rates on end market demand? And in particular, some of the other publicly traded test and measurement companies have mentioned project delays, particularly in China, have you seen anything along those lines?\nDave Zapico: Yes. As I mentioned, we were down about 3% organically in China, so there was some delays, but it wasn't substantial. In terms of increasing interest rates, that's one of the uncertainties that we're clearly looking at. And it's a very dynamic environment right now. And there are factors for sure, but we're not seeing an impact on projects, proceeding or anything like that from the interest rates at this point.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And are you supply chain constrained at this point in your Aerospace and Defense businesses? Is that a sort of a limiter on growth accelerating and even greater overtime?\nDave Zapico: We are not supply chain limited in Aerospace at this time. Now the industry is dealing with some supply chain difficulties, but we're not limited.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: All right. Thank you very much.\nDave Zapico: Next?\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Anastasiou with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMichael Anastasiou: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Michael.\nWilliamBurke: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Anastasiou: Back to Paragon, currently, medical-related revenues are about, give or take, 10% of sales. And after this acquisition, it takes you to about 20%. So was just expecting -- just curious if you're expecting to make like a deeper push into medical moving forward? And then what is sort of like the best way to think about balancing M&A dollars for these different end markets as well? Any color would be helpful.\nDave Zapico: Yes. There's a balance in AMETEK's end markets. And we really like that balance. That's why we're able to navigate some of the challenges that we're going through right now. So it's -- we plan on keeping that balance. But if there are other attractive areas in the medical space, we'll certainly look at them. But it's -- we like the balance in the portfolio. And what was your other question, Michael? M&A dollars. I mean we have a distributed operating model. In all of our businesses, we have management teams there that are doing strategy work around their businesses and trying to make their businesses better, and they're bringing forward acquisition candidates. So we don't have a predefined number of -- predefined amount of capital that we're going to apply to certain markets. We're going to be looking for the deal, the deal quality, the quality of the businesses and if we have the management teams to integrate them. So we have a different viewpoint. We don't look at it from the top down in terms of dollars allocated per market.\nMichael Anastasiou: Got you. That's helpful. And just kind of diving back into it. So potentially, depending on availability of assets and not such, do you expect total revenues to the medical end market increasing over time? And how do you expect that?\nDave Zapico: Yes. It's 20% now. It could go 25%, 30%. That wouldn't bother us, but we plan on having a diversified revenue base.\nMichael Anastasiou: Great. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Abigail, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our conference call. As a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, highlighted by outstanding operational execution, superb margin expansion, strong cash flows and earnings ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for operating income, operating margins, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flows. Given these strong results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have again, increased our earnings guidance for the full year. We have also been very active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of United Electronics Industries and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Amplifier Research. Today, we also announced the signing of a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Paragon Medical, a highly attractive acquisition, which broadens our exposure in the Medical Technology space. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly. Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were $1.62 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was flat. Acquisitions added four points in the quarter and foreign currency added one point. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96. We ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.4 billion, near record levels and down a modest 2% sequentially. Our backlog is up 5% from last year's third quarter and up 23% or $640 million from the end of 2021. AMETEK's operating performance in the third quarter was exceptional. Operating income in the quarter was a record $438 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 27% in the quarter, up a sizable 220 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $511 million, up 10% over the prior year, with EBITDA margin, an impressive 31.5%. Operating cash flow was up 45% in the quarter to a record $473 million. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.64 per diluted share, up 13% versus the third quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.58. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered impressive operating performance, with continued strong and broad-based sales growth. Sales for EIG were $1.14 billion in the quarter, up 8% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added 3.5% and foreign currency added a point. EIG's organic sales growth remains broad-based and reflects our leading position across attractive market segments and the impact of our organic growth initiatives. Growth in the quarter was particularly strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses as well as in our Zygo, Spectro and CAMECA businesses. Third quarter operating income was a record $335 million, up 23% versus the prior year. And operating margins were a record 29.5% in the quarter, up an impressive 360 basis points from the prior year. Tremendous work by our EIG businesses in the third quarter. The Electromechanical Group also delivered solid operating performance in the quarter, despite the impact of normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base. EMG's third quarter sales were $487 million, down 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales down 8% in the quarter. Acquisitions added four points and foreign currency added two points. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $128 million, down 7% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's third quarter operating margins were a very solid 26.2%. Our performance in the third quarter and thus far in 2023, reflects the unique value inherent in the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are aligned with diverse and attractive growth markets, while our organic growth initiatives continue to position us for long-term sustainable growth. Our distributed operating structure provides our businesses with the ability to execute their growth strategy and the flexibility to react quickly to changing market conditions. And our asset-light business model and strong operational execution drive outstanding cash flow generation, which we redeploy on value-enhancing acquisitions. This strong cash flow and our robust balance sheet are key differentiators for AMETEK in this higher interest rate environment. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. As noted, we have been very active in managing a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We are pleased to welcome our most recent acquisitions, United Electronic Industries and Amplifier Research. I'm pleased that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical. I will provide some more color on each of these businesses, starting with Paragon Medical. Paragon Medical is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and instruments serving applications, including orthopedics, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and drug delivery solutions. Paragon's broad product portfolio of single-use and implantable components are sold to a diverse blue-chip customer base of leading medical device OEMs. Paragon is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK. It expands our presence in the med tech space and provides us with access to attractive new market segments with strong growth rates. We are acquiring Paragon in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Paragon has annual sales of approximately $500 million and is headquartered in Pierceton, Indiana. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Now switching to United Electronic Industries, or UEI, which we acquired in August. UEI is a leading provider of ruggedized test, measurement, simulation and control solutions. UEI's custom products cater to diverse data acquisition needs from hardware in the loop testing, to aircraft simulators and automated testing systems and mission-critical applications. With a strong presence in the defense, aerospace nuclear power generation and semiconductor, UEI nicely complements AMETEK's Power Systems and Instruments division, significantly expanding our data acquisition capabilities. UEI has annual sales of approximately $35 million and is based in Norwood, Massachusetts. Next, Amplifier Research is a leading provider of innovative RF and microwave solutions. Its equipment is used for electromagnetic compatibility testing within the defense, industrial, automotive, medical and communication sectors. Amplifier Research is an outstanding strategic acquisition and complementary fit with our existing compliance test solutions business. Their technical capability has broaden our RF instrumentation and testing portfolio. Amplifier Research is a growing business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for electric vehicle research, development and testing. Amplifier Research is based in Souderton, PA and has annual sales of approximately $60 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains very solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital in the coming quarters.  AMETEK also remains committed to investing in our businesses to help position them for long-term sustainable organic growth. In 2023, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in these growth initiatives, including our new product development efforts where our businesses continue to develop highly differentiated technologies to help solve our customers' most complex challenges. In the quarter, our vitality index, which measures sales from products introduced over the prior three years, was a healthy 26%. As a complement to our internal new product development efforts, our ORTEC business recently acquired a Small Technology company, innoRIID, to help broaden their technology capabilities in the Radiation Detection market. InnoRIID, both cutting-edge technology expertise and an exceptional product development team, known for their innovative solutions having developed specialized Artificial Intelligence algorithms, for radiation detection in a range of Nuclear Security, Research, Health and Medical Applications. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, with strong performance in the third quarter and a positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are, once again, raising our earnings guidance. For the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up mid-to-high single-digits, and we continue to expect organic sales to be up mid-single-digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.31 to $6.33, up approximately 11% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $6.18 to $6.26 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single-digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.63 per share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's third quarter results for 2023 were outstanding, with strong growth across our long-cycle businesses, record operating performance and strong acquisition activity. Our businesses continue to excel, driven by our differentiated technology solutions serving diverse and growing markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging economic environments, while actively deploying capital to enhance shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned for long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill? Good morning, Deane. Yes. Sure. I'll give you my view of Paragon. As you stated, the leading provider of highly engineered medical components and instruments. When you look at the key market drivers of this acquisition, you have the aging population, the demographic shifts, you also have procedure innovation, where the minimally invasive procedures are becoming more percentages of surgeries, and they do a great job with that. And also in this market, there's a continuing trend toward outsourcing the OEMs. And they want to -- the OEMs want to accelerate their time to market, and Paragon is really well positioned with significant new product wins in this space. It serves specialty applications. I talked about the orthopedics, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and drug delivery. Orthopedics is the largest, but they're strong positions in each of the applications. Now, the portfolio is one of your questions, consisted of single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable components, and about 40% of the business is recurring in nature. So the single-use and consumables surgical instruments are about 40% of the revenue. So we really like that. As a blue-chip customer base, over 600 programs, with diverse sources of revenue, about 85% of the business is on sole-source programs. It's a very, very sticky business. When you combine the regulatory environment with lengthy approval processes and the capabilities of Paragon, there's high switching costs. It's a business that has unique value to its customer base. We did a lot of surveys in the market, and they're the highest quality provider. They have excellent customer service. A differentiator for them is their design and development capability. And I really considered a true partner by their customers. And when I look at this from -- that's about Paragon, when I look at what it does for AMETEK, it increases our med tech exposure now to over 20%. It's one of the goals we've been trying to achieve. It adds about $500 million in revenue to EMG, and that revenue is -- comes from Paragon, which is a secular low double-digit grower. It really fits our business model with the highly engineered products that provide unique value to customers. It's a growing, profitable business that provides multiple avenues of growth. And there's really an opportunity for us to improve margins by applying the AMETEK growth model. It's already a profitable business, but there's plenty of room for us to apply the AMETEK growth model and expand margins. Paragon will benefit from the AMETEK's global infrastructure for sure, and we like the management team. They're highly talented team, and we're excited about what we can accomplish together. And importantly, the deal economics meant AMETEK's traditional dealers, and this is on a large deployment of capital. So, our return on invested capital orders are met by this deal. And we paid about 15 times TTM EBITDA for the business. So we're very excited for the business. It's a good business for us. We've been looking at these businesses for some time and a universal excitement amongst Paragon and AMETEK. Yes. Sure, Deane, great questions. For the quarter, we grew our top line 5% on a mid-single-digit guide. Our revenue was in line with the guide. The acquisition performed a bit better. And we maintained, as I said, our full year sales guide mid-to-high single-digits and organic growth of mid-single-digits. To maintain that organic guide for the full year, our Aerospace and Defense business is stronger and our automation is weaker. And they're offsetting. That's one of the benefits of the AMETEK portfolio. And specifically in terms of Q3 revenue, we saw faster destocking in our automation businesses than we anticipated. So that's what we saw there. And we expect the destocking to continue through the end of the year. In terms of your question is, is it a, destock or a downturn? It's very difficult dynamic environment right now and lots of uncertainties, with the geopolitical risk, the interest rate increases. They're factoring in, for sure. But from what we see, this is largely an inventory correction. And demand looks constructive, with many new projects in the offing and the projects are not being delayed or canceled. Our Aerospace and Defense looks solid. Our Medical looks solid, significant projects and semiconductor, clean energy, power grid. So we remain positive post-destocking. And we think that destocking will continue through the end of the year. And in terms of 2024, we're going to sit down with our teams and understand what's going on. But in general, we're constructive. Thank you, Deane. Hi, Matt. Yes. Sure, Matt. I mean if you'll go back and look at my last quarter or two, I told you EIG, was gaining momentum, and the momentum certainly showed up in Q3. We had an excellent operating quarter. I mean EIG margins were up 360 basis points, driven by high contribution leverage on the growth. We really had excellent price cost. We had strongly performing acquisitions and it all came together to put up record margins. Great questions, Matt. We think the closure -- it's dependent on regulatory approval, but nothing atypical. But we think -- we'll get the approvals and close sometime in the first quarter. In terms of year one, yes, we'll have a very modest cash EPS accretion. It's going to be impacted by purchase accounting, integration costs, realignment cost to financing costs, we'll pay with this with a mix of cash and debt. And -- but we'll have very strong accretion in year two. And we're excited about getting the business under our wing, improving the business and delivering and we're very excited. We'll make that decision at the time. Historically, we have not broken them out, but with the amount of acquisition activity that we have. It may make sense to do that. We haven't made a decision yet. Good morning, Allison. Yes. We think it's destocking. We think it's destocking. And the destocking last through the year-end. And -- but post destocking, we remain constructive. We are -- that business automation sells to a lot of markets and the health care part of that market is not doing well right now and some of the other exposures, but we think it's clearly destocking. I think you should think about Paragon is matching the AMETEK profile. Yes. I mean we're going to sit down with each of our teams, discuss 2024 over the next six weeks. We're going to review each of the individual businesses. We do deep dives, as you know, into what they are seeing in their niches, their market dynamics, growth opportunities, cost reduction opportunities, and we want to go through that -- these meetings before there's any commentary in 2024. We'll tell you in early February. But -- so in terms of talking about next year, we'll have the typical things like we expect price to offset inflation and CapEx will be about 2% of sales and things like that. But we're going to defer from talking about the overall plan until we get to meet with our teams and understand at a detailed level. Thank you, Allison. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. That is the Zip code and it's over time. And we're going to build a plan with the management team and show them all the resources that AMETEK has and some of our business processes. But what you're talking about is in the Zip code of what we have planned. We have an existing business in our EMG business. It's about a $200 million business. It's -- or called our engineered medical components. So we're familiar with these segments. There's completely different end markets, but think about that as additive to that existing position, but in a greater scale. Not really. They're growing nicely. I mean you have the market growth that they're benefiting from, and they happen to be in the fastest areas. They've deployed their resources well and they're benefiting from the faster fastest growth areas. The -- there's -- they're winning new business on new programs, it's pretty substantial. And we did surveys on these businesses, and this is a really good business in terms of their capability and how they take care of their customers, and they're definitely winning share. So, it's going to be a low double-digit grower for the next few years, and a lot of that's programmed in. Now that's the way we're looking at. There's going to be ups and downs as we go throughout the years, but this is a solid business with really good growth prospects. Good morning, Scott. Thank you. Other way to make that-- Other way to make that-- Other way to make that, as Bill said, post-Paragon, we have 1.5 leverage, we wanted to take at up to 2.5 leverage, which is we've been there before, and that's not a high number for all. We can spend $2.6 billion on acquisitions, above and beyond Paragon. So we're in the M&A game, and our pipeline looks really good. And we have the balance sheet to be able to execute on it and the capability to integrate these businesses. Yes. Our models use current borrowing rates as part of that decision-making process. Sure, Scott, I'll walk around the business. I'll start with our Process business. And -- overall, sales for Process were up mid-single-digits, at low single-digit organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Navitar. And demand across our Process markets remains solid. Our products and technologies are well aligned with important secular growth trends like the energy transition and health care. Growth in the quarter was strongest across these end-markets, while our high-end optics business in Zygo continues to perform very well, with strong demand for our custom optical solutions. And for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Process businesses. Going to Aerospace & Defense Next. Aerospace & Defense continues to perform well. Organic sales were up low-double digits in the quarter. Growth remains strong and broad-based across our A&D sub-segments. Our growth in the quarter was strongest in our defense businesses, while commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses also grew at healthy levels. Given this strong performance, we now expect sales for Aerospace & Defense to increase mid-teens, on a percentage basis for the full year. In Power & Industrial, those businesses delivered solid results in the third quarter, with overall sales up mid-teens. This growth was driven by a low single-digit organic sales growth and the contribution from the acquisition of RTDS technologies. We saw the strongest growth in the quarter across our renewable Energy and Power Simulation businesses, including RTDS. Our Power businesses are well positioned to benefit from long-term investments required to modernize the electric power grid and build-out of the renewable energy infrastructure globally. And for all of 2023, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Power business. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. Overall sales for AE&S, were down mid-single-digits in the quarter, with contributions from the acquisition of Bison Engineering, being more than offset by a low double-digit decrease in organic sales. As we expected, the impact from normalization of inventory levels, which we talked about earlier, across our OEM customer base, combined with the challenging prior year comparisons, created a short-term headwind for our OEM exposed businesses. We believe underlying demand is solid. As we talked about earlier, and across our diverse Automation & Engineered Solutions markets, we remain constructive. But we do expect, as we said before, the inventory normalization is going to recur throughout the OEM customer base will continue through the end of the year. And now for the full year, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be down mid-single-digits versus the prior year. So that's all for the subsegment commentary here, Scott. Thank you, Scott. Yes. We can hear you Nigel. Okay. Q4 and geography. Okay. I'll go across the geographies. We had continued solid growth in the US, with the international slowing a bit. So I'll unpack that a bit. The US was up mid-single-digits, with notable strength in our process business. Europe was down low single-digits, notable strength in process and our aerospace business, but weakness in automation. You mentioned China. Our China exposure was down 3%. Strong growth in process weakness in automation. And overall, Asia was down about 10%. So China did better than overall Asia, kind of about 9% of sales. So again, up in the US, slowing in international markets. And the second question you asked was on Q4 and the guide for Q4. And our sales will be up mid-single-digits. We'll grow in revenue. There are two factors impacting the earnings in Q4. One of them is a higher tax rate. And the second one is there's some acquisition, integration costs and they're related to the deals we completed. But we're very confident in our guide for Q4. Core growth for Q4 was low to mid-single-digits. I think we're seeing some good demand on the EIG side from the typical year-end selling -- year-end sales that we typically get of capital spending, plus the EIG business is performing well. So our aerospace and our process businesses are performing well, and that's what driving the organic sales in Q4 to be higher than the organic sales in Q3. Yes, I think it's a little choppy in the market and people are reevaluating. And the interest rates are higher. So financing that debt on a continuing organization may be a challenge. And as I said, in the beginning of the year, our pipeline is strong. I would categorize our pipeline right now is very strong. We have a lot of attractive candidates we're looking at. And I'm just bullish on being able to differentiate AMETEK's performance over the next 12 to 24 months with our OpEx and our M&A. Good morning, Chris. Yes. When you think about Paragon, they're largely selling to an OEM customer base, but they do sell some of their surgical instruments directly to the end customer, but it's largely an OEM customer base. We purchased the business from American Securities. And from our view, they did an excellent job running the business and got a fantastic management team in place, a good growth strategy. And they're -- what they did is really position kind of a pure med tech play, by positioning this with some other parts of their portfolio. So we're pretty excited about what we're buying. Yes. Thank you, Chris. No, I think the quarterly evolution of orders is about what we see. We mentioned our book-to-bill and things like that. And we started out in Q4 in line with what we need to deliver those results. So we had talked -- in our last few earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact orders. And our orders have been very strong for an extended period of time. In fact, we averaged 18% organic growth in 2021 and 2022. And we had 12 consecutive quarters up to this quarter with positive book-to-bill. So as a result, we have a near record backlog. As we said, these dynamics are playing out as we anticipated. Yes. Good morning, David. Yes. As I mentioned, we were down about 3% organically in China, so there was some delays, but it wasn't substantial. In terms of increasing interest rates, that's one of the uncertainties that we're clearly looking at. And it's a very dynamic environment right now. And there are factors for sure, but we're not seeing an impact on projects, proceeding or anything like that from the interest rates at this point. We are not supply chain limited in Aerospace at this time. Now the industry is dealing with some supply chain difficulties, but we're not limited. Next? Good morning, Michael. Yes. There's a balance in AMETEK's end markets. And we really like that balance. That's why we're able to navigate some of the challenges that we're going through right now. So it's -- we plan on keeping that balance. But if there are other attractive areas in the medical space, we'll certainly look at them. But it's -- we like the balance in the portfolio. And what was your other question, Michael? M&A dollars. I mean we have a distributed operating model. In all of our businesses, we have management teams there that are doing strategy work around their businesses and trying to make their businesses better, and they're bringing forward acquisition candidates. So we don't have a predefined number of -- predefined amount of capital that we're going to apply to certain markets. We're going to be looking for the deal, the deal quality, the quality of the businesses and if we have the management teams to integrate them. So we have a different viewpoint. We don't look at it from the top down in terms of dollars allocated per market. Yes. It's 20% now. It could go 25%, 30%. That wouldn't bother us, but we plan on having a diversified revenue base. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter, with exceptional operating performance, robust margin expansion and strong cash flows. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million essentially unchanged from the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's third quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Other income and expense was a headwind of $9 million in the quarter, due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.7%, down from 19% in the third quarter of 2022, due to improved utilization of tax credits. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $29 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $330 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per share. Operating working capital in the third quarter was 19.1% of sales. Cash flow was excellent in the quarter with outstanding growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $473 million, up 45% versus the third quarter of 2022, while free cash flow was also a record at $444 million, up 49% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 131% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion. Total debt at September 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $842 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.6 times, leaving us with significant available cash and financial capacity to deploy on strategic acquisitions. As Dave has noted, we've been very active. During the third quarter, we deployed approximately $150 million on the acquisitions of UEI and innoRIID. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $105 million on the acquisition of Amplifier Research. Also subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical for $1.9 billion, which would be our largest acquisition to-date. Following the acquisition of Paragon, we would still have significant financial capacity with approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities available to support our growth initiatives. In summary, AMETEK had exceptional results in the third quarter. We achieved significant margin expansion and delivered high-quality earnings. Our strong position in key market segments, coupled with a very strong backlog and exceptional operating capabilities, positions us well for continued success. Kevin? Give me one second on that. I got it. It was 18.4. No, that's the amount of cash and availability under our revolver post-Paragon. The leverage post-Paragon would only be about 1.5 times EBITDA at the gross level. So substantial \u2026 --financial flexibility as well as we're still well under-levered I would say. And as Dave has talked about, lots of other opportunities available to us as we look to continue the acquisition strategy. So again, it's always finding the right businesses for the AMETEK portfolio. It is not capital constrained. Good morning, Michael."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nKevin Coleman: Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2022 or 2023 results or to 2023 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. AMETEK achieved exceptional performance in the second quarter, marked by strong sales growth, outstanding operational execution and record results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, operating margins, earnings per share and EBITDA. We also ended the quarter with a record backlog. AMETEK's continued outstanding results reflect the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our niche differentiated businesses. The benefits from our organic growth initiatives and, most importantly, the outstanding efforts from our dedicated colleagues. Considering our strong second quarter results and the positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were $1.65 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was 5%. Acquisitions added 4 points in the quarter and foreign currency was flat. Our book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter was 1.01, our 12th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. As a result, we ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.44 billion up $220 million from the end of 2022 and up $1.6 billion or 91% from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was a record $419 million. A 15% increase over the second quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.4% in the quarter, up an impressive 130 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $496 million, up 12% over the prior year, while EBITDA margins were also impressive at 30.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.57 per diluted share, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.49 to $1.51 per share. Now let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a great quarter with excellent sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were $1.13 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were up a very strong 8% with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. EIG sales growth in the second quarter was widespread across each of our divisions, with growth particularly strong in our Aerospace and Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. EIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and margin expansion. Operating income was $307 million up 16% versus the prior year, while operating margins were 27.1%, up a robust 130 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $511 million up 5% versus the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Bison Engineering, with organic sales roughly flat in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $136 million up 10% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second quarter operating margins were excellent at 26.6%, up 100 basis points versus the prior year. While EMG's core operating margins was exclude acquisition dilution, we're up a sizable 180 basis points. Overall, AMETEK achieved outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, AMETEK's continued strong operating execution -- our strong results speak to the attractiveness and diversity of the end markets we serve. Our businesses hold leading positions in attractive niche market segments. Through our continued organic growth investments and strategic acquisitions, we are expanding our presence in market segments and niches aligned with strong secular growth drivers. As a result, our businesses are well positioned with differentiated solutions, to benefit from the meaningful and long-term investments in areas such as electrification, clean energy, health care efficiency and manufacturing reinsuring. In addition to our alignment with strong growth markets, AMETEK has seen great success from our organic growth initiatives and investments. For all of 2023, we expect to spend over $100 million on incremental growth investments. These investments are largely focused on expanding our sales, marketing and commercial excellence initiatives as well as broadening our research, development and engineering efforts. AMETEK's research development and engineering teams across our businesses consistently deliver innovative and next-generation products tailored to meet the unique needs of our customers. While there are numerous examples across the company, I wanted to highlight our Abaco business unit for their outstanding accomplishments. Abaco is a leading provider of commercial off-the-shelf embedded computing systems for aerospace, defense and specialized industrial applications. Demand for Abaco solutions remains strong, given the position as a leading provider of ruggedized technology solutions with advanced thermal management capabilities. Abaco was awarded the best overall design for high-performance PCBAs at the recent Accelerator Technology Innovation Awards. Abaco also recently introduced a next-generation integrated computing and graphics car with the latest GPU technology. This provides our customers with advanced computing graphics processing and security capabilities required in AI-focused applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, radar signal processing and deep machine learning for autonomous systems. In addition to Abaco, many other businesses are well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for high computing power and analytics. We recognize the pivotal role of organic growth initiatives and driving our overall growth strategy. These investments in organic growth, coupled with our market leadership and attractive market exposures position the company for continued success in driving sustainable long-term growth. Now switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. Over the last three quarters, we deployed approximately $530 million on the acquisition of three businesses: Navitar, RTDS and Bison Engineering. Each of these businesses is integrating nicely into AMETEK and each is very well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities in their markets. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong and our businesses and internal M&A teams are actively managing a number of opportunities. AMETEK remains committed to leveraging our strong cash flow to pursue strategic acquisitions that align with our growth objectives. With a robust balance sheet and significant financial capacity, we are well positioned to support our acquisition strategy and capitalize on value-creating opportunities in the future. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment continue to warrant caution in the short term, we are confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and deliver strong results. Building upon our strong first half results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.26, up 9% to 10% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.96 to $6.10 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.58 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses continued to deliver excellent performance, benefiting from differentiated technology solutions that cater to diverse and growing niche markets. The implementation of our organic growth initiatives has yielded higher levels of growth, while our portfolio remains aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging, environments while actively deploying capital to drive increased shareholder value. As a result, AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nWilliam Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong second quarter with record level operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.5 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year and as a percentage of sales were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's second quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Second quarter other income and expense was a $6 million headwind versus the prior period due largely to lower pension income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.2%, down slightly from the 18.5% in the second quarter of 2022. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $28 million and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 19% of sales. Cash flow in the quarter was up meaningfully from the prior year. Operating cash flow was $335 million, up 42% from the prior year and free cash flow was $307 million, up 47% from the second quarter of 2022. Free cash flow conversion was 95% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion. Total debt at June 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $606 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses continue to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter of 2023. We delivered strong sales growth, achieved robust margin expansion and a high quality of earnings. Our leading positions across attractive market segments, record backlog and outstanding operating capabilities have positioned us well for continued success in the back half of the year. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Benny, can we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: All right, sure. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Could you maybe talk to about, obviously, book-to-bill being positive is very strong outcome here just given some of the uncertainties -- but could you maybe talk to order trends that you're seeing since then? Anything concerning I know you talked about sort of you've been to looks more in the longer term but any short-term kind of headwinds that you're starting to see there?\nDave Zapico: Great question. The overall demand environment still feels solid. We had the 12th straight quarter of positive book-to-bill and ended with an all-time record of $3.44 billion. So our book-to-bill was 1.01 and it was positive in both groups; so that's really great. Our backlog is over 50% of our annual sales and well above normal historical levels. So normal historical level of about 30%. So we're in a strong position as we proceed throughout 2023. If you recall in the last couple of earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact order growth. The first are difficult comparisons. If you look at our -- over an extended period of time, in fact, in all 2021 and '22, we averaged 18% organic growth. So we have some difficult comps that we're running up against. And the second dynamic we highlighted, is our expectation to return to more normalized ordering patterns. We had a situation where customers were ordering early and now that the supply chain is improving and getting back to normal, lead times are getting back to normal or seeing this dynamic play out. But we're well positioned to deal with it and our record backlog and positive book-to-bill give us confidence for the remainder of the year.\nAllison Poliniak: And leverage, clearly low here. You talked about a pipeline pretty active. Can you maybe give us some color on sort of what's been holding it back? Is it still in terms of executing, is it still, I would say, valuations at this point? You're just not seeing anything of great interest. Just any color there would be helpful.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Our pipeline remains very strong and we're actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of our markets. And as always, we will remain disciplined. So the discipline is in full force but we expect it to be active in the back half of the year. And more broadly, over the next couple of years, we really have the opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A aspect of our growth strategy. We're very well positioned with a strong balance sheet and we're really working hard at it and sometimes you can't predict what quarter they're going to close on or what quarters are going to happen but the backlog is at an elevated -- that backlog of deals at an elevated level and we are extremely busy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson & Company.\nMatt Summerville: David, could you maybe just go ahead and do the kind of around the horn, if you will, with respect to the businesses, the divisions, what you saw in Q2 and how that informs your organic expectations for those areas for the balance of the year?\nDave Zapico: I'd be glad to, Matt. I'll start with our largest market segment, our process segment and overall sales for our Process businesses, were up high single digits in the quarter and that included mid-single-digit organic growth and contributions from the recent acquisition of Navitar. Growth remains solid across each of our process divisions with -- as mentioned in the prepared remarks, our Ultra Precision Technologies business delivered notably strong growth and driven by high-end optics and metrology businesses. We also grew solid growth across our med tech businesses and the Rauland business that we mentioned a couple of quarters ago continues to perform extremely well. So for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth for the Process businesses, very solid. Aerospace and Defense. The growth remains very strong across our aerospace and defense businesses. In the quarter, both overall and organic sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis. And it really was reflective of strong performance in all of the subsegments in A&D. Growth was particularly strong across our aftermarket businesses as air travel returns to pre-pandemic levels, driving very strong demand for MRO products and services. And given the strong growth in the quarter, we now expect sales for the full year to increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus 2022. So we increased our outlook for our Aerospace and Defense businesses. Moving to Power & Industrial, overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter. And that was really fueled by mid-single-digit organic sales growth and the contributions from the RTDS acquisition which has performed extremely well. Organic growth in the quarter was strongest in our power test and measurement business, programmable power. And for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Power and Industrial businesses. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Overall sales were up mid-single digits, with mid-single-digit decline in organic sales being offset by the contributions from the Bison acquisition. And as we noted previously and in my question to Allison, I talked about normalization of inventory levels is continuing across our OEM businesses and the impact is most significant in our automation business. For the full year, we now expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions business to be up low single digits with stronger growth expected across our EMIP businesses. That's across the -- around the horn on that.\nMatt Summerville: And then maybe just to your last point, can you maybe comment on how long this normalization -- this normalization period, you feel may last with respect to automation. And then if you could maybe just to switch gears a little bit, give a little bit of geographic color in terms of what you're seeing, both organically and from an incoming order rate standpoint.\nDave Zapico: Yes, I'd be glad to. In terms of the automation business, I think it's going to last a couple of quarters. It's probably going to bottom near the end of this year. And what we have there is the end markets for automation are very interesting. The places where the inventory correction is steepest, as with our medical technology customers, with our life science customers. We have been positioned on a lot of COVID test equipment. Also our semiconductors, especially in the memory area is weak right now. So the -- that is correcting and it's going to correct in the second half. But I really think what the end markets that business serves is coiled the response. So in an upward fashion. So we kind of saw this coming. It's impacting OEM businesses but very significantly in our automation business but we're positioned well to manage through that, increase our guidance and because we're really operating well. Our productivity programs are progressing nicely. As I mentioned, the recent acquisitions are performing very well. Price inflation, we have good visibility and the A&D business is accelerating. It's our highest margin segment. Now moving on to your next question. I really feel good about the geographical story around AMETEK too. We saw a strong broad-based growth across all segments. The U.S. was up mid-single digits. We had broad-based strength -- notable strength in our process and aerospace and defense businesses. Europe was up high single digits, really, really positive performance there with notable strength in our process and power businesses. And Asia was up with 3 points with notable strength in process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: First, I got to start with the shout-out complement for that one pager in your website that gives you the quarter recap and backlog and free cash flow. I don't know, I didn't see the timing in the first quarter but we really appreciate having that up on the website; so, thank you. Listen, a lot of good questions. We've gone through already. Just on this normalization and we're seeing that everywhere and it seems to be not very disruptive for you all. Is there an opportunity? Maybe this is for Bill, would you be releasing any buffer inventory as things start to normalize, you go from just in case a bit closer to just in time. Is that an opportunity?\nWilliam Burke: Absolutely and that's something our businesses are very much focused on. We did all the right things to work our way through the supply chain, protect our customers given our extensive backlogs. But as that starts to normalize, our businesses are pivoting now to reducing inventories. And I think you'll see that happen as we move through the second half of the year.\nDeane Dray: Good. That was the timing we were looking for. And maybe some commentary on price cost, any kind of pricing carryover benefit and contribution from new products in the quarter?\nDave Zapico: Yes. On the price issue in the second quarter, we continued to more than offset inflation. Our pricing was about 5% and inflation was about 4%. And that gave us a positive spread of approximately 100 basis points. So solid performance there. We're seeing decreasing costs in some commodities and logistics, offset by other costs and wages in travel. But I feel like we have that really under control with good visibility and the results there speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio.\nDeane Dray: Great new products?\nDave Zapico: Yes. New products were a solid quarter. 24% of sales is our vitality index. So what's happening is our customers are buying our new products. And our new products at really good markets. And so we feel really good about that. And significant introductions across the business, I mentioned the Abaco introduction and the word Day 1. But while these are not home run-type swings and our product development is spread out across the business but we have a lot of good things going on.\nDeane Dray: You can get to the Hall of Fame with lots of singles and doubles.\nDave Zapico: That's right. That's AMETEK's strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer & Company Inc.\nChristopher Glynn: So Dave, reacting to your pitch on Abaco, you closed that out talking about demand for high computing power and analytics like many other AME businesses. Wondering if we could dive into that last dilution there.\nDave Zapico: Yes. When I'm talking about other businesses, I'm talking about what's happening, for example, in some of our process instrumentation businesses, we're doing a lot of work there to improve bringing some technologies that were in the lab to the field. And especially in our Spectro Scientific business where there's a lot of technology that we're putting in smart technology, where there's AI algorithms in it and we're doing measurements that were previously done in the lab, now we're doing them in the field. So that's really good and that's all around our predictive maintenance programs that we have with Spectro Analytics. So we're really positive on that. If you think about our -- some of our materials analysis businesses, there is a tremendous amount of data that we're taking from materials analysis. And we're showing our users that in unique and ways highlighting the technologies, our measurement technology. So you have situation where the graphics power, the graphics intensity of what we're doing is kind of a state of the art. So really, across our businesses, a couple of the trends around predictive maintenance, trends around moving the measurements to the field and trends around in the research environment, the analytical computational power to take the data that we have and provide our users with actionable intelligence is would be the areas I'd highlight.\nChristopher Glynn: It's very interesting. And then curious about any areas that might be inflecting higher? I think the question is yours more about anything kind of reaching an inflection or peak junctures. But you did raise the Aero defense market. And I think defense might be one particular area, if you could elaborate.\nDave Zapico: Yes. On both our Aerospace and Defense market, we have not peak. Demand is strong in the commercial market but I talked about it but outlook for the year, both commercial and the defense market have low double-digit outlook. So we're really well positioned in the defense market and some of the things I talked about with Abaco played to that. But both sides of A&D, commercial and defense are strong and we clearly have not peaked.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey of Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Just wanted to come back to orders. I was hoping you might be able to provide some context for how things track throughout the quarter, any preliminary view on July. And is there anything notable to glean from the changes in the mix of orders between project or CapEx related versus more OpEx purchases?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I'll answer the second part of that first. And -- the thing that I would glean, it's more OEM versus end user. So if we have OEMs between our product and the end customer, the OEMs have inventory in place and as we get back to more normalized activities, the OEM parts of the business are where the order is normalizing. On the end user side of the business, we're not seeing that really at all and end demand still remains strong. Regarding to your first question -- regarding the -- how we progressed throughout the month, we had solid orders in Q2. As typical, orders ramp higher each month of the quarter. So June was the highest month of the quarter. And notably, when we adjust for acquisitions because when you close an acquisition, you book the entire backlog as order input. So we take that out. And if we look to the last couple of years, cumulus like the highest booking or the second highest booking month the last couple of years. So June was really strong. So -- and in terms of July, it's just to close last night and we haven't really dug into it at a deep level but it's certainly up to that point was in line with the growth that we're telling we're communicating here where we're increase our guidance for the second half of the very substantially.\nBrett Linzey: And then just shifting over to pricing. As we do work through this normalization of some of the destock dynamic, are there any areas you think there's maybe price concessions? Or do you think you can hold the line on price, if not grow it, in your businesses there?\nDave Zapico: Yes, there's going to be just a small amount of giveback. We're going to retain the vast majority. We're going to retain the vast majority of pricing. And on a go-forward basis, I expect that inflation to moderate a bit but we're going to keep the 100 basis point spread. So we feel real good about the analysis and the control and what's playing out with price. So we'll retain the price and is certainly not going to be a big giveback.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. I guess what's directionally embedded in the revenue guidance for year ending backlog. I understand there's going to begin this normalization of the backlog. I'm wondering if you see that sort of playing out in the second half? Or is that more of a 2024 story?\nDave Zapico: Yes. As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, I do expect our sales to outpace orders in the second half of the year. But it will be a moderate impact and we'll end the year with historically high backlog in comparison to what we've done in the past. So it will be a modest impact as we progress through the second half of the year.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: And then if I'm doing the math right, guidance seems to imply about 40% core incremental margins versus kind of prior expectations of 30% to 35%. What's been improving, what's been going better than you expected?\nDave Zapico: Yes. Margin performance has been great. And in fact, in -- the second quarter, we had really healthy core incrementals of 52%. So you're correct on your outlook for the year and it probably is a bit higher because of our performance has been outstanding. And if you look at reported Anchor, we're both up 130 basis points at the company level, healthy incrementals and -- we think for the full year, the incrementals will be similar in both groups and 40% is a good number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Joe Giordano. I just wanted to check if there's any color you guys can provide on like some specific end markets in terms of any customer in specifically looking forward, if you have any color on any slowdowns on the medical side, like pressure on biotech because we're hearing from other people who are in the industry that there's been some pressure and some slowdown in that area.\nDave Zapico: I mentioned that some of our automation customers are in the med tech and life sciences world and we are seeing the impact of inventory destock and that's included in our overall guidance. But in terms of our overall medical business, not including that piece of the automation business. Q2, we were up mid-teens. So really strong and strong growth in our engineered medical components business and a very significant performance for AMETEK in the second quarter and for the full year.\nOperator: So, I do not see any other questions at this point. I would now like to turn the conference back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Benny, for all your help and thank you for joining us for our conference call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. AMETEK achieved exceptional performance in the second quarter, marked by strong sales growth, outstanding operational execution and record results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, operating margins, earnings per share and EBITDA. We also ended the quarter with a record backlog. AMETEK's continued outstanding results reflect the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our niche differentiated businesses. The benefits from our organic growth initiatives and, most importantly, the outstanding efforts from our dedicated colleagues. Considering our strong second quarter results and the positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were $1.65 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was 5%. Acquisitions added 4 points in the quarter and foreign currency was flat. Our book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter was 1.01, our 12th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. As a result, we ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.44 billion up $220 million from the end of 2022 and up $1.6 billion or 91% from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was a record $419 million. A 15% increase over the second quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.4% in the quarter, up an impressive 130 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $496 million, up 12% over the prior year, while EBITDA margins were also impressive at 30.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.57 per diluted share, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.49 to $1.51 per share. Now let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a great quarter with excellent sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were $1.13 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were up a very strong 8% with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. EIG sales growth in the second quarter was widespread across each of our divisions, with growth particularly strong in our Aerospace and Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. EIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and margin expansion. Operating income was $307 million up 16% versus the prior year, while operating margins were 27.1%, up a robust 130 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $511 million up 5% versus the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Bison Engineering, with organic sales roughly flat in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $136 million up 10% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second quarter operating margins were excellent at 26.6%, up 100 basis points versus the prior year. While EMG's core operating margins was exclude acquisition dilution, we're up a sizable 180 basis points. Overall, AMETEK achieved outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, AMETEK's continued strong operating execution -- our strong results speak to the attractiveness and diversity of the end markets we serve. Our businesses hold leading positions in attractive niche market segments. Through our continued organic growth investments and strategic acquisitions, we are expanding our presence in market segments and niches aligned with strong secular growth drivers. As a result, our businesses are well positioned with differentiated solutions, to benefit from the meaningful and long-term investments in areas such as electrification, clean energy, health care efficiency and manufacturing reinsuring. In addition to our alignment with strong growth markets, AMETEK has seen great success from our organic growth initiatives and investments. For all of 2023, we expect to spend over $100 million on incremental growth investments. These investments are largely focused on expanding our sales, marketing and commercial excellence initiatives as well as broadening our research, development and engineering efforts. AMETEK's research development and engineering teams across our businesses consistently deliver innovative and next-generation products tailored to meet the unique needs of our customers. While there are numerous examples across the company, I wanted to highlight our Abaco business unit for their outstanding accomplishments. Abaco is a leading provider of commercial off-the-shelf embedded computing systems for aerospace, defense and specialized industrial applications. Demand for Abaco solutions remains strong, given the position as a leading provider of ruggedized technology solutions with advanced thermal management capabilities. Abaco was awarded the best overall design for high-performance PCBAs at the recent Accelerator Technology Innovation Awards. Abaco also recently introduced a next-generation integrated computing and graphics car with the latest GPU technology. This provides our customers with advanced computing graphics processing and security capabilities required in AI-focused applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, radar signal processing and deep machine learning for autonomous systems. In addition to Abaco, many other businesses are well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for high computing power and analytics. We recognize the pivotal role of organic growth initiatives and driving our overall growth strategy. These investments in organic growth, coupled with our market leadership and attractive market exposures position the company for continued success in driving sustainable long-term growth. Now switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. Over the last three quarters, we deployed approximately $530 million on the acquisition of three businesses: Navitar, RTDS and Bison Engineering. Each of these businesses is integrating nicely into AMETEK and each is very well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities in their markets. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong and our businesses and internal M&A teams are actively managing a number of opportunities. AMETEK remains committed to leveraging our strong cash flow to pursue strategic acquisitions that align with our growth objectives. With a robust balance sheet and significant financial capacity, we are well positioned to support our acquisition strategy and capitalize on value-creating opportunities in the future. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment continue to warrant caution in the short term, we are confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and deliver strong results. Building upon our strong first half results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.26, up 9% to 10% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.96 to $6.10 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.58 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses continued to deliver excellent performance, benefiting from differentiated technology solutions that cater to diverse and growing niche markets. The implementation of our organic growth initiatives has yielded higher levels of growth, while our portfolio remains aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging, environments while actively deploying capital to drive increased shareholder value. As a result, AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill? Great question. The overall demand environment still feels solid. We had the 12th straight quarter of positive book-to-bill and ended with an all-time record of $3.44 billion. So our book-to-bill was 1.01 and it was positive in both groups; so that's really great. Our backlog is over 50% of our annual sales and well above normal historical levels. So normal historical level of about 30%. So we're in a strong position as we proceed throughout 2023. If you recall in the last couple of earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact order growth. The first are difficult comparisons. If you look at our -- over an extended period of time, in fact, in all 2021 and '22, we averaged 18% organic growth. So we have some difficult comps that we're running up against. And the second dynamic we highlighted, is our expectation to return to more normalized ordering patterns. We had a situation where customers were ordering early and now that the supply chain is improving and getting back to normal, lead times are getting back to normal or seeing this dynamic play out. But we're well positioned to deal with it and our record backlog and positive book-to-bill give us confidence for the remainder of the year. Yes. Our pipeline remains very strong and we're actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of our markets. And as always, we will remain disciplined. So the discipline is in full force but we expect it to be active in the back half of the year. And more broadly, over the next couple of years, we really have the opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A aspect of our growth strategy. We're very well positioned with a strong balance sheet and we're really working hard at it and sometimes you can't predict what quarter they're going to close on or what quarters are going to happen but the backlog is at an elevated -- that backlog of deals at an elevated level and we are extremely busy. I'd be glad to, Matt. I'll start with our largest market segment, our process segment and overall sales for our Process businesses, were up high single digits in the quarter and that included mid-single-digit organic growth and contributions from the recent acquisition of Navitar. Growth remains solid across each of our process divisions with -- as mentioned in the prepared remarks, our Ultra Precision Technologies business delivered notably strong growth and driven by high-end optics and metrology businesses. We also grew solid growth across our med tech businesses and the Rauland business that we mentioned a couple of quarters ago continues to perform extremely well. So for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth for the Process businesses, very solid. Aerospace and Defense. The growth remains very strong across our aerospace and defense businesses. In the quarter, both overall and organic sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis. And it really was reflective of strong performance in all of the subsegments in A&D. Growth was particularly strong across our aftermarket businesses as air travel returns to pre-pandemic levels, driving very strong demand for MRO products and services. And given the strong growth in the quarter, we now expect sales for the full year to increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus 2022. So we increased our outlook for our Aerospace and Defense businesses. Moving to Power & Industrial, overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter. And that was really fueled by mid-single-digit organic sales growth and the contributions from the RTDS acquisition which has performed extremely well. Organic growth in the quarter was strongest in our power test and measurement business, programmable power. And for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Power and Industrial businesses. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Overall sales were up mid-single digits, with mid-single-digit decline in organic sales being offset by the contributions from the Bison acquisition. And as we noted previously and in my question to Allison, I talked about normalization of inventory levels is continuing across our OEM businesses and the impact is most significant in our automation business. For the full year, we now expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions business to be up low single digits with stronger growth expected across our EMIP businesses. That's across the -- around the horn on that. Yes, I'd be glad to. In terms of the automation business, I think it's going to last a couple of quarters. It's probably going to bottom near the end of this year. And what we have there is the end markets for automation are very interesting. The places where the inventory correction is steepest, as with our medical technology customers, with our life science customers. We have been positioned on a lot of COVID test equipment. Also our semiconductors, especially in the memory area is weak right now. So the -- that is correcting and it's going to correct in the second half. But I really think what the end markets that business serves is coiled the response. So in an upward fashion. So we kind of saw this coming. It's impacting OEM businesses but very significantly in our automation business but we're positioned well to manage through that, increase our guidance and because we're really operating well. Our productivity programs are progressing nicely. As I mentioned, the recent acquisitions are performing very well. Price inflation, we have good visibility and the A&D business is accelerating. It's our highest margin segment. Now moving on to your next question. I really feel good about the geographical story around AMETEK too. We saw a strong broad-based growth across all segments. The U.S. was up mid-single digits. We had broad-based strength -- notable strength in our process and aerospace and defense businesses. Europe was up high single digits, really, really positive performance there with notable strength in our process and power businesses. And Asia was up with 3 points with notable strength in process. Yes. On the price issue in the second quarter, we continued to more than offset inflation. Our pricing was about 5% and inflation was about 4%. And that gave us a positive spread of approximately 100 basis points. So solid performance there. We're seeing decreasing costs in some commodities and logistics, offset by other costs and wages in travel. But I feel like we have that really under control with good visibility and the results there speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio. Yes. New products were a solid quarter. 24% of sales is our vitality index. So what's happening is our customers are buying our new products. And our new products at really good markets. And so we feel really good about that. And significant introductions across the business, I mentioned the Abaco introduction and the word Day 1. But while these are not home run-type swings and our product development is spread out across the business but we have a lot of good things going on. That's right. That's AMETEK's strategy. Yes. When I'm talking about other businesses, I'm talking about what's happening, for example, in some of our process instrumentation businesses, we're doing a lot of work there to improve bringing some technologies that were in the lab to the field. And especially in our Spectro Scientific business where there's a lot of technology that we're putting in smart technology, where there's AI algorithms in it and we're doing measurements that were previously done in the lab, now we're doing them in the field. So that's really good and that's all around our predictive maintenance programs that we have with Spectro Analytics. So we're really positive on that. If you think about our -- some of our materials analysis businesses, there is a tremendous amount of data that we're taking from materials analysis.

Yes. On both our Aerospace and Defense market, we have not peak. Demand is strong in the commercial market but I talked about it but outlook for the year, both commercial and the defense market have low double-digit outlook. So we're really well positioned in the defense market and some of the things I talked about with Abaco played to that. But both sides of A&D, commercial and defense are strong and we clearly have not peaked. Yes, I'll answer the second part of that first. And -- the thing that I would glean, it's more OEM versus end user. So if we have OEMs between our product and the end customer, the OEMs have inventory in place and as we get back to more normalized activities, the OEM parts of the business are where the order is normalizing. On the end user side of the business, we're not seeing that really at all and end demand still remains strong. Regarding to your first question -- regarding the -- how we progressed throughout the month, we had solid orders in Q2. As typical, orders ramp higher each month of the quarter.

As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, I do expect our sales to outpace orders in the second half of the year. But it will be a moderate impact and we'll end the year with historically high backlog in comparison to what we've done in the past. So it will be a modest impact as we progress through the second half of the year. Yes. Margin performance has been great. And in fact, in -- the second quarter, we had really healthy core incrementals of 52%. So you're correct on your outlook for the year and it probably is a bit higher because of our performance has been outstanding. And if you look at reported Anchor, we're both up 130 basis points at the company level, healthy incrementals and -- we think for the full year, the incrementals will be similar in both groups and 40% is a good number. I mentioned that some of our automation customers are in the med tech and life sciences world and we are seeing the impact of inventory destock and that's included in our overall guidance. But in terms of our overall medical business, not including that piece of the automation business. Q2, we were up mid-teens. So really strong and strong growth in our engineered medical components business and a very significant performance for AMETEK in the second quarter and for the full year."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong second quarter with record level operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.5 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year and as a percentage of sales were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's second quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Second quarter other income and expense was a $6 million headwind versus the prior period due largely to lower pension income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.2%, down slightly from the 18.5% in the second quarter of 2022. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $28 million and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 19% of sales. Cash flow in the quarter was up meaningfully from the prior year. Operating cash flow was $335 million, up 42% from the prior year and free cash flow was $307 million, up 47% from the second quarter of 2022. Free cash flow conversion was 95% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion. Total debt at June 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $606 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses continue to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter of 2023. We delivered strong sales growth, achieved robust margin expansion and a high quality of earnings. Our leading positions across attractive market segments, record backlog and outstanding operating capabilities have positioned us well for continued success in the back half of the year. Kevin? Absolutely and that's something our businesses are very much focused on. We did all the right things to work our way through the supply chain, protect our customers given our extensive backlogs. But as that starts to normalize, our businesses are pivoting now to reducing inventories. And I think you'll see that happen as we move through the second half of the year."

Continued solid demand across our diverse set of end markets led to strong sales in order of growth and another record backlog. Our businesses delivered tremendous operating performance with record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and reported a portion of that cash flow on our first acquisition of the year Bison Gear & Engineering. Given these results and the outlook for the remainder of 2023, we are increasing our sales earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.6 million up 10% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was excellent at 9%. Acquisitions added 2 points while foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK\u2019s continued strong organic sales growth reflects its success of our organic growth initiatives and our leadership positions across diverse and attractive niche markets. Demand also remains solid with overall orders growing 6% in the quarter. Organic orders were up low single digit on a percentage basis against the difficult prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.13 in the quarter for our 11th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.4 billion an increase of over $200 million from the end of 2022. As noted, AMETEK\u2019s operating performance in the first quarter was exceptional. Operating income in the quarter was a record $405.5 million a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 25.4% in the quarter up 120 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were to exclude acquisition dilution and the gain from our facility sale in the first quarter of 2022 or up an impressive 180 basis points with strong core margin expansion in each group. EBITDA in the quarter was $482 million up 11% over the prior year and EBITDA margins were 30.2%. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating model a differentiation of our businesses and the great work of our teams. This tremendous operating performance led to a high quality of earnings with diluted earnings per share of $1.49 up 12% versus the prior first quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.38, $1.42 per share. Now let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the electronic instruments group. EIG delivered excellent sales growth and operating performance with sales up 13% versus the prior year to $1.12 billion. Organic sales were up 11%, acquisitions added three percentage points with foreign currency of slight headwind in the quarter. This strong organic sales growth is broad based of our businesses and geographies with growth particularly strong across our aerospace and defense businesses in the quarter. EIG\u2019s operating profit was impressive resulting in a record operating profit in the quarter. Operating income was $309.7 million up 27% versus the prior year, while EIG margins were 27.7% up a robust 290 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also delivered excellent results in the quarter with solid organic sales growth and strong operating performance. EMG's first quarter sales were $479.9 million, up 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 4% in the quarter and foreign currency a 2-point headwind. Growth was notably strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the first quarter was $120.5 million, and operating margins were 25.1%. On a core basis, excluding acquisition dilution and the gain from a facility sale in the first quarter of 2022, EMG margins were up 50 basis points versus last year's first quarter. So overall tremendous performance by our businesses and all AMETEK colleagues. All elements of the AMETEK growth model, operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions are working well. These strategies allow us to quickly react to changing market conditions, invest in our businesses for long-term growth and deploy our capital on value-enhancing acquisitions. Now switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. The primary focus for our strong cash flow remains strategic acquisitions. We are managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates, and we have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity to support this strategy. I'm excited to announce our most recent acquisition, Bison Gear & Engineering. Bison is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK's automation businesses, helping expand our presence within this attractive secular growth market. Bison is a leading provider of customized motion control solutions for use across a wide range of high-precision applications within the automation, food and beverage, power and transportation markets. Bison's portfolio of linear and motion control technology is highly complementary with existing technologies, providing an expanded product offering that enables wider and deeper market participation in attractive markets and applications, including growing electrification requirements. Bison is based in St. Charles, Illinois, and has annual sales of approximately $80 million. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain focused on ensuring sustainable growth by investing in organic growth initiatives. This includes making strategic growth investments and driving broader adoption of growth has ends, digitalization and new product development. For all of 2023, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments in research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. One way we celebrate and recognize the great work of our businesses, new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award is provided annually to the AMETEK business who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded organic growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our Creaform business for developing its innovative new handheld 3D metrology solution, PL3. Creaform, based in Levy, Canada, is a leading provider of 3D portable and automated measurement technologies for applications such as reverse engineering, quality control, product development and non-destructive testing. The introduction of PL3 further expands the breadth of Creaform's metrology offering and makes high-end 3D scanning accessible to professionals and small enterprises, opening up a new attractive market segment. In addition to the PL3, Creaform also recently added a new scanner to their HandySCAN 3D platform, the HandySCAN BLACK Alete Limited. The latest addition to Creaform's flagship metrology-grade 3D scanners set a new industry standard for handheld devices. I would like to extend my congratulations to the entire Creaform team for their innovative new products and on-going efforts to push into boundaries and metrology. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain cautious in the short term due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage through these challenges. The company's record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid and long-cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. Given our strong first quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up mid-to-high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid-single digits, with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.96 to $6.10, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.84 to $6 per diluted share. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid to high-single digits with earnings of $1.49 to $1.51 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We delivered strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, a record backlog, record cash flows and increased our earnings guidance for the year. The company's differentiated technology solutions, market-leading positions in attractive markets and proven operating capabilities have allowed us to navigate through challenging economic cycles. Additionally, AMETEK's strong cash flows and robust balance sheet provide us meaningful flexibility to deploy capital to drive shareholder value. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?\nWilliam Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK had an outstanding first quarter, positioning us well to start the year. We delivered record-level operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $5 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense, as well as the return to more normal levels of discretionary spending. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales, below 2022's level of 1.5 percent of sales. Other income and expense was a headwind of $8 million in the quarter, due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5% versus 19% in the first quarter of 2022. For 2023, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $20 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million, or $0.58 [Ph] per diluted share. Operating working capital in the first quarter was 19.2% of sales. Cash flow was outstanding in the quarter a sizeable growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $370 million up 92% versus the first quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record of $367 million up 110% over the prior year. While free cash flow conversion was a very strong 120% of net income. Total debt at March 31st was $2.25 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $400 million. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times. During the first quarter, we acquired Bison Gear and Engineering, and we remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital, given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have significant financial capacity, with approximately $2.6 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our business has delivered exceptional results to start the year with strong organic sales growth, robust margin expansion and high-quality earnings. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Chris, could we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson & Company. Your line is now open.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks, Morning. A couple questions. Dave, can you remind us what you consider to be your canary-like businesses and how they may be informing your go-forward kind of view on the environment? Obviously, you sound pretty positive this morning. And then I have a follow-up.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Matt, we have largely mid and long-cycle businesses, so we don't have a short-cycle canary. And what used to be our canary was our cost-driven motors business in the floor-care market. But we've largely --that's not a part of the portfolio. So what we're looking at right now is really strength across our portfolio. So we don't see any canaries right now.\nMatt Summerville: And just a follow-up, Dave, can you talk about where you were in Q1 with respect to price-cost, what that's going to look like, and the magnitude of absolute realization you expect in 2023 versus 2022? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Right. Great question, Matt. In that first quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. Our pricing was a bit more than 5%, and inflation was about 4%. So we had a spread of a little more than 100 basis points. And for the full year, we expect the incremental pricing to moderate a bit. So we think we'll get 4% for the entire year. So -- and the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in the niche markets that we operate in. So we're pretty positive on pricing, and we're getting value, and we're adding value to our customers also. So we think it can continue for some time. While inflation may moderate a bit, we think it's going to be here for a while, and we think we can outpace inflation with price.\nMatt Summerville: Perfect. Thank you, David.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. This question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.\nAllison Poliniak: Can you, Dave, just talk about I know you don't really have the canary in the coal mine, but you did note, a little bit more cautious view, just given the macro. I would say any noticeable trends that you're -- that's driving some of that cautious view for you guys, just in terms of what you're seeing? Obviously, backlog and results were pretty solid today. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Yes, we're confident in our guide and for the balance of the year, but we are cautious given how early we are in the year and given the risks in a global macro environment. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our book-to-bill was 1.13. That's pretty strong. And if you take out the bison acquisition, it was still 1.1. It was positive in both groups. Our backlog is over 50% of annual sales is well above normal historical levels. So I think we're pretty well positioned to perform this year. We have mentioned that there is an expectation that we're returning to more normalized ordering patterns. And now that the supply chain is improving and we're seeing some of that play out. And we also have some difficult comps. But when you look across our portfolio, we're feeling really good. We're mid and long cycle. And it feels like the biggest part of our business, EIG, is starting to accelerate. So we're feeling pretty good.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. And then, nice acquisition with bison to start the year. Any color you can provide on and sort of the M&A pipeline, what you're seeing, are multiples becoming more reasonable for you guys? Any thoughts there? Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Right. That's a great question. And, we really like the bison deal. We deployed about $100 million on it. And it's an excellent fit with our automation business. We talked about expanding our capabilities there. But more broadly, we have a very, very wide and deep pipeline. And that pipeline is filled with attractive candidates. And it feels like the pricing has come in a bit. And it feels like we're in good position to continue our acquisition strategy and provide a differentiator in coming quarters and years with our strong balance sheet and with our capability there and with our strong pipeline. I'm fairly optimistic that with the pricing coming in and our strong -- we've done work for many years on developing the pipeline of deals, that we're going to have some success this year.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Okay, Allison.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. This question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we can take the tour of the key end markets and maybe you can start with arrow and defense because that got called out in both segments. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Right, right. Exactly Deane. Our aerospace and defense business had an excellent start to the year. Both overall and organic sales were up mid-20s in the first quarter. And we really saw growth across all A&D segments, but our defense and our commercial aftermarket segments were particularly strong. And given the strong start to the year and the positive end market tailwinds, we now expect our organic sales to increase and to be up 10% for the full year with similar growth across both our commercial and defense segments. Next, I'll go to Process. Overall sales for our Process businesses increased 10% in the quarter. Organic sales were up 10%. We had the acquisition of Navitor, largely being offset by foreign currency headwinds. And similar to last year, growth was broad-based in the quarter as end market demand remains solid across key process end markets, including research, medical, oil and gas. And looking ahead, we expect to continue strong organic sales growth for process, and we expect to be up mid-single digits for the year. And moving to the Power & Industrial segment. Strong results in the first quarter with overall sales up low teens. This growth was driven by low single-digit organic growth and contributions from our recent acquisition, RTDS. And we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth for our Power & Industrial businesses in 2023, with similar growth expected across both our Power & Industrial segments. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Organic sales were flat in the first quarter and in line with our expectations given prior year comparisons and timing of customer shipments. For all of 2023, we continue to expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered solutions business to be up mid-single digits with similar growth rates across both our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. That's a walk around the company, Deane.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s all really helpful. Thank you. And a follow-up question is actually a follow-up to Allison's question around normalizing and normalization of the supply chain. So maybe if you could just expand on that, product scarcity. How has that played out? And anything on -- when you said normalized order patterns, so what the customers spacing out the orders at smaller size? And anything -- and maybe for Bill, are you releasing buffer inventory because before it was -- recently it's just in case, now coming back a bit more to just in time, but will you be releasing any of this buffer inventory? Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Yes. The -- I'd just comment that there is a return to more normalized ordering patterns because lead times are back to normal. And the customers aren't ordering early now that the supply chain has improved, and we're seeing that dynamic play out. And it plays out more in our OEM-related businesses than our end market businesses. So a little more in EMG than EIG, but it's what we've been communicating for several quarters we were expecting. And overall, we're very pleased with the order of performance. We're very pleased with our record backlog. We -- our book-to-bill was up in both groups, and the normalization is really getting back to -- just getting back to normal lead times.\nWilliam Burke: And Deane, from the inventory perspective, we did add a little bit in the quarter, but we'd expect as we progress through the balance of the year, you're going to see that release of inventories that we've built up over the last year or so, as you say, just in case in protecting our customers and making sure we had enough right inventory on hand.\nDeane Dray: And would we see that inventory release result in some higher free cash flow conversion, maybe just above normal seasonality?\nDave Zapico: I think it will be -- it's -- we're going to be continuing to grow the business, which requires working capital, but I think you will see a release in the inventories as being a benefit to the overall free cash flow, which we'd expect would be in that 120% area for all of 2023.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s great to hear. Thank you.\nWilliam Burke: Then, we had record operating cash flow, record free cash flow and 120% conversion in the first quarter. So we think as our business is getting back to normal, you're going to see benefits in the cash flow.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. This next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hey good morning guys. Dave, I just want to dig in a little bit here on throughput. So you built backlog this quarter, but you had a pretty sizable revenue beat. So I guess that's the good news. But maybe the other side of that is how should we think about where you're at, I guess, particularly on EIG in terms of is there an ability to kind of ramp revenue further based on your own supply capability or your own kind of willingness to eat into the backlog? Like how should we think about your own throughput or kind of backlog conversion through the year? Is this sort of where you'd like to be? Or do you want to raise that higher just given the cyclical backdrop?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think EIG is more of a long-cycle business. And as these supply issues resolve, we're able to convert on more. And I would expect our backlog to stay strong for the balance of the year. I'd expect it to be a little bit lower at the end of the year, but it's still in excess of typical. And in my view, EIG is just starting to fire on all cylinders. I mean it's just really across the board. And one of the things that's happening in EIG is along with strong growth, along with solid pricing, the profit performance from the recent acquisition has been excellent. And for RTDS and Navacar, the acquisitions we did last year, they're doing well. And you're seeing Abaco also have a very strong year-over-year quarter in margins. So it feels really good for EIG. And I don't think we've taken our foot off the gas.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just on your automation business. You have some of the folks out there that are more in kind of the controller, mainline automation gear, that are sitting on big orders, record backlogs as well. Are you seeing this from mega projects and things like nearshoring, the same as those folks? Or where you fit into that value chain? Is there's something different driving the business?\nDave Zapico: No, it's similar. I mean we're in precision motion control. So we're moving things to automate them. And we're diverse end markets. We're in medical and factory automation and a bunch of end markets. But just the business that we acquired, Bison Gear & Engineering is a perfect example of what you're talking about. I mean they have about a year of backlog. And they're really capacity limited, and that's something that we can fix in relatively quick order. And it's a business with to provide us a lot of cost synergy, but at the same time, growth drivers of automation and freeing up capacity to go after reshoring and electrification requirements are really on our sweet spot. So -- while we largely have the capacity in our existing businesses, we can really improve Bison. So that's in line with what you're saying in these automation markets where there's secular growth drivers and good strong backlogs.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Excellent. Thanks all I have for you guys.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Stand by for the next question. This question comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Wertheimer: So I wanted to circle back to M&A, where some peers have called out a very strong M&A market, including, I think, one person call it kind of one of the best ever. And your comments were very positive that could very well be AMETEK execution developing the time. So I'm curious about your general feel on the M&A markets. And if they are quite strong, I think you indicated prices coming down, what's changing in the dynamics there?\nDave Zapico: Yes. The overall M&A market in the first quarter was down quite a bit. So the overall market is not that good. And -- but what you have is a lot of buyers are cautious now, and it's because of financing capability. A lot of the private equity businesses are less active right now. But we're largely a self-funded acquisition strategy. And we have, as Bill said, over $2.6 billion of cash in existing credit facilities. And our pipeline of opportunities remain strong, and we're very active in exploring it. And we are really a meaningful level of financing to make some headway. So it's a good opportunity for us to use this aspect of our strategy to differentiate our performance in the future. And we're very excited with the companies that are -- we've recently acquired. We're also very excited about the companies that we're working with. And we're growing our presence in attractive growth areas, and we'll stick to delivering our traditional financial orders. They are important thresholds for us. And we want to provide a strong level of returns on the capital we deploy. So it's the same setup, but at the same time, I think we're in an incrementally better position because we're a strategic buyer that has a strong balance sheet, that has cash flow and has a viable pipeline of deals.\nRobert Wertheimer: Great. That makes total sense. Thank you. And then just to go in a different direction, to follow up on your comment on, you mentioned like 5, 4 maybe pricing phase a little bit barely really towards the end of the year. Is it more to give us a sense of what's happening in the cost base inflation? Have you seen dramatic down in some areas or logistics or whomever? I'm just curious give us a little bit of sense of breakdown there.\nDave Zapico: Right. As I said, our inflation was about 4%. We're seeing decreasing costs in some commodities, some logistic costs, but there's other inflationary costs and things like wages and travel. So there's net inflation for sure, and it's sticky, but we think it will moderate a bit this year from what we're seeing. So -- but we're well positioned to deal with that with our pricing in our portfolio of companies.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank you.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks good morning everyone. [Indiscernible] so if we go back to sort of late January, February, when you put together the 1Q plan, obviously, it came in a lot stronger, which is not untypical, but I think the upside is a bit more than normal. So maybe just talk about what surprised you to the upside? Clearly, A&D was was a lot stronger. I'm wondering if you saw an inflection in defense. Curious if you saw maybe China coming in a lot better than perhaps expected. Just kind of walk off better. And maybe talk about was it mainly backlog conversion supply chain driven or customer demand driven?\nDave Zapico: Yes. The first point was our positive book-to-bill in both groups and overall, it was also order driven, not just backlog driven. The second point is what really is changing is the supply chain is getting much better. So we're able to convert on more backlog. And in China, in particular, you mentioned it was up about 12% growth. So it was a good grower. And as they're recovering from there COVID lockdowns, our business is developing nicely there. So it's really both. We had good book-to-bill, we convert on the backlog and we're strong across all geographies.\nNigel Coe: No, there's no question about it. You talked about the expectation that you'd expect to burn some backlog between now and year-end. You talked about order patents changing, which is very natural with the supply chain improvements. Have you seen that change, David, happened already? Did that sort of happen in March, April? Are we starting to burn backlog through the second quarter? Curious on what you see in real time.\nDave Zapico: Yes. We started to see a little bit the chip patterns last year. We started calling out last year, and we did see it. And it's mainly our OEM businesses. It's not so much in -- we're selling directly to end users because we have customized products, and they pretty much aren't going to over order a lot of expensive things like that. But on our OEM businesses, we have been seeing it for a while, and we did see it in the quarter.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. And then it seems like I'm close to the end of the queue here. So maybe I'll throw 1 more question if I can. The Bison deal, motion control, I don't think we've seen the motion control acquisition for some time or one of the size. Is there a desire to maybe do more of these kinds of deals, maybe become a bit more of a scale player in motion control?\nDave Zapico: I think there is a desire, but we need the technology and the business has to be successful and a niche, and we have to add value to it. And I think there are a few other businesses that we're looking at right now that would be very attractive to us. And Bison just fit all those characteristics. We can add substantial value. It was a fair price. It has capability that we don't have. And we can really improve the business to address -- go after more of the applications that they have been not able to go after. So it really fits in our toolkit and really adds value to our solution offerings. And there are other businesses like that we're looking at. And there are several businesses that we're looking at. And -- but we're going to be -- we're going to wait for the right opportunities, and I think those opportunities are showing up.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks Dave.\nDave Zapico: Okay. Thank you Nigel.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. This question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Glynn: Hey thanks good morning Dave, Bill, Kevin. Amazing to see the 1.1x organic book-to-bill at this point in the supply chain in the cycle. But I did want to ask about Abaco, as you just kind of hit the 2-year anniversary. Just curious for an overall kind of update on the past 2 years integrating, getting to know that business. And is it episodic? Or is it in, in a nice kind of scaling mode here would you project?\nDave Zapico: No, it's definitely not episodic. I mean, we had -- if you go back after we first bought it, we get the supply chain crisis in electronics, and we had to work through all of that. And we've also augmented the management team. And I think we're really in the right gear now with that business. The defense market is strong. We're in the right areas. So that business is going to accelerate and be a big contributor for us going forward.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. And on the organic kind of mid-single-digit outlook, could you kind of parse that, how you're thinking about the two segments relative to one another? Similar kind of outperformance from the first quarter at EIG, do we expect that to continue?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think both groups have a very good chance to grow mid-single digits for the full year organically. EIG, a little bit stronger than EMG, but both groups have the potential to grow mid-single digits.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you Chris.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Lot of commentary about improvements to supply chain. Just to go down a little, what about in your Aerospace business? We've heard more mixed messages about component availability and it could be constraints revenue. Obviously, you had very strong revenue growth this quarter, just an update on Aero's specific supply chain.\nDave Zapico: The aero-specific supply chain is improving as our entire supply chain is. And we grew mid-20% organic growth in the quarter. We have a good supply chain team there, a good management team running that business. So it feels like that business is accelerating. That was our strongest area, and we took out the year on that segment. So there are always challenges in different markets. And -- but in the Aerospace right now, I see us accelerating growth is what we're looking at.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thanks for that. And then on the Electronic Instruments Group, that commentary is very interesting that you're actually seeing some re-acceleration in demand. Are there any secular themes that you would point to? Can you identify certain maybe reshoring-related projects, etcetera, that are helpful there?\nDave Zapico: More than the secular -- there are secular opportunities driving growth. A lot of it is our approach and our niche focus. We have very flexible businesses that are aggressive. They go after where the niche opportunities are. I'll give you a couple of examples. In the semiconductor market, our Semiconductor business, which is about 6% of our sales, it was actually up in the first quarter. And most semiconductor businesses are up in the first quarter. And the reason is that, well, we participate some in the memory area that was down. We also participate in semiconductor research, which is very strong now. In the EUV optics within semiconductors were just very strong. So at the same time, there is some weakness in the market. We're very agile and can adapt, and we've been doing that for years, and we're growing. So I think that the big thing, I think, when you look across our whole businesses is are there growth opportunities for sure. We're very agile. Our distributor model lets us get after them with management teams dedicated to businesses and markets. And I don't see that stopping.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you for the details.\nDave Zapico: Thank you David.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. This question comes from Michael Anastasiou of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMichael Anastasiou: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. There's been some commentary as of late for destocking in different areas of the medical and life science-related end markets. Can you just briefly describe where your portfolio specifically plays in that area and your outlook for the year? Any color would be appreciated.\nDave Zapico: Sure. The medical market is about 15% of our sales now. And in the quarter, it was up high teens with strong growth in our Rauland business and also our Engineered mechanical components business. And for the full year, we expect it to be up high single digits. So we expect to be growing in that medical space. And it's much like the discussion I just had with David about we're in the right niches because in Rauland, their primary product are really to improve the efficiency of nurses. And as long as I've been alive, you have nursing shortages in the United States and Rauland's nurse call systems make nurses more efficient. So coming out of the pandemic, we see a lot of spending on dealing with the shortages, and Rauland has great products and very successful in that area. And in our EMC business, we're dealing with a lot of single procedure, single-use-type devices that we're building components for and that business is accelerating. So both of those core businesses that make up the large part of our medical businesses are doing well, and we were up high teens in the quarter.\nMichael Anastasiou: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our last question comes from Joseph Donahue of Baird. Your line is open.\nJoseph Donahue: Hey guys. I am on for Rob. How are you doing?\nDave Zapico: Good.\nJoseph Donahue: The kind of following up on the commentary that you had earlier. Could you just kind of take the temperature on R&D spending? Should we expect it to stay strong, you think, through the rest of the year?\nDave Zapico: In relation to the semiconductor, I think there's a lot happening now for -- we're transitioning from one technology to -- new technology and smaller and smaller nodes. So I think that we're seeing the strength in semiconductor research spending, and it's one of the strongest areas of our business right now. Again, it's another area where we're in the right niche.\nJoseph Donahue: Got you. And then this could just be on our side, but EMG looked a little bit below normal seasonal growth. Is there any difference in supply improvement across the two segments going on or anything else that we should be thinking about?\nDave Zapico: I think when you look at EMG the organic growth was up 4%. So they had a good, good quarter. You had some headwinds from currency. And so EIG grew faster for sure, but EMG was still really solid.\nJoseph Donahue: Got it. Alright, thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A segment. I'll now turn it back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining our conference call today. As a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you all for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent start to 2023 with outstanding results in the first quarter. Continued solid demand across our diverse set of end markets led to strong sales in order of growth and another record backlog. Our businesses delivered tremendous operating performance with record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and reported a portion of that cash flow on our first acquisition of the year Bison Gear & Engineering. Given these results and the outlook for the remainder of 2023, we are increasing our sales earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.6 million up 10% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was excellent at 9%. Acquisitions added 2 points while foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK\u2019s continued strong organic sales growth reflects its success of our organic growth initiatives and our leadership positions across diverse and attractive niche markets. Demand also remains solid with overall orders growing 6% in the quarter. Organic orders were up low single digit on a percentage basis against the difficult prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.13 in the quarter for our 11th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.4 billion an increase of over $200 million from the end of 2022. As noted, AMETEK\u2019s operating performance in the first quarter was exceptional. Operating income in the quarter was a record $405.5 million a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 25.4% in the quarter up 120 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were to exclude acquisition dilution and the gain from our facility sale in the first quarter of 2022 or up an impressive 180 basis points with strong core margin expansion in each group. EBITDA in the quarter was $482 million up 11% over the prior year and EBITDA margins were 30.2%. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating model a differentiation of our businesses and the great work of our teams. This tremendous operating performance led to a high quality of earnings with diluted earnings per share of $1.49 up 12% versus the prior first quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.38, $1.42 per share. Now let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the electronic instruments group. EIG delivered excellent sales growth and operating performance with sales up 13% versus the prior year to $1.12 billion. Organic sales were up 11%, acquisitions added three percentage points with foreign currency of slight headwind in the quarter. This strong organic sales growth is broad based of our businesses and geographies with growth particularly strong across our aerospace and defense businesses in the quarter. EIG\u2019s operating profit was impressive resulting in a record operating profit in the quarter. Operating income was $309.7 million up 27% versus the prior year, while EIG margins were 27.7% up a robust 290 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also delivered excellent results in the quarter with solid organic sales growth and strong operating performance. EMG's first quarter sales were $479.9 million, up 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 4% in the quarter and foreign currency a 2-point headwind. Growth was notably strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the first quarter was $120.5 million, and operating margins were 25.1%. On a core basis, excluding acquisition dilution and the gain from a facility sale in the first quarter of 2022, EMG margins were up 50 basis points versus last year's first quarter. So overall tremendous performance by our businesses and all AMETEK colleagues. All elements of the AMETEK growth model, operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions are working well. These strategies allow us to quickly react to changing market conditions, invest in our businesses for long-term growth and deploy our capital on value-enhancing acquisitions. Now switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. The primary focus for our strong cash flow remains strategic acquisitions. We are managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates, and we have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity to support this strategy. I'm excited to announce our most recent acquisition, Bison Gear & Engineering. Bison is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK's automation businesses, helping expand our presence within this attractive secular growth market. Bison is a leading provider of customized motion control solutions for use across a wide range of high-precision applications within the automation, food and beverage, power and transportation markets. Bison's portfolio of linear and motion control technology is highly complementary with existing technologies, providing an expanded product offering that enables wider and deeper market participation in attractive markets and applications, including growing electrification requirements. Bison is based in St. Charles, Illinois, and has annual sales of approximately $80 million. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain focused on ensuring sustainable growth by investing in organic growth initiatives. This includes making strategic growth investments and driving broader adoption of growth has ends, digitalization and new product development. For all of 2023, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments in research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. One way we celebrate and recognize the great work of our businesses, new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award is provided annually to the AMETEK business who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded organic growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our Creaform business for developing its innovative new handheld 3D metrology solution, PL3. Creaform, based in Levy, Canada, is a leading provider of 3D portable and automated measurement technologies for applications such as reverse engineering, quality control, product development and non-destructive testing. The introduction of PL3 further expands the breadth of Creaform's metrology offering and makes high-end 3D scanning accessible to professionals and small enterprises, opening up a new attractive market segment. In addition to the PL3, Creaform also recently added a new scanner to their HandySCAN 3D platform, the HandySCAN BLACK Alete Limited. The latest addition to Creaform's flagship metrology-grade 3D scanners set a new industry standard for handheld devices. I would like to extend my congratulations to the entire Creaform team for their innovative new products and on-going efforts to push into boundaries and metrology. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain cautious in the short term due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage through these challenges. The company's record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid and long-cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. Given our strong first quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up mid-to-high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid-single digits, with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.96 to $6.10, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.84 to $6 per diluted share. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid to high-single digits with earnings of $1.49 to $1.51 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We delivered strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, a record backlog, record cash flows and increased our earnings guidance for the year. The company's differentiated technology solutions, market-leading positions in attractive markets and proven operating capabilities have allowed us to navigate through challenging economic cycles. Additionally, AMETEK's strong cash flows and robust balance sheet provide us meaningful flexibility to deploy capital to drive shareholder value. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill? Yes. Matt, we have largely mid and long-cycle businesses, so we don't have a short-cycle canary. And what used to be our canary was our cost-driven motors business in the floor-care market. But we've largely --that's not a part of the portfolio. So what we're looking at right now is really strength across our portfolio. So we don't see any canaries right now. Right. Great question, Matt. In that first quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. Our pricing was a bit more than 5%, and inflation was about 4%. So we had a spread of a little more than 100 basis points. And for the full year, we expect the incremental pricing to moderate a bit. So we think we'll get 4% for the entire year. So -- and the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in the niche markets that we operate in. So we're pretty positive on pricing, and we're getting value, and we're adding value to our customers also. So we think it can continue for some time. While inflation may moderate a bit, we think it's going to be here for a while, and we think we can outpace inflation with price. Thank you, Matt. Good morning, Allison. Yes, we're confident in our guide and for the balance of the year, but we are cautious given how early we are in the year and given the risks in a global macro environment. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our book-to-bill was 1.13. That's pretty strong. And if you take out the bison acquisition, it was still 1.1. It was positive in both groups. Our backlog is over 50% of annual sales is well above normal historical levels. So I think we're pretty well positioned to perform this year. We have mentioned that there is an expectation that we're returning to more normalized ordering patterns. And now that the supply chain is improving and we're seeing some of that play out. And we also have some difficult comps. But when you look across our portfolio, we're feeling really good. We're mid and long cycle. And it feels like the biggest part of our business, EIG, is starting to accelerate. So we're feeling pretty good. Right. That's a great question. And, we really like the bison deal. We deployed about $100 million on it. And it's an excellent fit with our automation business. We talked about expanding our capabilities there. But more broadly, we have a very, very wide and deep pipeline. And that pipeline is filled with attractive candidates. And it feels like the pricing has come in a bit. And it feels like we're in good position to continue our acquisition strategy and provide a differentiator in coming quarters and years with our strong balance sheet and with our capability there and with our strong pipeline. I'm fairly optimistic that with the pricing coming in and our strong -- we've done work for many years on developing the pipeline of deals, that we're going to have some success this year. Okay, Allison. Good morning, Deane. Right, right. Exactly Deane. Our aerospace and defense business had an excellent start to the year. Both overall and organic sales were up mid-20s in the first quarter. And we really saw growth across all A&D segments, but our defense and our commercial aftermarket segments were particularly strong. And given the strong start to the year and the positive end market tailwinds, we now expect our organic sales to increase and to be up 10% for the full year with similar growth across both our commercial and defense segments. Next, I'll go to Process. Overall sales for our Process businesses increased 10% in the quarter. Organic sales were up 10%. We had the acquisition of Navitor, largely being offset by foreign currency headwinds. And similar to last year, growth was broad-based in the quarter as end market demand remains solid across key process end markets, including research, medical, oil and gas. And looking ahead, we expect to continue strong organic sales growth for process, and we expect to be up mid-single digits for the year. And moving to the Power & Industrial segment. Strong results in the first quarter with overall sales up low teens. This growth was driven by low single-digit organic growth and contributions from our recent acquisition, RTDS. And we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth for our Power & Industrial businesses in 2023, with similar growth expected across both our Power & Industrial segments. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Organic sales were flat in the first quarter and in line with our expectations given prior year comparisons and timing of customer shipments. For all of 2023, we continue to expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered solutions business to be up mid-single digits with similar growth rates across both our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. That's a walk around the company, Deane. Yes. The -- I'd just comment that there is a return to more normalized ordering patterns because lead times are back to normal. And the customers aren't ordering early now that the supply chain has improved, and we're seeing that dynamic play out. And it plays out more in our OEM-related businesses than our end market businesses. So a little more in EMG than EIG, but it's what we've been communicating for several quarters we were expecting. And overall, we're very pleased with the order of performance. We're very pleased with our record backlog. We -- our book-to-bill was up in both groups, and the normalization is really getting back to -- just getting back to normal lead times. I think it will be -- it's -- we're going to be continuing to grow the business, which requires working capital, but I think you will see a release in the inventories as being a benefit to the overall free cash flow, which we'd expect would be in that 120% area for all of 2023. Yes. I think EIG is more of a long-cycle business. And as these supply issues resolve, we're able to convert on more. And I would expect our backlog to stay strong for the balance of the year. I'd expect it to be a little bit lower at the end of the year, but it's still in excess of typical. And in my view, EIG is just starting to fire on all cylinders. I mean it's just really across the board. And one of the things that's happening in EIG is along with strong growth, along with solid pricing, the profit performance from the recent acquisition has been excellent. And for RTDS and Navacar, the acquisitions we did last year, they're doing well. And you're seeing Abaco also have a very strong year-over-year quarter in margins. So it feels really good for EIG. And I don't think we've taken our foot off the gas. No, it's similar. I mean we're in precision motion control. So we're moving things to automate them. And we're diverse end markets. We're in medical and factory automation and a bunch of end markets. But just the business that we acquired, Bison Gear & Engineering is a perfect example of what you're talking about. I mean they have about a year of backlog. And they're really capacity limited, and that's something that we can fix in relatively quick order. And it's a business with to provide us a lot of cost synergy, but at the same time, growth drivers of automation and freeing up capacity to go after reshoring and electrification requirements are really on our sweet spot. So -- while we largely have the capacity in our existing businesses, we can really improve Bison. So that's in line with what you're saying in these automation markets where there's secular growth drivers and good strong backlogs. Thank you. Yes. The overall M&A market in the first quarter was down quite a bit. So the overall market is not that good. And -- but what you have is a lot of buyers are cautious now, and it's because of financing capability. A lot of the private equity businesses are less active right now. But we're largely a self-funded acquisition strategy. And we have, as Bill said, over $2.6 billion of cash in existing credit facilities. And our pipeline of opportunities remain strong, and we're very active in exploring it. And we are really a meaningful level of financing to make some headway. So it's a good opportunity for us to use this aspect of our strategy to differentiate our performance in the future. And we're very excited with the companies that are -- we've recently acquired. We're also very excited about the companies that we're working with. And we're growing our presence in attractive growth areas, and we'll stick to delivering our traditional financial orders. They are important thresholds for us. And we want to provide a strong level of returns on the capital we deploy. So it's the same setup, but at the same time, I think we're in an incrementally better position because we're a strategic buyer that has a strong balance sheet, that has cash flow and has a viable pipeline of deals. Right. As I said, our inflation was about 4%. We're seeing decreasing costs in some commodities, some logistic costs, but there's other inflationary costs and things like wages and travel. So there's net inflation for sure, and it's sticky, but we think it will moderate a bit this year from what we're seeing. So -- but we're well positioned to deal with that with our pricing in our portfolio of companies. Yes. The first point was our positive book-to-bill in both groups and overall, it was also order driven, not just backlog driven. The second point is what really is changing is the supply chain is getting much better. So we're able to convert on more backlog. And in China, in particular, you mentioned it was up about 12% growth. So it was a good grower. And as they're recovering from there COVID lockdowns, our business is developing nicely there. So it's really both. We had good book-to-bill, we convert on the backlog and we're strong across all geographies. Yes. We started to see a little bit the chip patterns last year. We started calling out last year, and we did see it. And it's mainly our OEM businesses. It's not so much in -- we're selling directly to end users because we have customized products, and they pretty much aren't going to over order a lot of expensive things like that. But on our OEM businesses, we have been seeing it for a while, and we did see it in the quarter. I think there is a desire, but we need the technology and the business has to be successful and a niche, and we have to add value to it. And I think there are a few other businesses that we're looking at right now that would be very attractive to us. And Bison just fit all those characteristics. We can add substantial value. It was a fair price. It has capability that we don't have. And we can really improve the business to address -- go after more of the applications that they have been not able to go after. So it really fits in our toolkit and really adds value to our solution offerings. And there are other businesses like that we're looking at. And there are several businesses that we're looking at. And -- but we're going to be -- we're going to wait for the right opportunities, and I think those opportunities are showing up. Okay. Thank you Nigel. No, it's definitely not episodic. I mean, we had -- if you go back after we first bought it, we get the supply chain crisis in electronics, and we had to work through all of that. And we've also augmented the management team. And I think we're really in the right gear now with that business. The defense market is strong. We're in the right areas. So that business is going to accelerate and be a big contributor for us going forward. Yes. I think both groups have a very good chance to grow mid-single digits for the full year organically. EIG, a little bit stronger than EMG, but both groups have the potential to grow mid-single digits. Thank you Chris. The aero-specific supply chain is improving as our entire supply chain is. And we grew mid-20% organic growth in the quarter. We have a good supply chain team there, a good management team running that business. So it feels like that business is accelerating. That was our strongest area, and we took out the year on that segment. So there are always challenges in different markets. And -- but in the Aerospace right now, I see us accelerating growth is what we're looking at. More than the secular -- there are secular opportunities driving growth. A lot of it is our approach and our niche focus. We have very flexible businesses that are aggressive. They go after where the niche opportunities are. I'll give you a couple of examples. In the semiconductor market, our Semiconductor business, which is about 6% of our sales, it was actually up in the first quarter. And most semiconductor businesses are up in the first quarter. And the reason is that, well, we participate some in the memory area that was down. We also participate in semiconductor research, which is very strong now. In the EUV optics within semiconductors were just very strong. So at the same time, there is some weakness in the market. We're very agile and can adapt, and we've been doing that for years, and we're growing. So I think that the big thing, I think, when you look across our whole businesses is are there growth opportunities for sure. We're very agile. Our distributor model lets us get after them with management teams dedicated to businesses and markets. And I don't see that stopping. Thank you David. Sure. The medical market is about 15% of our sales now. And in the quarter, it was up high teens with strong growth in our Rauland business and also our Engineered mechanical components business. And for the full year, we expect it to be up high single digits. So we expect to be growing in that medical space. And it's much like the discussion I just had with David about we're in the right niches because in Rauland, their primary product are really to improve the efficiency of nurses. And as long as I've been alive, you have nursing shortages in the United States and Rauland's nurse call systems make nurses more efficient. So coming out of the pandemic, we see a lot of spending on dealing with the shortages, and Rauland has great products and very successful in that area. And in our EMC business, we're dealing with a lot of single procedure, single-use-type devices that we're building components for and that business is accelerating. So both of those core businesses that make up the large part of our medical businesses are doing well, and we were up high teens in the quarter. Good. In relation to the semiconductor, I think there's a lot happening now for -- we're transitioning from one technology to -- new technology and smaller and smaller nodes. So I think that we're seeing the strength in semiconductor research spending, and it's one of the strongest areas of our business right now. Again, it's another area where we're in the right niche. I think when you look at EMG the organic growth was up 4%. So they had a good, good quarter. You had some headwinds from currency. And so EIG grew faster for sure, but EMG was still really solid. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK had an outstanding first quarter, positioning us well to start the year. We delivered record-level operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $5 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense, as well as the return to more normal levels of discretionary spending. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales, below 2022's level of 1.5 percent of sales. Other income and expense was a headwind of $8 million in the quarter, due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5% versus 19% in the first quarter of 2022. For 2023, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $20 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million, or $0.58 [Ph] per diluted share. Operating working capital in the first quarter was 19.2% of sales. Cash flow was outstanding in the quarter a sizeable growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $370 million up 92% versus the first quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record of $367 million up 110% over the prior year. While free cash flow conversion was a very strong 120% of net income. Total debt at March 31st was $2.25 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $400 million. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times. During the first quarter, we acquired Bison Gear and Engineering, and we remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital, given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have significant financial capacity, with approximately $2.6 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our business has delivered exceptional results to start the year with strong organic sales growth, robust margin expansion and high-quality earnings. Kevin? And Deane, from the inventory perspective, we did add a little bit in the quarter, but we'd expect as we progress through the balance of the year, you're going to see that release of inventories that we've built up over the last year or so, as you say, just in case in protecting our customers and making sure we had enough right inventory on hand. Then, we had record operating cash flow, record free cash flow and 120% conversion in the first quarter. So we think as our business is getting back to normal, you're going to see benefits in the cash flow."

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our business has executed extremely well, resulted in earnings per share above our expectations, solid margin performance, outstanding cash flow conversion and double-digit growth in overall orders with positive growth in organic orders. Additionally, during the quarter, we deployed approximately $60 million on share repurchases. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired Virtek Vision, an excellent strategic fit with our Creaform business. I am very pleased with our team's performance. Our businesses remain focused on managing through short-term macro headwinds, while ensuring we are positioned for long-term growth. We have a proven successful growth model, and efficient operating structure, robust cash flows, a strong balance sheet and leading positions across a diverse set of niche markets. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial results. Third quarter sales were $1.71 billion, up 5% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 2%, acquisitions added 7.5 points and foreign currency was flat. Overall, orders in the quarter were up 12%. Book-to-bill was 1.02 and organic orders were up 2%. Additionally, we saw a solid sequential growth in orders. We ended the quarter with a strong backlog of $3.44 billion near record levels. AMETEK's operational performance in the third quarter was excellent. Our disciplined approach to cost management and operational efficiency resulted in strong margins. Operating income in the quarter was $446 million, a 2% increase over the third quarter of 2023 and operating margins were 26.1% in the quarter. Core margins, excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency were very strong at 27.4%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was $553 million, up 4% versus the prior year with EBITDA margins an impressive, 31.2%. Cash flow in the third quarter was excellent with free cash flow up 4% versus the prior year and free cash flow conversion of very strong 135%, reflecting our asset-light business model and operating capability. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.66 per diluted share, up 1% versus the third quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.60 to $1.62 per share. Now, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG continues to perform well with strong margin expansion and overall outstanding levels of operating margins reflecting the quality of our businesses. EIG sales were $1.13 billion in line with the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 2% and acquisitions contributed two points. Growth remains solid across our Aerospace & Defense businesses, while our high-end research instrumentation business CAMECA also saw strong growth in the quarter. While we did see some temporary delays in project spending across parts of our EIG business as we had expected our new funnel pipeline remains solid and our businesses are very well positioned across a number of secular growth markets. EIG operating income was $339 million, up 1% and operating margins were a very strong 29.9%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. EIG core margins were 30.2%, up 70 basis points versus last year's third quarter. Now switching to the Electromechanical Group. EMG's third quarter sales were $574 million, up 18% versus the prior year with organic sales down 3% and acquisitions contributing over 20 points to growth. Strong growth across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter was offset by expected weakness with our OEM-exposed businesses due to the impact of inventory destocking. EMG orders were very strong in the quarter growing 12% organically. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $132 million, up 3% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's third quarter operating margins were 22.9% with excellent core margins of 26.1%. AMETEK delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, effectively navigating demand headwinds to deliver strong results. We remain focused on executing our growth model and positioning AMETEK for continued long-term growth, while ensuring we deliver strong results in the face of a choppy macro environment. Now turning to our acquisition strategy. Strategic acquisitions are a core component of our growth model. We are committed to deploying our strong cash flow and acquisitions to expand our portfolio in highly attractive market segments. With that I'm excited to announce our newest acquisition Virtek Vision. Virtek Vision is a leading provider of laser-based projection and inspection systems, offering a suite of 2D and 3D laser projectors, smart cameras and advanced measurement solutions powered by their proprietary AI software. Virtek's automated systems enhance productivity, improve quality and reduce cost, across a range of aerospace defense and industrial applications. Virtek is an excellent strategic fit with our Creaform business, broadening its technology offerings and enabling a wider range of automation and inspection capabilities for our customers. Virtek is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada and has annual sales of approximately $40 million. I would like to welcome the Virtek team to the AMETEK family. Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust. As noted, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet and anticipate remaining active in this area. AMETEK also remains committed to investing in our businesses to ensure they are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we are investing an incremental $90 million in growth initiatives including our new product development efforts where our teams are focused on developing highly differentiated technologies to help solve our customers' most complex challenges. Throughout our business, we see countless examples of innovative products and technologies being developed to support our customers and provide them with the advanced differentiated capabilities to need. One way we measure the success of our new product development activities is through our Vitality Index, which measures the sales from products introduced over the past three years. In the third quarter, our Vitality Index was an outstanding 28%. In addition to our internal development activities, I'm also pleased to announce that our CAMECA business, a leader in micro-analytical and metrology instrumentation recently completed a small technology acquisition of Polygon Physics. Polygon Physics specializes in ultracompact, ultra-low power electron cyclotron resonance technology. This technology enhances CAMECA's capabilities and advanced metrology instrumentation and advanced chip manufacturing. Polygon provides us access to cutting-edge ion source technology and expertise that will help accelerate CAMECA's new product development efforts and enhance their technology portfolio. We're excited to welcome the Polygon team to AMETEK. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given our third quarter results, we are raising our earnings guidance for the full year. We continue to expect overall sales to be up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.77 to $6.82, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $6.70 to $6.80 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits with earnings in the range of $1.81 to $1.86, up 8% to 11% versus the prior year. In summary, I'm pleased with the team's performance in the quarter and thus far in 2024. We're managing through an uncertain macro environment and confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. AMETEK has been very successful over a long period of time managing a diverse set of highly differentiated niche businesses. The AMETEK growth model has allowed us to deliver double-digit earnings growth throughout different phases of the economic cycle. The strength of our portfolio combined with our operational excellence capabilities and acquisition strategy has allowed us to deliver outstanding results. This has also allowed us to successfully manage through periods of economic weakness or uncertainty and emerge even stronger with exceptional growth. We are excited for the future. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will take us through some of the financial details of the quarter. And then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip?\nDalip Puri: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter with excellent operating performance and high free cash flow conversion. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $25 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year. As a percentage of sales, G&A expense came in at 1.4% of sales down from 1.5% in last year's third quarter. For fiscal year 2024 general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Third quarter interest expense was $25 million up $7 million from the third quarter of 2023, due to higher debt balances following recent acquisitions. Third quarter other operating expenses were down $4 million versus the prior period due largely to higher pension income and lower acquisition-related due diligence expense in the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% up from 17.7% in the third quarter of 2023. For 2024, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 17% and 17.5% driven by a lower fourth quarter tax rate due to statute expirations. As we have stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from the full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $90 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $395 million, including after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $188 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the third quarter was 19% of sales. Cash flow generation in the third quarter was excellent. Operating cash flow was $487 million, up 3% versus the third quarter of 2023, while free cash flow was $461 million, up 4% over the prior year. This was a record third quarter level for both operating and free cash flow generation. Free cash flow conversion was also outstanding at 135% in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% to 120% of net income. During the quarter, we spent $60 million on share repurchases, repurchasing approximately 371,000 shares of our common stock in the open market. Additionally at the end of the quarter, we paid down a maturing $300 million private placement note. Total debt at September 30th was $2.34 billion, down $360 million in the quarter and down approximately $1 billion from the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $396 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times. We have significant financial capacity and flexibility with over $2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our acquisition strategy and growth initiatives. In summary, AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our operational excellence initiatives and our strategic focus contributed to strong earnings, robust margins and excellent free cash flow. With a strong balance sheet, near-record backlog and leadership across our key markets, we are well-positioned for continued long-term growth. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Dalip. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Good morning guys.\nDave Zapico: Morning, Matt.\nMatt Summerville: David, could you maybe do a little bit more of a detailed update specifically on what you're seeing in your medical and life sciences facing end markets across both EIG and EMG and work in some commentary on what you're seeing in those businesses specifically around destocking? And then I have a follow-up.\nDave Zapico: Yeah, sure. We saw -- in terms of the destock, we saw demand largely in line with our expectations in the quarter. Actually as both our OEM customers and our automation and Paragon businesses continue to work down excess levels of inventory. And the destocking headwinds are going to continue. We remain well-positioned on a range of attractive programs within both the automation business and the Paragon business. And we're really encouraged by the trend in recent order rates. We had the -- in EMG where the main destocking areas was up plus 12 organically. Again we had a positive book-to-bill of 1.02. And if you just look at the trends, the trends are heading in the right direction. So we stabilized we saw solid sequential growth in orders and we're feeling pretty good about that.\nMatt Summerville: And then as a follow-up you mentioned in your prepared remarks when talking about EIG that you're still seeing a little bit of customer tentativeness with respect to some delays in that portion of the business. Can you just talk through maybe, which divisions are being most impacted by that, which end markets, et cetera? And if you're able at all to kind of ring fence and quantify the impact?\nDave Zapico: Sure. Yeah, I'll do that Matt. In terms of the project lease we spoke about last quarter this quarter played out largely as expected. Customers remain cautious given the impact of various economic, geopolitical and election uncertainties. And these project delays are specifically in our EIG test and measurement businesses. That's what we talked about last quarter. And the key point here is our new opportunity funnel remains strong. So things are definitely not getting worse. In fact, the EIG orders trend went from minus 11 organic in Q1 to minus four organic in Q2 to minus two organic in Q3. So we're feeling pretty good about the -- encouraged by the positive trend there.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. Thanks David.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Dave maybe you can take us through the end markets geographies? And to the extent that you can some comments on China, I don't think there's ever been more mixed messages, most of them negative, but each company has got different views based upon their exposures, but maybe we can start there. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Great set of questions. I'll try to get them all, and if I forget anything, pull me back to it. I'll go around the one first, and talk about our process business. Both, overall and organic sales for our process businesses, declined low single digits in the quarter. Growth, remains solid across our energy businesses. We had a good quarter in energy. And also our high-end research business, we talked about CAMECA also had a very strong growth in the quarter. And looking ahead, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be flat to up low single digits for the full year. Next switching the Aerospace & Defense. Aerospace & Defense is about 18% of AMETEK, delivered strong performance in the quarter, both overall and organic sales were up mid-single digits. Growth was strongest across our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. A reminder, we have a good balance between sales and defense and we have a good balance between OEM products and aftermarket. And additionally, we're on a wide range of applications and not dependent on any one platform. So, we're positioned well to benefit from the long-term growth across these markets. And for the full year, we continue to expect high single-digit organic growth for our aerospace and defense businesses. Next, I'll go to power and industrial. Power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter driven by the contributions of Amplifier Research and UEI, recent acquisitions both of them. Organic sales were down low single digits in the quarter. We expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be down low single digits for the full year. Then, finally our Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment. Overall, sales there increased in the low 20% range, driven primarily by the contributions of Paragon Medical. Organic sales were down, high single digits due to continued normalization of inventory across our OEM customer base. And for the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to decline mid-single digits as the headwinds from destocking continue. Talking about the geographies, yes, a little different in the mix there. We had strong growth in Europe and Asia, offset by some declines in the US. You talked specifically about China. Our Asia business did well, and China was actually up 10%. We had strong growth in our UPT or Ultra Precision Technology division, AMETEK products are used by our customers in China to improve their manufacturing processes, automate processes, make the environment cleaner, produce energy. So, very well positioned. But that market will remain choppy and there's been some stimulus announced, but the results that we're seeing now aren't from stimulus or just from market share wins and making good headway in the markets. But it's very difficult to predict, what's happening in China. So it's just wait and see what happens each quarter.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And it is remarkable, how -- it really depends on what your exposures are in China. You just can't paint it all, with the negative brush there. And just as a quick follow-up, the context of destocking the longer it lasts, I always get this impression that it's really a lower demand as opposed to just an inventory correction. So, what's your sense? Is there a reset, let's say, at Paragon? Or is it still you can see sell-in versus sell-through and that there is really like an inventory work down coming through? Just kind of, how do you separate those two dynamics?\nDave Zapico: Yes. That's a great question, and it's obviously difficult to parse, but we're pretty confident that we're working through a supply chain crisis level of inventory that -- and we have some math you can see, when we work through that and then there's the same kind of growth on the other end of it. And same thing is happening in the medical space as the automation space. So, we're seeing -- the other factor that influences our decision, is the new business activity the pipeline activity. Our customers are very active. We're working on new programs and they're getting delayed but there's no program cancellations and there's some uncertainty when they're going to go forward, but we're full out working on tremendous number of opportunities. So, we think it's a destocking issue and it's not an overall demand issue and we think we'll work through it. And you can see some of that starting to happen with the order trends in our business.\nDeane Dray: Excellent. I'll leave it there. Just a quick shout out. That was a nice free cash flow this quarter. thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Deane. The team did a great job.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Hey thanks. Good morning everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey good morning. Hey David I was on a little late, so I don't know if you just listening to your answer to Deane, I don't know if you already specifically commented on Paragon. But just in terms of the sales trajectory there if you wouldn't mind repeating it. And then just on EMG overall right? It's certainly kind of an interesting set of cross currents right with destock going on but orders up 12% organically? Maybe you could just unpack a little bit more kind of the moving pieces inside that if you haven't already.\nDave Zapico: Yes, I haven't gone deeper, but I can say that every division at EMG was up substantially in orders. So, it wasn't one area. So it was across the board all parts of EMG are up in order. So, we're really encouraged by that. Speaking of Paragon, again, it's a single-use and consumable surgical instruments business implantable components in attractive med tech markets with solid growth rates. And we continue to be excited about the future growth opportunities, excellent engineering capability, leading additive manufacturing capability. Many, many new program wins which will provide upside as these things get phased in. And the business is really well-positioned when the destocking headwinds abate. At the same time we're working on substantial efficiency improvements in the business. And the team is really doing an excellent job of doing that because of some difficult things that are going on. And -- but that process is proceeding well. So, I'm very pleased. I mean Paragon met its expectations for Q3. They had a similar sequential order improvement that we talked about in our other businesses and overall very pleased with it.\nJeff Sprague: Dave then on sort of the margin recovery plan itself obviously the restructuring in Q1 and I guess if there's a silver lining in the drawdown right maybe it allows you to accelerate some things on restructuring and the like. Can you give us a sense of sort of the likely tailwind into 2025 as we work through some of these things and arguably sales start to kind of stabilize pick back up into the new year?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I think the scenario you're talking about is something that has a high likelihood of happening. But when you talk about 2025, we don't give guidance at this time of the year. So, we're going to stay away from that and talking about next year. But the things that you're pointing to are correct. I mean it's a tough time. We're improving the business significantly. There are some plant closures in there and we're continuing to fund all the new product phases in. So, it's going to be a very, very positive scenario as we move forward with that business.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you for in the insights. Appreciate it.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Hey, I had a couple of cleanups. Just to kind of put a bow on the destocking. I mean you guys were clear that destocking should continue through the end of the year. I think you mentioned that it continues again now Dave. The orders seem to indicate that we're getting there. I don't know whether your comment was implied was intended to imply any continuation in the next year?\nDave Zapico: Yes, I think we've definitely stabilized in the last couple of orders we're seeing quarters we're seeing incremental orders growth. We're encouraged by that. We're seeing it in EMG where the destocking was occurring. We're seeing it in all of our businesses. So, that's all positive. But this destock isn't like a switch. There's going to be -- we're going to slowly improve. As we get into next year, we'll give you the guidance for next year. But whether the destock occurs or not, we're going to make money. And that's what we're working on the operations side. So my point is there's positive trends now. We haven't given guidance for next year. We go through our standard process with sitting down with each business and go through a comprehensive budgeting process. We look at market conditions and sales opportunities and cost reduction opportunities and decide what investments to fund. And it's very important to follow this process right now given all the macro geopolitical and election uncertainty, because -- that's why we're firm on doing -- working through our process and giving you a good look at the best information we have at the beginning of next year.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you. And then if I may on the acquisition pipeline, your balance sheet looks great. Obviously, the pipeline is robust. Are you seeing any similar hesitation to commit amongst your potential inquiries is slowing things down? Or should we just assume things come on stock as normal process? Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes, that's a good question. Excellent question, Rob. And this is just my subjective read on the market, but I feel like things are coming on stock. We were in a period where things were -- everybody was dealing with higher interest rates and trying to get their businesses in order. But our pipeline is robust and we're talking to a lot of people about a lot of things. So I feel like sometime next year -- sometime early next year. It feels like things are moving and it feels like they're moving at an accelerated pace.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners.\nScott Graham: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Really just a couple of them. You're doing a lot of investing internally. The Vitality is up to 28%. Dave you mentioned that you're really heavily focused on some differentiated products. Could you maybe unbundle that a little bit more? And I know Vitality the percentage is always a tricky thing, because it's a three-year trail. But nevertheless is that a number that you think can go even higher? And maybe which businesses -- I know that you're single titers. I get all that. But is there anything that's standing out to you in certain business units? And where can that index go?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think -- we think the right level for our business is between 20% and 30%. And we're at 28% and it could go down to 20% or go up to 30% and that's probably the right range. As you mentioned, it's very distributed across our company. We're spending incrementally $90 million on projects. They're good projects. They're going to result in good sales in the future. In some cases they're coming in at lower price points too. There's been a good job of cost reductions through the new development processes. So, it's -- and when you have the fresh up-to-date product line and you're a leader in the niche markets that we're in it enables you to justify premium pricing for the new products. So, that all feels good. It all feels -- it's working well and it's part of our core. So, we've -- as you know you've followed us for a long time whether the market is good or the market is bad, we fund the R&D spending consistently and it's paid off for us in the long run and we plan to continue it.\nScott Graham: Thank you. I just wanted to ask something that's a little bit more forward-looking to the extent that you can answer it. One of your two very large aerospace customers is struggling in various parts of their portfolio in production. I'm just wondering does that dampen your potential outlook for 2025 in your Aerospace business.\nDave Zapico: Yes. We haven't done the detailed work on 2025. And related to the situation, we did see some minor delays in the quarter but we were able to work around them. And we factored in the impact that we know of for Q4, and it's a fluid situation obviously but we feel confident in our guide for Q4. Our Aerospace businesses have diverse exposures across a wide range of platforms a very healthy mix of OEM and aftermarket sales. There's no overexposure to any single platform or any single customer. So we're feeling good about that. And there's a strong demand and we're well positioned to benefit from it. And we're not selling as much up on the value chain. We focus on what we do well, the technologies in the niche markets that we focus on. And we really feel that, we're in a good position going forward. And hopefully, some of the larger customers can work through some of the situations that we're in, but we think we have a call properly for the rest of this year.\nScott Graham: Great. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning, all.\nDave Zapico: Hello, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: Hey. Just wanted to come back to the OEM dynamic and the destock once more. So you noted some of the internal exercises or the math the teams were doing to gauge that pressure. I guess, is there any way to quantify in revenue dollars or order percent? How much of the pressure on results this year has been related to OEM destock?\nDave Zapico: I'd say that -- yes, if you go back to Q2, we talked about it, it's pretty significant. It's significant. So if that reverses, that's clearly not -- it's a headwind that's not there for next year. So yeah, it was -- in our automation business and with Paragon, that de-stock was substantial.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And then just on the project delays. So I think you noted it was various verticals. I guess what are you hearing from customers in terms of project readiness and when these might return? Are you contemplating any catch-up in the fourth quarter as part of the guide? Or have you slid that expectation to 2025?\nDave Zapico: I think our Q4 guide for our project businesses and EIG assumes a normal calendar Q4 that's pretty strong. So we'll see a sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 related to seasonality, related to projects in that business. So it feels like there's definitely some year-end spending going on. So that's positive.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. Best of luck.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to come back to orders. Plus 2% organic, I think, is what you said. So that's great news. I don't think you were signaling the return to growth until the fourth quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So just anything happened during September that changed that? Any call out? Was there some aerospace -- just any color there? And then maybe on sort of the back end of that, if we kind of like look at the implied organic orders, it seems like there's about $140 million or thereabout $140 million, $150 million of backlog growth that's not organic that's a big number. So I'm just wondering, what the book-to-bill was for Paragon? And whether this Virtek acquisition has influence as well?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. The first point is we don't give guidance on orders. So I don't know how you got your information on the Q3 being a quarter late. But in any event, it's what it was. The second point was -- A - Kevin Coleman Backlog build.\nDave Zapico: The backlog build, yeah, we don't have that number in front of us. It's something we look at. It was $3.44 billion for the company and pretty healthy. And it's -- and the orders turn positive. So I think it's -- I wouldn't read too much into it. It's just positive. We're just encouraged by the positive trends and maybe it did occur earlier than you thought it would be. And we think we're going to have a good quarter in Q4.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Okay. Maybe I'm just mistaken there. And then looking at Paragon, obviously, I think you asked about the -- seen in sales this year is really inventory draw. Should we consider that to be sort of one-time in nature and therefore, we spring back to original plan in 2025? Or do you think it might take a little bit longer to achieve that?\nDave Zapico: So Nigel, your question broke up on our end, and we couldn't hear you. But we...\nNigel Coe: Okay. Paragon the inventory impact has reversed basically in 2025?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I mean as that inventory situation abates it's definitely going to improve in 2025. And hopefully it improves in 2025 and we have a low cost -- lower cost structure and we also have a lot of new products that we're phasing in. It's going to take some time like I said you don't throw a switch. But yes I really think it is going to improve in 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. A lot of time spent on the EMG orders. And Dave you gave the kind of sequential improvement in the year-over-year for EIG. But wondering if we could go a little further into the sequential 3Q over 2Q orders pattern for EIG maybe anything on book-to-bill there?\nDave Zapico: Yes. The book-to-bill for the whole company was 1.02 and it was above one for both of the groups. That's what I can give you there.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. That covers all that. And then last quarter you talked about defense delays and you had a couple of mid single-digit quarters for A&D versus the high single-digit guide. Is -- what's the status update on the defense? And is that something that you have factored in pretty strong in the fourth quarter?\nDave Zapico: Yes. Yes we had -- Q2 and Q3 there's a little bit of project timing on that and we think that's going to reverse and there's some good things scheduled for us in Q4. That business is excellent because it's growing. The defense business is growing, but it is project based. So it can be lumpy but -- it's lumpy and headed in the right direction. So you're looking at it the right way.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thanks. Lastly, I'm not sure if it was asked multiple companies coming through here. But the deal pipeline just curious mix of small larger actionability?\nDave Zapico: Yes. The deal pipeline remains strong. We're actively looking at a high number of quality deals. We obviously have got the cash and the credit facilities to execute. That's recognized by sellers. The pipeline is a variety of deal sizes and we're very active. And what I mentioned before it feels like things are starting to move a little bit more in that area than they were maybe in the last six or nine months.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. Thanks a lot.\nDave Zapico: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning. Can you hear me?\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew. Yes.\nAndrew Obin: Hi. How are you? Look I appreciate Dave that you don't give guide on orders. But just checking if my math is correct. If I do look on a two-year stack just third quarter of last year organically was the easiest comp in the year. And I think sort of right it was minus 10 and it just goes to minus two by Q4. And if I look at Q2 and Q3 on a two-year stack, for orders, I'm just wondering, is it reasonable to assume that we've bottomed and by fourth quarter, we could return to growth is just arithmetically, it would suggest that we'll probably continue to be -- we'll go back to order decline. And I know you don't guide it, but we're just getting a lot of questions from investors, when do orders impact for these short-cycle names? And look, I get it, it's macro. You don't have a specialty crystal ball. I appreciate all these things.\nDave Zapico : Yes, that's right. Our crystal ball is no better than anyone else's. But we don't look at the two-year stack numbers, so I can't comment on your numbers. What I can comment is that there's been healthy sequential increases from Q2 to Q3. So and we also saw a sequential increase from Q1 to Q2. So, along with the two-year stack on the year-over-year and we gave the organic numbers already, the sequential numbers are -- they were up mid single digits in the quarter. So that's an encouraging fact from our viewpoint.\nAndrew Obin: No. Really appreciate it, more than I expected. And just a follow-up question on Paragon and it's a different business. I mean, it's med tech, right? So a lot more regulation. Could you just give us an update on the time line of your restructuring? And obviously, AMETEK playbook is as good as anyone's in the industrial world. But how do you apply this playbook on timing of the restructuring and getting things out fast in terms of costs in a regulated environment where you can't just move production from one facility to another. You can't. It's all subject to regulatory approval. Can you just -- what lessons are being learned? And what has the speed of restructuring been relative to -- I'm sure, very high expectations? Thank you.\nDave Zapico : Yes, because the environment is regulated, and we know that because we have another business in the space that we moved factories. So our EMC business is a sister business to Paragon. So we're very experienced with the regulatory environment and our timing is adjusted for it, and you have to move slow and you have to be careful when it takes a bit longer, just like moving an aerospace business, or just like moving a defense business, or just like moving a utility business. So we operate in a lot of regulated markets. That's really our focus. We like regulated markets. This isn't new for us. It's kind of core. If you look at our whole portfolio. And -- but you're right, it does take time, and we're going to do it right.\nAndrew Obin: So on time. Really appreciate it.\nDave Zapico : Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.\nJoe Giordano : Hey, guys. Good morning.\nDave Zapico : Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano : Just curious on the aero, you mentioned like you're taking everything into consideration. I know you're a very balanced there, but is your Boeing OE exposure like are you essentially assuming zero in the fourth quarter? Or are you still selling to like maybe Tier 1s or something where you can still ship?\nDave Zapico : Yes, I think you've got it right. I mean, the -- where we have confirmed orders to lower levels of the supply chain is zero. And if there was anything direct, that's removed.\nJoe Giordano : Got it. And then apologies if I missed this, I had joined a little bit late. But on Paragon, did you give an updated 2024 like revenue number that you expect from them or a contribution number?\nDave Zapico : No, we didn't give the number. And the number that we gave last quarter still holds, and Paragon executed in line with what they thought they did for this quarter. It was a good quarter for them. We also talked about the sequential orders growing in Paragon too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Hey. Thanks for let me back. And just a really quick follow-up, Dave can you just give us an update on price and then what you're seeing on kind of price cost spread in the quarter? And do you think that changing any -- as we move into Q4 the early part of 2025?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. That's a good question, Jeff. I mean price -- it seems we're getting back to more normal patterns. In the quarter we got three points of price pretty consistent across the portfolio and we got about 100 basis points of positive spread to the P&L from it. So I think the days of the high inflation the higher price are abating. And I think we're in the normal -- if you look into the next year normal price/cost spread where we are always positive by 50 basis points and the number is like 2% to 3%.\nJeff Sprague: Right. Thanks again.\nDave Zapico: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KBCM.\nDave Zapico: Hi Steve.\nSteve Barger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning.\nSteve Barger: I'll just ask a question on the semi-cap cycle. It feels like expectations are moderating a bit due to slower recovery in some consumer products, but I know there's still a lot of optimism around leading-edge investments coming through. I think you're in deep back to detection and more leading edge. But based on how your portfolio is positioned can you match or outgrow whatever the equipment market does, as the cycle improves?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I think we can. I mean, in the -- for example in the quarter, our semiconductor businesses were up mid-single digits and that was -- we had growth and it was driven by the uniqueness of the product portfolio. And the one thing about our portfolio is that we have a lot of laboratory semiconductor stuff that gets worked on during the -- between the cycles and then the production stuff that happens. So there's a natural balance in there. And we usually don't have large swings either way that kind of compensate or they're not correlated with each other. So it's a positive market. I mean you have some dynamics with China. We have some dynamics with new technology. We have a product in our CAMECA business that's been developed is very unique and best-in-class that's we're selling quite well now. So yeah, we were up mid-single digits. We think we'll be up mid-single digits for the year in semiconductor. That's about 6% of our portfolio. And we haven't done the planning for 2025. But if anything or -- that's a market that buys technology and our technology is getting better.\nSteve Barger: That's great.\nDave Zapico: In fact, a small acquisition that we did Polygon Physics was related to an ion source technology that is specifically used in EUV manufacturing and gives us some capability in the advanced semiconductor space.\nSteve Barger: Understood. And so does it feel like the cycle itself -- and I know you do have some lab exposure but for the more high-volume production cycle does it feel like we're inflecting?\nDave Zapico: Yeah. I mean you read all the industry things out there, and it feels like there's some inflection points, but then you got some geopolitical dynamics and \u2026\nSteve Barger: Yeah.\nDave Zapico: \u2026kind of sit back and see what happens on that one.\nSteve Barger: Got it. Thanks.\nDave Zapico: Thank you Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now hand the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer Kevin Coleman, for any closing remarks.\nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder a replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's program. And you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our business has executed extremely well, resulted in earnings per share above our expectations, solid margin performance, outstanding cash flow conversion and double-digit growth in overall orders with positive growth in organic orders. Additionally, during the quarter, we deployed approximately $60 million on share repurchases. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired Virtek Vision, an excellent strategic fit with our Creaform business. I am very pleased with our team's performance. Our businesses remain focused on managing through short-term macro headwinds, while ensuring we are positioned for long-term growth. We have a proven successful growth model, and efficient operating structure, robust cash flows, a strong balance sheet and leading positions across a diverse set of niche markets. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial results. Third quarter sales were $1.71 billion, up 5% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 2%, acquisitions added 7.5 points and foreign currency was flat. Overall, orders in the quarter were up 12%. Book-to-bill was 1.02 and organic orders were up 2%. Additionally, we saw a solid sequential growth in orders. We ended the quarter with a strong backlog of $3.44 billion near record levels. AMETEK's operational performance in the third quarter was excellent. Our disciplined approach to cost management and operational efficiency resulted in strong margins. Operating income in the quarter was $446 million, a 2% increase over the third quarter of 2023 and operating margins were 26.1% in the quarter. Core margins, excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency were very strong at 27.4%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was $553 million, up 4% versus the prior year with EBITDA margins an impressive, 31.2%. Cash flow in the third quarter was excellent with free cash flow up 4% versus the prior year and free cash flow conversion of very strong 135%, reflecting our asset-light business model and operating capability. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.66 per diluted share, up 1% versus the third quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.60 to $1.62 per share. Now, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG continues to perform well with strong margin expansion and overall outstanding levels of operating margins reflecting the quality of our businesses. EIG sales were $1.13 billion in line with the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 2% and acquisitions contributed two points. Growth remains solid across our Aerospace & Defense businesses, while our high-end research instrumentation business CAMECA also saw strong growth in the quarter. While we did see some temporary delays in project spending across parts of our EIG business as we had expected our new funnel pipeline remains solid and our businesses are very well positioned across a number of secular growth markets. EIG operating income was $339 million, up 1% and operating margins were a very strong 29.9%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. EIG core margins were 30.2%, up 70 basis points versus last year's third quarter. Now switching to the Electromechanical Group. EMG's third quarter sales were $574 million, up 18% versus the prior year with organic sales down 3% and acquisitions contributing over 20 points to growth. Strong growth across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter was offset by expected weakness with our OEM-exposed businesses due to the impact of inventory destocking. EMG orders were very strong in the quarter growing 12% organically. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $132 million, up 3% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's third quarter operating margins were 22.9% with excellent core margins of 26.1%. AMETEK delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, effectively navigating demand headwinds to deliver strong results. We remain focused on executing our growth model and positioning AMETEK for continued long-term growth, while ensuring we deliver strong results in the face of a choppy macro environment. Now turning to our acquisition strategy. Strategic acquisitions are a core component of our growth model. We are committed to deploying our strong cash flow and acquisitions to expand our portfolio in highly attractive market segments. With that I'm excited to announce our newest acquisition Virtek Vision. Virtek Vision is a leading provider of laser-based projection and inspection systems, offering a suite of 2D and 3D laser projectors, smart cameras and advanced measurement solutions powered by their proprietary AI software. Virtek's automated systems enhance productivity, improve quality and reduce cost, across a range of aerospace defense and industrial applications. Virtek is an excellent strategic fit with our Creaform business, broadening its technology offerings and enabling a wider range of automation and inspection capabilities for our customers. Virtek is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada and has annual sales of approximately $40 million. I would like to welcome the Virtek team to the AMETEK family. Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust. As noted, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet and anticipate remaining active in this area. AMETEK also remains committed to investing in our businesses to ensure they are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we are investing an incremental $90 million in growth initiatives including our new product development efforts where our teams are focused on developing highly differentiated technologies to help solve our customers' most complex challenges. Throughout our business, we see countless examples of innovative products and technologies being developed to support our customers and provide them with the advanced differentiated capabilities to need. One way we measure the success of our new product development activities is through our Vitality Index, which measures the sales from products introduced over the past three years. In the third quarter, our Vitality Index was an outstanding 28%. In addition to our internal development activities, I'm also pleased to announce that our CAMECA business, a leader in micro-analytical and metrology instrumentation recently completed a small technology acquisition of Polygon Physics. Polygon Physics specializes in ultracompact, ultra-low power electron cyclotron resonance technology. This technology enhances CAMECA's capabilities and advanced metrology instrumentation and advanced chip manufacturing. Polygon provides us access to cutting-edge ion source technology and expertise that will help accelerate CAMECA's new product development efforts and enhance their technology portfolio. We're excited to welcome the Polygon team to AMETEK. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given our third quarter results, we are raising our earnings guidance for the full year. We continue to expect overall sales to be up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.77 to $6.82, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $6.70 to $6.80 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits with earnings in the range of $1.81 to $1.86, up 8% to 11% versus the prior year. In summary, I'm pleased with the team's performance in the quarter and thus far in 2024. We're managing through an uncertain macro environment and confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. AMETEK has been very successful over a long period of time managing a diverse set of highly differentiated niche businesses. The AMETEK growth model has allowed us to deliver double-digit earnings growth throughout different phases of the economic cycle. The strength of our portfolio combined with our operational excellence capabilities and acquisition strategy has allowed us to deliver outstanding results. This has also allowed us to successfully manage through periods of economic weakness or uncertainty and emerge even stronger with exceptional growth. We are excited for the future. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will take us through some of the financial details of the quarter. And then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip? Morning, Matt. Yeah, sure. We saw -- in terms of the destock, we saw demand largely in line with our expectations in the quarter. Actually as both our OEM customers and our automation and Paragon businesses continue to work down excess levels of inventory. And the destocking headwinds are going to continue. We remain well-positioned on a range of attractive programs within both the automation business and the Paragon business. And we're really encouraged by the trend in recent order rates. We had the -- in EMG where the main destocking areas was up plus 12 organically. Again we had a positive book-to-bill of 1.02. And if you just look at the trends, the trends are heading in the right direction. So we stabilized we saw solid sequential growth in orders and we're feeling pretty good about that. Sure. Yeah, I'll do that Matt. In terms of the project lease we spoke about last quarter this quarter played out largely as expected. Customers remain cautious given the impact of various economic, geopolitical and election uncertainties. And these project delays are specifically in our EIG test and measurement businesses. That's what we talked about last quarter. And the key point here is our new opportunity funnel remains strong. So things are definitely not getting worse. In fact, the EIG orders trend went from minus 11 organic in Q1 to minus four organic in Q2 to minus two organic in Q3. So we're feeling pretty good about the -- encouraged by the positive trend there. Thank you, Matt. Good morning, Deane. Great set of questions. I'll try to get them all, and if I forget anything, pull me back to it. I'll go around the one first, and talk about our process business. Both, overall and organic sales for our process businesses, declined low single digits in the quarter. Growth, remains solid across our energy businesses. We had a good quarter in energy. And also our high-end research business, we talked about CAMECA also had a very strong growth in the quarter. And looking ahead, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be flat to up low single digits for the full year. Next switching the Aerospace & Defense. Aerospace & Defense is about 18% of AMETEK, delivered strong performance in the quarter, both overall and organic sales were up mid-single digits. Growth was strongest across our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. A reminder, we have a good balance between sales and defense and we have a good balance between OEM products and aftermarket. And additionally, we're on a wide range of applications and not dependent on any one platform. So, we're positioned well to benefit from the long-term growth across these markets. And for the full year, we continue to expect high single-digit organic growth for our aerospace and defense businesses. Next, I'll go to power and industrial. Power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter driven by the contributions of Amplifier Research and UEI, recent acquisitions both of them. Organic sales were down low single digits in the quarter. We expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be down low single digits for the full year. Then, finally our Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment. Overall, sales there increased in the low 20% range, driven primarily by the contributions of Paragon Medical. Organic sales were down, high single digits due to continued normalization of inventory across our OEM customer base. And for the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to decline mid-single digits as the headwinds from destocking continue. Talking about the geographies, yes, a little different in the mix there. We had strong growth in Europe and Asia, offset by some declines in the US. You talked specifically about China. Our Asia business did well, and China was actually up 10%. We had strong growth in our UPT or Ultra Precision Technology division, AMETEK products are used by our customers in China to improve their manufacturing processes, automate processes, make the environment cleaner, produce energy. So, very well positioned. But that market will remain choppy and there's been some stimulus announced, but the results that we're seeing now aren't from stimulus or just from market share wins and making good headway in the markets. But it's very difficult to predict, what's happening in China. So it's just wait and see what happens each quarter. Yes. That's a great question, and it's obviously difficult to parse, but we're pretty confident that we're working through a supply chain crisis level of inventory that -- and we have some math you can see, when we work through that and then there's the same kind of growth on the other end of it. And same thing is happening in the medical space as the automation space. So, we're seeing -- the other factor that influences our decision, is the new business activity the pipeline activity. Our customers are very active. We're working on new programs and they're getting delayed but there's no program cancellations and there's some uncertainty when they're going to go forward, but we're full out working on tremendous number of opportunities. So, we think it's a destocking issue and it's not an overall demand issue and we think we'll work through it. And you can see some of that starting to happen with the order trends in our business. Thank you, Deane. The team did a great job. Good morning Jeff. Yes, I haven't gone deeper, but I can say that every division at EMG was up substantially in orders. So, it wasn't one area. So it was across the board all parts of EMG are up in order. So, we're really encouraged by that. Speaking of Paragon, again, it's a single-use and consumable surgical instruments business implantable components in attractive med tech markets with solid growth rates. And we continue to be excited about the future growth opportunities, excellent engineering capability, leading additive manufacturing capability. Many, many new program wins which will provide upside as these things get phased in. And the business is really well-positioned when the destocking headwinds abate. At the same time we're working on substantial efficiency improvements in the business. And the team is really doing an excellent job of doing that because of some difficult things that are going on. And -- but that process is proceeding well. So, I'm very pleased. I mean Paragon met its expectations for Q3. They had a similar sequential order improvement that we talked about in our other businesses and overall very pleased with it. Yes, I think the scenario you're talking about is something that has a high likelihood of happening. But when you talk about 2025, we don't give guidance at this time of the year. So, we're going to stay away from that and talking about next year. But the things that you're pointing to are correct. I mean it's a tough time. We're improving the business significantly. There are some plant closures in there and we're continuing to fund all the new product phases in. So, it's going to be a very, very positive scenario as we move forward with that business. Thank you, Jeff. Yes, I think we've definitely stabilized in the last couple of orders we're seeing quarters we're seeing incremental orders growth. We're encouraged by that. We're seeing it in EMG where the destocking was occurring. We're seeing it in all of our businesses. So, that's all positive. But this destock isn't like a switch. There's going to be -- we're going to slowly improve. As we get into next year, we'll give you the guidance for next year. But whether the destock occurs or not, we're going to make money. And that's what we're working on the operations side. So my point is there's positive trends now. We haven't given guidance for next year. We go through our standard process with sitting down with each business and go through a comprehensive budgeting process. We look at market conditions and sales opportunities and cost reduction opportunities and decide what investments to fund. And it's very important to follow this process right now given all the macro geopolitical and election uncertainty, because -- that's why we're firm on doing -- working through our process and giving you a good look at the best information we have at the beginning of next year. Yes, that's a good question. Excellent question, Rob. And this is just my subjective read on the market, but I feel like things are coming on stock. We were in a period where things were -- everybody was dealing with higher interest rates and trying to get their businesses in order. But our pipeline is robust and we're talking to a lot of people about a lot of things. So I feel like sometime next year -- sometime early next year. It feels like things are moving and it feels like they're moving at an accelerated pace. Thank you. Yes. I think -- we think the right level for our business is between 20% and 30%. And we're at 28% and it could go down to 20% or go up to 30% and that's probably the right range. As you mentioned, it's very distributed across our company. We're spending incrementally $90 million on projects. They're good projects. They're going to result in good sales in the future. In some cases they're coming in at lower price points too. There's been a good job of cost reductions through the new development processes. So, it's -- and when you have the fresh up-to-date product line and you're a leader in the niche markets that we're in it enables you to justify premium pricing for the new products. So, that all feels good. It all feels -- it's working well and it's part of our core. So, we've -- as you know you've followed us for a long time whether the market is good or the market is bad, we fund the R&D spending consistently and it's paid off for us in the long run and we plan to continue it. Yes. We haven't done the detailed work on 2025. And related to the situation, we did see some minor delays in the quarter but we were able to work around them. And we factored in the impact that we know of for Q4, and it's a fluid situation obviously but we feel confident in our guide for Q4. Our Aerospace businesses have diverse exposures across a wide range of platforms a very healthy mix of OEM and aftermarket sales. There's no overexposure to any single platform or any single customer. So we're feeling good about that. And there's a strong demand and we're well positioned to benefit from it. And we're not selling as much up on the value chain. We focus on what we do well, the technologies in the niche markets that we focus on. And we really feel that, we're in a good position going forward. And hopefully, some of the larger customers can work through some of the situations that we're in, but we think we have a call properly for the rest of this year. Thank you, Scott. Hello, Brett. I'd say that -- yes, if you go back to Q2, we talked about it, it's pretty significant. It's significant. So if that reverses, that's clearly not -- it's a headwind that's not there for next year. So yeah, it was -- in our automation business and with Paragon, that de-stock was substantial. I think our Q4 guide for our project businesses and EIG assumes a normal calendar Q4 that's pretty strong. So we'll see a sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 related to seasonality, related to projects in that business. So it feels like there's definitely some year-end spending going on. So that's positive. Thank you. Yeah. The first point is we don't give guidance on orders. So I don't know how you got your information on the Q3 being a quarter late. But in any event, it's what it was. The second point was -- A - Kevin Coleman Backlog build. The backlog build, yeah, we don't have that number in front of us. It's something we look at. It was $3.44 billion for the company and pretty healthy. And it's -- and the orders turn positive. So I think it's -- I wouldn't read too much into it. It's just positive. We're just encouraged by the positive trends and maybe it did occur earlier than you thought it would be. And we think we're going to have a good quarter in Q4. So Nigel, your question broke up on our end, and we couldn't hear you. But we... Yes. I mean as that inventory situation abates it's definitely going to improve in 2025. And hopefully it improves in 2025 and we have a low cost -- lower cost structure and we also have a lot of new products that we're phasing in. It's going to take some time like I said you don't throw a switch. But yes I really think it is going to improve in 2025. Yes. The book-to-bill for the whole company was 1.02 and it was above one for both of the groups. That's what I can give you there. Yes. Yes we had -- Q2 and Q3 there's a little bit of project timing on that and we think that's going to reverse and there's some good things scheduled for us in Q4. That business is excellent because it's growing. The defense business is growing, but it is project based. So it can be lumpy but -- it's lumpy and headed in the right direction. So you're looking at it the right way. Yes. The deal pipeline remains strong. We're actively looking at a high number of quality deals. We obviously have got the cash and the credit facilities to execute. That's recognized by sellers. The pipeline is a variety of deal sizes and we're very active. And what I mentioned before it feels like things are starting to move a little bit more in that area than they were maybe in the last six or nine months. Thanks, Chris. Good morning, Andrew. Yes. Yes, that's right. Our crystal ball is no better than anyone else's. But we don't look at the two-year stack numbers, so I can't comment on your numbers. What I can comment is that there's been healthy sequential increases from Q2 to Q3. So and we also saw a sequential increase from Q1 to Q2. So, along with the two-year stack on the year-over-year and we gave the organic numbers already, the sequential numbers are -- they were up mid single digits in the quarter. So that's an encouraging fact from our viewpoint. Yes, because the environment is regulated, and we know that because we have another business in the space that we moved factories. So our EMC business is a sister business to Paragon. So we're very experienced with the regulatory environment and our timing is adjusted for it, and you have to move slow and you have to be careful when it takes a bit longer, just like moving an aerospace business, or just like moving a defense business, or just like moving a utility business. So we operate in a lot of regulated markets. That's really our focus. We like regulated markets. This isn't new for us. It's kind of core. If you look at our whole portfolio. And -- but you're right, it does take time, and we're going to do it right. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Joe. Yes, I think you've got it right. I mean, the -- where we have confirmed orders to lower levels of the supply chain is zero. And if there was anything direct, that's removed. No, we didn't give the number. And the number that we gave last quarter still holds, and Paragon executed in line with what they thought they did for this quarter. It was a good quarter for them. We also talked about the sequential orders growing in Paragon too. Yeah. That's a good question, Jeff. I mean price -- it seems we're getting back to more normal patterns. In the quarter we got three points of price pretty consistent across the portfolio and we got about 100 basis points of positive spread to the P&L from it. So I think the days of the high inflation the higher price are abating. And I think we're in the normal -- if you look into the next year normal price/cost spread where we are always positive by 50 basis points and the number is like 2% to 3%. Thanks Jeff. Hi Steve. Good morning. Yeah. I think we can. I mean, in the -- for example in the quarter, our semiconductor businesses were up mid-single digits and that was -- we had growth and it was driven by the uniqueness of the product portfolio. And the one thing about our portfolio is that we have a lot of laboratory semiconductor stuff that gets worked on during the -- between the cycles and then the production stuff that happens. So there's a natural balance in there. And we usually don't have large swings either way that kind of compensate or they're not correlated with each other. So it's a positive market. I mean you have some dynamics with China. We have some dynamics with new technology. We have a product in our CAMECA business that's been developed is very unique and best-in-class that's we're selling quite well now. So yeah, we were up mid-single digits. We think we'll be up mid-single digits for the year in semiconductor. That's about 6% of our portfolio. And we haven't done the planning for 2025. But if anything or -- that's a market that buys technology and our technology is getting better. In fact, a small acquisition that we did Polygon Physics was related to an ion source technology that is specifically used in EUV manufacturing and gives us some capability in the advanced semiconductor space. Yeah. I mean you read all the industry things out there, and it feels like there's some inflection points, but then you got some geopolitical dynamics and \u2026 \u2026kind of sit back and see what happens on that one. Thank you Steve."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter with excellent operating performance and high free cash flow conversion. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $25 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year. As a percentage of sales, G&A expense came in at 1.4% of sales down from 1.5% in last year's third quarter. For fiscal year 2024 general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Third quarter interest expense was $25 million up $7 million from the third quarter of 2023, due to higher debt balances following recent acquisitions. Third quarter other operating expenses were down $4 million versus the prior period due largely to higher pension income and lower acquisition-related due diligence expense in the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% up from 17.7% in the third quarter of 2023. For 2024, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 17% and 17.5% driven by a lower fourth quarter tax rate due to statute expirations. As we have stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from the full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $90 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $395 million, including after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $188 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the third quarter was 19% of sales. Cash flow generation in the third quarter was excellent. Operating cash flow was $487 million, up 3% versus the third quarter of 2023, while free cash flow was $461 million, up 4% over the prior year. This was a record third quarter level for both operating and free cash flow generation. Free cash flow conversion was also outstanding at 135% in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% to 120% of net income. During the quarter, we spent $60 million on share repurchases, repurchasing approximately 371,000 shares of our common stock in the open market. Additionally at the end of the quarter, we paid down a maturing $300 million private placement note. Total debt at September 30th was $2.34 billion, down $360 million in the quarter and down approximately $1 billion from the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $396 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times. We have significant financial capacity and flexibility with over $2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our acquisition strategy and growth initiatives. In summary, AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our operational excellence initiatives and our strategic focus contributed to strong earnings, robust margins and excellent free cash flow. With a strong balance sheet, near-record backlog and leadership across our key markets, we are well-positioned for continued long-term growth. Kevin?"

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid results with a strong operating performance in the second quarter against the backdrop of a more subdued global growth environment. In the quarter, we experienced continued headwinds from inventory destocking across our OEM customer base, leading to lower-than-expected sales volumes. Additionally, we are seeing signs of customers turning more cautious leading to some temporary delays in project spending. Despite these headwinds, our businesses delivered strong operating performance in the quarter, we saw the growth in cash flow and earnings and robust core margin expansion reflecting the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK operating model. We expect the inventory destocking and more cautious customer behavior to continue in the back half of the year. As a result, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate these near-term headwinds. As we've done in the past, we will expand our focus on operational efficiencies and continue to invest back in our businesses utilize our strong balance sheet to deploy capital on strategic acquisitions and ensure we position AMETEK for continued long-term growth. Now let me turn to our second quarter financial results. Sales in the quarter - sales in the second quarter were $1.73 billion, up 5% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 2%. Acquisitions added 8 points in the quarter and foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was excellent with robust margin expansion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $448 million, 7% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 25.8% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a sizable 180 basis points in the quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $545 million, up 10% over prior year with EBITDA margins in impressive 31.4%. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent, reflecting our operating capability and asset-light business model. Operating cash flow in the quarter was up 14% to $381 million with free cash flow up 17% and free cash flow conversion of 107%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.66 per diluted share, up 6% versus the second quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.63 to $1.65 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG delivered strong operating performance with outstanding margin expansion. EIG sales were $1.15 billion, a 2% increase from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were flat and acquisitions contributed two points. Growth was strongest within our aerospace and defense and CAMECA businesses in the quarter. EIG operating income was $350 million, up 14% versus the prior year and operating margins were at 30.3%, up 320 basis points from the prior year. Our EIG businesses are operating at a very high level with excellent operating margins. They remain well-positioned to benefit from a number of important long-term secular growth drivers, given their increasing exposures to attractive markets across process, aerospace, power and energy markets. The electric mechanical group continues to navigate the impacts of inventory normalization across our automation and engineered solutions businesses. In the quarter, EMG sales were a record $81 million, a 14% increase compared to the prior year, driven by contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical. Organic sales declined 6% due to weakness in our automation and engineered solutions businesses, more than offsetting solid growth across our EMG, aerospace and defense businesses. Acquisitions contributed 20% in the quarter. Operating income for the second quarter was $123 million with operating margins at 21.2%, while core operating income margins were 25%. As we have noted for a number of quarters, OEM customers across a wide range of markets are reducing excess inventory built up during the supply chain prices. While we had expected to see conditions approved in the second half of year, we now believe demand within this OEM customer base will remain subdued at current levels through the end of 2024. This inventory normalization is also impacting our medical OEM businesses, including Paragon Medical, leading to near-term delays in orders and shipments. Paragon remains very well-positioned for strong growth once the inventory correction is complete, given their leadership position across a number of high-growth MedTech market segments. Additionally, Paragon has won a new programs that we're currently investing in, which will drive incremental growth in 2025 and beyond. As we noted last quarter, are leveraging our proven integration capabilities to drive meaningful operational improvements to best position Paragon for long-term success. As the volumes return following destocking, we believe the business will be levered to deliver outstanding sales growth and profitability. In summary, we are operating our businesses very well with 7% growth in operating income and 180 basis points of core margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flow with 17% free cash flow growth in the quarter. And for full year, we expect free cash flow to net income conversion be between 110% and 120%. The strength of AMETEK's operational excellence strategy is evident in our operating results. We continue to drive efficiency improvements across our businesses by leveraging our global infrastructure and OpEx initiatives. And this year, we now expect to generate $140 million in savings. We also remain committed to investing back into our businesses. And this year, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in growth, largely focused on research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index, which was a strong 24% in the quarter. Additionally, our strong free cash flow and flexible balance sheet provides us with ample financial capacity for strategic acquisitions. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities remain strong. AMETEK is very well positioned to continue to expand our portfolio of highly differentiated businesses that both our organic growth investments and our acquisition strategy. Now, turning to outlook for the remainder of the year. With destocking expected to continue through the balance of the year and some customers turning more cautious on project spending, we are adjusting our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. Overall, sales are now expected to be up 5% to 7% versus the prior year, with organic sales expected to be flat to down low single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.80, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. This is less than a 1% reduction from our prior earnings guidance range of $6.74 to $6.86 as our proactive productivity actions, along with a lower expected fourth quarter tax rate helped offset the impact of the reduced sales forecast. This guidance reflects second half sales and operating earnings, essentially in line with our first half results. For the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.62 per share, down 1% to 2% versus the prior year. In summary, we are pleased with our business's strong operating performance in the second quarter. We have a proven operating model and an experienced management team, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the sluggish demand environment and deliver exceptional long-term results. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Dal?\nDalip Puri: Thank, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had a solid second quarter with excellent operating performance leading to outstanding margin expansion and strong cash flows. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $25 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's second quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Second quarter interest expense was $31 million, up $12 million from the second quarter of 2023 due to higher debt balances following the acquisition of Paragon Medical in December. Second quarter other expense was down approximately $4 million versus the prior period, due largely to higher pension income and higher investment income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 19%, up from 18.2% in the second quarter of 2023. For 2024, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 17% and 18%, driven by a lower fourth quarter tax rate due to statute expirations. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from the full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $21 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $99 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million. This includes after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 18.6% of sales. Operating cash flow was $381 million, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2023. While free cash flow was $360 million, up 17% over the prior year. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 107% of net income. For the full year, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at June 30 was $2.65 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $397 million. At the end of second quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1 times. We have significant financial capacity and flexibility with $2.2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and deploy on strategic acquisitions. In summary, AMETEK had a solid second quarter of 2024, delivering strong results with robust margin expansion and excellent free cash flows. Our leading positions across attractive market segments Combined with our strong balance sheet and outstanding operating capabilities leaves us very well positioned to navigate the current environment and to deliver on our growth strategies. Kevin?\nKevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Dalip. Can we please open the lines for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, Dave, you seemed pretty convinced a quarter ago that the destocking phenomenon would wrap itself up by mid-year. So I guess relative to 90 days ago, can you maybe talk a little bit about what's changed? What gives you confidence that we're only in for another six months of this? And then maybe touch on what end markets and businesses are starting to be impacted by some of the project delays you referenced? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Yes. Our outlook for the year has changed. And as we noted in my prepared remarks, we now expect the improvements in the second half of the year are not going to happen as originally anticipated, and we talked about that earlier in the year. We now expect our sales and operating performance in the second half will be similar to the growth that we \u2013 sales and operating performance in the first half. So we're not going to see the increases that we had anticipated. And this change results in about a four-point reduction in our sales outlook. And to your question, where is it coming from? Roughly three points of this reduction is our automation and engineered solutions subset, which is the businesses that we talked about being exposed to the OEM destocking. And within that area, we have two points of reduction tied to our automation business and one point from the Paragon destock. So that makes up about three to four-point reduction in our outlook. Across our EIG businesses, we expect about one point of lower sales due to short-term project delays. And there, we're seeing customers are being just a bit more cautious given the cumulative impact of wide range of economic, political and geopolitical factors. But we feel these are temporary delays. Our new funnel pipelines remain very solid, projects are not being canceled. They're being delayed. And given the expected lower sales, we reduced our earnings guidance by about $0.05 at the midpoint. Another couple of points. I mean, we've really done a good job running the company. It reflects when you take that sales decrease, it reflects about a 20% decremental margin on the expected lower sales. And as Dalip mentioned, the tax rate will be lower in Q4. So I'm pleased with how the team is managing through these temporary demand changes. I'm confident that we're positioned to see accelerated profit growth when the economic conditions change. I think to your point, we missed the timing of the recovery and the inventory corrections will take a bit longer. And as AMETEK does, we're adapting to the current situation, and we're going to manage our business appropriately. And as I said, we've got really pleased how the team responded with 20% decremental to the volume change.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks, David. I would definitely agree on the decremental comment. Can you also - I think it's probably good from a timing standpoint in the call. Can you kind of go ahead and do the - around the horn you typically do across the businesses and how expectations have kind of changed in some of the suburbs?\nDave Zapico: Sure, Matt. I'll start with our largest subsegment, the process. Sales for our Process businesses were up low single digits with solid growth across our energy businesses and our CAMECA business in the quarter. As noted in my prepared remarks, we've seen customers, as we just talked about, turn more cautious. We expect this to continue in the second half as we discussed, and we expect our process businesses to be flat to up low single digits versus the prior year. Now I'll move to aerospace and defense and that business was up mid-single digits in the quarter. Growth was strongest across our commercial aerospace businesses, while Defense experienced some shipment delays in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect strong high single-digit organic sales growth for our A&D business with similar growth across both our commercial and defense businesses. Next, I'll move to our Power & Industrial businesses. And overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the second quarter with contributions from recent acquisitions being offset by a low single-digit decrease in organic sales. Similar to our process businesses, our Power and Industrial are seeing the same kind of customers of delaying some projects due to the broader macro uncertainties. And for all of '24, we now expect organic sales for our Process and Industrial businesses to be flat compared to 2023. And our final segment, automation and Engineered Solutions. Self-segment sales, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the quarter. This was driven by the contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical. Organic sales in quarter were down approximately 10% due to the continued normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base, we expected to see improvements in return to growth, as we talked about in the second half of the year. And as we just mentioned, that's not going to happen. Inventory normalization is going to continue through the end of the year. And as a result, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be down mid-single digits for the full year. So that's a picture around the word at.\nMatt Summerville: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Dave, would like to pick up where you left off with Matt. And just some more color on the customers' kind of sentiment here and the delayed project spending. What kind of reasons are they giving you? Is it macro? Are they having trouble getting financing? Is it election worries? Any kind of way that you could characterize and frame for us about this degree of cautiousness?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think the - I think what we see from our customer base is they're just taking longer to approve projects. And they're going further up the sign-off chain, to get signed off. These are typically - they're not even large projects. And you see those resulting in delays. I think it's a combination of the elections in the U.S., I think two-thirds of the worlds have elections this year. So it's elections around the world. It's the - some financing related to the higher interest rate higher inflation. I mean, it's the worst. So just a lot of things that they're combining to affect people's decisions, and they're just delaying a bit, I mean the thing that's different than some other downturns is we still have very strong pipelines of new activity. So thinking about past downturns, we've been through a bunch of these, I don't think there's been any where we have a strong new activity pipeline from our customers. So the projects aren't being canceled. There may be some delays in phasing some new products in and maybe it's taken longer to get the financing, although that's not primary feedback we're getting. But I think it's this broader macro issue that's honestly a bit of smaller issue for us. The bigger issue is the OEM destock. So I think we had the pandemic. And then we had the supply chain crisis. And we're selling it in our automation and engineered solutions businesses differentiated components and subsystems to people that are typically smaller dollar value amounts to the entire system. And when people bought inventory, because we're very specialized, and they wanted to keep shipping the products. And now we're just dealing with a destocking process that's just taking a little longer than we thought. And I think that.\nDeane Dray: Yes, David, that's really helpful. I love the way you characterize it because in slowing, that's one of the first things you see customers do is they kind of delay the spending more approvals. And so that's pretty familiar. Do have any sense that it's snowballing from here? Does it get like as the quarter progressed did those type of behaviors increase? And any kind of monthly cadence would be helpful.\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think the monthly cadence in both sales and orders was our typical monthly cadence. So otherwise, we typically step through a quarter with the first month being the lowest and the second month being a little bit higher than the third month being the highest month of the quarter. That same process occurred. But definitely, as the quarter went on, we saw some incremental weakness mainly in the project area.\nDeane Dray: Got it. All right. Just last question on the destocking and when we look back on this period, that's been the biggest surprise how long it has persisted. And you're not, by far, the only one. We've seen this everywhere. Anyone has anything to do with medical or life sciences supplies chain it has just taken more than 2x longer than anyone thought. And just the question is for Paragon. What's their visibility like? You said they - a percent of point was from their, destock\u2026\nDave Zapico: Right.\nDeane Dray: What's their visibility versus your comparison of the rest of AMETEK businesses, where do they fit on that scale?\nDave Zapico: Yes, because Paragon is mainly in one end market, and they're talking to their customers daily. I think there's better visibility. And you can also talk to customers and get market information. So this the - talk that we're seeing is really happening everywhere. Just to refresh everybody's memory, Paragon manufactures single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable devices, orthopedic implantable devices, drug delivery systems, really attractive markets. At the same time, this is going on. We're working on substantial efficiency improvements in the businesses. We talked about that last quarter and this process is proceeding very well. So this combination of the market growth that follows the destock, along with the new program wins and leaned out and efficient cost structure is really going to provide substantial sales and profit growth for Paragon in the years ahead. We have a similar business and similar markets and another part of AMETEK, and it's seeing the same kind of destock and Paragon won a tremendous amount of new programs. So we're still investing and driving those things in the market. So I think when you take a step back, this is going to be a tremendous generator for our long-term shareholders, and we're very optimistic about the business. It's unfortunate about the destock process, but we're in this game for the long run, and we're doing all the ready things for the business and we've got a new management team with some really talented people from AMETEK that are working with people that are from Paragon and they have a great plan to take the business forward. So we're really optimistic about how that business is going to perform for us long term.\nDeane Dray: David, thanks for all that color. Really helpful.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning.\nJamie Cook: Nice quarter considering the environment. I guess just my first question, can you talk to sort of what price cost was in the quarter by segment and what your expectation is in an environment where organic growth is going to be flat to down single digit. And then my follow-up question, it also struck me about the quarter over the past couple of quarters is the margins in EIG above 30% with mediocre growth. So is there anything like, was there anything unusual to drive the operating margins there. What's structural? What's the risk that some of this goes away if pricing gets more difficult? I'm just trying to understand the performance in EIG margins, the good performance, given a tough macro. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Good questions, Jamie, and I'll try to answer them both. The first thing is you talked about pricing in the quarter. And our pricing in Q2 was about 3.5 points price, and our inflation was about 2.5 points. So we had a positive benefit from that. So the pricing environment is moderating a bit and the inflation is moderating a bit, but we're real pleased with that. And it was across our portfolio and maybe a little bit more in EMG just a bit than EMG, but it was pretty much across the portfolio at a pretty consistent performance, and that's driven by our differentiated portfolio on the heavy level of investments. We're putting in new products. We talked about a vitality index of 24%. We got newer products, fresh products in the market. Our customers are buying them. So - and that's resulting in some good pricing. And as I said, inflation is moderating. And we think that general environment, the moderation of inflation, but our ability to continue to leverage our investments are going to continue throughout the year. So, no change there, very, very consistent and it's kind of the AMETEK portfolio is very differentiated and kind of performed very well. In terms of the margins in EIG, if you think about - we've got a similar performance in the first quarter and excellent operating quarter. We had 320 basis points up driven by high leverage, excellent price cost, strongly performing acquisitions and a really good product mix. And that was consistent from Q2 to Q3. And we see that continuing for the rest of the year. I mean we do have a comp in Q3 margins is a difficult one, because that was a high-margin quarter for us if you look back the past few years. But in general, if you think about EIG, the margins are good and they're going to stay there, and that business is very well positioned. And it's - in our process, our Power and Industrial and our Aerospace businesses, we've got excellent market positions. And then just talking about the EMG part of the business, they had core margins of over 25%. So they got some dilution there because of the acquisition and destocking and automation in our medical businesses. But when we look at our businesses, they're running - both segments are running very well generating excellent margins. I think EIG has historically a bit of a higher margin entitlement, because they sell mainly to end users, and they get the aftermarket revenue stream and EMG is selling more to an OEM customer base, a little bit lower margin. So they're in relation to each other. And I see that continuing. I'm not really concerned that those margins are going to fall off or anything like that. So, does that answer your question, Jamie?\nJamie Cook: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Hope as going well, Dave. Hi, just on Paragon, I want to just make sure I have things dialed right here. I think your comment about a point of headwind, right, is on a total AMETEK basis.\nDave Zapico: Yes.\nJeff Sprague: So that implies $40 million or $50 million. So we're sort of talking about the business being down kind of 8%, 9%, 10% for the year. Is that basically where we're at?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I'd say you're between 10% and 15% is the Paragon. You're right on.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. And then just thinking about EMG, right, I mean the comps are getting fairly easy on a year-over-year basis, but really, the commentary is we should kind of think sequentially, revenues are quite similar to Q2? Or do you actually see a little bit of a step up there?\nDave Zapico: That's a good question. And when we step back and look at this. First, I'll go to orders. Our orders for the past couple of quarters have had small sequential improvements. So like if you go back to Q4 of last year, you have Q1 of this year and now the quarter recently completed, the orders sequentially were up low single-digits each quarter. So I feel like the orders have stabilized. We had a minus 10% organic in Q1. The orders in Q2 organically were minus 4%. And we think in the second half of the year, we're going to have a modest improvement versus the first half. So it kind of feels like the business has really stabilized. When you go to sales, we wanted to derisk the year because and it's really flat. So even though you have a little bit of movement from quarter-to-quarter, and we have a benefit of a tax rate in in Q4, if you back that out and you look at sales the first half of the year versus sales in the second half of the year, then you look at operating profit above the tax line in the first half of the year versus operating profit in the second half of year, it's a 50-50 split. AMETEK traditionally is a 48-52 split. And that's why we think really derisked the year with that 50-50 split in the second half. Now we still have some seasonality in our business. Historically Q4 because the seasonality is always higher than Q3, and we have a typical seasonality there. And again, as Dalip mentioned, we have the benefit of the tax rate in Q4. But we really feel we derisked the year to reflect the current environment, and we think it's going to stay that way through the balance of the year.\nJeff Sprague: And then maybe we could just touch on that tax rate. So assuming 19%, again in Q3, you would imply, I don't know, 14 or 15 in Q4. But the bigger question is just jumping off into 2025. Do we stay at that 17% to 18% range? Or do we move back up into the 19% to 20% range in 2025?\nDave Zapico: Yes. No, you see it right. We moved back up in 2025 to our typical tax rate. We haven't done our planning for 2025, but based on where we're sitting, that's what we would expect.\nJeff Sprague: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Graham: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nDave Zapico: Hi, Scott. Good to hear from you.\nScott Graham: Likewise. So I want to understand, so the reduction in sales guidance for the year, you indicated that it was essentially three points in EMG One point in EIG and you talked about project delays there. My question is, in your sort of around the horn, you indicated project delays in power. And I was just wondering if there's any vulnerability to project delays spreading into process because you didn't decide anything there?\nDave Zapico: Yes. If I didn't cite it, I should have said the process and power seeing similar activities. I mean, in the power segment, we have some power test and measurement businesses and they sell to multiple markets, including the government customers and there's a little delay there in projects, but we're very well positioned those are just delayed and process is a bit larger and it's more - it's - but it's kind of the same thing. But that was only the change in sales from all of EIG and - which is both process power.\nScott Graham: Okay. Thank you. I want to maybe shift to defense because that's a pretty high-margin business for you guys. Is that sort of push out of shipments? Is that something that you'll see in the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Is there anything more to discuss there?\nDave Zapico: No, I think that on the defense side, for our A&D business, we kept the guide for the year, the same, like plus high single digits. So what we saw in the second quarter was a very good commercial and had some defense delays. But for full year, we're saying that defense and commercial is still going to be the same. They're going to be up high single digits. So there's - doing very well there. As you said, there's good margins in our A&D segment, and we feel confident in that segment.\nScott Graham: If I could just squeeze this last one in, Dave. The net leverage of 1x, it's pretty low for you guys. Just kind of wondering the pump, I assume, is pretty darn primed at this point. How does the pipeline look or how are the sizes of the deals out there? Maybe you can give us a little color.\nDave Zapico: Yes. The pipeline looks really good. The size of the deals are throughout whole spectrum. I mean there are smaller deals, mid-size and larger deals. And as we talked about before, we'll probably buy a big business, for us as deployment of greater than $1 billion in capital every couple of years. And that's just because we're generating so much cash flow I think we really have the opportunity to differentiate our performance in this period. What you really see is there's a lot of PE-owned sponsor businesses that are long in the tooth. They're laying their ownership cycle, and they're struggling now because they have to go back and refinance their businesses at higher rates, and they're also trying to sell the business in a slowing environment. But those are - we have discussions going on, and there's a very, very large pipeline of opportunities that fit our businesses that we're having discussions with. So I'm optimistic that the pipeline is going to be strong and the discussions we're having are good ones. And you remember our capital allocation is very clear. Our first priority is to deploy our free cash flow strategic acquisitions that remains a clear priority. And like we're going to see from Paragon next year, that's how we generate value. And priority two is opportunistic buybacks. And as we've shown in the past, if we see a dislocation in our valuation, we're poised to act. And our third priority is a consistently modestly increasing dividend. So capital allocation doesn't change. And with a net leverage of one, we're ideally positioned right now, and there's a lot activity going on. Does that answer your question, Scott?\nScott Graham: It answers everything fully. Thank you.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: I understand that the kind of delays here and there that you're talking about aren't the biggest driver in the quarter. But I'm still a little bit curious. And so is the project delay often one where you're a small piece of the total project cost is one question. And the second is probably pretty easy to answer, given the nature of your business. But is there any pushback on price? Do customers have any option to change out? I mean is there any downshifting or anything like that? I know it's unlikely just thought sort of check around those dynamics.\nDave Zapico: Yes. The project cost, I think, was your first question. And you're right \u2026\nRob Wertheimer: Yes.\nDave Zapico: We are typically a small portion of the project and with good technology, a small part of a bigger project. It's a nice place to be. In terms of pricing, we have very differentiated technology. And we're conscious of the value that we're adding. What you'll typically see in most classic downturns is they may mix down. They may buy our project, buy our product, but it will maybe have less, features, because we're pretty good position with the customer base and our positions in our niche portfolio. We're not seeing that now. And we're not seeing the activity pipeline change. So I think on the - we're typically smaller projects typically priced for value and we do a lot of investment in our portfolio. So I think delays are more just related to the general macro that we talked about with Dean, about the elections and some of the uncertainty with the geopolitical issues but we went through the - we're confident we're not losing share. We're confident that our pipelines are very strong. So it's a temporary delay.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks so much.\nDave Zapico: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hi. Good morning. This is [technical difficulty] talk about the Paragon charges you took last quarter. Now that you're another quarter in, do you expect any additional charges? I know there were just one-time, but just any update on that? And when you might start seeing any impact from those charges?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think - we don't anticipate another charge. I mean that doesn't mean we won't change our mind, but we don't anticipate any other charges that will be clear. That's clear. Yes, that activity is going on now. So we're in process of improving that business, so fixing that business. So making it run as efficiently as AMETEK does. And we have a team of Paragon people and a team of AMETEK people and a team of our operational excellence, talent across the business, all working on the project. And the response is very, very solid to it. So I think that's ongoing and it will occur through the balance of this year. I think next year, you'll start to see the benefits of it. But the project, if you recall, goes up two or three years, as we continue to improve it. So I think the, next year, you have a sizable improvement, because expect the volumes to come back from the - destock, combined with the OpEx work that's going on combined with some new product introductions that we're heavily investing in the phase-in. So it's unfortunate that we have this destock downturn right now, but we couldn't be happier with the business.\nJoe Giordano: Thank you for that. And another question I had was on the 4Q ramp. So I understand the normal cyclicality, there's usually a 4Q ramp. But it does look like the implied guide implies the ramp is more than usual for historical. Is there - especially considering that you guys are not anticipating any easement in destocking for the latter half - could you comment on what's driving that?\nDalip Puri: Yes. I kind of disagree with your conclusion. I think there's a tax benefit in Q4. And when you factor that in, we have a pretty - I think the ramp is very similar to what it was last year. So it's - and we derisked Q3. So as I said, the operating performance in the first half of the year is very similar to the operating performance in the second half year. And you add to that a little bit of a tax benefit in Q4. So I don't - I think it's pretty typical from what we've done in the past.\nJoe Giordano: Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful.\nDalip Puri: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just going back to inventory, just how to think about it. Are your OEM customers? Are they bringing inventory levels back to pre-COVID levels or below pre-COVID levels? I guess just trying better understand how to think about the destocking impact versus history? And where do you think inventories will be on a going-forward basis relative to pre-COVID levels?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think there - it's different because there's a lot of customers and a lot of different market segments. But in general, I think you're getting back to pre-COVID levels, there might be slightly higher because of some of the geopolitical things that happened and the supply chains becoming more regional and less dependent on Asia. So it could be a bit higher. But in general, I believe that the general statement across the customer base, they're trying to get back to something at the pre-COVID level. They might be a bit higher for some of the other geopolitical issues going on.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just - maybe I missed it, but could you just cover major geographies? What are we seeing North America versus Europe versus Asia versus China? I apologize if I missed it.\nDave Zapico: Sure, Andrew. No, you didn't miss it. We saw a modest growth in Europe in the second quarter, and we saw a low single-digit declines in both the U.S. Asia. Go a step lower. We had low single-digit in the U.S. We actually had strong growth in our Materials Analysis division or A&D businesses but our automation business was down a bit. Europe was up low single-digit. Again, weakness in our automation business, offset by strong growth in process. And for Asia, we were down low single digits, pretty difficult comps in China. China was down a bit. But when you look at Asia, excluding China, it was flat. So it's kind of a flat world. But we are seeing some improvements in Europe.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Thanks. Good morning.\nDave Zapico: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Barger: Dave, we're hearing a lot of optimism about the semiconductor cycle having a strong 2025 led by AI-related devices, of course, but also some leading-edge node transitions later next year. What are you seeing in that business? And are you more levered to node transitions or unit volume increases?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think right now, we're levered to both of them. But in our second quarter, our semiconductor business was up, and it was up because we had strong growth in our CAMECA business, and you think about that business, they're doing next-generation defect detection. And it's kind of like you're going to want one of these CAMECA systems in just about every new fab. And then we also have the strong benefits from our Zygo business. And there, we're one of the few businesses that can operate with technology in the EUV, the extreme EUV, and that's more of the transitioning to smaller nodes. So right now, what you see is even though the market was down tremendously, there's a lot of R&D activity to get at the node transitions, to get us some of the - to be able to detect defects at these smaller nodes. So we're going very well there driven by the uniqueness of our product portfolio. But then when the market picks up, we also have a good part of our business is tied to the - just the rate production. So, it feels pretty good for us in terms of moving into next year, Steve.\nSteve Barger: Got it. And activity over the past year for mature nodes in domestic Chinese manufacturers have been stronger than I think people expected. Do you have exposure there? And do you have an outlook for that market in the back half and next year?\nDave Zapico: We don't - I don't have that level of resolution for next year. We do sell into the Chinese market. It's typically lower technology products, has been healthy this year.\nSteve Barger: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Good morning. Hi David, hi Dalip and Kevin. Thanks for the question. Just a few more details. I know you got a lot of ground here. But on Paragon, I just want to make sure I've got the right base for FY '23. I've got about $450 million, $460 million of revenues for FY '23. Is that about right?\nDave Zapico: A little bit higher for '23.\nNigel Coe: A bit high of 23%. Okay. That's helpful. So down 10% to 20% this year, I mean, what sort of cost measures are you taking? I know the charge you took in 1Q is much longer tail. But what measures are you taking to sort of preserve the earnings there? And - where do we stand right now on the accretion for FY '24?\nDave Zapico: Yes. I think the - we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure. They have excess capacity in plants - so that work is going on right now. And we took the charges also some expenses related to doing things that are non-accruable that we're spending. And then more importantly, there's a lot of new product introductions that are going on that we're spending that - spending on right now that are very, very solidly positioned for Paragon. You talk about the accretion for this year, it's a couple of pennies and it's in the fourth quarter.\nNigel Coe: Couple of pennies in the fourth quarter. Yes. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, David. And then on orders, I think you said 4% organic decline. I think that's better than the 8% you saw in the first quarter I'm calculating $1.6 billion of orders this quarter. Is that in the right zone?\nDave Zapico: Yes. If you look at overall orders, they were up 1.5% in the quarter.\nNigel Coe: 1.5%, okay, that\u2019s\u2026\nDave Zapico: The overall orders were up 1.5%. Organic orders were down 4%. That's improved from what we saw in Q1 where we were down organically minus 10 and we saw a sequential improvement in orders in Q2. So they're up low-single-digits from Q1. So we're definitely seeing stability in orders. And the cadence\u2026\nNigel Coe: The question about it.\nDave Zapico: June was the strongest.\nNigel Coe: And then just a quick one on the 4Q tax rate issue and any quantification there?\nDalip Puri: Yes. I mean if you think about the way we're seeing our expected tax rate play out, Nigel, Q3, as we said, we're projecting our typical expected tax rate Q4, we're now projecting a lower expected tax rate in the range of 10% to 15%. That lower effective tax rate in Q4 is primarily due to statute expirations. So that brings our expected tax rate for the full year to 17% to 18%, which is expected to provide an earnings benefit in the range of $0.10 to $0.15 per share in Q4.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thank you very much.\nDave Zapico: Thank you, Nigel.\nOperator: Since there are no more questions, I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.

            "name": "Dave Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid results with a strong operating performance in the second quarter against the backdrop of a more subdued global growth environment. In the quarter, we experienced continued headwinds from inventory destocking across our OEM customer base, leading to lower-than-expected sales volumes. Additionally, we are seeing signs of customers turning more cautious leading to some temporary delays in project spending. Despite these headwinds, our businesses delivered strong operating performance in the quarter, we saw the growth in cash flow and earnings and robust core margin expansion reflecting the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK operating model. We expect the inventory destocking and more cautious customer behavior to continue in the back half of the year. As a result, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate these near-term headwinds. As we've done in the past, we will expand our focus on operational efficiencies and continue to invest back in our businesses utilize our strong balance sheet to deploy capital on strategic acquisitions and ensure we position AMETEK for continued long-term growth. Now let me turn to our second quarter financial results. Sales in the quarter - sales in the second quarter were $1.73 billion, up 5% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 2%. Acquisitions added 8 points in the quarter and foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was excellent with robust margin expansion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $448 million, 7% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 25.8% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a sizable 180 basis points in the quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $545 million, up 10% over prior year with EBITDA margins in impressive 31.4%. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent, reflecting our operating capability and asset-light business model. Operating cash flow in the quarter was up 14% to $381 million with free cash flow up 17% and free cash flow conversion of 107%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.66 per diluted share, up 6% versus the second quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.63 to $1.65 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG delivered strong operating performance with outstanding margin expansion. EIG sales were $1.15 billion, a 2% increase from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were flat and acquisitions contributed two points. Growth was strongest within our aerospace and defense and CAMECA businesses in the quarter. EIG operating income was $350 million, up 14% versus the prior year and operating margins were at 30.3%, up 320 basis points from the prior year. Our EIG businesses are operating at a very high level with excellent operating margins. They remain well-positioned to benefit from a number of important long-term secular growth drivers, given their increasing exposures to attractive markets across process, aerospace, power and energy markets. The electric mechanical group continues to navigate the impacts of inventory normalization across our automation and engineered solutions businesses. In the quarter, EMG sales were a record $81 million, a 14% increase compared to the prior year, driven by contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical. Organic sales declined 6% due to weakness in our automation and engineered solutions businesses, more than offsetting solid growth across our EMG, aerospace and defense businesses. Acquisitions contributed 20% in the quarter. Operating income for the second quarter was $123 million with operating margins at 21.2%, while core operating income margins were 25%. As we have noted for a number of quarters, OEM customers across a wide range of markets are reducing excess inventory built up during the supply chain prices. While we had expected to see conditions approved in the second half of year, we now believe demand within this OEM customer base will remain subdued at current levels through the end of 2024. This inventory normalization is also impacting our medical OEM businesses, including Paragon Medical, leading to near-term delays in orders and shipments. Paragon remains very well-positioned for strong growth once the inventory correction is complete, given their leadership position across a number of high-growth MedTech market segments. Additionally, Paragon has won a new programs that we're currently investing in, which will drive incremental growth in 2025 and beyond. As we noted last quarter, are leveraging our proven integration capabilities to drive meaningful operational improvements to best position Paragon for long-term success. As the volumes return following destocking, we believe the business will be levered to deliver outstanding sales growth and profitability. In summary, we are operating our businesses very well with 7% growth in operating income and 180 basis points of core margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flow with 17% free cash flow growth in the quarter. And for full year, we expect free cash flow to net income conversion be between 110% and 120%. The strength of AMETEK's operational excellence strategy is evident in our operating results. We continue to drive efficiency improvements across our businesses by leveraging our global infrastructure and OpEx initiatives. And this year, we now expect to generate $140 million in savings. We also remain committed to investing back into our businesses. And this year, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in growth, largely focused on research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index, which was a strong 24% in the quarter. Additionally, our strong free cash flow and flexible balance sheet provides us with ample financial capacity for strategic acquisitions. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities remain strong. AMETEK is very well positioned to continue to expand our portfolio of highly differentiated businesses that both our organic growth investments and our acquisition strategy. Now, turning to outlook for the remainder of the year. With destocking expected to continue through the balance of the year and some customers turning more cautious on project spending, we are adjusting our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. Overall, sales are now expected to be up 5% to 7% versus the prior year, with organic sales expected to be flat to down low single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.80, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. This is less than a 1% reduction from our prior earnings guidance range of $6.74 to $6.86 as our proactive productivity actions, along with a lower expected fourth quarter tax rate helped offset the impact of the reduced sales forecast. This guidance reflects second half sales and operating earnings, essentially in line with our first half results. For the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.62 per share, down 1% to 2% versus the prior year. In summary, we are pleased with our business's strong operating performance in the second quarter. We have a proven operating model and an experienced management team, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the sluggish demand environment and deliver exceptional long-term results. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Dal? Yes. Our outlook for the year has changed. And as we noted in my prepared remarks, we now expect the improvements in the second half of the year are not going to happen as originally anticipated, and we talked about that earlier in the year. We now expect our sales and operating performance in the second half will be similar to the growth that we \u2013 sales and operating performance in the first half. So we're not going to see the increases that we had anticipated. And this change results in about a four-point reduction in our sales outlook. And to your question, where is it coming from? Roughly three points of this reduction is our automation and engineered solutions subset, which is the businesses that we talked about being exposed to the OEM destocking. And within that area, we have two points of reduction tied to our automation business and one point from the Paragon destock. So that makes up about three to four-point reduction in our outlook. Across our EIG businesses, we expect about one point of lower sales due to short-term project delays. And there, we're seeing customers are being just a bit more cautious given the cumulative impact of wide range of economic, political and geopolitical factors. But we feel these are temporary delays. Our new funnel pipelines remain very solid, projects are not being canceled. They're being delayed. And given the expected lower sales, we reduced our earnings guidance by about $0.05 at the midpoint. Another couple of points. I mean, we've really done a good job running the company. It reflects when you take that sales decrease, it reflects about a 20% decremental margin on the expected lower sales. And as Dalip mentioned, the tax rate will be lower in Q4. So I'm pleased with how the team is managing through these temporary demand changes. I'm confident that we're positioned to see accelerated profit growth when the economic conditions change. I think to your point, we missed the timing of the recovery and the inventory corrections will take a bit longer. And as AMETEK does, we're adapting to the current situation, and we're going to manage our business appropriately. And as I said, we've got really pleased how the team responded with 20% decremental to the volume change. Sure, Matt. I'll start with our largest subsegment, the process. Sales for our Process businesses were up low single digits with solid growth across our energy businesses and our CAMECA business in the quarter. As noted in my prepared remarks, we've seen customers, as we just talked about, turn more cautious. We expect this to continue in the second half as we discussed, and we expect our process businesses to be flat to up low single digits versus the prior year. Now I'll move to aerospace and defense and that business was up mid-single digits in the quarter. Growth was strongest across our commercial aerospace businesses, while Defense experienced some shipment delays in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect strong high single-digit organic sales growth for our A&D business with similar growth across both our commercial and defense businesses. Next, I'll move to our Power & Industrial businesses. And overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the second quarter with contributions from recent acquisitions being offset by a low single-digit decrease in organic sales. Similar to our process businesses, our Power and Industrial are seeing the same kind of customers of delaying some projects due to the broader macro uncertainties. And for all of '24, we now expect organic sales for our Process and Industrial businesses to be flat compared to 2023. And our final segment, automation and Engineered Solutions. Self-segment sales, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the quarter. This was driven by the contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical. Organic sales in quarter were down approximately 10% due to the continued normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base, we expected to see improvements in return to growth, as we talked about in the second half of the year. And as we just mentioned, that's not going to happen. Inventory normalization is going to continue through the end of the year. And as a result, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be down mid-single digits for the full year. So that's a picture around the word at. Good morning, Deane. Yes. I think the - I think what we see from our customer base is they're just taking longer to approve projects. And they're going further up the sign-off chain, to get signed off. These are typically - they're not even large projects. And you see those resulting in delays. I think it's a combination of the elections in the U.S., I think two-thirds of the worlds have elections this year. So it's elections around the world. It's the - some financing related to the higher interest rate higher inflation. I mean, it's the worst. So just a lot of things that they're combining to affect people's decisions, and they're just delaying a bit, I mean the thing that's different than some other downturns is we still have very strong pipelines of new activity. So thinking about past downturns, we've been through a bunch of these, I don't think there's been any where we have a strong new activity pipeline from our customers. So the projects aren't being canceled. There may be some delays in phasing some new products in and maybe it's taken longer to get the financing, although that's not primary feedback we're getting. But I think it's this broader macro issue that's honestly a bit of smaller issue for us. The bigger issue is the OEM destock. So I think we had the pandemic. And then we had the supply chain crisis. And we're selling it in our automation and engineered solutions businesses differentiated components and subsystems to people that are typically smaller dollar value amounts to the entire system. And when people bought inventory, because we're very specialized, and they wanted to keep shipping the products. And now we're just dealing with a destocking process that's just taking a little longer than we thought. And I think that. Yes. I think the monthly cadence in both sales and orders was our typical monthly cadence. So otherwise, we typically step through a quarter with the first month being the lowest and the second month being a little bit higher than the third month being the highest month of the quarter. That same process occurred. But definitely, as the quarter went on, we saw some incremental weakness mainly in the project area. Right. Yes, because Paragon is mainly in one end market, and they're talking to their customers daily. I think there's better visibility. And you can also talk to customers and get market information. So this the - talk that we're seeing is really happening everywhere. Just to refresh everybody's memory, Paragon manufactures single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable devices, orthopedic implantable devices, drug delivery systems, really attractive markets. At the same time, this is going on. We're working on substantial efficiency improvements in the businesses. We talked about that last quarter and this process is proceeding very well. So this combination of the market growth that follows the destock, along with the new program wins and leaned out and efficient cost structure is really going to provide substantial sales and profit growth for Paragon in the years ahead. We have a similar business and similar markets and another part of AMETEK, and it's seeing the same kind of destock and Paragon won a tremendous amount of new programs. So we're still investing and driving those things in the market. So I think when you take a step back, this is going to be a tremendous generator for our long-term shareholders, and we're very optimistic about the business. It's unfortunate about the destock process, but we're in this game for the long run, and we're doing all the ready things for the business and we've got a new management team with some really talented people from AMETEK that are working with people that are from Paragon and they have a great plan to take the business forward. So we're really optimistic about how that business is going to perform for us long term. Thank you, Deane. Good morning. Good questions, Jamie, and I'll try to answer them both. The first thing is you talked about pricing in the quarter. And our pricing in Q2 was about 3.5 points price, and our inflation was about 2.5 points. So we had a positive benefit from that. So the pricing environment is moderating a bit and the inflation is moderating a bit, but we're real pleased with that. And it was across our portfolio and maybe a little bit more in EMG just a bit than EMG, but it was pretty much across the portfolio at a pretty consistent performance, and that's driven by our differentiated portfolio on the heavy level of investments. We're putting in new products. We talked about a vitality index of 24%. We got newer products, fresh products in the market. Our customers are buying them. So - and that's resulting in some good pricing. And as I said, inflation is moderating. And we think that general environment, the moderation of inflation, but our ability to continue to leverage our investments are going to continue throughout the year. So, no change there, very, very consistent and it's kind of the AMETEK portfolio is very differentiated and kind of performed very well. In terms of the margins in EIG, if you think about - we've got a similar performance in the first quarter and excellent operating quarter. We had 320 basis points up driven by high leverage, excellent price cost, strongly performing acquisitions and a really good product mix. And that was consistent from Q2 to Q3. And we see that continuing for the rest of the year. I mean we do have a comp in Q3 margins is a difficult one, because that was a high-margin quarter for us if you look back the past few years. But in general, if you think about EIG, the margins are good and they're going to stay there, and that business is very well positioned. And it's - in our process, our Power and Industrial and our Aerospace businesses, we've got excellent market positions. And then just talking about the EMG part of the business, they had core margins of over 25%. So they got some dilution there because of the acquisition and destocking and automation in our medical businesses. But when we look at our businesses, they're running - both segments are running very well generating excellent margins. I think EIG has historically a bit of a higher margin entitlement, because they sell mainly to end users, and they get the aftermarket revenue stream and EMG is selling more to an OEM customer base, a little bit lower margin. So they're in relation to each other. And I see that continuing. I'm not really concerned that those margins are going to fall off or anything like that. So, does that answer your question, Jamie? Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. Yes. I'd say you're between 10% and 15% is the Paragon. You're right on. That's a good question. And when we step back and look at this. First, I'll go to orders. Our orders for the past couple of quarters have had small sequential improvements. So like if you go back to Q4 of last year, you have Q1 of this year and now the quarter recently completed, the orders sequentially were up low single-digits each quarter. So I feel like the orders have stabilized. We had a minus 10% organic in Q1. The orders in Q2 organically were minus 4%. And we think in the second half of the year, we're going to have a modest improvement versus the first half. So it kind of feels like the business has really stabilized. When you go to sales, we wanted to derisk the year because and it's really flat. So even though you have a little bit of movement from quarter-to-quarter, and we have a benefit of a tax rate in in Q4, if you back that out and you look at sales the first half of the year versus sales in the second half of the year, then you look at operating profit above the tax line in the first half of the year versus operating profit in the second half of year, it's a 50-50 split. AMETEK traditionally is a 48-52 split. And that's why we think really derisked the year with that 50-50 split in the second half. Now we still have some seasonality in our business. Historically Q4 because the seasonality is always higher than Q3, and we have a typical seasonality there. And again, as Dalip mentioned, we have the benefit of the tax rate in Q4. But we really feel we derisked the year to reflect the current environment, and we think it's going to stay that way through the balance of the year. Yes. No, you see it right. We moved back up in 2025 to our typical tax rate. We haven't done our planning for 2025, but based on where we're sitting, that's what we would expect. Hi, Scott. Good to hear from you. Yes. If I didn't cite it, I should have said the process and power seeing similar activities. I mean, in the power segment, we have some power test and measurement businesses and they sell to multiple markets, including the government customers and there's a little delay there in projects, but we're very well positioned those are just delayed and process is a bit larger and it's more - it's - but it's kind of the same thing. But that was only the change in sales from all of EIG and - which is both process power. No, I think that on the defense side, for our A&D business, we kept the guide for the year, the same, like plus high single digits. So what we saw in the second quarter was a very good commercial and had some defense delays. But for full year, we're saying that defense and commercial is still going to be the same. They're going to be up high single digits. So there's - doing very well there. As you said, there's good margins in our A&D segment, and we feel confident in that segment. Yes. The pipeline looks really good. The size of the deals are throughout whole spectrum. I mean there are smaller deals, mid-size and larger deals. And as we talked about before, we'll probably buy a big business, for us as deployment of greater than $1 billion in capital every couple of years. And that's just because we're generating so much cash flow I think we really have the opportunity to differentiate our performance in this period. What you really see is there's a lot of PE-owned sponsor businesses that are long in the tooth. They're laying their ownership cycle, and they're struggling now because they have to go back and refinance their businesses at higher rates, and they're also trying to sell the business in a slowing environment. But those are - we have discussions going on, and there's a very, very large pipeline of opportunities that fit our businesses that we're having discussions with. So I'm optimistic that the pipeline is going to be strong and the discussions we're having are good ones. And you remember our capital allocation is very clear. Our first priority is to deploy our free cash flow strategic acquisitions that remains a clear priority. And like we're going to see from Paragon next year, that's how we generate value. And priority two is opportunistic buybacks. And as we've shown in the past, if we see a dislocation in our valuation, we're poised to act. And our third priority is a consistently modestly increasing dividend. So capital allocation doesn't change. And with a net leverage of one, we're ideally positioned right now, and there's a lot activity going on. Does that answer your question, Scott? Thank you, Scott. Good morning, Rob. Yes. The project cost, I think, was your first question. And you're right \u2026 We are typically a small portion of the project and with good technology, a small part of a bigger project. It's a nice place to be. In terms of pricing, we have very differentiated technology. And we're conscious of the value that we're adding. What you'll typically see in most classic downturns is they may mix down. They may buy our project, buy our product, but it will maybe have less, features, because we're pretty good position with the customer base and our positions in our niche portfolio. We're not seeing that now. And we're not seeing the activity pipeline change. So I think on the - we're typically smaller projects typically priced for value and we do a lot of investment in our portfolio. So I think delays are more just related to the general macro that we talked about with Dean, about the elections and some of the uncertainty with the geopolitical issues but we went through the - we're confident we're not losing share. We're confident that our pipelines are very strong. So it's a temporary delay. Thank you. Yes. I think - we don't anticipate another charge. I mean that doesn't mean we won't change our mind, but we don't anticipate any other charges that will be clear. That's clear. Yes, that activity is going on now. So we're in process of improving that business, so fixing that business. So making it run as efficiently as AMETEK does. And we have a team of Paragon people and a team of AMETEK people and a team of our operational excellence, talent across the business, all working on the project. And the response is very, very solid to it. So I think that's ongoing and it will occur through the balance of this year. I think next year, you'll start to see the benefits of it. But the project, if you recall, goes up two or three years, as we continue to improve it. So I think the, next year, you have a sizable improvement, because expect the volumes to come back from the - destock, combined with the OpEx work that's going on combined with some new product introductions that we're heavily investing in the phase-in. So it's unfortunate that we have this destock downturn right now, but we couldn't be happier with the business. Good morning, Andrew. Yes. I think there - it's different because there's a lot of customers and a lot of different market segments. But in general, I think you're getting back to pre-COVID levels, there might be slightly higher because of some of the geopolitical things that happened and the supply chains becoming more regional and less dependent on Asia. So it could be a bit higher. But in general, I believe that the general statement across the customer base, they're trying to get back to something at the pre-COVID level. They might be a bit higher for some of the other geopolitical issues going on. Sure, Andrew. No, you didn't miss it. We saw a modest growth in Europe in the second quarter, and we saw a low single-digit declines in both the U.S. Asia. Go a step lower. We had low single-digit in the U.S. We actually had strong growth in our Materials Analysis division or A&D businesses but our automation business was down a bit. Europe was up low single-digit. Again, weakness in our automation business, offset by strong growth in process. And for Asia, we were down low single digits, pretty difficult comps in China. China was down a bit. But when you look at Asia, excluding China, it was flat. So it's kind of a flat world. But we are seeing some improvements in Europe. Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, Steve. Yes. I think right now, we're levered to both of them. But in our second quarter, our semiconductor business was up, and it was up because we had strong growth in our CAMECA business, and you think about that business, they're doing next-generation defect detection. And it's kind of like you're going to want one of these CAMECA systems in just about every new fab. And then we also have the strong benefits from our Zygo business. And there, we're one of the few businesses that can operate with technology in the EUV, the extreme EUV, and that's more of the transitioning to smaller nodes. So right now, what you see is even though the market was down tremendously, there's a lot of R&D activity to get at the node transitions, to get us some of the - to be able to detect defects at these smaller nodes. So we're going very well there driven by the uniqueness of our product portfolio. But then when the market picks up, we also have a good part of our business is tied to the - just the rate production. So, it feels pretty good for us in terms of moving into next year, Steve. We don't - I don't have that level of resolution for next year. We do sell into the Chinese market. It's typically lower technology products, has been healthy this year. A little bit higher for '23. Yes. I think the - we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure. They have excess capacity in plants - so that work is going on right now. And we took the charges also some expenses related to doing things that are non-accruable that we're spending. And then more importantly, there's a lot of new product introductions that are going on that we're spending that - spending on right now that are very, very solidly positioned for Paragon. You talk about the accretion for this year, it's a couple of pennies and it's in the fourth quarter. Yes. If you look at overall orders, they were up 1.5% in the quarter. The overall orders were up 1.5%. Organic orders were down 4%. That's improved from what we saw in Q1 where we were down organically minus 10 and we saw a sequential improvement in orders in Q2. So they're up low-single-digits from Q1. So we're definitely seeing stability in orders. And the cadence\u2026 June was the strongest. Thank you, Nigel."

            "content": "Thank, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had a solid second quarter with excellent operating performance leading to outstanding margin expansion and strong cash flows. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $25 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's second quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Second quarter interest expense was $31 million, up $12 million from the second quarter of 2023 due to higher debt balances following the acquisition of Paragon Medical in December. Second quarter other expense was down approximately $4 million versus the prior period, due largely to higher pension income and higher investment income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 19%, up from 18.2% in the second quarter of 2023. For 2024, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 17% and 18%, driven by a lower fourth quarter tax rate due to statute expirations. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from the full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $21 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $99 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million. This includes after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 18.6% of sales. Operating cash flow was $381 million, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2023. While free cash flow was $360 million, up 17% over the prior year. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 107% of net income. For the full year, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at June 30 was $2.65 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $397 million. At the end of second quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1 times. We have significant financial capacity and flexibility with $2.2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and deploy on strategic acquisitions. In summary, AMETEK had a solid second quarter of 2024, delivering strong results with robust margin expansion and excellent free cash flows. Our leading positions across attractive market segments Combined with our strong balance sheet and outstanding operating capabilities leaves us very well positioned to navigate the current environment and to deliver on our growth strategies. Kevin? Yes. I kind of disagree with your conclusion. I think there's a tax benefit in Q4. And when you factor that in, we have a pretty - I think the ramp is very similar to what it was last year. So it's - and we derisked Q3. So as I said, the operating performance in the first half of the year is very similar to the operating performance in the second half year. And you add to that a little bit of a tax benefit in Q4. So I don't - I think it's pretty typical from what we've done in the past. Yes. Yes. I mean if you think about the way we're seeing our expected tax rate play out, Nigel, Q3, as we said, we're projecting our typical expected tax rate Q4, we're now projecting a lower expected tax rate in the range of 10% to 15%. That lower effective tax rate in Q4 is primarily due to statute expirations. So that brings our expected tax rate for the full year to 17% to 18%, which is expected to provide an earnings benefit in the range of $0.10 to $0.15 per share in Q4."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. \nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Julia. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. We today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dalip Puri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations.  \n A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2023 or 2024 results or 2024 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding the pretax $29.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share charge in the first quarter for integration costs related to the Paragon Medical acquisition. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.  \n We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions.  \n I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave. \nDavid Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2024 with outstanding operating performance leading to double-digit growth in earnings per share. During the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income and EBITDA, and deliver robust core margin expansion and excellent cash flows. Considering our first quarter results and the positive outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. AMETEK's continued success is a testament to the strength and resiliency of our growth model, the quality of our businesses and the outstanding contributions from all AMETEK colleagues.\n Now let me turn to our first quarter results. Sales in the first quarter were $1.74 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down slightly. Acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency had a small positive impact. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96, and we ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.46 billion near record levels. AMETEK's operating performance at the start of the year was excellent. Operating income in the quarter was a record $446 million, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a very strong 180 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $542 million up 13% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 31.2%. This outstanding performance led to earnings of $1.64 per diluted share up 10% versus the first quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.60. \n  Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a strong start to the year with tremendous operating performance leading to record operating margins and impressive margin expansion. Sales for EIG were $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 4% from the first quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 1% and acquisitions added 3 points. Growth in the quarter remained strongest across our Aerospace & Defense and Materials Analysis businesses.  \n EIG's operational execution in the first quarter was superb with strong profit and exceptional operating margin expansion. Operating income was $353 million, up 14% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were a record 30.5%, up a robust 280 basis points. This level of operating margin speaks to the quality and leadership positions of our highly differentiated businesses.\n The Electromechanical Group also delivered solid first quarter operating performance despite the headwinds from inventory normalization impacting some of our EMG businesses. EMG's first quarter sales were a record $579 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering. First quarter operating income was $120 million, while core operating income margins were 24.1% in the quarter.  \n Our first quarter results reflect the unique capabilities of our growth model to successfully manage short-term market headwinds and deliver robust margin expansion, outstanding cash flow and strong double-digit earnings growth. Our businesses remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives and delivering differentiated technology solutions to support our customers' most complex challenges. Our distributed operating structure enables flexibility in responding to market dynamics, while our robust cash flow and balance sheet provide ample support for our acquisition strategy.  \n This acquisition strategy along with our organic growth initiatives is expanding AMETEK's presence within high-growth markets. These markets include med tech, clean energy, electrification and aerospace and defense and help ensure our diverse portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on these attractive long-term secular growth areas.\n We remain committed to investing across our businesses to accelerate new product development and expand our sales and marketing efforts. In 2024, we expect to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives with a sizable portion of this in support of our research, development and engineering efforts. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index which was a strong 25% in the first quarter.\n AMETEK's commitment to invest in RD&E and continuously innovate ensures a steady stream of new products that support our customers' critical applications and position us for continued success.\n I wanted to take a moment to highlight an example of how the elements of the AMETEK growth model work together to deliver exceptional results. AMETEK Zygo, a global leader in the design and manufacturer of advanced optical metrology systems and ultraprecise optical components was recently awarded AMETEK's Dr. John H. Lux Award, an annual award provided to the AMETEK business that best exemplifies the commitment to continuous improvement and achievements and operational excellence. \n As part of its market expansion strategy, Zygo identified an attractive new market segment, virtual and augmented reality applications as a compelling growth opportunity for their advanced optical metrology systems. This led to Zygo's new product development and commercial teams working closely together to advance their technology capabilities and commercialize as a solution to support the highly precise requirements of this application. The success of this work resulted in strong demand and the need for Zygo to meaningfully increase production. Utilizing cross-functional teams and deploying tools like value stream mapping, and Lean Six Sigma, they achieved a remarkable threefold increase in production output, allowing them to meet the growing demand for the metrology solution.  \n This achievement highlights the synergy between our new product development, global market expansion and operational excellence strategies to help identify, develop and deliver exceptional technology solutions to address an important market need and accelerate growth. Congratulations to the Zygo team for a job well done.\n Now switching to our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we completed in 2023 are integrating nicely into AMETEK. We are leveraging our proven integration capabilities and our global infrastructure to help accelerate their growth, drive operational improvements and deliver strong returns. We are very excited about these acquisitions as they are expanding our market presence in attractive growth markets, including the med tech space through the Paragon Medical acquisition.  \n Paragon Medical, which we acquired in December, is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Paragon has an outstanding brand, leading innovation and design capabilities and a strong position serving a number of high-growth market segments. Our integration efforts are focused on supporting and accelerating this growth, while also leveraging AMETEK's infrastructure and operational excellence capabilities to drive efficiency improvements. The integration charge we took in the first quarter will allow us to drive these improvements and better position Paragon for accelerated growth and profitability. \n Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we are actively working on multiple opportunities. We have the balance sheet and financial capacity to deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. We look forward to delivering continued value to our shareholders through strategic acquisitions and prudent capital deployment.\n Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect the impact of inventory normalization to continue through the first half of the year with improvements in the second half of the year as we indicated on our last earnings call. As a result, for the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.74 to $6.86, up 6% to 8% compared to last year's results, an increase from the previous guidance range of $6.70 to $6.85. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with earnings of $1.63 to $1.65, up 4% to 5% versus the prior year.  \n In summary, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter with earnings growth, which exceeded our expectations, driven by exceptional operating performance. We are encouraged by these results and remain confident in our ability to navigate the current environment and benefit from improved sales growth in the back half of 2024. We are confident in the future of AMETEK has our world-class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK road model will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. \n I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip? \nDalip Puri: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong first quarter with record level sales and exceptional operating performance, highlighted by strong core margin expansion and free cash flow conversion.\n Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the first quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.4 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's first quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales.  \n First quarter interest expense was $35 million, up $15 million from the prior year first quarter due to higher debt balances outstanding following the December 2023 acquisition of Paragon Medical. Other operating expenses were down $5 million primarily due to higher interest income and higher pension income compared to the prior year's first quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.9%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2023. For 2024, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.\n As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $28 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $160 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $98 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share.  \n Operating working capital in the first quarter was 18.7% of sales. Operating cash flow was $410 million, up 6% versus the first quarter of 2023, while free cash flow was $383 million, up 4% over the prior year. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 123% of net income. For the remainder of 2024, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023.  \n Offsetting this debt, it's cash and cash equivalents of $374 million. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and our active acquisition pipeline.\n While acquisitions remain our #1 priority for use of our free cash flow, we also seek to opportunistically repurchase our shares and provide our shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend. And in February, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per share, our fifth consecutive year of 10% plus annual increases.\n In summary, our businesses delivered strong results to start the year with outstanding operating performance, leading to robust core margin expansion and excellent free cash flow.  \n Kevin? \nKevin Coleman: Thank you, Dalip. Julie, can we please open the lines for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. \nDeane Dray: Can we start off with the usual kind of tour of the end markets and geographies and maybe finish up with the -- just kind of the destocking comments. It just continues to be drawn out, and we're seeing it in all kinds of pockets. So it's not AMETEK specific in any way. But just kind of what's your refresh feel on that as well? \nDavid Zapico: Sure, sure. Glad to do that all, Deane. I'll start with the walk around the company, and I'll start with our Process business. Overall sales for our Process businesses were roughly flat versus last year and in line with our expectations. Growth remains solid across our energy and semiconductor businesses, and we're really well positioned there to benefit from the sizable project and investment activity within these markets. For the full year, we continue to expect sales for our Process businesses to be up low single digits.\n Next, I'll switch to Aerospace & Defense, and our A&D businesses, had a strong start to the year with approximately 10% organic growth in the quarter. Growth was very solid across both our commercial, aerospace and defense segments and for all of 2024, we continue to expect organic sales for our A&D businesses to be up high single digits on a percentage basis with similar growth across both our commercial aerospace and defense businesses.\n Next, I'll move to Power. Our Power businesses were up low double digits in the first quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of UEI and Amplifier Research being offset by a low single-digit decrease in organic sales. These recent acquisitions along with the acquisition of RTDS in 2022, expanded our presence within a number of highly attractive market segments, which are expected to benefit from a strong investment cycle, including the expansion of renewable energy and the power grid infrastructure. And for the Power segment, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth for 2024.\n And finally, going to the Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment, overall sales for A&ES were up 20% on a percentage basis in the quarter -- were up mid-20s in the quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering being offset by a high single-digit decrease in organic sales. As we expected, the impact from normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base continued in the first quarter, and we expect to see a return to growth in the second half of the year consistent with what we had indicated last quarter.\n And then finally, as a result, we continue to expect organic sales for our automation businesses to be up low single digits stronger growth in the back half of the year. So that's the walk around the company. And I think you also asked for what's going on in the various geographies. So get to that too, Deane.\n The U.S. was down 1% against a pretty difficult comparison, and our strongest growth was in our aerospace and defense businesses. Moving to Europe, we were down 2%, so minus 2% organic with notable growth in parts of our process and parts of our Power businesses offset by weakness in automation. And in Asia, we were up low single digits with strength across our Process businesses. So we had a very good performance in Asia. And digging down into that a little further, China was flat in the quarter, we saw the growth in our parts of our process businesses. So up low single digits in Asia and China was flat. \nDeane Dray: It's all really help. Go ahead. \nDavid Zapico: Yes. You asked about the destock, Deane. Yes, I think that it's playing out as we had talked about last quarter. I think the destock will continue into the second quarter, but in the second half of the year, we expect that to turn around. So we're watching that closely and it's really kind of playing out as we thought. I mean, the destock was probably a bit more than we thought it was going to be in Q1, but that may be positive for later in the year because we think second half of the year is just positive. \nDeane Dray: Great. And just a quick follow-up on the growth investments. We know this is your playbook. Is there anything unique in terms of how you're deploying that capital? I mean, typically, it's salespeople, is a component, but any other kind of wrinkles here you could share? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. It's salespeople with the largest chunk of it is in the engineering, research, development and engineering. And we have a full slate of projects, we have excellent opportunities longer term and we're getting after them. So I'm very positive on what's happening in our new product development programs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Sprague: Can you just address a little bit more Paragon itself, how it's performing and the charge that you took I don't recall a large charge like this on prior deals, maybe there are smaller ones that you just absorbed but didn't break out, but kind of the nature of what you're trying to accomplish? And is this kind of a onetime deal in this quarter as you kind of bed down the asset? \nDavid Zapico: Yes, that's a great question, Jeff. And it's kind of what you said. I mean we typically absorb the smaller acquisitions as we proceed through the years and quarters. And the last time we did something like this, when we bought, I believe, Zygo, is a bigger acquisition. And because of the size of the acquisition and because of the opportunities that we see, we wanted to take that integration charge because there are tremendous, tremendous opportunities to improve the business. So it's a onetime nature. It's for larger deals as you know, Paragon was largest acquisition that we have done.\n We spent about $1.9 billion. So as we dug into it, as we work with our management team, we got really comfortable with this plan. Quite honestly, there's more opportunities than we thought. We have a good team of both AMETEK and Paragon leaders that are really getting after it now. So I feel really good about the business.\n The integration is being integrated into AMETEK well, it's very positive around the future. And I think this restructuring is largely going to happen over the next couple of years, and we really see as a less than 2-year payback on it. So excellent payback. And we started on that, and we're really positive of what we're doing, and I feel positive about the deal. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And then maybe just switching gears, and I'm sorry if I missed it, I was on a little bit late, but can we just decompose revenue growth in the quarter for the segments, some color on what the organic performance was at the segment level? And if you have any color on price or other elements of revenue. I'm curious... \nDavid Zapico: Yes, if you look at -- our overall sales were up 9%. That's because both groups. And go the organic growth was just down modestly, about 0.5 point. EIG overall sales were plus 4. The organic growth in EIG was plus 1%. EMG overall sales were plus 21% and the organic sales at EMG were minus 4. So you had that defines the group dynamics for revenue. \nJeffrey Sprague: And maybe just 1 last 1 back to this kind of destock question. Just to comment that it was more in Q1 than expected, and I know it's kind of hard to know what your customers are going to do. But just your confidence level that it actually is, in fact, destock and like you have visibility on sell-through being better on the other side? Maybe just kind of address that, if you could? \nDavid Zapico: Yes, yes. The first point is when you look at AMETEK's first half, second half, we typically have 48% of our revenue and profits in the first half of the year, and 52% of our revenue and profits in the second half of the year, and that's exactly what we have this year. So our second half of the year is not back-end loaded. So we feel good about that.\n Another point that you may not see it really appears our orders have stabilized. Specifically, when I look at Q4 '23 to Q3 '23, and then I look at the next quarter, Q1 '24 the last quarter compared to Q2 '23. So the last 2 quarters sequentially, with all the acquired backlog removed. So really looking at a true run rate sequentially. We've seen low single-digit growth in orders in both Q4 '23 and Q1 '24. So it feels like we've bottomed and we're starting to see some modest improvements. At the same time, in Q1 '23, we had an extremely good quarter. So we have a difficult comp that we're battling.\n And finally, and perhaps most importantly, we've had customer commentary that continues to communicate to us in the second half of the year that destocking phase will come to an end, and we should return to a positive book-to-bill.\n So in terms of the economic environment, we're not -- we're watching it closely, but for the balance of the year, we're just assuming modest economic growth, not any kind of economic acceleration and at the same time, not a recessionary environment. And we expect that we'll grow sales modestly each quarter and the comparables get easier in the second half of the year. And as I said, this 48%, 52% split, H1 to H2 is very much aligned with our historical averages. \nJeffrey Sprague: And I'm sorry, did you have a comment on price? I missed it, and I'll see the floor. \nDavid Zapico: That's a good question, Jeff. Pricing was continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was approximately 4% in the quarter and inflation was about 3%. The results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets around the globe. And for the full year, we do expect their pricing to come in a bit and inflation to come in a bit, but we expect to maintain a positive spread between them. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey of Mizuho. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [indiscernible] for Brett Linzey. So as we look at a more potentially more aggressive tariff regime, can you just talk about how nimble your supply chain configuration is and then your ability to flex around different regions if needed? \nDavid Zapico: Yes, it's a great question. I mean we look at tariffs, and that became a bigger issue back in the 2017 time frame. And in the quarter, we had a minimal impact from tariffs and they were completely offset for price. And to give you an idea across the whole company, tariffs are only going to cost us about $0.01, a $3 million or $4 million. And what happened there is we've aggressively rebalanced our supply chain. It's largely done. So we're not overexposed to any region of the globe. And we have a strategy where from the U.S., we're largely sourcing from Mexico and other regions of the Americas and in Europe. We do a lot of sourcing from to Czech Republic and Serbia. And in Asia, we do a lot of sourcing from Malaysia.\n So we've got a nice balance around the world. So I think the hard work that we did over the past few years are really rebalancing our supply chain. We're essentially finished with it, just very small bit of work that continues. And we're very well positioned to be able to deal with an increasing tariff regime, specifically with China, in particular, we don't have a real risk there. We do excellent business in China. It's a China kind of strategy is about 9% of our sales. And largely, we source what we sell in China. So we're in a pretty good position in terms of tariffs. \nUnknown Analyst: Perfect. And then if you can just provide some color on the tempo or monthly cadence of trends in the quarter and then looking into April? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. I mean it was a pretty typical quarter. March was the strongest -- excuse me, March was the strongest quarter. Wait a minute. Okay, yes, pretty typical quarter, with March being the strongest on both orders and sales. So it's -- sales were the highest of the quarter in March and then in April, we're right on plan. So we feel good about the guidance. And it's pretty -- as I said, it's bouncing around there. But we're not seeing any incremental weakness at this point. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Seaport Research Partners. \nScott Graham: Really, maybe the first question is about the M&A environment. EBITDAs do seem to have firmed up even though this first quarter, I think, most would say industrial land has been a little uneven. Nevertheless, when EBITDA is firm up, that's kind of when I think the AMETEK does a lot of striking. And I'm just wondering, are we looking at a year this year that could mirror last year? I mean what is like the really near-term pipeline look like, Dave? \nDavid Zapico: Yes, it's very, very difficult to predict the very near term. But Scott, the pipeline remains very strong, and we're actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of markets. So we have $1.8 billion of existing cash and credit facilities post Paragon. We have a balance sheet that would support -- if the deals meet our criteria, we could do over $4 billion of deals this year, and that would only take our leverage up to about 2.5x. So we're really in an excellent position. And it's not a balance sheet issue. It's not a cash flow issue.\n We're performing extremely well. it comes down to finding the right businesses, and we have a good pipeline right now, a very good pipeline. And we really have the opportunity, as you said, we typically have this opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A element of our growth strategy with this strong balance sheet and with the strong cash flow position. So in this market is a bit choppy. Our combination of OpEx and M&A and this proven acquisition strategy, I'm really looking to differentiate our performance with our M&A and our OpEx during the next couple of quarters. \nScott Graham: You answered one of Jeff's questions earlier, saying you're expecting sales to be up modestly each quarter. Were you referring to organic for the next 3 quarters? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. This is sequential, Scott. \nScott Graham: Okay. So sequentially, you're expecting sales dollar to be up. \nDavid Zapico: Q1 will be a bit higher than Q2, Q3 a bit higher than Q2 and Q4 will be a bit higher than Q3. \nScott Graham: Okay. And the last one is just sort of back on the orders. I know you do have a pretty significant comp that you're up against when you stack them. What were orders in the quarter in dollars and in organic? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. The orders were -- orders were minus 8 and organic orders were minus 10. And again, we had a tough comp, and I went through the process of they sequentially grew low single digits the last couple of quarters. When you take out the comp, I think in Q1 of '23, we had exceptional orders from some project business and EIG in particular. So when you take that out and you look at what's going on sequentially, we get more comfortable. \nScott Graham: Yes. No, I get it, '22 and '21 were also exceptional organic periods for you. \nDavid Zapico: Yes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: Just a question, how to think about the Paragon Medical integration costs. So what's the payback on this restructuring that's now -- because I assume it's extra. So what's the payback on this restructuring that's embedded in '24 guide? And how much of it should I add to '25? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. Well, in '24, we had told you in prior meetings that Paragon is going to contribute $0.08 to $0.10 to AMETEK's EPS, and that still holds. When I look at that $22 million charge, we said the payback is going to be less than 2 years, and at run rate, so it will take us a couple of years to get there. But the run rate, we have $70 million of benefit. So we spent approximately $29 million. We're going to get approximately $70 million of benefits. The payback is less than 2 years. So that really tells you what a great return it has, and it's just -- there wasn't a lot of focus, and we can run things really efficiently. And I'm just excited that the management team sees it that way, too, and we're really going to make Paragon an exceptional business from an operating perspective.\n Regarding 2025, I think we've come out and said that we should see a substantial increase in operating earnings related to Paragon in 2025. But I'm not willing to quantify what's going to happen in 2025. We're much too far away to do that. But again, the metrics I'd point you to are we spent $29 million. We'll see $70 million in benefit at max run rate. And the payback for the project is a little less than 2 years. So we feel really good about it, good payback for our shareholders. \nAndrew Obin: Sorry, I'd probably -- and I'd probably take it offline, but just to make sure, so I thought the Paragon restructuring was extra because you saw incremental opportunities. So you were saying that I should have -- that, that was embedded all along but was not in the guide. I'm sorry... \nDavid Zapico: I just think that it's a larger deal, and we saw a lot of opportunities over -- it will take us a few years to do it so we put it forward. \nAndrew Obin: Okay. I'll take it offline because I'm not sure if I -- so I should have had it in my numbers or this $0.10 is extra on top of view we're thinking, just confirming that, I apologize. And I'm happy to take it offline with Kevin, I apologize. \nDavid Zapico: Yes. I don't know what you have in your numbers, Andrew. I don't really look at them, but I can tell you that we're expecting to get $0.08 to $0.10 of benefit from Paragon and this restructuring doesn't change that. \nAndrew Obin: Got you. That makes sense. And then just on revenue and you did give very good color was basically the destock what drove -- I guess you were expecting I think you guided for low double-digit revenue in the first quarter, a little bit below. So it's just you said it's destock pulled forward, correct? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. \nChristopher Glynn: Dave, I was curious just to go into the top a little bit of the long-term multiyear kind of secular trends where you see an impact. It occurs to me maybe the Power business could be on your leading edge with energy transition and electrification. But curious your comments in general on the kind of secular trends, and in particular, what you're seeing as kind of street level evidence on reshoring type trend. \nDavid Zapico: Yes. I think the -- when I think about the long-term secular growth drivers, and we talked about a little -- a few of them in my talk, but a lot of project activity around the semiconductor market, and that's finally we're moving closer and closer to the point where that's going to start turning into business for us in the West. There's a lot of project work on semiconductors.\n The Power market, as you said, and there are really two drivers there, the driver for renewables, energy but also the driver for investments in the power grid. So our RTDS business or power instrumentation business are really levered to those. So that's starting to happen as work its way through.\n When I think about the Aerospace & Defense business. Again, we had a great quarter again, and that's continuing. And I think both Airbus and Boeing have a 9-year backlog for the commercial market looks good. Our defense -- we're in the right position in defense. We had another good quarter in defense. So I think about those kind of markets and those trends, I feel good about the future, and a lot of fiscal stimulus in the U.S., which has not been there in the past. And -- but it takes time to work through the system. So we think longer term, I think we're in the right places to do well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of T.D. Cowen. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Dan on for Joe. Sorry, I know destocking and bottoming of orders within automation has been discussed a few times. So just a quick follow-up. This is obviously something a lot of companies have been struggling with in the past few quarters. But some have also been talking about changing their internal processes to gain more visibility of end market and end users. Is there anything that you guys have done potentially more frequent conversations or reaching out to like end market users to understand a bit better their demand going forward? Anything you've changed recently? \nDavid Zapico: I can't point to anything to change. I mean if you go back and you follow us, we kind of call exactly what happened. We talked about the first half of the year of sales outpacing orders. So that means you'd have a slightly below 1 book-to-bill.\n And we talked about the destock in the first half, and we thought it would turn positive in the second half. We did that before this quarter. I think we have a pretty robust communication system with our field, but there's always opportunities to get better and we work on those and continuously improve our businesses. But I feel like the information that we got from the field is pretty accurate, and we're on top of it. So -- but there's always room to improve, and we're always looking at ways to improve. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: David, I just want to come back to the order math. I think you said down 8% and then down 10% organic. \nDavid Zapico: Right. \nNigel Coe: We've got about 9 points of contribution from Paragon in our numbers. So just wondering what am I missing, I've expected that there would be significant contribution from Paragon in the order numbers. So just help me out with that math, please. \nDavid Zapico: Yes. We had 9% acquisition growth, and Paragon is in the acquisition is not the organic. So the Paragon sales orders -- sales, excuse me. Yes. \nNigel Coe: Okay. But then the orders, 8% organic to, that makes sense, reported downtimes in organic. Was there no material impact from Paragon there? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. With Paragon, we had obviously, the large -- look the backlog as orders in Q4. And then in Q1, there's a timing issue because Paragon has gone through the same destock that the EMG business is. So there's a bit of a destock there. That impacts the orders.\n So the medical market, it's in both our EMG business and Paragon, we're seeing the same kind of destock in the EMG businesses. If we look at the medical procedures, they're all growing at mid- to high single digits, but the medical device OEMs are destocking their inventory, correcting their inventories. It's kind of a widely communicated piece of information, and we monitor the procedures, and they're growing. So this destock we think is going to run a space through the first half of the year. \nNigel Coe: Okay. Does that impact the full year forecast? I think we've got close to $5 million of sales Paragon, does that destock impact that outlook. But also... I do. \nDavid Zapico: Go ahead. \nNigel Coe: No, no. Please go ahead, Dave. \nDavid Zapico: Yes. I think for the year, when we bought Paragon, it was a little less than $500 million. And the first year, we talked about the mid-single-digit growth. So that's still exactly what we have in our model. So we think that we get out of this year, and we think it will be a double-digit grower over the next couple of years, but the Paragon model from the viewpoint of what we had going into the year and what it is now is pretty much identical. \nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just, sorry, a follow-up on the $29 million. Is that all restructuring? Or is there some inventory and accounting break down? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. I'd say the vast majority of it was restructuring, and there was a small part of it that were other integration costs. But the vast majority... \nNigel Coe: And does some of that come into 2Q as well? Do we think about that into 2Q? \nDavid Zapico: Yes. We started the effort in Q1 and as I said, we pulled forward all the benefits that we had. And I think the restructuring is -- was done in Q1. So I don't think we're going to have another restructuring charge in Q2, if that's what you're asking.\n It's a one-off charge. It's a one-off charge. The Zygo business, we had a big acquisition. We did a similar thing when we got comfortable with what we could do. And we may have another charge with Paragon down the road if we think there's other ways to improve it. But right now, this is a onetime charge to dramatically improve the operating capability of that business and the returns that I communicated to you are very positive. \nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, for closing remarks. \nKevin Coleman: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast may be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Zapico",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2024 with outstanding operating performance leading to double-digit growth in earnings per share. During the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income and EBITDA, and deliver robust core margin expansion and excellent cash flows. Considering our first quarter results and the positive outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. AMETEK's continued success is a testament to the strength and resiliency of our growth model, the quality of our businesses and the outstanding contributions from all AMETEK colleagues.\n Now let me turn to our first quarter results. Sales in the first quarter were $1.74 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down slightly. Acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency had a small positive impact. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96, and we ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.46 billion near record levels. AMETEK's operating performance at the start of the year was excellent. Operating income in the quarter was a record $446 million, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a very strong 180 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $542 million up 13% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 31.2%. This outstanding performance led to earnings of $1.64 per diluted share up 10% versus the first quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.60. \n  Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a strong start to the year with tremendous operating performance leading to record operating margins and impressive margin expansion. Sales for EIG were $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 4% from the first quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 1% and acquisitions added 3 points. Growth in the quarter remained strongest across our Aerospace & Defense and Materials Analysis businesses.  \n EIG's operational execution in the first quarter was superb with strong profit and exceptional operating margin expansion. Operating income was $353 million, up 14% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were a record 30.5%, up a robust 280 basis points. This level of operating margin speaks to the quality and leadership positions of our highly differentiated businesses.\n The Electromechanical Group also delivered solid first quarter operating performance despite the headwinds from inventory normalization impacting some of our EMG businesses. EMG's first quarter sales were a record $579 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering. First quarter operating income was $120 million, while core operating income margins were 24.1% in the quarter.  \n Our first quarter results reflect the unique capabilities of our growth model to successfully manage short-term market headwinds and deliver robust margin expansion, outstanding cash flow and strong double-digit earnings growth. Our businesses remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives and delivering differentiated technology solutions to support our customers' most complex challenges. Our distributed operating structure enables flexibility in responding to market dynamics, while our robust cash flow and balance sheet provide ample support for our acquisition strategy.  \n This acquisition strategy along with our organic growth initiatives is expanding AMETEK's presence within high-growth markets. These markets include med tech, clean energy, electrification and aerospace and defense and help ensure our diverse portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on these attractive long-term secular growth areas.\n We remain committed to investing across our businesses to accelerate new product development and expand our sales and marketing efforts. In 2024, we expect to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives with a sizable portion of this in support of our research, development and engineering efforts. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index which was a strong 25% in the first quarter.\n AMETEK's commitment to invest in RD&E and continuously innovate ensures a steady stream of new products that support our customers' critical applications and position us for continued success.\n I wanted to take a moment to highlight an example of how the elements of the AMETEK growth model work together to deliver exceptional results. AMETEK Zygo, a global leader in the design and manufacturer of advanced optical metrology systems and ultraprecise optical components was recently awarded AMETEK's Dr. John H. Lux Award, an annual award provided to the AMETEK business that best exemplifies the commitment to continuous improvement and achievements and operational excellence. \n As part of its market expansion strategy, Zygo identified an attractive new market segment, virtual and augmented reality applications as a compelling growth opportunity for their advanced optical metrology systems. This led to Zygo's new product development and commercial teams working closely together to advance their technology capabilities and commercialize as a solution to support the highly precise requirements of this application. The success of this work resulted in strong demand and the need for Zygo to meaningfully increase production. Utilizing cross-functional teams and deploying tools like value stream mapping, and Lean Six Sigma, they achieved a remarkable threefold increase in production output, allowing them to meet the growing demand for the metrology solution.  \n This achievement highlights the synergy between our new product development, global market expansion and operational excellence strategies to help identify, develop and deliver exceptional technology solutions to address an important market need and accelerate growth. Congratulations to the Zygo team for a job well done.\n Now switching to our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we completed in 2023 are integrating nicely into AMETEK. We are leveraging our proven integration capabilities and our global infrastructure to help accelerate their growth, drive operational improvements and deliver strong returns. We are very excited about these acquisitions as they are expanding our market presence in attractive growth markets, including the med tech space through the Paragon Medical acquisition.  \n Paragon Medical, which we acquired in December, is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Paragon has an outstanding brand, leading innovation and design capabilities and a strong position serving a number of high-growth market segments. Our integration efforts are focused on supporting and accelerating this growth, while also leveraging AMETEK's infrastructure and operational excellence capabilities to drive efficiency improvements. The integration charge we took in the first quarter will allow us to drive these improvements and better position Paragon for accelerated growth and profitability. \n Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we are actively working on multiple opportunities. We have the balance sheet and financial capacity to deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. We look forward to delivering continued value to our shareholders through strategic acquisitions and prudent capital deployment.\n Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect the impact of inventory normalization to continue through the first half of the year with improvements in the second half of the year as we indicated on our last earnings call. As a result, for the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.74 to $6.86, up 6% to 8% compared to last year's results, an increase from the previous guidance range of $6.70 to $6.85. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with earnings of $1.63 to $1.65, up 4% to 5% versus the prior year.  \n In summary, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter with earnings growth, which exceeded our expectations, driven by exceptional operating performance. We are encouraged by these results and remain confident in our ability to navigate the current environment and benefit from improved sales growth in the back half of 2024. We are confident in the future of AMETEK has our world-class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK road model will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. \n I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip? Sure, sure. Glad to do that all, Deane. I'll start with the walk around the company, and I'll start with our Process business. Overall sales for our Process businesses were roughly flat versus last year and in line with our expectations. Growth remains solid across our energy and semiconductor businesses, and we're really well positioned there to benefit from the sizable project and investment activity within these markets. For the full year, we continue to expect sales for our Process businesses to be up low single digits.\n Next, I'll switch to Aerospace & Defense, and our A&D businesses, had a strong start to the year with approximately 10% organic growth in the quarter. Growth was very solid across both our commercial, aerospace and defense segments and for all of 2024, we continue to expect organic sales for our A&D businesses to be up high single digits on a percentage basis with similar growth across both our commercial aerospace and defense businesses.\n Next, I'll move to Power. Our Power businesses were up low double digits in the first quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of UEI and Amplifier Research being offset by a low single-digit decrease in organic sales. These recent acquisitions along with the acquisition of RTDS in 2022, expanded our presence within a number of highly attractive market segments, which are expected to benefit from a strong investment cycle, including the expansion of renewable energy and the power grid infrastructure. And for the Power segment, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth for 2024.\n And finally, going to the Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment, overall sales for A&ES were up 20% on a percentage basis in the quarter -- were up mid-20s in the quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering being offset by a high single-digit decrease in organic sales. As we expected, the impact from normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base continued in the first quarter, and we expect to see a return to growth in the second half of the year consistent with what we had indicated last quarter.\n And then finally, as a result, we continue to expect organic sales for our automation businesses to be up low single digits stronger growth in the back half of the year. So that's the walk around the company. And I think you also asked for what's going on in the various geographies. So get to that too, Deane.\n The U.S. was down 1% against a pretty difficult comparison, and our strongest growth was in our aerospace and defense businesses. Moving to Europe, we were down 2%, so minus 2% organic with notable growth in parts of our process and parts of our Power businesses offset by weakness in automation. And in Asia, we were up low single digits with strength across our Process businesses. So we had a very good performance in Asia. And digging down into that a little further, China was flat in the quarter, we saw the growth in our parts of our process businesses. So up low single digits in Asia and China was flat. Yes. You asked about the destock, Deane. Yes, I think that it's playing out as we had talked about last quarter. I think the destock will continue into the second quarter, but in the second half of the year, we expect that to turn around. So we're watching that closely and it's really kind of playing out as we thought. I mean, the destock was probably a bit more than we thought it was going to be in Q1, but that may be positive for later in the year because we think second half of the year is just positive. Yes. It's salespeople with the largest chunk of it is in the engineering, research, development and engineering. And we have a full slate of projects, we have excellent opportunities longer term and we're getting after them. So I'm very positive on what's happening in our new product development programs. Yes, that's a great question, Jeff. And it's kind of what you said. I mean we typically absorb the smaller acquisitions as we proceed through the years and quarters. And the last time we did something like this, when we bought, I believe, Zygo, is a bigger acquisition. And because of the size of the acquisition and because of the opportunities that we see, we wanted to take that integration charge because there are tremendous, tremendous opportunities to improve the business. So it's a onetime nature. It's for larger deals as you know, Paragon was largest acquisition that we have done.\n We spent about $1.9 billion. So as we dug into it, as we work with our management team, we got really comfortable with this plan. Quite honestly, there's more opportunities than we thought. We have a good team of both AMETEK and Paragon leaders that are really getting after it now. So I feel really good about the business.\n The integration is being integrated into AMETEK well, it's very positive around the future. And I think this restructuring is largely going to happen over the next couple of years, and we really see as a less than 2-year payback on it. So excellent payback. And we started on that, and we're really positive of what we're doing, and I feel positive about the deal. Yes, if you look at -- our overall sales were up 9%. That's because both groups. And go the organic growth was just down modestly, about 0.5 point. EIG overall sales were plus 4. The organic growth in EIG was plus 1%. EMG overall sales were plus 21% and the organic sales at EMG were minus 4. So you had that defines the group dynamics for revenue. Yes, yes. The first point is when you look at AMETEK's first half, second half, we typically have 48% of our revenue and profits in the first half of the year, and 52% of our revenue and profits in the second half of the year, and that's exactly what we have this year. So our second half of the year is not back-end loaded. So we feel good about that.\n Another point that you may not see it really appears our orders have stabilized. Specifically, when I look at Q4 '23 to Q3 '23, and then I look at the next quarter, Q1 '24 the last quarter compared to Q2 '23. So the last 2 quarters sequentially, with all the acquired backlog removed. So really looking at a true run rate sequentially. We've seen low single-digit growth in orders in both Q4 '23 and Q1 '24. So it feels like we've bottomed and we're starting to see some modest improvements. At the same time, in Q1 '23, we had an extremely good quarter. So we have a difficult comp that we're battling.\n And finally, and perhaps most importantly, we've had customer commentary that continues to communicate to us in the second half of the year that destocking phase will come to an end, and we should return to a positive book-to-bill.\n So in terms of the economic environment, we're not -- we're watching it closely, but for the balance of the year, we're just assuming modest economic growth, not any kind of economic acceleration and at the same time, not a recessionary environment. And we expect that we'll grow sales modestly each quarter and the comparables get easier in the second half of the year. And as I said, this 48%, 52% split, H1 to H2 is very much aligned with our historical averages. That's a good question, Jeff. Pricing was continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was approximately 4% in the quarter and inflation was about 3%. The results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets around the globe. And for the full year, we do expect their pricing to come in a bit and inflation to come in a bit, but we expect to maintain a positive spread between them. Yes, it's a great question. I mean we look at tariffs, and that became a bigger issue back in the 2017 time frame. And in the quarter, we had a minimal impact from tariffs and they were completely offset for price. And to give you an idea across the whole company, tariffs are only going to cost us about $0.01, a $3 million or $4 million. And what happened there is we've aggressively rebalanced our supply chain. It's largely done. So we're not overexposed to any region of the globe. And we have a strategy where from the U.S., we're largely sourcing from Mexico and other regions of the Americas and in Europe. We do a lot of sourcing from to Czech Republic and Serbia. And in Asia, we do a lot of sourcing from Malaysia.\n So we've got a nice balance around the world. So I think the hard work that we did over the past few years are really rebalancing our supply chain. We're essentially finished with it, just very small bit of work that continues. And we're very well positioned to be able to deal with an increasing tariff regime, specifically with China, in particular, we don't have a real risk there. We do excellent business in China. It's a China kind of strategy is about 9% of our sales. And largely, we source what we sell in China. So we're in a pretty good position in terms of tariffs. Yes. I mean it was a pretty typical quarter. March was the strongest -- excuse me, March was the strongest quarter. Wait a minute. Okay, yes, pretty typical quarter, with March being the strongest on both orders and sales. So it's -- sales were the highest of the quarter in March and then in April, we're right on plan. So we feel good about the guidance. And it's pretty -- as I said, it's bouncing around there. But we're not seeing any incremental weakness at this point. Yes, it's very, very difficult to predict the very near term. But Scott, the pipeline remains very strong, and we're actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of markets. So we have $1.8 billion of existing cash and credit facilities post Paragon. We have a balance sheet that would support -- if the deals meet our criteria, we could do over $4 billion of deals this year, and that would only take our leverage up to about 2.5x. So we're really in an excellent position. And it's not a balance sheet issue. It's not a cash flow issue.\n We're performing extremely well. it comes down to finding the right businesses, and we have a good pipeline right now, a very good pipeline. And we really have the opportunity, as you said, we typically have this opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A element of our growth strategy with this strong balance sheet and with the strong cash flow position. So in this market is a bit choppy. Our combination of OpEx and M&A and this proven acquisition strategy, I'm really looking to differentiate our performance with our M&A and our OpEx during the next couple of quarters. Yes. This is sequential, Scott. Q1 will be a bit higher than Q2, Q3 a bit higher than Q2 and Q4 will be a bit higher than Q3. Yes. The orders were -- orders were minus 8 and organic orders were minus 10. And again, we had a tough comp, and I went through the process of they sequentially grew low single digits the last couple of quarters. When you take out the comp, I think in Q1 of '23, we had exceptional orders from some project business and EIG in particular. So when you take that out and you look at what's going on sequentially, we get more comfortable. Yes. Yes. Well, in '24, we had told you in prior meetings that Paragon is going to contribute $0.08 to $0.10 to AMETEK's EPS, and that still holds. When I look at that $22 million charge, we said the payback is going to be less than 2 years, and at run rate, so it will take us a couple of years to get there. But the run rate, we have $70 million of benefit. So we spent approximately $29 million. We're going to get approximately $70 million of benefits. The payback is less than 2 years. So that really tells you what a great return it has, and it's just -- there wasn't a lot of focus, and we can run things really efficiently. And I'm just excited that the management team sees it that way, too, and we're really going to make Paragon an exceptional business from an operating perspective.\n Regarding 2025, I think we've come out and said that we should see a substantial increase in operating earnings related to Paragon in 2025. But I'm not willing to quantify what's going to happen in 2025. We're much too far away to do that. But again, the metrics I'd point you to are we spent $29 million. We'll see $70 million in benefit at max run rate. And the payback for the project is a little less than 2 years. So we feel really good about it, good payback for our shareholders. I just think that it's a larger deal, and we saw a lot of opportunities over -- it will take us a few years to do it so we put it forward. Yes. I don't know what you have in your numbers, Andrew. I don't really look at them, but I can tell you that we're expecting to get $0.08 to $0.10 of benefit from Paragon and this restructuring doesn't change that. Yes. Yes. I think the -- when I think about the long-term secular growth drivers, and we talked about a little -- a few of them in my talk, but a lot of project activity around the semiconductor market, and that's finally we're moving closer and closer to the point where that's going to start turning into business for us in the West. There's a lot of project work on semiconductors.\n The Power market, as you said, and there are really two drivers there, the driver for renewables, energy but also the driver for investments in the power grid. So our RTDS business or power instrumentation business are really levered to those. So that's starting to happen as work its way through.\n When I think about the Aerospace & Defense business. Again, we had a great quarter again, and that's continuing. And I think both Airbus and Boeing have a 9-year backlog for the commercial market looks good. Our defense -- we're in the right position in defense. We had another good quarter in defense. So I think about those kind of markets and those trends, I feel good about the future, and a lot of fiscal stimulus in the U.S., which has not been there in the past. And -- but it takes time to work through the system. So we think longer term, I think we're in the right places to do well. I can't point to anything to change. I mean if you go back and you follow us, we kind of call exactly what happened. We talked about the first half of the year of sales outpacing orders. So that means you'd have a slightly below 1 book-to-bill.\n And we talked about the destock in the first half, and we thought it would turn positive in the second half. We did that before this quarter. I think we have a pretty robust communication system with our field, but there's always opportunities to get better and we work on those and continuously improve our businesses. But I feel like the information that we got from the field is pretty accurate, and we're on top of it. So -- but there's always room to improve, and we're always looking at ways to improve. Right. Yes. We had 9% acquisition growth, and Paragon is in the acquisition is not the organic. So the Paragon sales orders -- sales, excuse me. Yes. Yes. With Paragon, we had obviously, the large -- look the backlog as orders in Q4. And then in Q1, there's a timing issue because Paragon has gone through the same destock that the EMG business is. So there's a bit of a destock there. That impacts the orders.\n So the medical market, it's in both our EMG business and Paragon, we're seeing the same kind of destock in the EMG businesses. If we look at the medical procedures, they're all growing at mid- to high single digits, but the medical device OEMs are destocking their inventory, correcting their inventories. It's kind of a widely communicated piece of information, and we monitor the procedures, and they're growing. So this destock we think is going to run a space through the first half of the year. Go ahead. Yes. I think for the year, when we bought Paragon, it was a little less than $500 million. And the first year, we talked about the mid-single-digit growth. So that's still exactly what we have in our model. So we think that we get out of this year, and we think it will be a double-digit grower over the next couple of years, but the Paragon model from the viewpoint of what we had going into the year and what it is now is pretty much identical. Yes. I'd say the vast majority of it was restructuring, and there was a small part of it that were other integration costs. But the vast majority... Yes. We started the effort in Q1 and as I said, we pulled forward all the benefits that we had. And I think the restructuring is -- was done in Q1. So I don't think we're going to have another restructuring charge in Q2, if that's what you're asking.\n It's a one-off charge. It's a one-off charge. The Zygo business, we had a big acquisition. We did a similar thing when we got comfortable with what we could do. And we may have another charge with Paragon down the road if we think there's other ways to improve it. But right now, this is a onetime charge to dramatically improve the operating capability of that business and the returns that I communicated to you are very positive."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong first quarter with record level sales and exceptional operating performance, highlighted by strong core margin expansion and free cash flow conversion.\n Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the first quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.4 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's first quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales.  \n First quarter interest expense was $35 million, up $15 million from the prior year first quarter due to higher debt balances outstanding following the December 2023 acquisition of Paragon Medical. Other operating expenses were down $5 million primarily due to higher interest income and higher pension income compared to the prior year's first quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.9%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2023. For 2024, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.\n As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $28 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $160 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $98 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share.  \n Operating working capital in the first quarter was 18.7% of sales. Operating cash flow was $410 million, up 6% versus the first quarter of 2023, while free cash flow was $383 million, up 4% over the prior year. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 123% of net income. For the remainder of 2024, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023.  \n Offsetting this debt, it's cash and cash equivalents of $374 million. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and our active acquisition pipeline.\n While acquisitions remain our #1 priority for use of our free cash flow, we also seek to opportunistically repurchase our shares and provide our shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend. And in February, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per share, our fifth consecutive year of 10% plus annual increases.\n In summary, our businesses delivered strong results to start the year with outstanding operating performance, leading to robust core margin expansion and excellent free cash flow.  \n Kevin?"
