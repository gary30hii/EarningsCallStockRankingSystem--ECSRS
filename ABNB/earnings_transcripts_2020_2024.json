As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Airbnb\u2019s Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nIan Lee: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb\u2019s fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations session of Airbnb\u2019s website. During the call, we\u2019ll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remaining time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described on the forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and our perspectives filed with the SEC on December 11, 2020. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliation for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitute for our GAAP results. And with that, I\u2019ll pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you very much, Ian, and thank you all for joining today. I am excited to share our results for the first time as a public company. I want to start by acknowledging that we are still in a pandemic and a lot of people are hurting. So, we know how lucky we are to be in the position we\u2019re in. Now, before I go into a result, I want to share a theme that we\u2019ll run through each of our earnings calls. When we started Airbnb, it was about more than just travel. In 2007, my roommate, Joe and I, played three airbeds one weekend and turned our apartment into an airbed and breakfast. We hosted three guests that weekend, Michael, Kate, and Amol. And in doing so became the first host. Our guests arrived as strangers, but they left as our friends. And the connections we made that weekend made us realize maybe, there\u2019s a bigger idea here. Since then, we\u2019ve grown from two hosts to San Francisco to 4 million hosts all around the world. The idea of Airbnb is only possible, because of host. Without host, you\u2019re an outsider in the place that you visit. without hosts, you have nowhere to stay, but crowded tourist districts or resort. A great host does more than share their space. They provide a deeper connection to the places you visited, the people who live there, and they set the stage for you to be able to spend meaningful time, but the people who travel it. So this is why 14 years later, hosting is still at the center of Airbnb. As the world continues to change, people\u2019s fundamental need for connection and belonging or not. This is what will remain focused on day-in and day-out, quarter-after-quarter. With that, let me talk about our results. 2020 was a year when nearly everything changed, the way we live, the way we work and the way we travel. Airbnb changed as well. We started 2020 by preparing for IPO, only to have to put on hold once the world went into lockdown. But then in the face of the biggest prices in the travel industry has ever seen, our business proved to be resilient and our model was able to adapt. Through the crisis, we also sharpened our focus. We made many difficult decisions while staying true to our core principles that we became a stronger company as a result, and we succeeded in going public after all. Now, despite a difficult year, we are encouraged by our resilient business performance and the depths of the pandemic, we have forecasted that revenue in 2020 could be less than half of 2019 levels. Yes. We delivered $3.4 billion, a full-year revenue in 2020, down only 30% compared to the year earlier. In Q4, our revenue of $859 million was down only 22% year-over-year, despite the second wave of COVID cases and widespread lockdowns. In addition to this top-line resilience, we also demonstrated focus and discipline to protect our profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA in 2020 was slightly better than 2019 and this was despite revenue being down $1.4 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2020 with nearly $250 million better than Q4 2019. This was despite revenue in Q4 2020 being $250 million lower than a year earlier. So, we\u2019re able to achieve these results, because of the adaptability of our business model, and because of our focus and financial discipline. We believe these two factors set us up well for the coming travel rebound and travel is coming back nearly a year after lockdowns began, we believe people are yearning for what\u2019s been taken away from them, travel and human connection. When travel returned, it will be about connection. People will want to spend meaningful time with their family and friends and because of this, as restrictions lift and borders begin to open, we expect there will be a significant travel rebound. So in 2021, our single priority is to prepare for the coming travel rebound. to do this, what we\u2019re going to do is perfect the entire end-to-end experience of our core service. First, we\u2019re going to educate the world about what makes Airbnb different hosting. through our marketing and communications, we will educate guests that being hosted is a better way to travel. In addition, we will inspire more people to become hosts. Next, we will recruit more hosts and set them up for success. Once you\u2019ve educated people about hosting, we\u2019ll simplify the onboarding process. So, it\u2019s easier to for hosts to get started, and we are improving our tools and support to help them succeed. Third, to make it easier for guests to find the perfect stay, we are simplifying every part of the guest experience as well as improving our search functionality to support more flexible travel patterns. And finally, whenever our hosts or guests need us, we need to deliver world-class service. So, we\u2019re actively fixing product issues that drive community contacts, we\u2019re scaling our operations to meet the demand and continually enhancing our service? So that is our plan for 2021, educate the world about hosting, recruit more hosts and set them up for success, simplify the guest experience and deliver world-class service. I want to end by just highlighting two things that we launched this week that I\u2019m really proud of. On Monday, we launched our first large scale marketing campaign in five years, made possible by host. Even though the brand of Airbnb is mainstream, the idea of hosting is not yet. Our goal with this campaign is to make a long-term investment in educating the world about our hosts. This campaign will help our guests to understand the benefits of being hosted and how this is unique to Airbnb. And it will create more awareness around the idea of becoming a host by making it more mainstream and aspirational. by using real photos of real guests on real Airbnb trips, this campaign shows what the real experience of being hosted is like. And I think it speaks directly to the need for connection that people all over the world are feeling after nearly a year of isolation. So that is made possible by hosts. And second finally, flexible dates. on Tuesday, we launched a new feature that we call flexible date. today, more people are working from home and that needs more flexibility about when and where they travel. Because of this, we\u2019re seeing a shift in how people search on Airbnb. in 2021 to-date, almost 40% of people searching on Airbnb have been flexible in terms of their date or their location of their stay. This is a huge change in the search paradigm and travel. flexible date allows guests to search for homes in a whole new way. Instead of having to select the exact dates for a trip, guests are able to do broader searches. Now, you can search for a weekend getaway, a weeklong vacation, or even a month long stay sometimes the next few months. This allows our guests to browse more options while being flexible on the exact dates of their trip and we think this will be a very popular feature coming this travel season. So that\u2019s our plan for this year to prepare for the coming travel rebound. We\u2019re excited about the year ahead. And with that, I look forward to answering your questions today.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Brian, I think you brought on quite a few new users to the platform throughout 2020. Is curious, are you seeing anything different from a retention perspective or any differences in user behavior of those people as 2021 booking season has started? And the second one, I think in the letter, you talk about 1Q 2021 bookings being above 1Q 2020. Are there any more detail on sort of which regions are driving that or is it pretty broad based with people to sort of looking forward to travel in the back half around the globe? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thank you for asking the questions and I\u2019ll start and Dave, you can obviously feel free to elaborate. I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll start with the second question. We are seeing a lot of resiliency in certain geographies, especially in North America and Europe. What we\u2019ve generally found is that domestic travel globally is pretty strong and that the primary challenge is cross border travel in addition to of course, business travel, but we\u2019re not as affected by business travel reductions. And so countries with really strong domestic travel are seeing more resilience than countries that are not as \u2013 that are not as affected by the cross border travel. So that\u2019s the first thing that we\u2019re seeing. And I\u2019m very encouraged by it. now, as far as retention of users that we got last year, we are seeing continued strong retention. There\u2019s no major changes. I think the retention of our user base has historically been strong and it was very strong last year. I\u2019ll just highlight a couple of things. One of the reasons I think our retention is strong is, because people are finding many new use cases to use Airbnb in addition to all the old rates that use that. So, even though borders were closed and international travel is reduced, many people found longer-term stays in Airbnb, because they were working from home. They were flexible. Many people want to get in cars and travel nearby, staying in a local community. And so we\u2019re able to seek that demand as well. And so there\u2019s a number of areas that I think that provide a lot of resiliency for our model. I think it\u2019s inherently adaptable and as our model adapts, that means retention increases, because there are more uses for our guests.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks, Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. Brian, as we do look out to the recovery later this year and beyond, I\u2019d be interested in what you\u2019re seeing so far in terms of a more flexible workforce using Airbnb for both sides of their travel, meaning they use Airbnb to monetize their home in one location to fund a longer-term stay somewhere else and how you see the size of that opportunity as more mobility becomes possible for a workforce that\u2019s got the taste for it.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, that\u2019s a really good question. I want to really underscore this point, the way \u2013 let me kind of \u2013 let me say this, travel will come back, but when travel comes back, we believe it\u2019s going to look different than before. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going back to the world of travel in 2019, it\u2019s going to change and it\u2019s going to be different. And probably, the biggest difference we\u2019ve seen is flexibility. A world of Zoom is a world, where more people can work from home and a world, where more people have the flexibility of work from home. We\u2019re seeing more people say they can work for many home on Airbnb. And so we\u2019ve seen a number of new use cases. People are living more nomadically. Some people are taking longer-term stays, one or two months at a time in our Airbnb. People are taking extended three, four-day weekends. So, like many weekends in a row, because they don\u2019t have to be in the physical office. And many people are snowboarding, they\u2019re like essentially living in somewhere cold and they want to go somewhere warm. They have the flexibility to do that. The other thing you\u2019ve mentioned is new people hosting. One of the things we found is that many people like to start hosting at the beginning of a life change. Maybe, somebody has kids and the kids move out of the house. They got some extra bedrooms. Maybe, they were recently unemployed. They recently lost their job, or they\u2019re now living more remotely and their home is more available. So, one of the things that we\u2019re really excited about is as we see more flexibility and more week or month long stays, there\u2019s more empty homes people are leaving behind. And our largest source of hosts in 2019 were prior guests, 23% of our hosts in 2019 were guests first. As we think, there\u2019s big opportunities for us to continue to convert our guests to become hosts. And this new world of flexibility means more empty homes that can be shared.\nHeath Terry: Thank you very much, Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Well, thanks for taking the question. two, if I can. first, Brian, you guys talked about made possible by host. Can you just talk a little bit more broadly about the supply acquisition strategy and what you\u2019re doing kind of near-term, the buildup supply in markets close to cities, as well as longer-term to continue to sustain your growth. And is there an opportunity to get more productivity out of existing supplier will most of the long-term growth come from new supply. And then the second question as you guys prepare for the rebound and travel, how are you approaching performance marketing differently in terms of maybe, scale and expected ROIs in 2021 versus say 2019 and 2020 that the shareholder letter talks about materially increasing marketing efficiency. So, if you could explain that a little bit more, that would be great. Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. these are two really good questions. Thank you for them. I\u2019ll start with supply, then I\u2019ll go to performance marketing. on supply, let\u2019s just start framing it. We have about four million hosts on Airbnb. 90% of our hosts are individual hosts. These are everyday people, typically school teachers, healthcare workers, students, 55% of them are women. And the vast majority of them come direct to Airbnb. So most of our hosts, we don\u2019t have to acquire per se. They come organically, often because they\u2019ve heard of Airbnb. Their friends have recommended it to them, who are also hosts for \u2013 because as I mentioned before, 23% of our hosts in 2019 were prior guests. The second point I\u2019d make is our model is pretty adaptable. So, we have hosts [ph] in 100,000 communities. One of the things we\u2019re seeing is a change of travel patterns right now in the pandemic. people aren\u2019t just looking to go to the same 20 cities or 30 cities. They now want to get in cars and travel the local communities nearby. That means a travel in a sense is being redistributed to thousands of communities. This helps us smooth out any supply demand gaps that we might have, but we do have a number of levers to add supply. Let me start by saying yes, our existing hosts rent their homes only occasionally. So, we see huge opportunities for productivity. The average host on Airbnb makes like under $10,000 a year and they do that by renting out just occasionally. So, we think there\u2019s a huge opportunity to increase productivity of the hosts that we already have. That being said, we also think now is the time that people are interested in hosting more than ever before. Airbnb \u2013 we started Airbnb in a recession and during the recession of 2008; people were losing their jobs, losing their homes and many people turned to Airbnb for income. We think now hosting is as appealing as ever before, given the economic circumstances happening in this country and around the world. And so we\u2019re doing a few things, made possible by host is a global campaign it\u2019s as I said, our first global campaign in five years. And we think if this campaign successful, this can absolutely mainstream hosting and bring a lot of people to our platform. In addition, we\u2019re doing a companion campaign called made possible by hosting. And that\u2019s going to talk about all the benefits of hosting, and we\u2019re going to really target people that are going through a life transition. As I said, people that just renovated their home, bought a new house, lost their job. Maybe, they\u2019re retired, maybe, their kids moved out of the house. So, we think this is a really great way to be able to target and recruit more hosts. Once they come to Airbnb, we want to make it more \u2013 we want to increase the conversion rate of people come to Airbnb and then listing, an active listing on Airbnb. conversion rates the name of the game, one of the things we\u2019ve learned about conversion rate is easier to make something. And the more support you offer to somebody, the more likely they\u2019re going to get through the conversion funnel. So, we\u2019re reducing the steps. We\u2019re going to allow you to become a host in less than 10 minutes. And if you need help, you can call customer service or we\u2019re going to match you to existing hosts to be able to support you along this journey. If we do these things, I think we\u2019ll be able to add a significant amount of more hosts, because the average person around the world that they knew that they can make some extra money by meeting interesting people. A lot more people would do it. Now, the next question is about marketing performance marketing. And let me just also take a step back and talk a little bit more about our marketing strategy, because I think this is very important to the corporate story. In 2019, we had elevated spending of performance marketing and then 2020 occurred, our business dropped by 80% in eight weeks. And we pulled back all marketing, including performance marketing. But something remarkable happened even before we started resuming our marketing spend, our traffic levels came back to 95% of the traffic levels of 2019 without any marketing spend. And what this revealed is that our brand is inherently strong. It\u2019s a noun and verb in pop culture. And so we don\u2019t intend to ever against, then the amount of money as a percentage of revenue on marketing in the future as we did in 2019. in Q4, 90% of our \u2013 more than 90% of our traffic was direct or unpaid. And we think that will continue in the future. our marketing plan; therefore, our strategy is the following, a full funnel marketing approach. The top of the funnel was actually PR. we got more than 0.5 million articles in last year in 2020. And we had as much share of voice as most of the other major travel companies combined. And that\u2019s how we really built the brand of Airbnb more than anything; probably with PR. second is brand marketing, we think of brand marketing as education and investment. And so made possible by hosting is by hosts is an investment in hosting. and then performance marketing, we don\u2019t treat performance marketing like other travel companies. We think of it as like a laser. It\u2019s not a way to arbitrage users. It\u2019s a way to laser in on where we want to acquire guests or hosts and key markets, where we have a supplier demand mismatch, but make no mistake our efficiencies, we\u2019re going to hold to a lot higher level than 2019 or years prior. I don\u2019t know if Dave, you want to share anything else about that?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I think you\u2019ve covered really well. I\u2019ll just round it out by saying that we\u2019ll continue to use performance marketing, where it makes economic sense to do so. It\u2019s absolutely important level and we\u2019ll absolutely continue to do it. We\u2019re just going to have a higher rate of return expectation on the performance marketing spend and we\u2019ll return to the levels that we saw in 2019. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 will be below that of 2019. The absolute dollars in 2021 will be below that of 2019. And I guess I\u2019ll run this out by saying that, because of the marketing campaign that made possible by hosts as launching now and in advance of the summer travel season, you\u2019re going to see sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue higher than the first half of this year that you are in the second half.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Justin Post with bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. A couple of questions; obviously, a lot of cost discipline this year to get too close to break even by Q4, which is pretty remarkable. How are you thinking about balancing that? And do you have any margin targets in mind as we think about modeling 2021? And then secondly, very interesting and I\u2019m sure you have a lot of incentives to get more hosts. Do you think there\u2019s a lot of latent post offerings that will come online once people get through the health issues? I guess another way of asking, do you think a lot of hosts have pulled their listings and we\u2019ll be back as soon as they feel more comfortable. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you very much, Justin. Why don\u2019t I start? And then I\u2019ll let Dave elaborate. Let me just start at a high level about cost discipline. We would have, of course, like everyone else never asked for last year\u2019s crisis. but I do think that crisis made us a much better company, because the first thing that happened is we got more disciplined. when our business was precipitously falling, we knew we couldn\u2019t focus on everything. So, we focused on what was most special about Airbnb. That was our individual post. It means we scaled back numerous investments, but something else Justin we found was as we focused, what it really meant was, we\u2019re taking our very best people and putting on the most important problem. And as we did that, and not only saved money actually drove more growth. I think that in addition to the inherent adaptability remodel does explain why we\u2019re able to see a fairly strong recovery in the back half of last year. I\u2019ll let Dave talk a little bit more about margin targets, but I\u2019ll just also get to host and I\u2019ll hand over to dave. on latent host offering and/or this question of did hosts pull back and do they intend to host again? What we know is this. In any given day, we have a certain number of hosts active and live in the platform. We know that when hosts deactivate, it\u2019s often not permanent, it\u2019s because they\u2019re taking a break from hosting and we know many hosts are intending to host once again. And so one of the things we\u2019re doing as I did a Q&A town hall with thousands of hosts. And I basically said to them together, we have to be ready and we want to be prepared for this travel season. And our goal to collectively with our hosts is to be ready before the rebound happens. We\u2019d rather be early than late. And so we do expect a lot of hosts to be ready. And one of the dynamics we basically found is one of the nice things about our business is as a host gets more booked up, they often either expand by adding a listing or more likely they\u2019ll tell their friends, who also become hosts. So with occupancy rise, it does have a nice, nice benefit, where word gets out, that people are making money. And if we can fulfill that with a couple of minutes out with our brand campaign, I think it could yield quite a few gains. Dave, do you want to cover either of these?\nDave Stephenson: Yes. I\u2019ll just round it out by saying; the overall number of active listening to experiences was relatively stable in Q4 relative to Q3 at about $5.6 million. So we actually haven\u2019t seen a substantial amount of deactivations, it\u2019s been very stable and for all the reasons that Brian said earlier, we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to be adding new hosts in the future, just given all of the tailwinds of the kind of macroeconomic factors that we have going around the world. As far as margin targets, one of the things we\u2019re really proud of is the progress we\u2019ve made on our profitability efficiency over 2020, right. We\u2019ve made substantial reductions in our fixed costs. We will not be having to add back fixed costs to support a business that will again, approach 2019 levels and beyond. And so our fixed cost discipline is great and we\u2019ll continue. And then we saw really great improvement in our variable cost efficiency across the P&L. And when you actually removed in Q4, remove the one-time impacts and stock-based compensation relative to the IPO, or our costs are down in every category across our P&L. And it\u2019s that discipline at very low expenses, things like cost of payments, community support expenses, infrastructure expenses, all the way down that we\u2019re proud of. And what we would like to \u2013 expect to achieve over time is 30% EBITDA margins or greater. And this has just accelerated our path towards those long-term margin targets. I\u2019d love to give you on specific targets for 2021, but it\u2019s just too hard to know what our revenue is going to be. And so therefore kind of a flow through to profitability, we\u2019re seeing that our revenue rates in Q1 will be better than the revenue growth rates in Q4. But we just don\u2019t have a lot of visibility in the back half of the year to give you a lot of guidance on profitability right now.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Great. Thanks for taking my question. two if I may. just one, can you provide any color on how your bookings for summer travel are trending relative to this time last year. and then Brian, what do you think the Olympics could do just to get people\u2019s confidence in traveling, especially around international travel? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you for the question. Dave maybe, you can take summer travel and I\u2019ll take Olympics.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. Yes. I don\u2019t have a lot of color that I can give you on summer travel bookings. I mean, one thing, which I can say is that people are booking in shorter windows. So, the greatest growth we\u2019re seeing in the business right now are booking windows in less than 30 days and typically, kind of pre-COVID, you\u2019re right. We\u2019d be seeing much more of the bookings now it had for the summer travel season, and that is delayed relative to kind of historic patterns. We\u2019re seeing some bright spots as in a little bit of a bright spot in the UK, dragging some summer travel bookings here in Q1. but I really don\u2019t have a more color that I can give to you on summer expectations. We just know that we want to be ready for the travel rebound when it occurs. We just don\u2019t know exactly when it will occur.\nBrian Chesky: And then on the question of the Olympics, just we are \u2013 we are a sponsor of the Olympics and if the Olympics has fans, I think, it would be a great boon to travel. but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear this year in Tokyo that we\u2019ll have fans. So, we\u2019ll have to see how that goes. So, I can just comment more broadly about what we\u2019re seeing with travel demand. We did a survey recently of American travelers and we found a couple of things. The first thing we found is that people missed traveling, that\u2019s not surprising, but we also found that people missed traveling more than any other out-of-home activity. People missed traveling more in America than going to a restaurant, going to sports, live music or other activities, but they don\u2019t miss all kinds of traveling. Generally, people don\u2019t miss traveling for business as much, and they generally don\u2019t miss mass tourism. They\u2019re generally not missing standing in a line with selfie sticks in front of a landmark for example, or going to a crowded lobby. the kind of travel that people missed is spending meaningful time that the people they care about, their friends and their families. And so we found that the majority of people we surveyed said, they do plan to travel this year. They will do it as soon as they feel safe to do so. So obviously, that\u2019s going to be pegged a little bit to the health crisis. but we see a lot of enthusiasm and I think the kind of travel that we offer, allows people to be able to connect with our friends and family, because our home is a great way to be able to gather and spend a meaningful quality time and that is very much what we\u2019re focused on. We think this is a huge window of opportunity, this travel rebound, and I think it\u2019s going to be disproportionately our travel rebound that\u2019s not going to be cross border. It\u2019s not going to be business travel. People want to get in cars, they\u2019re going to travel to smaller communities, and they\u2019re also going to be staying in home. So, we are prepared or we\u2019re going to be prepared for that.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Brian. Just if you could comment on the experience business and what you\u2019re seeing there and how important that is to the overall strategy right now. And also, as we come back through this recovery, can you just talk to the other element of the stay, which could be the hotel, and I know you\u2019ve invested there. How important will that be as we go back to the upswing of this travel cycle?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thanks for questioning, Brent. So yes, I\u2019ll talk about experiences and hotels. So with experiences, this is a very important product for us. Experiences are one of the purest manifestations of hosting and connection that we have. I mean, in a sense that is the entire product. You have an experience with a host when you connect with other guests. So, this is really important to us. And what we found statistically is that guests on Airbnb actually life experiences, statistically, more than home. For example, more guests leave a five star review after their experience than they do after a home, as a percentage of \u2013 after the reservations. So, we thought last year was going to be a breakout year for experiences, but the opposite happened. We had to put the product on hold with social distancing. So, very quickly pivoted the product to create online experiences, because people couldn\u2019t gather in person. We created one hour activities that you could do from your computer. These were different than Instagram, like videos or YouTube videos. These are actually interactive. So, you actually can connect with a host and you can meet other guests and people are using these, because they\u2019re feeling more isolated and they want to meet other people. And I think as the world starts opening back up, I think we\u2019re very bullish on experiences over the coming years, because when people travel, they\u2019re going to want to do something interesting. And I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all going to desire to go back to getting on double-decker buses and waiting in line and crowded lobbies, or landmarks. they\u2019re going to want to do really interesting activities and I think that\u2019s what our hosts have to offer. And then for people in their own city, I think, you can only sit at home and watch so many shows on Netflix. People will want to get out of their home. And if they want to alternate to a restaurant, I think experiences are a great thing to do in their own city. So, the short answer is that we\u2019re very focused on it. We had to take a bit of a pause last year, but they\u2019re coming back and we\u2019re going to be focused on it, because it\u2019s just another way of hosting. And this is one of many ways that we\u2019re going to continue to allow hosts, to be able to share the world with others. Now, with regards to hotels, this is a little bit of a different story. We made an acquisition of hotel tonight. I\u2019m very proud of the acquisition. I\u2019m very glad we made it. It\u2019s a great team, a great app. It\u2019s one of the most loved hotel booking apps in the world. And we were investing quite heavily in this product. Now, when the crisis happened, we had to scale back certain investments. And one of the investments we scaled back was our investment in hotels, but we ain\u2019t scale back entirely. We still are investing in hotels, just not as much as before. The way we think of hotels is the way essentially we think about property managers on Airbnb. Airbnb is a community of 4 million hosts; 90% are individuals, and they are who we prioritize, that\u2019s where our guests speak, our guests want something that\u2019s one of a kind, and this is typically offered by our individual hosts. But that being said, we never want Airbnb guests to come to Airbnb and not be able to find something they\u2019re looking for. So, we think that hotels in addition to property, managers are really important for our strategy instilling in our network apps. Again, we don\u2019t want anyone to come to Airbnb and beat, because they couldn\u2019t find a place to stay. So, hotels are important. And as we know, most hotels around the world are below 50% occupancy. So, we know they\u2019re in need of demand and Airbnb certainly, can provide that demand for them. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with experiences and hotels, both part of our strategy in the future.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Great, thanks and good afternoon. A couple of questions from me, really follow-ups. But given some of the expense rationalization last year, how confident are you at this point that you have the team and the infrastructure in place to handle more rapid rebound and travel if that\u2019s what does transpire over the course of the year? And then I know this may be a little bit difficult to answer at this point. You addressed it a little bit earlier, but some of the newer use cases such as long-term stays in shorter trips, do you have a view into whether those can be sustainable or incremental over what were normal use cases pre-pandemic? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Really, good question. So, let me start with being able to handle the rebound in the face of reductions. And then I\u2019ll go to new use cases, and Dave will fill in as needed. With regards to the reductions, a lot of the reductions have just made us significantly more efficient and be able to handle the rebound. One of the big changes we made \u2013 or really, there were two big changes we made. The first big change we made is that we got much more focused. So, it means we scaled back a lot of new investment areas and put our very best people on only a few problems, especially our core of hosting. But the other thing we did is because of that we shifted from a divisional business unit structure to a functional organization. And this reduced lots of people case with the function, instead of having multiple marketing departments, most multiple product departments, multiple operations group, we now have one technology group, one marketing group, one operations group, and this made us not only more efficient being able to turn on a dime much more quickly. So, we are preparing for this next rebound. I think that we are much more efficient. Those reductions will be able to sustain, the one group that that\u2019s up the scale a little more linearly, is customer service. We are scaling that ahead of demand, but making a mistake, even that is going to be significantly more efficient. We hired a woman, who running our operations name Tara Bunch. She ran all customer service at Apple for many years, and she has built a great team, including new leaders for trust and community support. And we are focused on improving efficiency by reducing contact rates. We are very, very focused on reducing the need for people to call us or message us, because they have a problem. If they do have to call us or message us, we are going to focus on making our agents significantly more efficient. So that\u2019s a really big focus area on the reductions. Now, on the new use cases, the short answer is yes, we do believe these new use cases are sustainable. Though we can\u2019t predict the future, we do know a few things to be true. Many of the reasons why people are using Airbnb for new use cases is because technology has digitized so much of the world that we can now do things remotely, we couldn\u2019t do before. So what this means is, because more people can work from home on a laptop, that means they can work out of any home. And so we think in the future, fewer people are going to be tethered to a permanent destination. And even people who are going to take more three-day weekends, they might be more likely to go away for the summer. And we think that in addition to the kind of short-term state, these medium length space a couple of weeks, or even a couple of months, we think these are going to be a really big part of the story. I guess the headline is this; people aren\u2019t just traveling on and live on Airbnb. They\u2019re now living on Airbnb. And I think that\u2019s here to stay. Dave, I\u2019ll hand it over to you.\nDave Stephenson: Yes. I\u2019ll keep the things at round out is that we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m very happy with the underlying progress we\u2019ve made in our operations support area, in terms of improving the efficiency there. We are making some investments in it in 2021, that\u2019s going to mask some of the underlying progress that we get to see internally. And the other thing that was happening as Brian said, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re ready for the rebound when it occurs, which means that we are going to be investing slightly more earlier in the year to make sure that we have all the support ready for a return to travel and being optimistic that it will return soon. And so with relatively more revenue in the first half than the second half, our operations support expenses, as a percent of revenue will be \u2013 sorry, it will be a little bit higher in the first half and the second half.\nColin Sebastian: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Michael Graham with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. please go ahead.\nMichael Graham: Oh, sorry. I was on mute. Pardon me. Two quick questions; one, on pricing, you mentioned that your average daily rate was up in the shareholder letter, because of mix shift towards North America partially, but as demand is really robust in some of these areas, can you just talk about how hosts are reacting in terms of setting price and are you seeing them get more opportunistic? And then the other one I wanted to ask was, you talked a little bit about the steps you\u2019re taking to simplify host onboarding. Can you just talk about the steps you\u2019re also taking to simplify that guest experience?\nBrian Chesky: Thank you, Michael. Why don\u2019t I start with simplifying the guest experience and Dave, I can hand it over to you for pricing. So, yes. As we said, to prepare for this travel rebound this summer, we\u2019re doing four things. We\u2019re going to educate the world and Airbnb, what makes them be different, that\u2019s hosting. We\u2019re going to simplify \u2013 we\u2019re going to recruit more hosts. We\u2019re going to simplify the guest experience. So, we\u2019re going to deliver world-class service. So, let\u2019s talk about your question simplifying the guest experience. One of the things we know is that as we make something easier, the conversion rate goes up. And so we have a goal that can \u2013 to make it even easier to be able to book on Airbnb. So, we\u2019re going to be reducing steps \u2013 significantly reducing steps to be able to log in, sign on, get verified, go through the key steps you need to be able to do and be able to find a place on Airbnb. So, we\u2019re looking at the entire end-to-end experience, and we\u2019re going to be doing a bit of a redesign of it over the coming months. I think this is going to be great the next travel season. But the other thing we\u2019re doing, and I want to highlight this, because this is something that I highlight in the very beginning is we\u2019re also changing how Airbnb works, because the whole paradigm that how people search travel is now changed, because today, this year, thus far 40% of people come to Airbnb and they either no longer know, where they\u2019re going or when they\u2019re going, in other words, they\u2019re flexible. And this is a major change, because every travel company has a search box, because people know where they\u2019re going. And so they ask, where are you going? And they have a date and say, check in on this date, check out on that date. This whole new world, that\u2019s much more flexible, means that when people are more open-minded, we can direct demand to where we have supply. And we can actually elevate not just destination, but unique homes that can become the destination. So, we think this is going to change how people search, because it also means that people wouldn\u2019t be more likely to look for something that\u2019s unique and special. And I think that really sets Airbnb up nicely. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do to simplify the guest experience. Dave, I\u2019ll hand over to you.\nDave Stephenson: In regards to ADR, we did see elevated rates of \u2013 average daily rate in Q4 was up 13% year-over-year. We\u2019re seeing almost all of that is just a form of mix. It\u2019s a mix towards North America, which has higher ADR, entire homes and less urban areas, each of which are \u2013 have higher average daily rates. So, we\u2019re actually not seeing new hosts, increased the rate of inflation of the same property year-over-year. I\u2019m sure some are doing it, but we\u2019re not seeing it a material level overall.\nMichael Graham: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Maybe, my numbers are wrong, but when I look back over the last five years, it seems as though you\u2019ve actually widened the gap between yourself and your competitors in the alternative segment. And I just wonder, now that it\u2019s sort of dawned on everyone, as you say that the travel is going to change permanently. Have you seen, or do you anticipate sort of heightened, competitive intensity relative to what the historical financials would suggest? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you very much for the question, Jason. I\u2019ll just \u2013 yes, I\u2019ll start by saying a couple of things. Number one, travel is one of the largest industries in the world and makes up a significant amount of global GDP as I believe one in 10 new jobs was created in the travel industry before the pandemic. So, the first thing I want you to say is this is such a large market. Its multiples larger than like the advertising industry, just to give you a point of reference. And so we think there\u2019s room for a lot of companies. Now with regards to more competition in our space, I mean, we\u2019ve really been seeing this competition for like the last five years actually. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really that different. What I have found though is this, I think that fundamentally, Airbnb, we\u2019re in a bit of a different space than our competitors, because Airbnb, we are focused primarily on individual host. They can price 90% of our 4 million hosts. And OTAs are primarily focused on professional hosts. We have professional host as well, and we think professional hosts will probably list on any site that provides a great experience and give them high-quality guests. And we of course, will do that, but we think individual hosts are less likely to want to listen to multiple platforms. We\u2019re the only platform that has a custom built platform designed specifically for individual hosts. We solved a lot of the really hard problems that individual host needs like the system of trust. Individual hosts want to know the quality for example, of their guest, 70% of hosts leave a review of guests after the stay. And that means, for example, a lot of guests actually have reviews. That\u2019s just one of many examples of the kind of custom built platform we\u2019ve made for individual hosts. And so I don\u2019t think competition is anything different, but I also think we\u2019re a bit of a category of one in the sense that we are really focused on the individual host as our primary opportunity area.\nJason Bazinet: That\u2019s super-interesting. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. We\u2019ve spoken a lot on discovery and just how travel is changing. I\u2019m curious to hear how you\u2019re thinking of helping individual hosts improve their level of service. Just you can make sure that special trips keep happening on Airbnb. And mine is a quick follow-up, it\u2019s got a great asset with your payments platform. I\u2019d love to hear about just how you see that investment evolving and where do you see more opportunity to provide value either to hosts or guests? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Great questions. So, why don\u2019t I start with hosts and then we\u2019re going to payments and I\u2019ll let Dave so \u2013 elaborate on payments. So, one of the things we\u2019re gaining is in addition to recruiting more hosts this year, we want to make sure our hosts are set up to succeed. and to be able to set up for success, they have to provide great experiences, because they\u2019re reviewed after the stay obviously. And so we\u2019re working on a number of tools. We\u2019re going to be developing a bit more host education to be able to educate host. We have a Host Advisory Board that has 17 hosts that come from 14 countries and they\u2019re going to be advising us on features that we build to be able to help our hosts be successful. We have a number of tools we\u2019re investing in, pricing tools to help them price their listing and improving our calendar tools, giving them more tips to provide better experiences. We\u2019re going to be updating the way, the information we collect and reviews to be able to give more helpful feedback to hosts. And I\u2019ll just say at a more fundamental level that this person managing our host organization is a woman named Catherine Powell. As I said, she is an executive from Disney. She managed the Disney cast members, and that seems to me, they created a Disney University, where they did a lot of education and we want to bring a lot of those learnings to educating our hosts. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re just a distribution platform for our hosts. We\u2019re really an enablement platform and we want to make sure we build all the tools and services, and educational materials that they need to be able to be successful. The last thing I\u2019ll just say with our hosts is we\u2019re also going to be providing elevated levels of customer service to our hosts. And we think, we can do this well, even becoming more efficient on the cost of customer service. So that is what we\u2019re doing for hosts. Now on payments, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll hand over to Dave, just to give a point of reference. In 2019, we processed approximately $70 billion of guest and host transaction and this was an over 40 tenancies across 220 countries and regions. So, we think this is a really unique capability that we have. The reason we even built a payments platform in the first place is, because we started with individual hosts. We didn\u2019t start with hotels and individual people couldn\u2019t actually receive money very easily and we were \u2013 because we\u2019re such a global network, we\u2019re in nearly every country in the world. We actually have to have a really custom built payment platform to be able to facilitate money between these countries. So, it\u2019s very strategic to this company. And I think it\u2019s one of the kind of best kept secrets of Airbnb, our payments capability. Dave, you want elaborate on it?\nDave Stephenson: Yes. I mean, we process 100% of the guests payments on Airbnb and it\u2019s super-powerful, individual hosts would not be able to host without us processing those payments for us. So, if you look at competitors that have substantially lower penetration of payments, it is a definite pinpoint for individuals, because it\u2019s not like they can do it on their own. And it also does other benefit that as we add more payment methods in, as Brian said, 140 countries across the globe. We keep working on ways to localize these payment methods in all the different countries. The payment methods and customs in Brazil are different than those of Russia; they\u2019re different than those in France, different than those in the United States. And so we really want to localize these payment methods and we get a double benefit of that. One is, we often decrease our costs by being more local and the second is often to increase our conversion. So, those are all great benefits.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So Brian, what do you think is a gap in awareness of Airbnb between your more well-established markets like the U.S. and some of your emerging territories and why do you think the corresponding difference in activity that you see between the developed versus emerging territories that you can look to close? And I guess secondarily, this is probably not the best question to ask while your host is still struggling with request demand. but the fees that you are charging seem to be fairly minimal especially through the individual hosts. So, is there a greater desire to start shifting that takeaway burden away from the consumer perhaps gradually overtime, or do you feel like you want to continue on this current path as there\u2019s probably so much more supply out there that you might want to consolidate have the lock onto Airbnb? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you for the question, Steven. I\u2019ll answer the first question. I\u2019ll let Dave answer the second. With regards to the question about the gap of awareness between a mature markets and our new markets. Yes. I mean, our brand is extremely strong in countries all over the world. but in particular, United States, France, UK, Australia, Canada, English speaking countries, and then France, I think in particular non-English speaking country. but it\u2019s got an extremely strong kind of culture of using Airbnb over many years. There is absolutely a gap between those and new emerging market. but this is an exciting opportunity, because the biggest gap is awareness. And what we found pretty universally is in nearly every country in the world, once the awareness normalizes, the growth rates and the volume of business gets to be approximately similar. So, the major thing we need to do is just increase awareness for Airbnb in our emerging markets. We\u2019re starting this year with investing more in brand marketing. We\u2019re going to be doing digital advertising all over the world. And I expect in the coming years, we\u2019re going to be targeting key countries that are emerging opportunities for us. We\u2019ve had a lot of success in Japan over the last few years. We\u2019ve been on a really long journey to build that business. We had great success in Mexico, Brazil, numerous countries and different countries all over the world. And I do think we are this near by farthe most global network and all travel. There\u2019s very few corners in the world, where Airbnb doesn\u2019t have a strong community, but I do think that we have a very big opportunity to grow in other countries. And I think in particular, once cross border travel reemerges it, and it will in the coming year, there\u2019s going to be a huge opportunity for us. Dave, I\u2019ll hand you for the second question.\nDave Stephenson: Great. On fees, it\u2019s just important that we charge a really fair price for stays in Airbnb and we continue to have a great value. We believe that we do have a great value there. You can have a whole home for the price of a typical hotel, is the other way when we look at our fees, we want to make sure that those fees are great value to both guests and to hosts and we do have a mix of those fees. In some cases, we have a mix of a low host fee and a higher guest fee. And then for some of our professional hosts, we\u2019ll have a host only fee and all of it is on the host side. And so we\u2019ll see a mix. The mix could change over time. We continue to test and evolve to see what works best for our guests, our hosts, and we\u2019ll just continue to evolve and iterate to make sure that we provide the best value to the overall community. Overall, kind of the philosophy is, as we give more back to the community in terms of services and capability than we would \u2013 could see opportunities for further increases uptake rate. But we would always want to give more back to the community before we would increase that take rate.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. In terms of the guest profile in 2020, just shares that the recent trends in travel such as domestic, non-urban and whole homes thought in a larger mix of new guests in 2020 versus 2019, and could that potentially drive further growth and future years? And then secondly, kind of occupancy you mentioned [Technical Difficulty] had been around 17% pre-COVID. So, what would you say are the largest drivers in order to move that rate higher over time? Thanks.\nDave Stephenson: On the mix of new guests, it has been a great opportunity to introduce Airbnb to new driving 50 miles down the road [Technical Difficulty]. So, I would say that the rebound of our business has still been skewed moderately back towards existing guests, guests that know all about Airbnb and all the benefits that we have. So, we think it\u2019s been a great opportunity to expose it. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the \u2013 it\u2019s disproportionately been new guests coming into Airbnb now. But at the same time, I think we are just becoming more of a mainstream opportunity for people that it\u2019s no longer the alternative. We really are the default. On occupancy rates, occupancy is kind of Brian mentioned earlier is just an area that can flux over time that, we can also get drive up the occupancy of the existing property. So, we don\u2019t need to necessarily increase the number of listings to drive incremental nights, but it is an opportunity that as we get more nights, we can also bring in people that are more flexible in the times like if they\u2019re traveling for a week, maybe they only use their home for a whole week. So, occupancy is probably not the best measure of performance on Airbnb, because if you\u2019re an individual host, it\u2019s not like you want to constantly drive up the use of your existing home. You just want to make sure that the home is available some part of the time during the year.\nMario Lu: Right. That makes sense.\nOperator: Okay. And your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks so much. So, during the pandemic, you\u2019ve seen kind of these sunscreen [ph] suburban properties do really as well. As we\u2019ve started to see some pickup here in booking activity with the COVID cases falling especially for the summer, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in some of the urban areas that have been hardest hit by the pandemic and also maybe, the kind of big picture outlook for those urban properties as we emerge?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, I think this would be great for you.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. Urban is still a really important part of our business. We have over 40% of our nights are still are urban and it\u2019s just the non-urban and low density urban is the place, where we\u2019re seeing the greater growth right now. So, it\u2019s still a really important part. And as probable returns that we\u2019re going to find is there are number of hotels that actually aren\u2019t going to be coming back online anytime soon. Brian also talked about the redistribution of a bit of travel, where people are going to go to some smaller communities that may not even have hotels. And so as this mix that\u2019s going to be kind of changing over time and as travel rebounds, I think we\u2019ll see continue to see nice growth in the non-urban and low density urban, and urban comes back, that would just be another tailwind for us.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks so much.\nDave Stephenson: Okay.\nOperator: And that is all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you, everyone for joining us today for our first earnings call as a public company. Before I end today, I just want to end by thanking all of you, our shareholders to our early shareholders, thank you for sticking with us and to all of our new shareholders. Thanks for joining us on this journey. It\u2019s just beginning. we look forward to sharing our progress this year with you. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Stephenson",
            "content": "Yes, I think you\u2019ve covered really well. I\u2019ll just round it out by saying that we\u2019ll continue to use performance marketing, where it makes economic sense to do so. It\u2019s absolutely important level and we\u2019ll absolutely continue to do it. We\u2019re just going to have a higher rate of return expectation on the performance marketing spend and we\u2019ll return to the levels that we saw in 2019. Our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 will be below that of 2019. The absolute dollars in 2021 will be below that of 2019. And I guess I\u2019ll run this out by saying that, because of the marketing campaign that made possible by hosts as launching now and in advance of the summer travel season, you\u2019re going to see sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue higher than the first half of this year that you are in the second half. Yes. I\u2019ll just round it out by saying; the overall number of active listening to experiences was relatively stable in Q4 relative to Q3 at about $5.6 million. So we actually haven\u2019t seen a substantial amount of deactivations, it\u2019s been very stable and for all the reasons that Brian said earlier, we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to be adding new hosts in the future, just given all of the tailwinds of the kind of macroeconomic factors that we have going around the world. As far as margin targets, one of the things we\u2019re really proud of is the progress we\u2019ve made on our profitability efficiency over 2020, right. We\u2019ve made substantial reductions in our fixed costs. We will not be having to add back fixed costs to support a business that will again, approach 2019 levels and beyond. And so our fixed cost discipline is great and we\u2019ll continue. And then we saw really great improvement in our variable cost efficiency across the P&L. And when you actually removed in Q4, remove the one-time impacts and stock-based compensation relative to the IPO, or our costs are down in every category across our P&L. And it\u2019s that discipline at very low expenses, things like cost of payments, community support expenses, infrastructure expenses, all the way down that we\u2019re proud of. And what we would like to \u2013 expect to achieve over time is 30% EBITDA margins or greater. And this has just accelerated our path towards those long-term margin targets. I\u2019d love to give you on specific targets for 2021, but it\u2019s just too hard to know what our revenue is going to be. And so therefore kind of a flow through to profitability, we\u2019re seeing that our revenue rates in Q1 will be better than the revenue growth rates in Q4. But we just don\u2019t have a lot of visibility in the back half of the year to give you a lot of guidance on profitability right now. Sure. Yes. I don\u2019t have a lot of color that I can give you on summer travel bookings. I mean, one thing, which I can say is that people are booking in shorter windows. So, the greatest growth we\u2019re seeing in the business right now are booking windows in less than 30 days and typically, kind of pre-COVID, you\u2019re right. We\u2019d be seeing much more of the bookings now it had for the summer travel season, and that is delayed relative to kind of historic patterns. We\u2019re seeing some bright spots as in a little bit of a bright spot in the UK, dragging some summer travel bookings here in Q1. but I really don\u2019t have a more color that I can give to you on summer expectations. We just know that we want to be ready for the travel rebound when it occurs. We just don\u2019t know exactly when it will occur. Yes. I\u2019ll keep the things at round out is that we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m very happy with the underlying progress we\u2019ve made in our operations support area, in terms of improving the efficiency there. We are making some investments in it in 2021, that\u2019s going to mask some of the underlying progress that we get to see internally. And the other thing that was happening as Brian said, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re ready for the rebound when it occurs, which means that we are going to be investing slightly more earlier in the year to make sure that we have all the support ready for a return to travel and being optimistic that it will return soon. And so with relatively more revenue in the first half than the second half, our operations support expenses, as a percent of revenue will be \u2013 sorry, it will be a little bit higher in the first half and the second half. In regards to ADR, we did see elevated rates of \u2013 average daily rate in Q4 was up 13% year-over-year. We\u2019re seeing almost all of that is just a form of mix. It\u2019s a mix towards North America, which has higher ADR, entire homes and less urban areas, each of which are \u2013 have higher average daily rates. So, we\u2019re actually not seeing new hosts, increased the rate of inflation of the same property year-over-year. I\u2019m sure some are doing it, but we\u2019re not seeing it a material level overall. Yes. I mean, we process 100% of the guests payments on Airbnb and it\u2019s super-powerful, individual hosts would not be able to host without us processing those payments for us. So, if you look at competitors that have substantially lower penetration of payments, it is a definite pinpoint for individuals, because it\u2019s not like they can do it on their own. And it also does other benefit that as we add more payment methods in, as Brian said, 140 countries across the globe. We keep working on ways to localize these payment methods in all the different countries. The payment methods and customs in Brazil are different than those of Russia; they\u2019re different than those in France, different than those in the United States. And so we really want to localize these payment methods and we get a double benefit of that. One is, we often decrease our costs by being more local and the second is often to increase our conversion. So, those are all great benefits. Great. On fees, it\u2019s just important that we charge a really fair price for stays in Airbnb and we continue to have a great value. We believe that we do have a great value there. You can have a whole home for the price of a typical hotel, is the other way when we look at our fees, we want to make sure that those fees are great value to both guests and to hosts and we do have a mix of those fees. In some cases, we have a mix of a low host fee and a higher guest fee. And then for some of our professional hosts, we\u2019ll have a host only fee and all of it is on the host side. And so we\u2019ll see a mix. The mix could change over time. We continue to test and evolve to see what works best for our guests, our hosts, and we\u2019ll just continue to evolve and iterate to make sure that we provide the best value to the overall community. Overall, kind of the philosophy is, as we give more back to the community in terms of services and capability than we would \u2013 could see opportunities for further increases uptake rate. But we would always want to give more back to the community before we would increase that take rate. On the mix of new guests, it has been a great opportunity to introduce Airbnb to new driving 50 miles down the road [Technical Difficulty]. So, I would say that the rebound of our business has still been skewed moderately back towards existing guests, guests that know all about Airbnb and all the benefits that we have. So, we think it\u2019s been a great opportunity to expose it. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the \u2013 it\u2019s disproportionately been new guests coming into Airbnb now. But at the same time, I think we are just becoming more of a mainstream opportunity for people that it\u2019s no longer the alternative. We really are the default. On occupancy rates, occupancy is kind of Brian mentioned earlier is just an area that can flux over time that, we can also get drive up the occupancy of the existing property. So, we don\u2019t need to necessarily increase the number of listings to drive incremental nights, but it is an opportunity that as we get more nights, we can also bring in people that are more flexible in the times like if they\u2019re traveling for a week, maybe they only use their home for a whole week. So, occupancy is probably not the best measure of performance on Airbnb, because if you\u2019re an individual host, it\u2019s not like you want to constantly drive up the use of your existing home. You just want to make sure that the home is available some part of the time during the year. Sure. Urban is still a really important part of our business. We have over 40% of our nights are still are urban and it\u2019s just the non-urban and low density urban is the place, where we\u2019re seeing the greater growth right now. So, it\u2019s still a really important part. And as probable returns that we\u2019re going to find is there are number of hotels that actually aren\u2019t going to be coming back online anytime soon. Brian also talked about the redistribution of a bit of travel, where people are going to go to some smaller communities that may not even have hotels. And so as this mix that\u2019s going to be kind of changing over time and as travel rebounds, I think we\u2019ll see continue to see nice growth in the non-urban and low density urban, and urban comes back, that would just be another tailwind for us. Okay."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Ian, and thank you all for joining today. I am excited to share our results for the first time as a public company. I want to start by acknowledging that we are still in a pandemic and a lot of people are hurting. So, we know how lucky we are to be in the position we\u2019re in. Now, before I go into a result, I want to share a theme that we\u2019ll run through each of our earnings calls. When we started Airbnb, it was about more than just travel. In 2007, my roommate, Joe and I, played three airbeds one weekend and turned our apartment into an airbed and breakfast. We hosted three guests that weekend, Michael, Kate, and Amol. And in doing so became the first host. Our guests arrived as strangers, but they left as our friends. And the connections we made that weekend made us realize maybe, there\u2019s a bigger idea here. Since then, we\u2019ve grown from two hosts to San Francisco to 4 million hosts all around the world. The idea of Airbnb is only possible, because of host. Without host, you\u2019re an outsider in the place that you visit. without hosts, you have nowhere to stay, but crowded tourist districts or resort. A great host does more than share their space. They provide a deeper connection to the places you visited, the people who live there, and they set the stage for you to be able to spend meaningful time, but the people who travel it. So this is why 14 years later, hosting is still at the center of Airbnb. As the world continues to change, people\u2019s fundamental need for connection and belonging or not. This is what will remain focused on day-in and day-out, quarter-after-quarter. With that, let me talk about our results. 2020 was a year when nearly everything changed, the way we live, the way we work and the way we travel. Airbnb changed as well. We started 2020 by preparing for IPO, only to have to put on hold once the world went into lockdown. But then in the face of the biggest prices in the travel industry has ever seen, our business proved to be resilient and our model was able to adapt. Through the crisis, we also sharpened our focus. We made many difficult decisions while staying true to our core principles that we became a stronger company as a result, and we succeeded in going public after all. Now, despite a difficult year, we are encouraged by our resilient business performance and the depths of the pandemic, we have forecasted that revenue in 2020 could be less than half of 2019 levels. Yes. We delivered $3.4 billion, a full-year revenue in 2020, down only 30% compared to the year earlier. In Q4, our revenue of $859 million was down only 22% year-over-year, despite the second wave of COVID cases and widespread lockdowns. In addition to this top-line resilience, we also demonstrated focus and discipline to protect our profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA in 2020 was slightly better than 2019 and this was despite revenue being down $1.4 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2020 with nearly $250 million better than Q4 2019. This was despite revenue in Q4 2020 being $250 million lower than a year earlier. So, we\u2019re able to achieve these results, because of the adaptability of our business model, and because of our focus and financial discipline. We believe these two factors set us up well for the coming travel rebound and travel is coming back nearly a year after lockdowns began, we believe people are yearning for what\u2019s been taken away from them, travel and human connection. When travel returned, it will be about connection. People will want to spend meaningful time with their family and friends and because of this, as restrictions lift and borders begin to open, we expect there will be a significant travel rebound. So in 2021, our single priority is to prepare for the coming travel rebound. to do this, what we\u2019re going to do is perfect the entire end-to-end experience of our core service. First, we\u2019re going to educate the world about what makes Airbnb different hosting. through our marketing and communications, we will educate guests that being hosted is a better way to travel. In addition, we will inspire more people to become hosts. Next, we will recruit more hosts and set them up for success. Once you\u2019ve educated people about hosting, we\u2019ll simplify the onboarding process. So, it\u2019s easier to for hosts to get started, and we are improving our tools and support to help them succeed. Third, to make it easier for guests to find the perfect stay, we are simplifying every part of the guest experience as well as improving our search functionality to support more flexible travel patterns. And finally, whenever our hosts or guests need us, we need to deliver world-class service. So, we\u2019re actively fixing product issues that drive community contacts, we\u2019re scaling our operations to meet the demand and continually enhancing our service? So that is our plan for 2021, educate the world about hosting, recruit more hosts and set them up for success, simplify the guest experience and deliver world-class service. I want to end by just highlighting two things that we launched this week that I\u2019m really proud of. On Monday, we launched our first large scale marketing campaign in five years, made possible by host. Even though the brand of Airbnb is mainstream, the idea of hosting is not yet. Our goal with this campaign is to make a long-term investment in educating the world about our hosts. This campaign will help our guests to understand the benefits of being hosted and how this is unique to Airbnb. And it will create more awareness around the idea of becoming a host by making it more mainstream and aspirational. by using real photos of real guests on real Airbnb trips, this campaign shows what the real experience of being hosted is like. And I think it speaks directly to the need for connection that people all over the world are feeling after nearly a year of isolation. So that is made possible by hosts. And second finally, flexible dates. on Tuesday, we launched a new feature that we call flexible date. today, more people are working from home and that needs more flexibility about when and where they travel. Because of this, we\u2019re seeing a shift in how people search on Airbnb. in 2021 to-date, almost 40% of people searching on Airbnb have been flexible in terms of their date or their location of their stay. This is a huge change in the search paradigm and travel. flexible date allows guests to search for homes in a whole new way. Instead of having to select the exact dates for a trip, guests are able to do broader searches. Now, you can search for a weekend getaway, a weeklong vacation, or even a month long stay sometimes the next few months. This allows our guests to browse more options while being flexible on the exact dates of their trip and we think this will be a very popular feature coming this travel season. So that\u2019s our plan for this year to prepare for the coming travel rebound. We\u2019re excited about the year ahead. And with that, I look forward to answering your questions today. Yes. Thank you for asking the questions and I\u2019ll start and Dave, you can obviously feel free to elaborate. I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll start with the second question. We are seeing a lot of resiliency in certain geographies, especially in North America and Europe. What we\u2019ve generally found is that domestic travel globally is pretty strong and that the primary challenge is cross border travel in addition to of course, business travel, but we\u2019re not as affected by business travel reductions. And so countries with really strong domestic travel are seeing more resilience than countries that are not as \u2013 that are not as affected by the cross border travel. So that\u2019s the first thing that we\u2019re seeing. And I\u2019m very encouraged by it. now, as far as retention of users that we got last year, we are seeing continued strong retention. There\u2019s no major changes. I think the retention of our user base has historically been strong and it was very strong last year. I\u2019ll just highlight a couple of things. One of the reasons I think our retention is strong is, because people are finding many new use cases to use Airbnb in addition to all the old rates that use that. So, even though borders were closed and international travel is reduced, many people found longer-term stays in Airbnb, because they were working from home. They were flexible. Many people want to get in cars and travel nearby, staying in a local community. And so we\u2019re able to seek that demand as well. And so there\u2019s a number of areas that I think that provide a lot of resiliency for our model. I think it\u2019s inherently adaptable and as our model adapts, that means retention increases, because there are more uses for our guests. Thank you. Yes, that\u2019s a really good question. I want to really underscore this point, the way \u2013 let me kind of \u2013 let me say this, travel will come back, but when travel comes back, we believe it\u2019s going to look different than before. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going back to the world of travel in 2019, it\u2019s going to change and it\u2019s going to be different. And probably, the biggest difference we\u2019ve seen is flexibility. A world of Zoom is a world, where more people can work from home and a world, where more people have the flexibility of work from home. We\u2019re seeing more people say they can work for many home on Airbnb. And so we\u2019ve seen a number of new use cases. People are living more nomadically. Some people are taking longer-term stays, one or two months at a time in our Airbnb. People are taking extended three, four-day weekends. So, like many weekends in a row, because they don\u2019t have to be in the physical office. And many people are snowboarding, they\u2019re like essentially living in somewhere cold and they want to go somewhere warm. They have the flexibility to do that. The other thing you\u2019ve mentioned is new people hosting. One of the things we found is that many people like to start hosting at the beginning of a life change. Maybe, somebody has kids and the kids move out of the house. They got some extra bedrooms. Maybe, they were recently unemployed. They recently lost their job, or they\u2019re now living more remotely and their home is more available. So, one of the things that we\u2019re really excited about is as we see more flexibility and more week or month long stays, there\u2019s more empty homes people are leaving behind. And our largest source of hosts in 2019 were prior guests, 23% of our hosts in 2019 were guests first. As we think, there\u2019s big opportunities for us to continue to convert our guests to become hosts. And this new world of flexibility means more empty homes that can be shared. Thank you. Yes. these are two really good questions. Thank you for them. I\u2019ll start with supply, then I\u2019ll go to performance marketing. on supply, let\u2019s just start framing it. We have about four million hosts on Airbnb. 90% of our hosts are individual hosts. These are everyday people, typically school teachers, healthcare workers, students, 55% of them are women. And the vast majority of them come direct to Airbnb. So most of our hosts, we don\u2019t have to acquire per se. They come organically, often because they\u2019ve heard of Airbnb. Their friends have recommended it to them, who are also hosts for \u2013 because as I mentioned before, 23% of our hosts in 2019 were prior guests. The second point I\u2019d make is our model is pretty adaptable. So, we have hosts [ph] in 100,000 communities. One of the things we\u2019re seeing is a change of travel patterns right now in the pandemic. people aren\u2019t just looking to go to the same 20 cities or 30 cities. They now want to get in cars and travel the local communities nearby. That means a travel in a sense is being redistributed to thousands of communities. This helps us smooth out any supply demand gaps that we might have, but we do have a number of levers to add supply. Let me start by saying yes, our existing hosts rent their homes only occasionally. So, we see huge opportunities for productivity. The average host on Airbnb makes like under $10,000 a year and they do that by renting out just occasionally. So, we think there\u2019s a huge opportunity to increase productivity of the hosts that we already have. That being said, we also think now is the time that people are interested in hosting more than ever before. Airbnb \u2013 we started Airbnb in a recession and during the recession of 2008; people were losing their jobs, losing their homes and many people turned to Airbnb for income. We think now hosting is as appealing as ever before, given the economic circumstances happening in this country and around the world. And so we\u2019re doing a few things, made possible by host is a global campaign it\u2019s as I said, our first global campaign in five years. And we think if this campaign successful, this can absolutely mainstream hosting and bring a lot of people to our platform. In addition, we\u2019re doing a companion campaign called made possible by hosting. And that\u2019s going to talk about all the benefits of hosting, and we\u2019re going to really target people that are going through a life transition. As I said, people that just renovated their home, bought a new house, lost their job. Maybe, they\u2019re retired, maybe, their kids moved out of the house. So, we think this is a really great way to be able to target and recruit more hosts. Once they come to Airbnb, we want to make it more \u2013 we want to increase the conversion rate of people come to Airbnb and then listing, an active listing on Airbnb. conversion rates the name of the game, one of the things we\u2019ve learned about conversion rate is easier to make something. And the more support you offer to somebody, the more likely they\u2019re going to get through the conversion funnel. So, we\u2019re reducing the steps. We\u2019re going to allow you to become a host in less than 10 minutes. And if you need help, you can call customer service or we\u2019re going to match you to existing hosts to be able to support you along this journey. If we do these things, I think we\u2019ll be able to add a significant amount of more hosts, because the average person around the world that they knew that they can make some extra money by meeting interesting people. A lot more people would do it. Now, the next question is about marketing performance marketing. And let me just also take a step back and talk a little bit more about our marketing strategy, because I think this is very important to the corporate story. In 2019, we had elevated spending of performance marketing and then 2020 occurred, our business dropped by 80% in eight weeks. And we pulled back all marketing, including performance marketing. But something remarkable happened even before we started resuming our marketing spend, our traffic levels came back to 95% of the traffic levels of 2019 without any marketing spend. And what this revealed is that our brand is inherently strong. It\u2019s a noun and verb in pop culture. And so we don\u2019t intend to ever against, then the amount of money as a percentage of revenue on marketing in the future as we did in 2019. in Q4, 90% of our \u2013 more than 90% of our traffic was direct or unpaid. And we think that will continue in the future. our marketing plan; therefore, our strategy is the following, a full funnel marketing approach. The top of the funnel was actually PR. we got more than 0.5 million articles in last year in 2020. And we had as much share of voice as most of the other major travel companies combined. And that\u2019s how we really built the brand of Airbnb more than anything; probably with PR. second is brand marketing, we think of brand marketing as education and investment. And so made possible by hosting is by hosts is an investment in hosting. and then performance marketing, we don\u2019t treat performance marketing like other travel companies. We think of it as like a laser. It\u2019s not a way to arbitrage users. It\u2019s a way to laser in on where we want to acquire guests or hosts and key markets, where we have a supplier demand mismatch, but make no mistake our efficiencies, we\u2019re going to hold to a lot higher level than 2019 or years prior. I don\u2019t know if Dave, you want to share anything else about that? Thank you very much, Justin. Why don\u2019t I start? And then I\u2019ll let Dave elaborate. Let me just start at a high level about cost discipline. We would have, of course, like everyone else never asked for last year\u2019s crisis. but I do think that crisis made us a much better company, because the first thing that happened is we got more disciplined. when our business was precipitously falling, we knew we couldn\u2019t focus on everything. So, we focused on what was most special about Airbnb. That was our individual post. It means we scaled back numerous investments, but something else Justin we found was as we focused, what it really meant was, we\u2019re taking our very best people and putting on the most important problem. And as we did that, and not only saved money actually drove more growth. I think that in addition to the inherent adaptability remodel does explain why we\u2019re able to see a fairly strong recovery in the back half of last year. I\u2019ll let Dave talk a little bit more about margin targets, but I\u2019ll just also get to host and I\u2019ll hand over to dave. on latent host offering and/or this question of did hosts pull back and do they intend to host again? What we know is this. In any given day, we have a certain number of hosts active and live in the platform. We know that when hosts deactivate, it\u2019s often not permanent, it\u2019s because they\u2019re taking a break from hosting and we know many hosts are intending to host once again. And so one of the things we\u2019re doing as I did a Q&A town hall with thousands of hosts. And I basically said to them together, we have to be ready and we want to be prepared for this travel season. And our goal to collectively with our hosts is to be ready before the rebound happens. We\u2019d rather be early than late. And so we do expect a lot of hosts to be ready. And one of the dynamics we basically found is one of the nice things about our business is as a host gets more booked up, they often either expand by adding a listing or more likely they\u2019ll tell their friends, who also become hosts. So with occupancy rise, it does have a nice, nice benefit, where word gets out, that people are making money. And if we can fulfill that with a couple of minutes out with our brand campaign, I think it could yield quite a few gains. Dave, do you want to cover either of these? Thank you for the question. Dave maybe, you can take summer travel and I\u2019ll take Olympics. And then on the question of the Olympics, just we are \u2013 we are a sponsor of the Olympics and if the Olympics has fans, I think, it would be a great boon to travel. but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear this year in Tokyo that we\u2019ll have fans. So, we\u2019ll have to see how that goes. So, I can just comment more broadly about what we\u2019re seeing with travel demand. We did a survey recently of American travelers and we found a couple of things. The first thing we found is that people missed traveling, that\u2019s not surprising, but we also found that people missed traveling more than any other out-of-home activity. People missed traveling more in America than going to a restaurant, going to sports, live music or other activities, but they don\u2019t miss all kinds of traveling. Generally, people don\u2019t miss traveling for business as much, and they generally don\u2019t miss mass tourism. They\u2019re generally not missing standing in a line with selfie sticks in front of a landmark for example, or going to a crowded lobby. the kind of travel that people missed is spending meaningful time that the people they care about, their friends and their families. And so we found that the majority of people we surveyed said, they do plan to travel this year. They will do it as soon as they feel safe to do so. So obviously, that\u2019s going to be pegged a little bit to the health crisis. but we see a lot of enthusiasm and I think the kind of travel that we offer, allows people to be able to connect with our friends and family, because our home is a great way to be able to gather and spend a meaningful quality time and that is very much what we\u2019re focused on. We think this is a huge window of opportunity, this travel rebound, and I think it\u2019s going to be disproportionately our travel rebound that\u2019s not going to be cross border. It\u2019s not going to be business travel. People want to get in cars, they\u2019re going to travel to smaller communities, and they\u2019re also going to be staying in home. So, we are prepared or we\u2019re going to be prepared for that. Yes. Thanks for questioning, Brent. So yes, I\u2019ll talk about experiences and hotels. So with experiences, this is a very important product for us. Experiences are one of the purest manifestations of hosting and connection that we have. I mean, in a sense that is the entire product. You have an experience with a host when you connect with other guests. So, this is really important to us. And what we found statistically is that guests on Airbnb actually life experiences, statistically, more than home. For example, more guests leave a five star review after their experience than they do after a home, as a percentage of \u2013 after the reservations. So, we thought last year was going to be a breakout year for experiences, but the opposite happened. We had to put the product on hold with social distancing. So, very quickly pivoted the product to create online experiences, because people couldn\u2019t gather in person. We created one hour activities that you could do from your computer. These were different than Instagram, like videos or YouTube videos. These are actually interactive. So, you actually can connect with a host and you can meet other guests and people are using these, because they\u2019re feeling more isolated and they want to meet other people. And I think as the world starts opening back up, I think we\u2019re very bullish on experiences over the coming years, because when people travel, they\u2019re going to want to do something interesting. And I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all going to desire to go back to getting on double-decker buses and waiting in line and crowded lobbies, or landmarks. they\u2019re going to want to do really interesting activities and I think that\u2019s what our hosts have to offer. And then for people in their own city, I think, you can only sit at home and watch so many shows on Netflix. People will want to get out of their home. And if they want to alternate to a restaurant, I think experiences are a great thing to do in their own city. So, the short answer is that we\u2019re very focused on it. We had to take a bit of a pause last year, but they\u2019re coming back and we\u2019re going to be focused on it, because it\u2019s just another way of hosting. And this is one of many ways that we\u2019re going to continue to allow hosts, to be able to share the world with others. Now, with regards to hotels, this is a little bit of a different story. We made an acquisition of hotel tonight. I\u2019m very proud of the acquisition. I\u2019m very glad we made it. It\u2019s a great team, a great app. It\u2019s one of the most loved hotel booking apps in the world. And we were investing quite heavily in this product. Now, when the crisis happened, we had to scale back certain investments. And one of the investments we scaled back was our investment in hotels, but we ain\u2019t scale back entirely. We still are investing in hotels, just not as much as before. The way we think of hotels is the way essentially we think about property managers on Airbnb. Airbnb is a community of 4 million hosts; 90% are individuals, and they are who we prioritize, that\u2019s where our guests speak, our guests want something that\u2019s one of a kind, and this is typically offered by our individual hosts. But that being said, we never want Airbnb guests to come to Airbnb and not be able to find something they\u2019re looking for. So, we think that hotels in addition to property, managers are really important for our strategy instilling in our network apps. Again, we don\u2019t want anyone to come to Airbnb and beat, because they couldn\u2019t find a place to stay. So, hotels are important. And as we know, most hotels around the world are below 50% occupancy. So, we know they\u2019re in need of demand and Airbnb certainly, can provide that demand for them. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with experiences and hotels, both part of our strategy in the future. Yes. Really, good question. So, let me start with being able to handle the rebound in the face of reductions. And then I\u2019ll go to new use cases, and Dave will fill in as needed. With regards to the reductions, a lot of the reductions have just made us significantly more efficient and be able to handle the rebound. One of the big changes we made \u2013 or really, there were two big changes we made. The first big change we made is that we got much more focused. So, it means we scaled back a lot of new investment areas and put our very best people on only a few problems, especially our core of hosting. But the other thing we did is because of that we shifted from a divisional business unit structure to a functional organization. And this reduced lots of people case with the function, instead of having multiple marketing departments, most multiple product departments, multiple operations group, we now have one technology group, one marketing group, one operations group, and this made us not only more efficient being able to turn on a dime much more quickly. So, we are preparing for this next rebound. I think that we are much more efficient. Those reductions will be able to sustain, the one group that that\u2019s up the scale a little more linearly, is customer service. We are scaling that ahead of demand, but making a mistake, even that is going to be significantly more efficient. We hired a woman, who running our operations name Tara Bunch. She ran all customer service at Apple for many years, and she has built a great team, including new leaders for trust and community support. And we are focused on improving efficiency by reducing contact rates. We are very, very focused on reducing the need for people to call us or message us, because they have a problem. If they do have to call us or message us, we are going to focus on making our agents significantly more efficient. So that\u2019s a really big focus area on the reductions. Now, on the new use cases, the short answer is yes, we do believe these new use cases are sustainable. Though we can\u2019t predict the future, we do know a few things to be true. Many of the reasons why people are using Airbnb for new use cases is because technology has digitized so much of the world that we can now do things remotely, we couldn\u2019t do before. So what this means is, because more people can work from home on a laptop, that means they can work out of any home. And so we think in the future, fewer people are going to be tethered to a permanent destination. And even people who are going to take more three-day weekends, they might be more likely to go away for the summer. And we think that in addition to the kind of short-term state, these medium length space a couple of weeks, or even a couple of months, we think these are going to be a really big part of the story. I guess the headline is this; people aren\u2019t just traveling on and live on Airbnb. They\u2019re now living on Airbnb. And I think that\u2019s here to stay. Dave, I\u2019ll hand it over to you. Thank you, Michael. Why don\u2019t I start with simplifying the guest experience and Dave, I can hand it over to you for pricing. So, yes. As we said, to prepare for this travel rebound this summer, we\u2019re doing four things. We\u2019re going to educate the world and Airbnb, what makes them be different, that\u2019s hosting. We\u2019re going to simplify \u2013 we\u2019re going to recruit more hosts. We\u2019re going to simplify the guest experience. So, we\u2019re going to deliver world-class service. So, let\u2019s talk about your question simplifying the guest experience. One of the things we know is that as we make something easier, the conversion rate goes up. And so we have a goal that can \u2013 to make it even easier to be able to book on Airbnb. So, we\u2019re going to be reducing steps \u2013 significantly reducing steps to be able to log in, sign on, get verified, go through the key steps you need to be able to do and be able to find a place on Airbnb. So, we\u2019re looking at the entire end-to-end experience, and we\u2019re going to be doing a bit of a redesign of it over the coming months. I think this is going to be great the next travel season. But the other thing we\u2019re doing, and I want to highlight this, because this is something that I highlight in the very beginning is we\u2019re also changing how Airbnb works, because the whole paradigm that how people search travel is now changed, because today, this year, thus far 40% of people come to Airbnb and they either no longer know, where they\u2019re going or when they\u2019re going, in other words, they\u2019re flexible. And this is a major change, because every travel company has a search box, because people know where they\u2019re going. And so they ask, where are you going? And they have a date and say, check in on this date, check out on that date. This whole new world, that\u2019s much more flexible, means that when people are more open-minded, we can direct demand to where we have supply. And we can actually elevate not just destination, but unique homes that can become the destination. So, we think this is going to change how people search, because it also means that people wouldn\u2019t be more likely to look for something that\u2019s unique and special. And I think that really sets Airbnb up nicely. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do to simplify the guest experience. Dave, I\u2019ll hand over to you. Thank you very much for the question, Jason. I\u2019ll just \u2013 yes, I\u2019ll start by saying a couple of things. Number one, travel is one of the largest industries in the world and makes up a significant amount of global GDP as I believe one in 10 new jobs was created in the travel industry before the pandemic. So, the first thing I want you to say is this is such a large market. Its multiples larger than like the advertising industry, just to give you a point of reference. And so we think there\u2019s room for a lot of companies. Now with regards to more competition in our space, I mean, we\u2019ve really been seeing this competition for like the last five years actually. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really that different. What I have found though is this, I think that fundamentally, Airbnb, we\u2019re in a bit of a different space than our competitors, because Airbnb, we are focused primarily on individual host. They can price 90% of our 4 million hosts. And OTAs are primarily focused on professional hosts. We have professional host as well, and we think professional hosts will probably list on any site that provides a great experience and give them high-quality guests. And we of course, will do that, but we think individual hosts are less likely to want to listen to multiple platforms. We\u2019re the only platform that has a custom built platform designed specifically for individual hosts. We solved a lot of the really hard problems that individual host needs like the system of trust. Individual hosts want to know the quality for example, of their guest, 70% of hosts leave a review of guests after the stay. And that means, for example, a lot of guests actually have reviews. That\u2019s just one of many examples of the kind of custom built platform we\u2019ve made for individual hosts. And so I don\u2019t think competition is anything different, but I also think we\u2019re a bit of a category of one in the sense that we are really focused on the individual host as our primary opportunity area. Great questions. So, why don\u2019t I start with hosts and then we\u2019re going to payments and I\u2019ll let Dave so \u2013 elaborate on payments. So, one of the things we\u2019re gaining is in addition to recruiting more hosts this year, we want to make sure our hosts are set up to succeed. and to be able to set up for success, they have to provide great experiences, because they\u2019re reviewed after the stay obviously. And so we\u2019re working on a number of tools. We\u2019re going to be developing a bit more host education to be able to educate host. We have a Host Advisory Board that has 17 hosts that come from 14 countries and they\u2019re going to be advising us on features that we build to be able to help our hosts be successful. We have a number of tools we\u2019re investing in, pricing tools to help them price their listing and improving our calendar tools, giving them more tips to provide better experiences. We\u2019re going to be updating the way, the information we collect and reviews to be able to give more helpful feedback to hosts. And I\u2019ll just say at a more fundamental level that this person managing our host organization is a woman named Catherine Powell. As I said, she is an executive from Disney. She managed the Disney cast members, and that seems to me, they created a Disney University, where they did a lot of education and we want to bring a lot of those learnings to educating our hosts. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re just a distribution platform for our hosts. We\u2019re really an enablement platform and we want to make sure we build all the tools and services, and educational materials that they need to be able to be successful. The last thing I\u2019ll just say with our hosts is we\u2019re also going to be providing elevated levels of customer service to our hosts. And we think, we can do this well, even becoming more efficient on the cost of customer service. So that is what we\u2019re doing for hosts. Now on payments, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll hand over to Dave, just to give a point of reference. In 2019, we processed approximately $70 billion of guest and host transaction and this was an over 40 tenancies across 220 countries and regions. So, we think this is a really unique capability that we have. The reason we even built a payments platform in the first place is, because we started with individual hosts. We didn\u2019t start with hotels and individual people couldn\u2019t actually receive money very easily and we were \u2013 because we\u2019re such a global network, we\u2019re in nearly every country in the world. We actually have to have a really custom built payment platform to be able to facilitate money between these countries. So, it\u2019s very strategic to this company. And I think it\u2019s one of the kind of best kept secrets of Airbnb, our payments capability. Dave, you want elaborate on it? Thank you for the question, Steven. I\u2019ll answer the first question. I\u2019ll let Dave answer the second. With regards to the question about the gap of awareness between a mature markets and our new markets. Yes. I mean, our brand is extremely strong in countries all over the world. but in particular, United States, France, UK, Australia, Canada, English speaking countries, and then France, I think in particular non-English speaking country. but it\u2019s got an extremely strong kind of culture of using Airbnb over many years. There is absolutely a gap between those and new emerging market. but this is an exciting opportunity, because the biggest gap is awareness. And what we found pretty universally is in nearly every country in the world, once the awareness normalizes, the growth rates and the volume of business gets to be approximately similar. So, the major thing we need to do is just increase awareness for Airbnb in our emerging markets. We\u2019re starting this year with investing more in brand marketing. We\u2019re going to be doing digital advertising all over the world. And I expect in the coming years, we\u2019re going to be targeting key countries that are emerging opportunities for us. We\u2019ve had a lot of success in Japan over the last few years. We\u2019ve been on a really long journey to build that business. We had great success in Mexico, Brazil, numerous countries and different countries all over the world. And I do think we are this near by farthe most global network and all travel. There\u2019s very few corners in the world, where Airbnb doesn\u2019t have a strong community, but I do think that we have a very big opportunity to grow in other countries. And I think in particular, once cross border travel reemerges it, and it will in the coming year, there\u2019s going to be a huge opportunity for us. Dave, I\u2019ll hand you for the second question. Yes. Dave, I think this would be great for you. Thank you, everyone for joining us today for our first earnings call as a public company. Before I end today, I just want to end by thanking all of you, our shareholders to our early shareholders, thank you for sticking with us and to all of our new shareholders. Thanks for joining us on this journey. It\u2019s just beginning. we look forward to sharing our progress this year with you. Thank you."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website following this call. I\u2019ll now hand over to Ellie Mertz, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb\u2019s fourth quarter of 2021 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter and full year of 2021. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website. During the call, we\u2019ll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We\u2019ve provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I\u2019ll pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you very much, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I\u2019m excited to share our Q4 results with you. Q4 was another record quarter, and 2021 was the best year in Airbnb\u2019s history. In Q4, revenue was $1.5 billion, our best fourth quarter ever and exceeded 2019 by 38%. Net income was $55 million, our best Q4 ever compared to a loss in 2019. And adjusted EBITDA was $333 million, also our best Q4 ever. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was a positive 22% compared to a negative 25% in Q4 of 2019, this is a huge improvement obviously. Now, in Q4, GBV was $11 billion, which surpassed 2019 levels by 32% and was driven by strong ADR. Now, even with Omicron, Q4 Nights and Experiences Booked were only down 3% compared to 2019. And when you exclude APAC, it was actually up 8%. What our [ph] results show is that we\u2019ve been able to respond to this changing world of travel. Nearly two years into the pandemic, it\u2019s clear that we are undergoing the biggest change to travel since the advent of commercial flying. Remote work has untethered many people from the need to be in an office. And as a result, people are spreading out to thousands of towns and cities, staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time. For the first time ever, millions of people can now live anywhere. And we\u2019ve been able to respond to these changes because our model is inherently adaptable. Our millions of hosts offer nearly every type of home in nearly every community around the world. But it\u2019s not just a model. It\u2019s also our culture of relentless innovation. In the last year alone, we made more than 150 upgrades and innovations across every aspect of the Airbnb service. This explains why we had our best year in our company\u2019s history, despite still being in the midst of a pandemic. Now, there are a number of business trends that have been driving the strong performance. First, guests are staying in thousands of small towns and rural communities on Airbnb. Throughout the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen growing demand for domestic and nonurban travels. In Q4, gross nights booked in non-urban markets was up nearly 45% from Q4 2019. And in the past year alone, Airbnb guests stayed in nearly 100,000 towns and cities all around the world. Second, guests are also returning to cities. Q4 nights booked at urban destinations have recovered to -- nearly recovered to Q4 2019 levels. And cross border travel also continues to recover and improved each quarter in 2021. Guests are planning to travel despite variants and surges. Despite the impact of Omicron, in December, gross nights booked were up 40% and the cancellation rate was lower than a year ago. In Q1, we\u2019re already seeing strong demand for the summer travel season compared to 2019. And finally, guests are not just traveling Airbnb, they\u2019re now living on Airbnb. Nearly half of our nights booked in Q4 were for stays of a week or longer. One in five nights were for stays of a month or longer. And in the past year alone, nearly 175,000 guests stayed for three months or longer. So, I\u2019m going to follow on the footsteps of our community. Recently, I shared that I too am going to live on Airbnb. Right now, I\u2019m doing this call from Airbnb in Miami. And I\u2019ll be staying in a different town or city every couple of weeks. I\u2019ve always wanted to do this. But before the pandemic, I had to be in office every day. Now, I have the flexibility that millions of other guests do on Airbnb. And I also think it\u2019s important that as CEO, I deeply understand the nuances and unique opportunities that this use case on Airbnb will provide. So now, I want to recap how we did on last year\u2019s priorities. As you recall, for 2021, our single priority last year was to prepare for the incoming travel rebound. And to do this, we focused on perfecting the end-to-end experience all of our core service. This meant educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success, simplifying the guest journey, and delivering world class service. So, let me just give you a really quick update on each. First, we\u2019ve been educating the world of what makes Airbnb different, and that is hosting. In 2021, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years to educate guests about the benefits of being hosted and inspire more guests to become hosts. It worked. We\u2019ve seen an increase in traffic to our platform in countries we ran the campaign, and this was significantly ahead of non-campaign countries where we didn\u2019t run the campaign. Second, we\u2019ve been recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success. Last year, we redesigned the host onboarding flow, making it easier for new hosts to get started. And we also introduced our d Ask a Superhost program, pairing potential hosts with Superhosts to answer their questions. And finally, we created AirCover top-to-bottom protection, free for every Airbnb Host and only offered on Airbnb. Third, we\u2019ve been simplifying every part of the guest experience. Last year, we introduced I\u2019m Flexible, a whole new way to search on Airbnb when guests are flexible about where and when they\u2019re traveling. And guests, since we\u2019ve launched these features, have used I\u2019m Flexible nearly 800 million times. We\u2019ve also chipped dozens of other product features to improve the guest experience. And finally, fourth, we\u2019ve been focused on delivering world class service to our guests and our hosts. Now, in addition to providing protection for our hosts through AirCover, we launched dedicated Superhost support. Now, dedicated Superhost support provides our most experienced host priority access to our most experienced support agents. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen fewer escalations and faster resolution times, increasing overall Superhost satisfaction. Now, I\u2019m incredibly proud of everything we deliver to our guests and hosts in 2021. But it\u2019s important to note we are not stopping here. Because in 2022 and beyond, what we\u2019re going to do is accelerate our pace of innovation. And we\u2019re going to focus on three key priorities: Live anywhere on Airbnb; unlock the next generation of hosts; and Airbnb becoming the ultimate host to our community. So, let me just give you a quick preview of each. First, live anywhere on Airbnb. As a result of pandemic, millions of people to now live anywhere. They\u2019re now using Airbnb to travel to thousands of towns and cities staying for weeks, months or even entire seasons at a time. Some people without families, like me, I can kind of live a bit nomadically, staying in different Airbnb\u2019s every week or every month. Now, people who have families probably can\u2019t do that. But we\u2019re seeing people who have family going to have a lot more flexibility over the summer, and I think this is why bookings in January for this summer by nights booked are up 25% from this time in 2019. Another people are just going to take some more extended weekends. The key point is that every length of stay on Airbnb is going up, whether it\u2019s two nights, three nights, a week, a month or a season, all lengths of stay except for single nights are up on Airbnb. And we want to design for this new world by making it even easier for guests to live on Airbnb. The second priority is we will unlock the next generation of hosts. With 4 million hosts on Airbnb, we believe we\u2019ve just scratched the surface in growing our host community. So, what we\u2019ve done is we listen to thousands of people who think -- who are thinking about hosting to understand what obstacles there are for them to become a host. And what we\u2019re going to do is systematically address each of these obstacles in order to attract the next generation of host on Airbnb. And finally, Airbnb will become the ultimate host. We believe that Airbnb can be much more than a marketplace that merely connects guests and hosts. Our goal is to provide the ultimate service to our guests, anticipating their needs and going above and beyond just like a good host. Now, by offering a more personalized service, we can dramatically improve the experience for millions of guests around the world. So that\u2019s it. Just to summarize. Q4 was Airbnb\u2019s best quarter ever. Revenues, adjusted EBITDA and net income were all records. We\u2019re in the midst of a revolution in travel because people have newfound flexibility in how they live and work. Our adaptable model and our relentless innovation have allowed us to respond to this moment. And in 2022, we\u2019re going to accelerate our pace of innovation and continue to support this new world of travel. So, with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Two questions from me. I guess, first off, Brian, you recently posted on Twitter the most popular requests for new functionality or services on the platform for this year. I think crypto payments might have been a tough request. But, when you talk about acceleration in the pace of innovation, what should we think about in terms of the key areas of focus and how that impacts where you\u2019re spending money? And then, secondly, maybe just one clarification on the EBITDA outlook for the full year. I think, there was commentary on flat margins. Is the context for that a seasonal -- or return to seasonal booking trends and ADRs normalizing, or if that\u2019s not right, if you could add some context? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thanks very much, Colin. So, why don\u2019t I take the first question and obviously, Dave, I think you could take the second question on EBITDA. So, Colin, with regards to the pace of innovation, just to kind of create a contrast, last year, we created 150 upgrades in innovation. So, it was the most innovation we\u2019ve ever delivered in any year of our history. And I think this explains why it was probably the best year in our company\u2019s history. But this year, we intend to create even bigger leads with our product. And just to give you a sense of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Going back to our priorities. We\u2019re seeing that millions of people are not tethered to have to go back to an office five days a week. And what this means is guests are spreading out to thousands of communities all over the world, and they\u2019re also staying longer. And so, we want to design for this world, both people just living on Airbnb or just traveling and having more extended vacations. We also launched I\u2019m Flexible last year, and that product has been used 800 million times. Now, this is a really key feature, because since the advent of the Internet, almost every travel website asked you two questions: Where are you going? And when are you traveling? And suddenly, I\u2019m Flexible gets us further up the funnel. This allows us to be in the inspiration business. And it\u2019s ultimately strategic for Airbnb because if you\u2019re flexible about where and when you can travel, we can point demand to where we have supply. So, we\u2019re going to continue to upgrade our product. And we\u2019re going to continue to be better host to our guests in those communities by providing even better world-class service for them each step of the way. So, what we\u2019re going to do is continue to invest in the guest experience to adapt to these new behaviors, provide world-class service for them. And then, once again, we want to unlock the next generation of hosts. So, we have a whole road map where we understand each of the obstacles for people to host, and we\u2019re going to launch products and features this year that will unlock those obstacles. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to create a huge plethora of new supply in Airbnb. Dave, do you want to get the second question on EBITDA?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. Yes. We\u2019re very proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in our margins in 2021. I mean, we increased them from minus 5% back in 2019 to 27% in 2021. And so, it\u2019s obviously a huge improvement and very proud of the work that we\u2019ve done across the board. But also remember that we\u2019re managing for profitability while investing for growth. We\u2019re still very much in the growth mode investing for the future, and that\u2019s key for us. And what we saw in 2021 was that we had a step change in our marketing expenses and achieved a new level of overall marketing investment as a percentage of revenue. And we\u2019ve already achieved that new baseline and likely not to achieve substantial improvement in the marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue this year. And we also made a step change in our fixed costs and continue to improving our variable costs. We\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019ll get more leverage on fixed and keep improving our variable costs. But last year, we also saw the tailwind of average daily rate which definitely helped our margins. And as ADRs may moderate this year and as a mix of our business changes, that will be an offset to some of the further improvements in our fixed cost leverage and variable costs. So if ADRs moderate a little bit less, there\u2019s room for some upside in EBITDA, so. But that\u2019s why we\u2019ve given the guidance we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Naved Khan from Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: Yes. Thanks a lot. Two questions. One for Brian, one for Dave. So, Brian, how are you thinking about growth in Experiences for 2022 as travel comes back and people engage in more activities and Experiences? And Dave, on the margin question, again, how should we think about the growth in other expenses outside of marketing and available costs, namely operations support and product development. Is there supposed to be a significant ramp up or is ADR the primary explanation for why margins can be flat year-on-year?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey Naved. So, I will take the first question and Dave, you can take the second question on expenses. With regards to Experiences, we are very bullish on this product. It should be noted, for example, that the percentage of people that leave 5-star reviews for Experiences is even higher as a percentage of people who leave 5-star reviews for homes. So, what guests have told us is they love Experiences, and I think hosts really depend on the economic income that it offers. Now, in 2020, before the pandemic, we thought that year was going to be a breakout year for Experiences. Instead, we had to pause the product. But now, we are going to be ramping the product back up. It\u2019s going to be a multiyear journey, but I\u2019m really excited about the potential for this product. And I think the reason is really simple. I think you can only like play so many video games and stay home and watch so many shows on Netflix before you want to get out of the house and you want to do an activity with other people, whether it\u2019s traveling or even in your own area. And so, we think this is going to be a great way to meet other people and also connect with people you care about over an activity. Dave, do you want to talk about expenses?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. So, we -- like I said just a minute ago, we achieved a new baseline in our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue. We already achieved that in 2021. So, there isn\u2019t as much opportunity for improvement in that particular line item going forward. On the operation support area, we\u2019re continuing to invest in the community and growth for the support of our guest and host community. So, underlying, we\u2019re making improvements in the underlying rate of our operational support, but we still have other investments on top of that in order to drive those underlying improvements. And so, that one will have a few -- would be relatively flat for this year. And on the product development expenses, again, we\u2019re growing our product development expenses more slowly than we\u2019re growing revenue. So, we\u2019re going to continue to get leverage and discipline on our focused kind of product development efforts. It, again, will just be a less of an improvement than what you saw in 2021. And then, ADR is a little bit of the challenge to forecast. If ADRs remain higher and stronger, that\u2019s a tailwind to EBITDA; if they -- as the business rebounds more urban, more lower ADR regions and ADRs moderate some, that will be a continued headwind for our margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. So, Brian, I think you rightly called out the longer-term stays as your fastest-growing category, and you\u2019re going to be in the roster as well. So, thinking about the other side of the equation and I guess, the supply side of the equation. So, how are your hosts responding to the rise in this type of demand? And are there any sort of supply and demand imbalance considerations we should be thinking about or worrying about? Because it seems like the pandemic has definitely taught the consumer that they can work and stay anywhere. Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Hey Stephen. This is a really, really great question. And you are correct that there -- that -- just let me preface our supply question by saying that there\u2019s this entire acceleration in this new category of travel, which is that people are less tethered to an office, so they can now live anywhere, not everyone but a lot of people. Additionally, we are really optimistic about cross-border travel rebounding and urban travel rebounding. So, all of the original Airbnb use cases from pre-pandemic are going to come back, I think, in full throttle, probably better than before because of pent-up demand. Now, because of that, we need to make sure we have enough supply. So, let\u2019s talk about how we get that. Well, the first thing I\u2019d say is that one of the great things about our business is we have a global network. And so, what that means is the number one source of host on Airbnb are prior guests. In fact, in Q4, 33% of hosts were prior guests, and that number has been going up over the last couple of years. The other really interesting phenomenon we see is the markets, the fastest supply growth are also the markets have a static demand growth. That\u2019s really interesting. And we think the reason why is most of our community are regular everyday people. They\u2019re teachers, their health care workers, they\u2019re students and really everyday people. And as they make money and they get a lot of bookings, we think what\u2019s happening is they\u2019re telling their friends in their neighborhood and community, and they are also listing, and then some other people are expanding their business. So that\u2019s the first thing is our global network. Next, we have a full funnel approach to recruiting hosts. First, Stephen, we need to make sure that more people know about hosting. We want the brand of hosting to be as mainstream as the brand of Airbnb, which is a noun, a verb used all over the world. So, we did two major host brand campaigns last year: Made Possible by Hosting and a Stranger campaign, and both campaigns have driven a lot more traffic and a lot prospective people to Airbnb. Next, we want to make sure it\u2019s easier to become a host. So, what we did last year is we reduced the number of steps down to 10 easy steps to become a host. One of the things we\u2019ve learned over the course of starting Airbnb and growing Airbnb is the number of -- the less friction, the better the conversion funnel. And so, as we make something easier, more people do it. And we also know that hosting is something that makes people ask questions about. And so, what we wanted to do is match our very best prospective host with their very best Superhost, so they can ask questions and get their questions answered. And this has led to a higher conversion rate of people becoming host. And then finally, we wanted to start addressing the obstacles that people are hosting. Now, one of the most common obstacles we heard are people were nervous about their home being damaged when they rented out to guests. And so, we launched last year with AirCover, top-to-bottom protection, free for every host only in our Airbnb, and this included $1 million damage protection and liability insurance. The last thing I\u2019d say, though, is in addition to our global network, in addition to our supply strategy, is this other real important point. This is kind of the Holy Grail, which is that because more people are flexible about where and when they\u2019re traveling, it means we\u2019re further up funnel. 800 million searches have used I\u2019m Flexible. And this means that we can start to point demand where we have supply because we are not supply constrained globally on any night of the year. The challenge is just that too many people go to too few places at the same time. But as the world gets more flexible, we can balance supply-demand in addition to our other strategies. So that\u2019s the answer, global network, a full host recruitment strategy and pointing demand to where we have supply.\nOperator: We now turn to Bernie McTernan from Needham & Company.\nBernie McTernan: Maybe just a follow-up on that with the supply and demand imbalance in the marketplace. Do you see the price appreciation as a problem for demand or an opportunity for the hosts?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take this one?\nDave Stephenson: I think, you would see a bit of both. I mean, if you go back to what we\u2019ve seen for the average daily rate throughout 2021, early in the year, it was almost exclusively driven by mix. So, it\u2019s the rebound of U.S. and European travel. It\u2019s been a rebound in non-urban whole home, larger homes. So, the ADR was almost entirely mix. In the year, especially around the peak travel season around the summer, we started seeing some price appreciation in high-demand locations, think mid-summer. And so, there was more price appreciation in those areas. And it was about equal price appreciation to mix, both in Q3 and that stabilized relatively in Q4. And so, with the amount of demand for travel, the ADRs, we\u2019ve not seen it take a significant tamper down on demand for people who travel. I think there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for people to get out of their homes to travel and live. And I think they\u2019re just constantly looking for the opportunity to kind of travel. In terms of the opportunity for host to earn more money, I mean, as there could be challenges in inflation driving up costs for individuals, they can certainly be empowered to become host as a source of earning additional income. And so, we see that Airbnb actually could be a solve for that. Airbnb have had hosts earn $150 billion as hosts on Airbnb, and I think continue to use us as a great way to earn additional income going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Two quick ones, one for Brian and one for Dave. Brian, you noted that Airbnb would want to become the ultimate host and offer a more personalized service for guests. Can you elaborate on some of those efforts? And what type of incremental opportunities do you envision kind of unlock from this in the next few years? And then, Dave, I just wanted to ask on the marketing spend. It seems like you noted that you found new baseline. But as some of these volume scales in the next few years, a lot of it is driven by kind of a macro recovery of the travel spend incrementally and then also in some of these use cases like long-term stays remaining strong. Why shouldn\u2019t we kind of expect additional leverage on marketing, or is this an effort by you to sort of step up investments so you can keep marketing spend relatively flat as a percent of revenues and bookings? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Awesome. Well, thanks, Deepak. Obviously, I\u2019ll take the first question, Dave, and then I\u2019ll let you take the second. So, Airbnb becoming the ultimate host. What I would say, let me point you to two things that we\u2019re seeing, just to give you a sense of where we\u2019re going. Let me start by saying Airbnb is really a design-driven company at the very beginning. We have a unique design driven approach, and I think that is a source of much of our innovation. And that\u2019s allowed us to create this new category of travel, and it\u2019s allowed us to make over 150 upgrades innovations in the last year. We have some really huge things that we\u2019re going to be launching in the coming months that I\u2019m really excited about. A couple of schemes that we\u2019re thinking about. Number one, as I said, more and more guests are coming to Airbnb with flexibility, right? So typically, the way it used to work is people would come to Airbnb or an OTA, and you\u2019d ask them where are you traveling and most people knew where they\u2019re traveling. You\u2019d asked them when you\u2019re travelling, they say, I know where I\u2019m traveling. So, maybe I\u2019m going to Miami this week. The more guests are flexible, the more you want to start learning more about why they\u2019re traveling and what they\u2019re interested in, so you can point demand where you have supply. So, the first thing we want to do is provide a more personalized shopping experience. I think that we can go beyond the classic e-commerce paradigm where anonymous customer comes to a website, they type something into search, they get a list of search results and then they book something. We think that we can provide an even more personalized service. And because we have a huge amount of repeat guests and we\u2019re a community and we know quite a lot about our guests, I think we can provide a deeply personal service. And that will increase conversion and really unlock a lot more opportunities for guests. That\u2019s just one example. One other example I\u2019m going to give to you is on customer service. One of the things we noticed is when we offer dedicated Superhost support for a Superhost and then AirCover, which is the industry first protection for host, it has massively increased host sentiment. And, we think this is critical. And we think we can do quite similar things for guests. We think that we can provide just the ultimate customer service to our guests and be there with them and go above and beyond each step of the way, just like a good host. And as far as does this offer an opportunity for incremental new offerings and services, the answer is absolutely yes. The more we know about our guests, the better service we provide, the more opportunities we have to promote new offerings to them as well. Dave, do you want to take marketing?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. Just to step back, remember that in 2019, kind of before the pandemic, we shifted our marketing strategy to be more brand-driven and even less dependent on search engine marketing. And so, we made that shift and it kind of was proven to be the right shift to be made not only in 2019, but obviously in 2020 and 2021. And what we\u2019re currently seeing is still 90% of our traffic remaining to be direct and unpaid. And so, we\u2019re continuing to focus more of our spend in brand marketing and less on the search engine marketing. And you are right that the brand marketing then should be more fixed, it\u2019s more of a fixed investment. But what we\u2019re seeing is great success in the brand marketing that we did last year, and we\u2019re going to be expanding it to more countries. And so, to the extent that we expand into additional countries, there will be some incremental more brand marketing spend in this year. But you\u2019re right, once we are penetrated in most of the countries around the world, we can see more leverage because it becomes more of a fixed cost. And as you grow revenue, you can kind of grow revenue out above the marketing. I just -- we don\u2019t expect to see that additional leverage in 2022, but we could see it in 2023 and beyond.\nOperator: We now turn to Mario Lu from Barclays.\nMario Lu: The first one is on one of your top priorities for \u201822 and beyond. You mentioned unlocking the next generation of hosts. So, it\u2019s been pretty clear that your hosts have been growing in regions that are seeing the largest demand. So, just curious if there\u2019s a certain demographic or host that you feel you\u2019re currently under indexing and look to unlock? And then, secondly, on service fees or take rate. I understand this is not reported, but with half of the elevated ADRS is due to pent-up demand, does that give you confidence that you could potentially increase the service fee at some point in the future? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey Mario, I can take both and then Dave, you can feel free to elaborate on anything I didn\u2019t get to. But, I\u2019ll do both of these. All right. So let\u2019s talk about unlocking the next generation of hosts. And the question is, is there any area that we\u2019re under-indexing in? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say there\u2019s an area we\u2019re under-indexing in, but I can tell you where I see the biggest opportunity. Airbnb, we started because my roommate and I were living in San Francisco, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay rent. So in other words, we weren\u2019t a small business. We weren\u2019t a vacation rental owner. We were just kind of everyday people. We weren\u2019t a property management company. And we started Airbnb, the real innovation was we created tools to allow everyday people to be able to become host for the very first time. And because of that, nearly 90% of our hosts are individuals. They\u2019re school features, healthcare workers, students. Our hosts have earned over $150 billion since we started and 55% of them are women. So, what we\u2019re going to do is continue to focus on individuals. We\u2019re going to continue to support property managers. We\u2019re continuing to invest in them. We also have hotels, but we think probably the biggest growth area is going to be individuals. And the reason why is because things like inflation are providing more pressure on families all over the world and they\u2019re going to require economic opportunity to be able to make it through this difficult time. And we saw that we started Airbnb during the 2008 recession. And many people were turning to Airbnb because the economic empowerment provided. So, I think that most people don\u2019t realize that they can make an incremental $9,000, $10,000 a year by hosting occasionally. And then there are a number of people that are incredibly successful. We see people renting unique properties that are making tens of thousands of dollars, even hundreds of thousands dollars a year. So, we think just getting the message out to everyday people, they can become a host, making it easier and addressing the obstacle systematically is the key opportunity. And this is true in geographies, all of the world, from North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa and APAC. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really seeing. And then on the service fees and take rate, let me just say this. There is no question that we have obviously the opportunity to increase take rate on the guest side and the host side. Now, we don\u2019t want to just increase the tax for the service. We want to make sure that we\u2019re going to increase our prices that -- or if we\u2019re going to increase fees, that\u2019s going to be because we\u2019re offering services that our guests or hosts want to pay for. We want to make sure that every single year, the value listing is increased. Right now, those opportunities to increase monetization efforts are not the most perishable opportunities right now. And the reason why is we think this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for this huge travel rebound. We have these new use cases. People are living anywhere all over the world. But we also have the return of cross-border travel, the return of urban travel. So, we are totally focused on responding to this travel market share as possible. Now, the bigger we get and the more scale we get, the more services we could potentially offer to guests and hosts. And what we\u2019ve seen is there\u2019s a lot of services that you can offer to host. I think Alibaba, Amazon, Etsy, Shopify and others have proven that there\u2019s a huge opportunity in this area. It\u2019s just not the most perishable opportunity right now, so we\u2019re focused on market share.\nOperator: We now turn to Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Two, if I may. You said your listings were up 20% in non-urban North America. Is that coming from primarily individuals or property managers? And then, as we think out to 2022 as more people return to urban destinations, how should we think about competition, specifically from hotels and more commoditized inventory? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Great. Thanks, Jed. Why don\u2019t Dave, you take the first question, growth of individuals versus property managers in nonurban areas?\nDave Stephenson: Yes. Broadly, what we\u2019re seeing is that our growth in new supply has been relatively consistent with the distribution of individual versus professional hosts that we\u2019ve seen typically. Like, the majority of our listings are unique to Airbnb and from our individual host community. And so, we\u2019re continuing to see the growth in our overall number of listings to be consistent with the relative distribution that we\u2019ve historically seen. We don\u2019t specifically break out the individual versus professional host by geography. I\u2019ll just tell you that broadly, we are continuing to see that we focus on the unique needs of the individual hosts, individual host community. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re continuing to see the growth. So, the mix overall has remained relatively stable between individuals and professional hosts during this most recent period.\nBrian Chesky: And then, Jed, why don\u2019t I take the question about competition, hotels and more commodity offerings. So, I think the important thing -- I mean this is just one thing to think about. The longer you\u2019re away from a home, the more I think you want to be in a home. And if you actually look at the growth of Airbnb by length of stay, every length of stay segment, except for one grew from this time in 2019, Q4 2019. For example, 1 month stays grew, 1 week stays grew, 3 nights stays, 5 nights stays grew. The only stay category that didn\u2019t grow were 1 night stays. Presumably, these are business travel stays. I don\u2019t think that business travel is going to ever come back the way it was before the pandemic. It doesn\u2019t mean business travel is not going to back. I just think it\u2019s going to be different because the way we work is different. And I think that the bar to get on an airplane to travel for a meeting will just be a little higher than before. Now, I do think that the travel market is so big that I think there\u2019s so much room for both, Airbnb and hotels. And actually, I think many hotels are going to consider it to be a very important distribution platform for them. The bigger we get, the more important we actually are to them. I also think the hotels are going to have a really great opportunity with a lot of group travel conferences, like really large like events and offsites. So, they\u2019re going to have their area where I think they\u2019re going to thrive and I think we are going to have ours as well. But I don\u2019t actually see like a massive overlap. I do think there are some very distinct use cases that are great for Airbnb and some others that are great for hotels and hotels exist on Airbnb.\nOperator: We now turn to Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two on the bookers. You guys have had incredible bookings growth the last couple of years. I\u2019d be curious to hear about what you know, what you\u2019ve learned about the demographics of your bookers and how it\u2019s changed, age, income? What does the base of your bookers look like now as opposed to pre-pandemic? How has that sort of changed your view of the world? And then secondly, about all the new bookers that came to the platform in 2020 in 2021, what can you tell us about their user behavior from a frequency or booking perspective at this point versus earlier cohorts, just so we get sort of an idea of how these users may or may not be different from what you\u2019ve added historically? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you very much, Brian. And Dave, why don\u2019t you take these. So, the first question is bookings growth, what are the demographic of bookers, especially new bookers and then new user behavior compared to earlier cohorts?\nDave Stephenson: I think broadly, the good news is that we\u2019re really not seeing a major shift in change overall. The demographics have been relatively consistent throughout this rebound and our new cohorts have -- it\u2019s early, but our new cohorts are still aging consistently with what we\u2019ve seen new booking cohorts age in the past, the repeat booking rates and things. So, I think that\u2019s a nice opportunity for us to introduce Airbnb to millions of new guests and it\u2019s great that those guests at least in the early days, are having similar rebooking rates as what we\u2019ve seen historically.\nBrian Chesky: And maybe I\u2019ll just -- maybe -- and maybe, Brian, I\u2019ll just say one other thing. I think the thing that\u2019s like really quite unique about Airbnb is we\u2019re not just a brand for young travelers or old travelers. We\u2019re not just a budget brand or a luxury brand. We are really -- we range from budget to luxury, young travelers to retirees. We\u2019re in U.S., also in Europe. We\u2019re in every continent in the world, and we\u2019re not just urban, we\u2019re urban and nonurban. And so I think the adaptability of our model and the incredible selection that we have really brings the kind of the whole world to Airbnb. And so, we\u2019re seeing -- and I think I continue to expect that really all demographics are going to continue on Airbnb. It\u2019s a pretty unique brand that can really flex in that way. And so, I think it\u2019s one of the great points of our global network.\nOperator: We now turn to Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: A couple of questions on the length of stay. As you continue to see the strong growth in longer stay. Just wondering if you could walk us through some of the take rate dynamics of that. And when you talk about addressing the key pain points of hosts, just wondering if you could share what some of the ongoing points of friction are there and preventing people from hosting on the platform?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. That\u2019s great. So Dave, why don\u2019t you take the length of stay, take rate dynamics and I can talk about the key obstacles people have for hosting.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. On the take rates, the long-term stays, they have a moderately lower take rate because the guest needs are a little bit lower. And the ADRs or the average daily rates are just staying for longer because hosts often offer a discount. But those lower take rates and ADRs are offset by the fact that they\u2019re longer than short-term stays and the costs actually support them. So lower customer support costs another -- and actually have a more nights booked. Those are benefit and become a tailwind and we generate similar contribution margins from a long-term stay booking relative to the short-term stay bookings. So, the dynamic is a little bit different on the top, but the bottom line contribution is more similar.\nBrian Chesky: And as far as addressing the obstacles, Brian, what we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019ve listened to thousands of hosts and we took a very systematic approach to the journey from people learning about Airbnb hosting to listing to going through the entire process. And the first thing we want to make sure is people know the benefits of hosting. Most people don\u2019t realize the economic opportunity the hosting provides. They don\u2019t realize that you can host in 10 easy steps. They don\u2019t realize that the vast majority of people get their first booking within three days. We want to make sure that if they have any problems they can get help they need, so we\u2019re going to continue to expand the Ask a Superhost program. We have some ideas to reduce the effort to hosting even further, and we want to continue to provide more protection like AirCover to get even more people a peace of mind. I think the thing about Airbnb hosting, that\u2019s pretty unique compared to other marketplaces is almost any type of person can be a host. Most of the people listening to this call could be a host. You could be renting your second home. We -- people rent their primary home. People can rent their homes when they\u2019re gone. And so I think there\u2019s something about hosting that can apply to people of all walks of life. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be focused on.\nOperator: We now turn to Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan.\nDoug Anmuth: I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about ADRs and just what you\u2019re seeing so far for bookings in \u201822? And just curious, just your view of the degree of decline for this year has changed at all. And then, Dave, just on capital allocation, just curious if there\u2019s any changes or anything different to call out now just given obviously, a lot more discipline in the business and a very different degree of profitability versus a couple of years ago. Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Obviously, Dave, why don\u2019t you take both of these, ADR in 2022 and capital allocation.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. Yes. Like I said earlier in the call, the average daily rate early in 2021 was almost exclusively driven by mix, country mix, urban versus nonurban and whole homes or whole home non-urban, Europe, U.S., just has a higher daily rate. And then towards the back half of the year, both in Q3 and Q4, we saw some price appreciation in high-demand markets and kind of peak periods. And so, then it was more equally weighted between the two. And so, then, what we\u2019ve seen kind of coming in and we expect that as urban comes back, and we are continuing to see urban accelerate every quarter and some of our lower ADR markets start coming back, and we have seen places like Latin America now well above 2019 rates. So, we would see some moderation in the ADRs. What we\u2019re seeing early in 2022 and included in this -- in the letter is we anticipate about a 4% increase still year-over-year, so Q1 \u201822 over Q1 \u201821 in ADR. So, we\u2019re still seeing strong ADR rates and anticipate that will be the case here early in the year. And what\u2019s tougher to forecast is the rate of return of those lower ADR segments and then how much of the price appreciation kind of steps. But we would anticipate some moderation of ADRs through the back half of the year. We just don\u2019t know exactly how much. And then, on the capital allocation, I do tell you that I sleep better at night now that we have $8 billion of cash in the bank relative to the position we were in -- prior to COVID or midst of COVID. And it enables us to have the flexibility to continue to invest in growth because that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on is to grow this business. And we can continue to use some of that cash in case we wanted to use it for any kind of acquisitions, although acquisition is not our primary kind of growth driver. And one change that we did announce here in the letter of this quarter is that we are planning to pay for our RSU tax obligations for employees with cash rather than selling to cover. So we will be net settling those shares, and that will be a use of about a little more than $1 billion of cash during the year. But, I\u2019m very proud about how -- with our investments. So, thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Lloyd Walmsley from UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. I had a couple. First, just on the host supply, it sounds like you\u2019re seeing good traffic gains in regions where you\u2019re advertising, but the aggregate listings number is only up something like 7% from the last disclosure, despite a pretty good environment. So, just wondering what gives you the confidence that you can continue to grow supply to meet demand on kind of a multiyear basis? And is there -- do you have visibility into the backlog of hosts just going through that process that gives you that confidence it can accelerate? And then a second one on kind of ADRs, the shareholder letter mentioned having over 25% more nights booked for the summer than this time in 2019. Can you talk about what that looks like kind of on a gross bookings basis? And as we think about ADRs, if you put aside the geographical format mix shift, like where do you think like-for-like pricing is moving up for this year as it seems like some folks are pushing price?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thanks very much, Lloyd. So, Dave, I think you can take both of them, and I\u2019m happy to round up the answers. The first one is obviously on host supply, how we\u2019re feeling about the environment on a multiyear basis and the backlog of hosts. And second, obviously, summer demand, what that means for GBV ADR.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. As we kind of mentioned earlier, the key is that -- on the supply side, remember that we have 4 million hosts. The vast majority of those are individual hosts, 90% of those are individual hosts. And the individual hosts hosting their own home or often the second home. And so, what we found kind of during the pandemic is people don\u2019t get rid of their own or their second home just because there\u2019s a global pandemic and they\u2019re not having hosting. When people are ready to travel, they\u2019re there and ready to travel again. So actually, we\u2019ve been quite proud of the fact we\u2019re pleased that our actual supply has remained as stable as it has throughout this pandemic. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in regions outside of where we\u2019re seeing a lot of the rebounds, U.S. and Europe, while there could be softness or not as much growth there. That growth would be there when the demand comes back. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re highlighting the growth that we saw in the high-demand areas. We did grow 20% in the U.S. non-urban because that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing a greater amount of demand. Airbnb is amazingly self-healing dynamic with the approach to how we add supply to our environment. So, I think as the market comes back, we\u2019ll continue to do it. And then go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Chesky: And again, maybe I\u2019ll just, Lloyd, round out a little bit of this answer. I just wanted to just really underline this. We designed the Airbnb in the very beginning so that guests attract hosts and hosts attract guests. And this is 14 years later, more than 1 billion guest arrivals later. It\u2019s working obviously pretty well. And again, I think one of the -- a couple of reasons. Number one, guests become hosts. And so, as we get more hosts, a percentage of them -- as we get more guests, a percentage of them become hosts. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on converting as many guests to hosts as possible. This is a really interesting flywheel. Number two, the way we grow primarily is word of mouth. So, as regular people get more bookings, they tend to tell other regular people about it. If a hotel gets a lot of bookings, they\u2019re not going to tell the next hotel who\u2019s a competitor. Most regular people don\u2019t think of themselves that way. So, word of mouth starts to spread. But the other thing, once again, I also want to underline is the Holy Grail of supply is also being able to point demand where you have supply. And we are not even close to supply constraints any night of the year, if you take a global average of every city, all 100,000 cities around the world. And so, what we want to do is as people are more flexible, and we are moving top of funnel, we want to continue to point demand where you have supply -- and all of that is in addition to our very specific efforts to continue to recruit hosts, which we\u2019re really focused on. So, I think Dave nailed it. It\u2019s all about the global network. And Dave, why don\u2019t you take the second question about summer demand?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, summer demand and ADRs. I mean, I think we\u2019re just seeing strong demand for travel. People are ready to travel this summer. We have 25% more nights booked for the summer travel season than we did in 2019. They\u2019re ready to get out and do that travel. And obviously, we are seeing that ADRs are higher. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, both in Q3 and Q4, a portion of that was mix and about an equal portion was due to price appreciation. So, that stayed relatively stable. In other words, we didn\u2019t see price appreciation go up higher as a driver in Q4. It was fairly stable. So, that\u2019s kind of what we have currently forecasted for what we\u2019ve shared in our guide here in Q1.\nOperator: We now turn to Andrew Boone from JMP Securities.\nAndrew Boone: Two please. First, can you just talk about your progress with hotels on the platform? Brian, I think you mentioned that briefly earlier. And then, secondly, going back to marketing, do we start to think about brand marketing as being more connected to the supply side of the equation, meaning that there\u2019s going to be continued pressure as you guys grow the network more broadly, but rather than focus on the demand side, focusing more on the listing side and thinking about that as it is connected to marketing?\nBrian Chesky: Thanks, Andrew. Why don\u2019t we do this? Why don\u2019t I, Dave, take marketing? I\u2019ll start there because I wanted to just recap how we\u2019re thinking about marketing over the coming years. And then you can take our progress with hotels and the platform. Let me just back up and just talk about how we\u2019re thinking about marketing, Andrew. We have a pretty different marketing approach than our competitors because we take a full funnel approach to marketing. And it combines PR with brand marketing and performance marketing, and PR is actually probably the most important channel to build the brand of Airbnb. And that is because Airbnb has got an offering that\u2019s really unique. And so, because of that, people are deeply passionate about, they tell one another and every Airbnb\u2019s become a noun and a verb used all over the world. We got more than 0.5 million articles on Airbnb just last year alone. So, it\u2019s been a very important part of our marketing strategy. And I think this explains why nearly 90% of our traffic remains direct or on pace. Now we take brand marketing, we think of as really investment in educating the world about Airbnb. So, it\u2019s not really about buying customers but educating people what makes Airbnb special. And then we think of performance marketing as really a laser, to laser in on balancing supply and demand. Now with regards to brand marketing going forward, it\u2019s a great question. I think we\u2019re going to focus on a couple of big areas. Number one, yes, we think the area that needs a little more investment is the brand of hosting. The brand of Airbnb is noun and verb used all over the world. And very few people at this point who travel regularly and book travel on Internet don\u2019t know about Airbnb. But we don\u2019t think enough people know about the incredible economic benefits to hosting and just be incredible, like what it brings to people\u2019s lives to be able to bring the world to their home. But the other thing is we have a lot of really big innovations that we\u2019re going to be launching this year. And so, we want to actually put some of our brand marketing dollars behind some of the new product innovations that I\u2019m incredibly excited to deal this year. And so, those are two of the areas that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in. Again, we think of marketing as education, education and what we have that\u2019s unique and different, and we\u2019re going to educate the world about hosting, and we\u2019re going to educate the world about our new products and innovations this year. With that, why don\u2019t I hand it over to Dave. Maybe the only other thing I\u2019d say of hotel, before we talk about how they\u2019re doing on our platform is, again, the core o our community are individual hosts. But the great thing of our platform is property managers and hotels are great ways to fill the network gap. We think most people come to Airbnb to book something unique, one-of-a-kind stay from an everyday host. But we always want to make sure we never have any network gaps. We never want somebody come to Airbnb and leave having not found a place to stay. And so, we think hotels and property managers continue to be a very important part of our strategy. And the more demand we give them, the more they will continue to come on our platform. I don\u2019t know, Dave, you want to talk a little bit about the progress of hotels on our platform.\nDave Stephenson: We notice that in 2020 and 2021 we did scale back our investment in those areas. I mean it\u2019s key to have hotels still in the network gaps. But as cities are starting to return and we\u2019re getting urban coming back, that\u2019s when the time we\u2019ll need to fill those network gaps with hotels. And so, what we\u2019ve seen in Q4 is that the nights remain depressed here over two years, and they\u2019re slightly down kind of quarter-over-quarter due to Omicron. But our revenue\u2019s a little bit stronger relative to that due to a little bit higher ADRs, which we\u2019re seeing in hotels, similar to what we\u2019re seeing in other parts of the business. So, we\u2019ll invest in hotels over the long term. It\u2019s just not our immediate focus.\nOperator: We now turn to Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. I just wanted to clarify something on marketing. It does sound like you\u2019ve run a few campaigns towards hosts and towards I think you called them shaggy strangers that you were pretty happy about. So, do you want to lean more into marketing you talked about expenses levering or not -- leveraging or not leveraging in \u201822, should we expect sales and marketing to show some deleverage as you kind of lean more into those marketing plans? And then, could you also talk a little bit more about ADRs? And I forget what the impact of the longer-term stays, what impact that\u2019s had on ADR? So, forget about the urban, forget about the pricing, just that impact itself of longer-term stays. Is that that accretive or dilutive to ADRs, what kind of impact does that have? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thanks very much, Mark, for both questions. Dave, I\u2019ll hand it over to you. Sorry.\nDave Stephenson: On the marketing campaign, as I said earlier, we anticipate our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue in 2022 to be relatively consistent with that in 2021. So I\u2019m not anticipating further deleverage and also not anticipating a lot of incremental leverage. As we\u2019re growing this year, we\u2019ll be expanding the investment to more countries. And as you noted, like our -- some of the brand marketing that we\u2019re doing in support of host. I think one of the powers to remember of our marketing is that we can speak to both sides of the marketplace. So, anytime we market Airbnb, we can actually talk to both, guests and hosts. And as Brian mentioned earlier, one of our single largest sources of new hosts are our formal guests. On the ADR, long-term stays are dilutive on the ADR as a percentage goes up. but it\u2019s kind of offset by some other -- the other factors that we talked about on the call today, both mix shift and price appreciation is what continues to buoy the ADR rates overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company.\nKevin Kopelman: I just had a follow-up on some of the recent booking trends you\u2019re seeing. So, looking at the Q1 revenue guide at the midpoint there, it would be 70% higher than in Q1 \u201819. And that\u2019s higher than any of the GBV stats you\u2019ve given out so far. So, is that revenue growth all GBV driven, or there other -- the take rate or other components in there as well? And if so, what are they? Thanks.\nDave Stephenson: Yes. The GBV is primarily driven by the -- relative to nights is driven by the increase in ADRs. So, our absolute kind of take rate on a percentage of GBV is actually remaining fairly stable, so.\nOperator: We\u2019ve come to the end of our Q&A. I will now hand back to Brian Chesky for his closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thanks for joining us today, everyone. Just to summarize what we shared today. 2021 was a record year for Airbnb. We hit new highs of gross booking value, revenue, net income and adjusted EBITDA. We made more than 150 upgrades and innovations across every aspect of our service. But we\u2019re not stopping there. In 2022 and beyond, the world will continue to change as millions of people choose to live anywhere. And Airbnb will relentlessly innovate to support this new world. We\u2019ve now been a public company for more than a year. And I want to end today by thanking our employees who worked tirelessly to make all of this innovation possible. And to our millions of guests and hosts around the world, I want to thank you for trusting us in helping build Airbnb into what it is today. Thank you all. And I\u2019m going to speak to you again soon from a number Airbnb somewhere around the world. See you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Stephenson",
            "content": "Sure. Yes. We\u2019re very proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in our margins in 2021. I mean, we increased them from minus 5% back in 2019 to 27% in 2021. And so, it\u2019s obviously a huge improvement and very proud of the work that we\u2019ve done across the board. But also remember that we\u2019re managing for profitability while investing for growth. We\u2019re still very much in the growth mode investing for the future, and that\u2019s key for us. And what we saw in 2021 was that we had a step change in our marketing expenses and achieved a new level of overall marketing investment as a percentage of revenue. And we\u2019ve already achieved that new baseline and likely not to achieve substantial improvement in the marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue this year. And we also made a step change in our fixed costs and continue to improving our variable costs. We\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019ll get more leverage on fixed and keep improving our variable costs. But last year, we also saw the tailwind of average daily rate which definitely helped our margins. And as ADRs may moderate this year and as a mix of our business changes, that will be an offset to some of the further improvements in our fixed cost leverage and variable costs. So if ADRs moderate a little bit less, there\u2019s room for some upside in EBITDA, so. But that\u2019s why we\u2019ve given the guidance we have. Sure. So, we -- like I said just a minute ago, we achieved a new baseline in our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue. We already achieved that in 2021. So, there isn\u2019t as much opportunity for improvement in that particular line item going forward. On the operation support area, we\u2019re continuing to invest in the community and growth for the support of our guest and host community. So, underlying, we\u2019re making improvements in the underlying rate of our operational support, but we still have other investments on top of that in order to drive those underlying improvements. And so, that one will have a few -- would be relatively flat for this year. And on the product development expenses, again, we\u2019re growing our product development expenses more slowly than we\u2019re growing revenue. So, we\u2019re going to continue to get leverage and discipline on our focused kind of product development efforts. It, again, will just be a less of an improvement than what you saw in 2021. And then, ADR is a little bit of the challenge to forecast. If ADRs remain higher and stronger, that\u2019s a tailwind to EBITDA; if they -- as the business rebounds more urban, more lower ADR regions and ADRs moderate some, that will be a continued headwind for our margins. I think, you would see a bit of both. I mean, if you go back to what we\u2019ve seen for the average daily rate throughout 2021, early in the year, it was almost exclusively driven by mix. So, it\u2019s the rebound of U.S. and European travel. It\u2019s been a rebound in non-urban whole home, larger homes. So, the ADR was almost entirely mix. In the year, especially around the peak travel season around the summer, we started seeing some price appreciation in high-demand locations, think mid-summer. And so, there was more price appreciation in those areas. And it was about equal price appreciation to mix, both in Q3 and that stabilized relatively in Q4. And so, with the amount of demand for travel, the ADRs, we\u2019ve not seen it take a significant tamper down on demand for people who travel. I think there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for people to get out of their homes to travel and live. And I think they\u2019re just constantly looking for the opportunity to kind of travel. In terms of the opportunity for host to earn more money, I mean, as there could be challenges in inflation driving up costs for individuals, they can certainly be empowered to become host as a source of earning additional income. And so, we see that Airbnb actually could be a solve for that. Airbnb have had hosts earn $150 billion as hosts on Airbnb, and I think continue to use us as a great way to earn additional income going forward. Sure. Just to step back, remember that in 2019, kind of before the pandemic, we shifted our marketing strategy to be more brand-driven and even less dependent on search engine marketing. And so, we made that shift and it kind of was proven to be the right shift to be made not only in 2019, but obviously in 2020 and 2021. And what we\u2019re currently seeing is still 90% of our traffic remaining to be direct and unpaid. And so, we\u2019re continuing to focus more of our spend in brand marketing and less on the search engine marketing. And you are right that the brand marketing then should be more fixed, it\u2019s more of a fixed investment. But what we\u2019re seeing is great success in the brand marketing that we did last year, and we\u2019re going to be expanding it to more countries. And so, to the extent that we expand into additional countries, there will be some incremental more brand marketing spend in this year. But you\u2019re right, once we are penetrated in most of the countries around the world, we can see more leverage because it becomes more of a fixed cost. And as you grow revenue, you can kind of grow revenue out above the marketing. I just -- we don\u2019t expect to see that additional leverage in 2022, but we could see it in 2023 and beyond. Yes. Broadly, what we\u2019re seeing is that our growth in new supply has been relatively consistent with the distribution of individual versus professional hosts that we\u2019ve seen typically. Like, the majority of our listings are unique to Airbnb and from our individual host community. And so, we\u2019re continuing to see the growth in our overall number of listings to be consistent with the relative distribution that we\u2019ve historically seen. We don\u2019t specifically break out the individual versus professional host by geography. I\u2019ll just tell you that broadly, we are continuing to see that we focus on the unique needs of the individual hosts, individual host community. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re continuing to see the growth. So, the mix overall has remained relatively stable between individuals and professional hosts during this most recent period. I think broadly, the good news is that we\u2019re really not seeing a major shift in change overall. The demographics have been relatively consistent throughout this rebound and our new cohorts have -- it\u2019s early, but our new cohorts are still aging consistently with what we\u2019ve seen new booking cohorts age in the past, the repeat booking rates and things. So, I think that\u2019s a nice opportunity for us to introduce Airbnb to millions of new guests and it\u2019s great that those guests at least in the early days, are having similar rebooking rates as what we\u2019ve seen historically. Sure. On the take rates, the long-term stays, they have a moderately lower take rate because the guest needs are a little bit lower. And the ADRs or the average daily rates are just staying for longer because hosts often offer a discount. But those lower take rates and ADRs are offset by the fact that they\u2019re longer than short-term stays and the costs actually support them. So lower customer support costs another -- and actually have a more nights booked. Those are benefit and become a tailwind and we generate similar contribution margins from a long-term stay booking relative to the short-term stay bookings. So, the dynamic is a little bit different on the top, but the bottom line contribution is more similar. Sure. Yes. Like I said earlier in the call, the average daily rate early in 2021 was almost exclusively driven by mix, country mix, urban versus nonurban and whole homes or whole home non-urban, Europe, U.S., just has a higher daily rate. And then towards the back half of the year, both in Q3 and Q4, we saw some price appreciation in high-demand markets and kind of peak periods. And so, then it was more equally weighted between the two. And so, then, what we\u2019ve seen kind of coming in and we expect that as urban comes back, and we are continuing to see urban accelerate every quarter and some of our lower ADR markets start coming back, and we have seen places like Latin America now well above 2019 rates. So, we would see some moderation in the ADRs. What we\u2019re seeing early in 2022 and included in this -- in the letter is we anticipate about a 4% increase still year-over-year, so Q1 \u201822 over Q1 \u201821 in ADR. So, we\u2019re still seeing strong ADR rates and anticipate that will be the case here early in the year. And what\u2019s tougher to forecast is the rate of return of those lower ADR segments and then how much of the price appreciation kind of steps. But we would anticipate some moderation of ADRs through the back half of the year. We just don\u2019t know exactly how much. And then, on the capital allocation, I do tell you that I sleep better at night now that we have $8 billion of cash in the bank relative to the position we were in -- prior to COVID or midst of COVID. And it enables us to have the flexibility to continue to invest in growth because that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on is to grow this business. And we can continue to use some of that cash in case we wanted to use it for any kind of acquisitions, although acquisition is not our primary kind of growth driver. And one change that we did announce here in the letter of this quarter is that we are planning to pay for our RSU tax obligations for employees with cash rather than selling to cover. So we will be net settling those shares, and that will be a use of about a little more than $1 billion of cash during the year. But, I\u2019m very proud about how -- with our investments. So, thank you. Sure. As we kind of mentioned earlier, the key is that -- on the supply side, remember that we have 4 million hosts. The vast majority of those are individual hosts, 90% of those are individual hosts. And the individual hosts hosting their own home or often the second home. And so, what we found kind of during the pandemic is people don\u2019t get rid of their own or their second home just because there\u2019s a global pandemic and they\u2019re not having hosting. When people are ready to travel, they\u2019re there and ready to travel again. So actually, we\u2019ve been quite proud of the fact we\u2019re pleased that our actual supply has remained as stable as it has throughout this pandemic. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in regions outside of where we\u2019re seeing a lot of the rebounds, U.S. and Europe, while there could be softness or not as much growth there. That growth would be there when the demand comes back. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re highlighting the growth that we saw in the high-demand areas. We did grow 20% in the U.S. non-urban because that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing a greater amount of demand. Airbnb is amazingly self-healing dynamic with the approach to how we add supply to our environment. So, I think as the market comes back, we\u2019ll continue to do it. And then go ahead, Brian. Yes, summer demand and ADRs. I mean, I think we\u2019re just seeing strong demand for travel. People are ready to travel this summer. We have 25% more nights booked for the summer travel season than we did in 2019. They\u2019re ready to get out and do that travel. And obviously, we are seeing that ADRs are higher. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, both in Q3 and Q4, a portion of that was mix and about an equal portion was due to price appreciation. So, that stayed relatively stable. In other words, we didn\u2019t see price appreciation go up higher as a driver in Q4. It was fairly stable. So, that\u2019s kind of what we have currently forecasted for what we\u2019ve shared in our guide here in Q1. We notice that in 2020 and 2021 we did scale back our investment in those areas. I mean it\u2019s key to have hotels still in the network gaps. But as cities are starting to return and we\u2019re getting urban coming back, that\u2019s when the time we\u2019ll need to fill those network gaps with hotels. And so, what we\u2019ve seen in Q4 is that the nights remain depressed here over two years, and they\u2019re slightly down kind of quarter-over-quarter due to Omicron. But our revenue\u2019s a little bit stronger relative to that due to a little bit higher ADRs, which we\u2019re seeing in hotels, similar to what we\u2019re seeing in other parts of the business. So, we\u2019ll invest in hotels over the long term. It\u2019s just not our immediate focus. On the marketing campaign, as I said earlier, we anticipate our marketing expense as a percentage of revenue in 2022 to be relatively consistent with that in 2021. So I\u2019m not anticipating further deleverage and also not anticipating a lot of incremental leverage. As we\u2019re growing this year, we\u2019ll be expanding the investment to more countries.

Yes. The GBV is primarily driven by the -- relative to nights is driven by the increase in ADRs. So, our absolute kind of take rate on a percentage of GBV is actually remaining fairly stable, so."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Thank you very much, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I\u2019m excited to share our Q4 results with you. Q4 was another record quarter, and 2021 was the best year in Airbnb\u2019s history. In Q4, revenue was $1.5 billion, our best fourth quarter ever and exceeded 2019 by 38%. Net income was $55 million, our best Q4 ever compared to a loss in 2019. And adjusted EBITDA was $333 million, also our best Q4 ever. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was a positive 22% compared to a negative 25% in Q4 of 2019, this is a huge improvement obviously. Now, in Q4, GBV was $11 billion, which surpassed 2019 levels by 32% and was driven by strong ADR. Now, even with Omicron, Q4 Nights and Experiences Booked were only down 3% compared to 2019. And when you exclude APAC, it was actually up 8%. What our [ph] results show is that we\u2019ve been able to respond to this changing world of travel. Nearly two years into the pandemic, it\u2019s clear that we are undergoing the biggest change to travel since the advent of commercial flying. Remote work has untethered many people from the need to be in an office. And as a result, people are spreading out to thousands of towns and cities, staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time. For the first time ever, millions of people can now live anywhere. And we\u2019ve been able to respond to these changes because our model is inherently adaptable. Our millions of hosts offer nearly every type of home in nearly every community around the world. But it\u2019s not just a model. It\u2019s also our culture of relentless innovation. In the last year alone, we made more than 150 upgrades and innovations across every aspect of the Airbnb service. This explains why we had our best year in our company\u2019s history, despite still being in the midst of a pandemic. Now, there are a number of business trends that have been driving the strong performance. First, guests are staying in thousands of small towns and rural communities on Airbnb. Throughout the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen growing demand for domestic and nonurban travels. In Q4, gross nights booked in non-urban markets was up nearly 45% from Q4 2019. And in the past year alone, Airbnb guests stayed in nearly 100,000 towns and cities all around the world. Second, guests are also returning to cities. Q4 nights booked at urban destinations have recovered to -- nearly recovered to Q4 2019 levels. And cross border travel also continues to recover and improved each quarter in 2021. Guests are planning to travel despite variants and surges. Despite the impact of Omicron, in December, gross nights booked were up 40% and the cancellation rate was lower than a year ago. In Q1, we\u2019re already seeing strong demand for the summer travel season compared to 2019. And finally, guests are not just traveling Airbnb, they\u2019re now living on Airbnb. Nearly half of our nights booked in Q4 were for stays of a week or longer. One in five nights were for stays of a month or longer. And in the past year alone, nearly 175,000 guests stayed for three months or longer. So, I\u2019m going to follow on the footsteps of our community. Recently, I shared that I too am going to live on Airbnb. Right now, I\u2019m doing this call from Airbnb in Miami. And I\u2019ll be staying in a different town or city every couple of weeks. I\u2019ve always wanted to do this. But before the pandemic, I had to be in office every day. Now, I have the flexibility that millions of other guests do on Airbnb. And I also think it\u2019s important that as CEO, I deeply understand the nuances and unique opportunities that this use case on Airbnb will provide. So now, I want to recap how we did on last year\u2019s priorities. As you recall, for 2021, our single priority last year was to prepare for the incoming travel rebound. And to do this, we focused on perfecting the end-to-end experience all of our core service. This meant educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success, simplifying the guest journey, and delivering world class service. So, let me just give you a really quick update on each. First, we\u2019ve been educating the world of what makes Airbnb different, and that is hosting. In 2021, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years to educate guests about the benefits of being hosted and inspire more guests to become hosts. It worked. We\u2019ve seen an increase in traffic to our platform in countries we ran the campaign, and this was significantly ahead of non-campaign countries where we didn\u2019t run the campaign. Second, we\u2019ve been recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success. Last year, we redesigned the host onboarding flow, making it easier for new hosts to get started. And we also introduced our d Ask a Superhost program, pairing potential hosts with Superhosts to answer their questions. And finally, we created AirCover top-to-bottom protection, free for every Airbnb Host and only offered on Airbnb. Third, we\u2019ve been simplifying every part of the guest experience. Last year, we introduced I\u2019m Flexible, a whole new way to search on Airbnb when guests are flexible about where and when they\u2019re traveling. And guests, since we\u2019ve launched these features, have used I\u2019m Flexible nearly 800 million times. We\u2019ve also chipped dozens of other product features to improve the guest experience. And finally, fourth, we\u2019ve been focused on delivering world class service to our guests and our hosts. Now, in addition to providing protection for our hosts through AirCover, we launched dedicated Superhost support. Now, dedicated Superhost support provides our most experienced host priority access to our most experienced support agents. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen fewer escalations and faster resolution times, increasing overall Superhost satisfaction. Now, I\u2019m incredibly proud of everything we deliver to our guests and hosts in 2021. But it\u2019s important to note we are not stopping here. Because in 2022 and beyond, what we\u2019re going to do is accelerate our pace of innovation. And we\u2019re going to focus on three key priorities: Live anywhere on Airbnb; unlock the next generation of hosts; and Airbnb becoming the ultimate host to our community. So, let me just give you a quick preview of each. First, live anywhere on Airbnb. As a result of pandemic, millions of people to now live anywhere. They\u2019re now using Airbnb to travel to thousands of towns and cities staying for weeks, months or even entire seasons at a time. Some people without families, like me, I can kind of live a bit nomadically, staying in different Airbnb\u2019s every week or every month. Now, people who have families probably can\u2019t do that. But we\u2019re seeing people who have family going to have a lot more flexibility over the summer, and I think this is why bookings in January for this summer by nights booked are up 25% from this time in 2019. Another people are just going to take some more extended weekends. The key point is that every length of stay on Airbnb is going up, whether it\u2019s two nights, three nights, a week, a month or a season, all lengths of stay except for single nights are up on Airbnb. And we want to design for this new world by making it even easier for guests to live on Airbnb. The second priority is we will unlock the next generation of hosts. With 4 million hosts on Airbnb, we believe we\u2019ve just scratched the surface in growing our host community. So, what we\u2019ve done is we listen to thousands of people who think -- who are thinking about hosting to understand what obstacles there are for them to become a host. And what we\u2019re going to do is systematically address each of these obstacles in order to attract the next generation of host on Airbnb. And finally, Airbnb will become the ultimate host. We believe that Airbnb can be much more than a marketplace that merely connects guests and hosts. Our goal is to provide the ultimate service to our guests, anticipating their needs and going above and beyond just like a good host. Now, by offering a more personalized service, we can dramatically improve the experience for millions of guests around the world. So that\u2019s it. Just to summarize. Q4 was Airbnb\u2019s best quarter ever. Revenues, adjusted EBITDA and net income were all records. We\u2019re in the midst of a revolution in travel because people have newfound flexibility in how they live and work. Our adaptable model and our relentless innovation have allowed us to respond to this moment. And in 2022, we\u2019re going to accelerate our pace of innovation and continue to support this new world of travel. So, with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions. Yes. Thanks very much, Colin. So, why don\u2019t I take the first question and obviously, Dave, I think you could take the second question on EBITDA. So, Colin, with regards to the pace of innovation, just to kind of create a contrast, last year, we created 150 upgrades in innovation. So, it was the most innovation we\u2019ve ever delivered in any year of our history. And I think this explains why it was probably the best year in our company\u2019s history. But this year, we intend to create even bigger leads with our product. And just to give you a sense of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Going back to our priorities. We\u2019re seeing that millions of people are not tethered to have to go back to an office five days a week. And what this means is guests are spreading out to thousands of communities all over the world, and they\u2019re also staying longer. And so, we want to design for this world, both people just living on Airbnb or just traveling and having more extended vacations. We also launched I\u2019m Flexible last year, and that product has been used 800 million times. Now, this is a really key feature, because since the advent of the Internet, almost every travel website asked you two questions: Where are you going? And when are you traveling? And suddenly, I\u2019m Flexible gets us further up the funnel. This allows us to be in the inspiration business. And it\u2019s ultimately strategic for Airbnb because if you\u2019re flexible about where and when you can travel, we can point demand to where we have supply. So, we\u2019re going to continue to upgrade our product. And we\u2019re going to continue to be better host to our guests in those communities by providing even better world-class service for them each step of the way. So, what we\u2019re going to do is continue to invest in the guest experience to adapt to these new behaviors, provide world-class service for them. And then, once again, we want to unlock the next generation of hosts. So, we have a whole road map where we understand each of the obstacles for people to host, and we\u2019re going to launch products and features this year that will unlock those obstacles. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to create a huge plethora of new supply in Airbnb. Dave, do you want to get the second question on EBITDA? Yes. Hey Naved. So, I will take the first question and Dave, you can take the second question on expenses. With regards to Experiences, we are very bullish on this product. It should be noted, for example, that the percentage of people that leave 5-star reviews for Experiences is even higher as a percentage of people who leave 5-star reviews for homes. So, what guests have told us is they love Experiences, and I think hosts really depend on the economic income that it offers. Now, in 2020, before the pandemic, we thought that year was going to be a breakout year for Experiences. Instead, we had to pause the product. But now, we are going to be ramping the product back up. It\u2019s going to be a multiyear journey, but I\u2019m really excited about the potential for this product. And I think the reason is really simple. I think you can only like play so many video games and stay home and watch so many shows on Netflix before you want to get out of the house and you want to do an activity with other people, whether it\u2019s traveling or even in your own area. And so, we think this is going to be a great way to meet other people and also connect with people you care about over an activity. Dave, do you want to talk about expenses? Hey Stephen. This is a really, really great question. And you are correct that there -- that -- just let me preface our supply question by saying that there\u2019s this entire acceleration in this new category of travel, which is that people are less tethered to an office, so they can now live anywhere, not everyone but a lot of people. Additionally, we are really optimistic about cross-border travel rebounding and urban travel rebounding. So, all of the original Airbnb use cases from pre-pandemic are going to come back, I think, in full throttle, probably better than before because of pent-up demand. Now, because of that, we need to make sure we have enough supply. So, let\u2019s talk about how we get that. Well, the first thing I\u2019d say is that one of the great things about our business is we have a global network. And so, what that means is the number one source of host on Airbnb are prior guests. In fact, in Q4, 33% of hosts were prior guests, and that number has been going up over the last couple of years. The other really interesting phenomenon we see is the markets, the fastest supply growth are also the markets have a static demand growth. That\u2019s really interesting. And we think the reason why is most of our community are regular everyday people. They\u2019re teachers, their health care workers, they\u2019re students and really everyday people. And as they make money and they get a lot of bookings, we think what\u2019s happening is they\u2019re telling their friends in their neighborhood and community, and they are also listing, and then some other people are expanding their business. So that\u2019s the first thing is our global network. Next, we have a full funnel approach to recruiting hosts. First, Stephen, we need to make sure that more people know about hosting. We want the brand of hosting to be as mainstream as the brand of Airbnb, which is a noun, a verb used all over the world. So, we did two major host brand campaigns last year: Made Possible by Hosting and a Stranger campaign, and both campaigns have driven a lot more traffic and a lot prospective people to Airbnb. Next, we want to make sure it\u2019s easier to become a host. So, what we did last year is we reduced the number of steps down to 10 easy steps to become a host. One of the things we\u2019ve learned over the course of starting Airbnb and growing Airbnb is the number of -- the less friction, the better the conversion funnel. And so, as we make something easier, more people do it. And we also know that hosting is something that makes people ask questions about. And so, what we wanted to do is match our very best prospective host with their very best Superhost, so they can ask questions and get their questions answered. And this has led to a higher conversion rate of people becoming host. And then finally, we wanted to start addressing the obstacles that people are hosting. Now, one of the most common obstacles we heard are people were nervous about their home being damaged when they rented out to guests. And so, we launched last year with AirCover, top-to-bottom protection, free for every host only in our Airbnb, and this included $1 million damage protection and liability insurance. The last thing I\u2019d say, though, is in addition to our global network, in addition to our supply strategy, is this other real important point. This is kind of the Holy Grail, which is that because more people are flexible about where and when they\u2019re traveling, it means we\u2019re further up funnel. 800 million searches have used I\u2019m Flexible. And this means that we can start to point demand where we have supply because we are not supply constrained globally on any night of the year. The challenge is just that too many people go to too few places at the same time. But as the world gets more flexible, we can balance supply-demand in addition to our other strategies. So that\u2019s the answer, global network, a full host recruitment strategy and pointing demand to where we have supply. Dave, do you want to take this one? All right. Awesome. Well, thanks, Deepak. Obviously, I\u2019ll take the first question, Dave, and then I\u2019ll let you take the second. So, Airbnb becoming the ultimate host. What I would say, let me point you to two things that we\u2019re seeing, just to give you a sense of where we\u2019re going. Let me start by saying Airbnb is really a design-driven company at the very beginning. We have a unique design driven approach, and I think that is a source of much of our innovation. And that\u2019s allowed us to create this new category of travel, and it\u2019s allowed us to make over 150 upgrades innovations in the last year. We have some really huge things that we\u2019re going to be launching in the coming months that I\u2019m really excited about. A couple of schemes that we\u2019re thinking about. Number one, as I said, more and more guests are coming to Airbnb with flexibility, right? So typically, the way it used to work is people would come to Airbnb or an OTA, and you\u2019d ask them where are you traveling and most people knew where they\u2019re traveling. You\u2019d asked them when you\u2019re travelling, they say, I know where I\u2019m traveling. So, maybe I\u2019m going to Miami this week. The more guests are flexible, the more you want to start learning more about why they\u2019re traveling and what they\u2019re interested in, so you can point demand where you have supply. So, the first thing we want to do is provide a more personalized shopping experience. I think that we can go beyond the classic e-commerce paradigm where anonymous customer comes to a website, they type something into search, they get a list of search results and then they book something. We think that we can provide an even more personalized service. And because we have a huge amount of repeat guests and we\u2019re a community and we know quite a lot about our guests, I think we can provide a deeply personal service. And that will increase conversion and really unlock a lot more opportunities for guests. That\u2019s just one example. One other example I\u2019m going to give to you is on customer service. One of the things we noticed is when we offer dedicated Superhost support for a Superhost and then AirCover, which is the industry first protection for host, it has massively increased host sentiment. And, we think this is critical. And we think we can do quite similar things for guests. We think that we can provide just the ultimate customer service to our guests and be there with them and go above and beyond each step of the way, just like a good host. And as far as does this offer an opportunity for incremental new offerings and services, the answer is absolutely yes. The more we know about our guests, the better service we provide, the more opportunities we have to promote new offerings to them as well. Dave, do you want to take marketing? Yes. Hey Mario, I can take both and then Dave, you can feel free to elaborate on anything I didn\u2019t get to. But, I\u2019ll do both of these. All right. So let\u2019s talk about unlocking the next generation of hosts. And the question is, is there any area that we\u2019re under-indexing in? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say there\u2019s an area we\u2019re under-indexing in, but I can tell you where I see the biggest opportunity. Airbnb, we started because my roommate and I were living in San Francisco, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay rent. So in other words, we weren\u2019t a small business. We weren\u2019t a vacation rental owner. We were just kind of everyday people. We weren\u2019t a property management company. And we started Airbnb, the real innovation was we created tools to allow everyday people to be able to become host for the very first time. And because of that, nearly 90% of our hosts are individuals. They\u2019re school features, healthcare workers, students. Our hosts have earned over $150 billion since we started and 55% of them are women. So, what we\u2019re going to do is continue to focus on individuals. We\u2019re going to continue to support property managers. We\u2019re continuing to invest in them. We also have hotels, but we think probably the biggest growth area is going to be individuals. And the reason why is because things like inflation are providing more pressure on families all over the world and they\u2019re going to require economic opportunity to be able to make it through this difficult time. And we saw that we started Airbnb during the 2008 recession. And many people were turning to Airbnb because the economic empowerment provided. So, I think that most people don\u2019t realize that they can make an incremental $9,000, $10,000 a year by hosting occasionally. And then there are a number of people that are incredibly successful. We see people renting unique properties that are making tens of thousands of dollars, even hundreds of thousands dollars a year. So, we think just getting the message out to everyday people, they can become a host, making it easier and addressing the obstacle systematically is the key opportunity. And this is true in geographies, all of the world, from North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa and APAC. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really seeing. And then on the service fees and take rate, let me just say this. There is no question that we have obviously the opportunity to increase take rate on the guest side and the host side. Now, we don\u2019t want to just increase the tax for the service. We want to make sure that we\u2019re going to increase our prices that -- or if we\u2019re going to increase fees, that\u2019s going to be because we\u2019re offering services that our guests or hosts want to pay for. We want to make sure that every single year, the value listing is increased. Right now, those opportunities to increase monetization efforts are not the most perishable opportunities right now. And the reason why is we think this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for this huge travel rebound. We have these new use cases. People are living anywhere all over the world. But we also have the return of cross-border travel, the return of urban travel. So, we are totally focused on responding to this travel market share as possible. Now, the bigger we get and the more scale we get, the more services we could potentially offer to guests and hosts. And what we\u2019ve seen is there\u2019s a lot of services that you can offer to host. I think Alibaba, Amazon, Etsy, Shopify and others have proven that there\u2019s a huge opportunity in this area. It\u2019s just not the most perishable opportunity right now, so we\u2019re focused on market share. Great. Thanks, Jed. Why don\u2019t Dave, you take the first question, growth of individuals versus property managers in nonurban areas? And then, Jed, why don\u2019t I take the question about competition, hotels and more commodity offerings. So, I think the important thing -- I mean this is just one thing to think about. The longer you\u2019re away from a home, the more I think you want to be in a home. And if you actually look at the growth of Airbnb by length of stay, every length of stay segment, except for one grew from this time in 2019, Q4 2019. For example, 1 month stays grew, 1 week stays grew, 3 nights stays, 5 nights stays grew. The only stay category that didn\u2019t grow were 1 night stays. Presumably, these are business travel stays. I don\u2019t think that business travel is going to ever come back the way it was before the pandemic. It doesn\u2019t mean business travel is not going to back. I just think it\u2019s going to be different because the way we work is different. And I think that the bar to get on an airplane to travel for a meeting will just be a little higher than before. Now, I do think that the travel market is so big that I think there\u2019s so much room for both, Airbnb and hotels. And actually, I think many hotels are going to consider it to be a very important distribution platform for them. The bigger we get, the more important we actually are to them. I also think the hotels are going to have a really great opportunity with a lot of group travel conferences, like really large like events and offsites. So, they\u2019re going to have their area where I think they\u2019re going to thrive and I think we are going to have ours as well. But I don\u2019t actually see like a massive overlap. I do think there are some very distinct use cases that are great for Airbnb and some others that are great for hotels and hotels exist on Airbnb. All right. Thank you very much, Brian. And Dave, why don\u2019t you take these. So, the first question is bookings growth, what are the demographic of bookers, especially new bookers and then new user behavior compared to earlier cohorts? And maybe I\u2019ll just -- maybe -- and maybe, Brian, I\u2019ll just say one other thing. I think the thing that\u2019s like really quite unique about Airbnb is we\u2019re not just a brand for young travelers or old travelers. We\u2019re not just a budget brand or a luxury brand. We are really -- we range from budget to luxury, young travelers to retirees. We\u2019re in U.S., also in Europe. We\u2019re in every continent in the world, and we\u2019re not just urban, we\u2019re urban and nonurban. And so I think the adaptability of our model and the incredible selection that we have really brings the kind of the whole world to Airbnb. And so, we\u2019re seeing -- and I think I continue to expect that really all demographics are going to continue on Airbnb. It\u2019s a pretty unique brand that can really flex in that way. And so, I think it\u2019s one of the great points of our global network. Yes. That\u2019s great. So Dave, why don\u2019t you take the length of stay, take rate dynamics and I can talk about the key obstacles people have for hosting. And as far as addressing the obstacles, Brian, what we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019ve listened to thousands of hosts and we took a very systematic approach to the journey from people learning about Airbnb hosting to listing to going through the entire process. And the first thing we want to make sure is people know the benefits of hosting. Most people don\u2019t realize the economic opportunity the hosting provides. They don\u2019t realize that you can host in 10 easy steps. They don\u2019t realize that the vast majority of people get their first booking within three days. We want to make sure that if they have any problems they can get help they need, so we\u2019re going to continue to expand the Ask a Superhost program. We have some ideas to reduce the effort to hosting even further, and we want to continue to provide more protection like AirCover to get even more people a peace of mind. I think the thing about Airbnb hosting, that\u2019s pretty unique compared to other marketplaces is almost any type of person can be a host. Most of the people listening to this call could be a host. You could be renting your second home. We -- people rent their primary home. People can rent their homes when they\u2019re gone. And so I think there\u2019s something about hosting that can apply to people of all walks of life. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be focused on. Yes. Obviously, Dave, why don\u2019t you take both of these, ADR in 2022 and capital allocation. Yes. Thanks very much, Lloyd. So, Dave, I think you can take both of them, and I\u2019m happy to round up the answers. The first one is obviously on host supply, how we\u2019re feeling about the environment on a multiyear basis and the backlog of hosts. And second, obviously, summer demand, what that means for GBV ADR. And again, maybe I\u2019ll just, Lloyd, round out a little bit of this answer. I just wanted to just really underline this. We designed the Airbnb in the very beginning so that guests attract hosts and hosts attract guests. And this is 14 years later, more than 1 billion guest arrivals later. It\u2019s working obviously pretty well. And again, I think one of the -- a couple of reasons. Number one, guests become hosts. And so, as we get more hosts, a percentage of them -- as we get more guests, a percentage of them become hosts. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on converting as many guests to hosts as possible. This is a really interesting flywheel. Number two, the way we grow primarily is word of mouth. So, as regular people get more bookings, they tend to tell other regular people about it. If a hotel gets a lot of bookings, they\u2019re not going to tell the next hotel who\u2019s a competitor. Most regular people don\u2019t think of themselves that way. So, word of mouth starts to spread. But the other thing, once again, I also want to underline is the Holy Grail of supply is also being able to point demand where you have supply. And we are not even close to supply constraints any night of the year, if you take a global average of every city, all 100,000 cities around the world. And so, what we want to do is as people are more flexible, and we are moving top of funnel, we want to continue to point demand where you have supply -- and all of that is in addition to our very specific efforts to continue to recruit hosts, which we\u2019re really focused on. So, I think Dave nailed it. It\u2019s all about the global network. And Dave, why don\u2019t you take the second question about summer demand? Thanks, Andrew. Why don\u2019t we do this? Why don\u2019t I, Dave, take marketing? I\u2019ll start there because I wanted to just recap how we\u2019re thinking about marketing over the coming years. And then you can take our progress with hotels and the platform. Let me just back up and just talk about how we\u2019re thinking about marketing, Andrew. We have a pretty different marketing approach than our competitors because we take a full funnel approach to marketing. And it combines PR with brand marketing and performance marketing, and PR is actually probably the most important channel to build the brand of Airbnb. And that is because Airbnb has got an offering that\u2019s really unique. And so, because of that, people are deeply passionate about, they tell one another and every Airbnb\u2019s become a noun and a verb used all over the world. We got more than 0.5 million articles on Airbnb just last year alone. So, it\u2019s been a very important part of our marketing strategy. And I think this explains why nearly 90% of our traffic remains direct or on pace. Now we take brand marketing, we think of as really investment in educating the world about Airbnb. So, it\u2019s not really about buying customers but educating people what makes Airbnb special. And then we think of performance marketing as really a laser, to laser in on balancing supply and demand. Now with regards to brand marketing going forward, it\u2019s a great question. I think we\u2019re going to focus on a couple of big areas. Number one, yes, we think the area that needs a little more investment is the brand of hosting. The brand of Airbnb is noun and verb used all over the world. And very few people at this point who travel regularly and book travel on Internet don\u2019t know about Airbnb. But we don\u2019t think enough people know about the incredible economic benefits to hosting and just be incredible, like what it brings to people\u2019s lives to be able to bring the world to their home. But the other thing is we have a lot of really big innovations that we\u2019re going to be launching this year. And so, we want to actually put some of our brand marketing dollars behind some of the new product innovations that I\u2019m incredibly excited to deal this year. And so, those are two of the areas that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in. Again, we think of marketing as education, education and what we have that\u2019s unique and different, and we\u2019re going to educate the world about hosting, and we\u2019re going to educate the world about our new products and innovations this year. With that, why don\u2019t I hand it over to Dave. Maybe the only other thing I\u2019d say of hotel, before we talk about how they\u2019re doing on our platform is, again, the core o our community are individual hosts. But the great thing of our platform is property managers and hotels are great ways to fill the network gap. We think most people come to Airbnb to book something unique, one-of-a-kind stay from an everyday host. But we always want to make sure we never have any network gaps. We never want somebody come to Airbnb and leave having not found a place to stay. And so, we think hotels and property managers continue to be a very important part of our strategy. And the more demand we give them, the more they will continue to come on our platform. I don\u2019t know, Dave, you want to talk a little bit about the progress of hotels on our platform. All right. Thanks very much, Mark, for both questions. Dave, I\u2019ll hand it over to you. Sorry. All right. Well, thanks for joining us today, everyone. Just to summarize what we shared today. 2021 was a record year for Airbnb. We hit new highs of gross booking value, revenue, net income and adjusted EBITDA. We made more than 150 upgrades and innovations across every aspect of our service. But we\u2019re not stopping there. In 2022 and beyond, the world will continue to change as millions of people choose to live anywhere. And Airbnb will relentlessly innovate to support this new world. We\u2019ve now been a public company for more than a year. And I want to end today by thanking our employees who worked tirelessly to make all of this innovation possible. And to our millions of guests and hosts around the world, I want to thank you for trusting us in helping build Airbnb into what it is today. Thank you all. And I\u2019m going to speak to you again soon from a number Airbnb somewhere around the world. See you."

I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb\u2019s Third Quarter of 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2021. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website. During the call, we\u2019ll make brief opening remarks and spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We\u2019ve provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And with that, I\u2019ll pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I\u2019m really excited to share our results with you. The travel rebound that began earlier this year accelerated in the third quarter. Q3 was Airbnb\u2019s best quarter yet. Revenue of $2.2 billion with our highest ever, surpassing 2019 by 36%. Net income of $834 million was our highest ever, nearly 4x larger than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1 billion, also our best ever. Our EBITDA margin was 49%, an increase of 30%, or 3,000 basis points compared to Q3 2019. Over the summer, we also reached a major milestone with one billion cumulative guest arrivals. This means that Airbnb has been used more than one billion times since we started. Now finally, I\u2019m delighted to report that our hosts earned a record $12.8 billion in the quarter. Our results show that the growing strength of the travel rebound is here despite the continued pandemic. We saw continued strength in North America and EMEA and an acceleration in Latin America despite sequential increase of cancellations. Now excluding APAC, our total global Nights and Experiences Booked exceeded 2019 levels. Gross booking value of $11.9 billion shot above 2019\u2019s levels by 23%, driven by the strength of ADR. But something bigger than a travel rebound that\u2019s happening. The world is undergoing a revolution in how we live and work. The pandemic has suddenly untethered tens of millions of people from the need to go into an office. Technologies like Zoom make it possible to work from home. Airbnb makes it possible to work from any home. And this new found flexibility is bringing about a revolution in how we travel, because for the first time ever, millions of people can now travel anytime, anywhere for any length and even live anywhere on Airbnb. And we believe that this trend towards more flexibility will only accelerate. In recent months, some of the world\u2019s largest companies Procter & Gamble, Amazon, Ford, PricewaterhouseCoopers have announced increased flexibility for employees to work remotely and we expect many more companies follow this. And so what we\u2019re seeing our several trends as a result of this travel revolution. First, people can travel anytime, because many people don\u2019t have to be in the office at specific times, they have more flexibility and when they can travel. So families are increasingly travelling traveling outside the traditional week, weekend trip. And in fact, Mondays and Tuesdays are currently our highest growing days of the week to travel. This is really interesting. The second trend we\u2019re seeing is that people are traveling everywhere, literally everywhere. During the pandemic, over 100,000 cities have had at least one booking on Airbnb. And that includes 6,000 towns and cities that received their first booking ever on Airbnb. The third trend we\u2019re seeing is people aren\u2019t just traveling in Airbnb, they\u2019re now living on Airbnb. Long-term stays, up 28 days or more, remained our fastest-growing category by trip length. People are traveling Airbnb for extended vacations, relocation, temporary housing, student housing and many other reasons. Now finally, more people were also interested in hosting than ever before. We ended Q3 with the most active listings ever, and there are two reasons for this. First, our demand is driving more supply. In fact, our highest supply growth is in our highest demand destinations, particularly in North America and EMEA. And second our marketing and product initiatives to attract new hosts are working. Now we\u2019re constantly improving our service to meet this new way of traveling and the wave of guests it will bring. On May 24, we introduced the Airbnb 2021 release, which included more than 100 upgrades across every aspect of Airbnb service. On November 9, which is next Tuesday we\u2019ll be announcing the Airbnb 2021 Winter Release and this release will include another 50 upgrades and innovations that make it easier to host and support the changing needs of guests, and you can watch it right at our home page next Tuesday at 8:00 AM Pacific Standard Time. So, I hope you can tune in and to see I\u2019m really excited about what we have to share. So, now let\u2019s turn to our progress on our 2021 plan. Now as a reminder, our single priority in 2021 has been to prepare for the travel rebound. To do this, we\u2019ve been perfecting the end-to-end experience of our core service. And this includes educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest experience and delivering world-class service. So, let me give you an update on each of these. First, we are educating the world about what makes Airbnb different, and that is hosting. Earlier this year, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years, made possible by hosts. We\u2019re educating guests about the benefits of being hosted, and we\u2019re also inspiring more people to become hosts, and we continue to be encouraged by the results of this campaign. Second, we\u2019re recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success. On May 24, we launched a completely redesigned host onboarding flow that makes it simpler for anyone to start hosting. Throughout the process, potential hosts can now be paired with Superhosts to answer their questions or concerns. We began Ask a Superhost in nine countries, and we\u2019ve since expanded the program to over 30 languages in 196 countries. Third, we\u2019re simplifying every part of the guest experience. Earlier this year, we introduced I\u2019m Flexible, a whole new way to search on Airbnb when guests are flexible about where or when they\u2019re traveling. Now since launch, guests have used I\u2019m Flexible more than 500 million times. Now due to the popularity of this feature, we\u2019re soon making it even more flexible by expanding the date range of this feature as well as adding more categories of unique space. We\u2019re really excited about the progress of this feature. And finally, fourth, whenever a host or guest need us, we must deliver world-class service. In September, we launched dedicated Superhost support in North America, giving our most experienced hosts priority access to our most experienced support agents. We\u2019re expanding the support to all Superhosts globally by the end of the year. So that is our plan for 2021. Now, before I go to questions, I have one update that bittersweet. Three years ago, Ann Mather became the second independent director to join our Board after Ken Chenault. Since then, our team has benefited from her guidance. Now Ann recently made the decision to reduce the number of Board she sits on, and sadly for us that means she\u2019ll be departing our Board of Directors on December 15. Now Ann has been a critical member of our team as we transition from a private to a public company, and we appreciate everything she\u2019s done. We look forward to adding another independent director as soon as possible. I know that being on the Airbnb born in the midst of a global pandemic is no easy task. And I want to once again thank you, Ann, for everything you\u2019ve done. So to recap, Q3 was Airbnb\u2019s best quarter ever. Revenue, adjusted EBITDA and net income were our highest ever. Travel is undergoing a revolution. People are now taking longer trips traveling to more locations and even living on Airbnb. As the world changes, we continue to innovate. We\u2019ve made more than 150 upgrades innovations this year alone. So with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric, please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. It\u2019s been a big year in terms of innovation and investing behind supply. Brian, would love to get a little bit more color on what you see as the key learnings from rolling some of those investments out into the marketplace. And how they can inform the way investors should be thinking about supply growth and innovation in the years ahead. Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thank you very much, Eric. So yes, this has been a really great year for supply growth. We have more active listings on Airbnb today than we ever have. And it\u2019s important to just share a few thoughts on supply. Number one, we are quite different than our competitors. Airbnb, we have four million hosts, and 90% of our hosts are individual. That means they could never have posted, if not for the tools that we provide. And the vast majority are only listed on Airbnb. And we found that if we make hosting easier and as more people know about hosting and we give host more support, more people will become hosts. And so our strategy is a full life cycle. It starts with making sure more people know about hosting. You see the Airbnb brand is very mainstream. Our brand is now \u2013 use all over the world, but hosting is not as mainstream. And so the first thing we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re raising awareness about hosting. This year, we did our first brand campaign in five years, made possible by hosts. It uses real photos from real trips to highlight what makes Airbnb different in that host. The great thing about that ad is that also is able to track more host to Airbnb as well. So once we\u2019re able to increase awareness of hosting, then the name of the game is making it easier to host. And on May 24, we showed a simple 10-step process to become a host where we\u2019ve radically reduced the number of steps and made it easier to host and conversion rate for people starting to leisure their space low is up. Third, if a host needs help we\u2019re going to give them support. So, we launched Ask a Superhost. Ask a Superhost pairs prospective host with our very best Superhost on Airbnb. And since we launched this feature in May, more than 50,000 prospective hosts have used this, and we\u2019re now expanding this to 196 countries globally. And finally, we\u2019re continually investing more tools to allow hosts to expand their business. And what all this means is that you\u2019re going to see continued innovation from us. What we\u2019ve seen is an increase in the trajectory of a number of people becoming a host. The other point, though, Eric, I just want to make is the following. On [indiscernible], we ever supply constraint globally on Airbnb, the vast majority hosts only rent occasionally. And so the holy grail of travel is pointing demand to where we have supply. Before the pandemic, most people were very fixed in their search parameters. They had a destination of mine and they had dates in mind. But now because many people don\u2019t have to go back to an office, they\u2019re more flexible. And this means that we can point them to where we have supply. And this is the power of being flexible. Over 500 million searches have used flexibility. More than 40% of our searches, guests are flexible on where or when they\u2019re traveling. So this is what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re focused on a full funnel approach to supply acquisition, and we\u2019re pointing demand to where we have supply. And I expect that we\u2019ll have plenty of supply years to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mario Lu from Barclays. Mario, please proceed.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple on the long-term stays of 28 days and more. You guys mentioned that it was roughly 20% within 3Q. But I think in the first quarter, it was around 24%. Was this mostly due to seasonality that declined slightly since then. And then at a higher level, any updated views on how large the channel these larger stays could attract over time? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Mario, why don\u2019t I give the mix shift to Dave and I spent to talk a little bit more broadly about the strategy. Dave?\nDave Stephenson: Yes. The majority of the decrease is simply the increase of short-term stays kind of coming back. It still remains to be \u2013 long-term stay has been one of the fastest-growing parts of our business, pre-COVID. That is a trend that we are seeing in the pre-COVID era it just continued to be strong during COVID, and it remains strong today. And so yes, the decrease is just the fact that short-term stays continue to come back. And in terms of the market opportunity of long-term state \u2013 market opportunity in long-term stays, we think this adds hundreds of billions of dollars to our overall long-term TAM opportunity with long-term space.\nBrian Chesky: And I\u2019ll just share a few more thoughts, Mario. We\u2019ve just seen a major paradigm shift in travel. Before the pandemic, short-term stays is really the primary business that we were in. What we actually saw was that long-term stays was our fastest-growing segment of business even before the pandemic. So, I think what the pandemic did is an accelerated inevitable trend. There was already this emerging category between classic traveling and really kind of permanent housing which was people seeking stays of weeks at a time or even months at a time. And I think what the pandemic has done has just accelerated this. We\u2019re going to see a lot more people going away as they have newfound flexibility. Even people with families who can\u2019t go away during the year, they may be able to travel a little bit longer during summer as well. So this is really exciting. And the only other thing I\u2019d just add is nearly half of our business is for more than a week as well. So these are really exciting categories. I think there\u2019s a huge amount of growth going forward for these different segments.\nMario Lu: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jen Shi from Bank of America. Jen, please go ahead.\nJen Shi: Thanks for taking the question. This is Jen on for Justin. Just wondering, so you guys mentioned that with the host initiatives, you\u2019re gaining supply in very popular areas like North America and Europe. Just wondering, are you seeing supply opening up in urban areas? And as the mix shift kind of comes back to urban and cross-border travel, how should we think about the impact on ADRs, take rate and maybe margins in future years? And then just one follow-up on marketing spend. Looking at marketing spend trends, obviously, this year has been super positive compared to pre-pandemic spending, you have a lot of leverage there. Just wondering, do you see a scenario where maybe you would have to be more aggressive on marketing if hotel travel was coming back? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. So thank you, Jen. I heard three questions. One is about supply growth in urban. The next is mix shift, it\u2019s impacting at ADR and then marketing spend. Dave, do you want to take these? I think these would be great for you to take.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. In terms \u2013 again, one of the things to remember is \u2013 and the reason why we kind of highlighted on the call that the growth in our supply in the nonurban areas of on North America and Europe is that we get the supply when we have the demand, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s gone up 15% since the beginning of the year because that\u2019s also where there\u2019s biggest demand. Now, we\u2019re obviously seeing greater demand pickup in our more urban areas. So the percentage of nights in the urban area has started to increase or now made 46% of our nights. We\u2019re still down to maybe 60% of our nights kind of pre-COVID. And so we\u2019ll continue to see listings growth in those more urban areas as the demand kind of keeps coming back. So until I think we\u2019re back to full demand, we actually don\u2019t need incremental growth because we\u2019re still below our nights that we had back in 2019. But again, the important part is that we get the supply when we need it because the supply will follow that demand and we\u2019ll continue to make it easier for new supply to come on board. In terms of forward-looking ADRs, the high average daily rate we\u2019ve seen throughout this last year has been primarily driven by the mix of types of space and the location. So it\u2019s a mix of Europe and North America have higher average daily rates. Non-urban whole home, larger homes, all those reasons have been driving up the rates overall. And the other thing we start seeing a little bit more in Q3 with some price appreciation in high demand areas. And so it was a combination in Q3 of both the mix of types of stays and some of the price appreciation. And what we do anticipate is as urban comes back, and more markets like Asia and Latin America, which have lower average daily rates. We anticipate the overall ADR to moderate some, but we also believe that some of the higher ADR will sustain for the future. So in terms of \u2013 and then what we did say also in our shareholder letter is that we anticipate that the ADRs in Q4 should be relatively consistent with the ADRs we had here in Q3. In terms of marketing, we\u2019re really happy with the adjusted marketing approach that we\u2019ve taken. Now again, this was a pre-COVID change that we made, where we were \u2013 began to invest in our strength. And our strength is the brand of Airbnb. And we modified that marketing approach pre-COVID. We reduced our reliance on search-engine marketing. And then in COVID, we have shifted even just more significantly more quickly, and we\u2019re really pleased with those results. As Brian mentioned, this broader brand campaign, talking about made possible by hosts, it gets to talk to both sides of our marketplace. It both recruits new host to Airbnb, and talks to guests about why you\u2019d want to stand Airbnb, and we\u2019re really happy with those results and plan to continue the strength of that. We\u2019ve increased our relative marketing rate this year, just given the fact that our \u2013 the business has been going quite well. And so \u2013 but on a relative basis, our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue are down from levels we had in 2019. And we should anticipate that this \u2013 it will be in this kind of range for the foreseeable future.\nBrian Chesky: And I can just share just to really recap briefly our marketing strategy. We take a really different approach than our competitors at the full funnel integrated marketing strategy. And it really starts with PR and word of mouth. And really word of mouth and PR\u2019s how we build the brand for the vast majority of the years before you even have enough money to have a marketing budget. And because of that, Airbnb is a really well-known brand that\u2019s a noun and a verb used all over the world. And because of this, more than 90% of our traffic was free or unpaid in Q3. And so we think of marketing is really education. Brand marketing is really about educating people that are highly differentiated product. And then performance marketing for us isn\u2019t really a way to buy customers. It\u2019s the way the laser in on balancing supply and demand. So we think this is a really unique approach. And I think that it\u2019s just really all about continually investing in our brand. And over time, we think the amount of the loyalty to the brand will only increase.\nJen Shi: Great. Super helpful. Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Canaccord. Kevin, your line is now open.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks a lot. It\u2019s Kevin from Cowen. Can you give us a sense of the booking trends in the fourth quarter, quarter-to-date. You mentioned acceleration in the shareholder letter, are you seeing that back to Q2 levels yet in terms of growth as compared to the same quarter in 2019, just given kind of the Delta slowdown, that would be helpful.\nBrian Chesky: Hey, Kevin, thanks for the question. Dave, do you want to take this?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. what we\u2019re seeing is continued strength in growing strength in the business as borders are starting to open up, people are more vaccinate more willing to kind of travel. We\u2019re continuing to see bookings strength, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be seeing gross booking rate of gross booking value growth increasing from Q3 to Q4. I don\u2019t have a specific percentage that we\u2019re sharing on the call today. There can be some variability on the overall growth, but it is accelerating. And that\u2019s what\u2019s included in our guidance estimate that we\u2019ve shared.\nKevin Kopelman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen, your line is now open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Brian, I don\u2019t know if you have data \u2013 this data, but I\u2019ll go ahead and ask anyway. But are you able to say perhaps what percentage of your registered users perhaps have younger children who until now were not able to get vaccinated. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how much incremental pent-up demand you may have waiting for U.S. parents start to feel better about traveling more with the younger kids? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Thanks for the question, Stephen. I don\u2019t think we have that data specifically, but I can just share a couple of high-level thoughts with you. I think that we\u2019re going to be entering a new golden age of travel. I tend to think that the last 18 months have been \u2013 the world has been turned on its head. And I think that many people yearned for what was taken away from them. Now not everything that was taken away from us. Do I think we all want that. But I think one of the things that\u2019s taken away from a lot of people, they want back is the ability to travel and the ability to travel freely and the ability to travel freely or cross borders. And just to give you one anecdote or one data point on October 15, I believe it was that date that President Biden announced the reopening of the borders for international travelers come to the United States. Within one week of that announcement, we saw a 44% spike in nights booked for stays, crossing borders coming into United States on Airbnb for stays November 9 and later, which is when the borders would open. So, what we are seeing kind of across the board is evidence of pent-up demand. I think all the new emerging use cases that exist in Airbnb are here to stay, because I think flexibility is here to stay. So, I think a lot of the nearby destinations of people getting cars here to stay, I think the longer stays, people living in Airbnb Tuesday. But I think what I\u2019m really excited about is the emergence of cross-border travel. Cross-border travel is now 80% of what it was at its peak in Airbnb. It used to be half of our business. It went down quite a bit. Now it\u2019s about one-third of our business and growing again. So yes, we are seeing a lot of pent-up demand. And Dave, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to this.\nDave Stephenson: No, I think that\u2019s the key. Our cross-border travel, it\u2019s 33% here in Q3, but we\u2019re continuing to see strengthening here in October. More continued countries are reducing their travel restrictions and the travel trends continue to improve.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Just on the cross-border, and when you think of Europe and what you\u2019re seeing there, can you drill in and give us a sense of what\u2019s starting to happen inside the country there.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take that?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. We\u2019re continuing to see sequential improvement in the net nights booked in October relative to September. So travel restrictions as they come off. We\u2019re continuing to see that sequential increase \u2013 We have more global net nights booked in October 21 that we did in 2019. So, I think that\u2019s a really positive sign for Europe. And there are some week-to-week variations, but the trends continue to be up and to the right.\nBrent Thill: And as just a follow on, has there been anything surprising to you due to this recovery in Europe that just anything that you\u2019ve seen in underlying trends? Or is it just continued strengthening as you\u2019ve been mentioning?\nDave Stephenson: Well, the reality it tends to vary by country, right? Different countries will have different levels of restrictions in opening. There\u2019s obviously a lot of pent-up demand for kind of peak kind of travel. We saw that in Q3 is a big part of the strength of our results in Q3 or Europeans wanting to get into their traditional kind of summer holidays in Spain and Italy and other places. And so there can be some variation by country throughout, but the strengthening of the business in Europe just kind of continues. We\u2019re seeing a nice uptick in bookings, especially even leading into 2022. So some of the bookings growth that we\u2019re seeing now is going to obviously be for travel in early next year and throughout in 2022.\nBrent Thill: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We now have a question from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Doug, your line is now open.\nDae Lee: This is Dae Lee on for Doug. Thanks for taking the question. The first one, so based on your conversation with your host, what do you think is the biggest friction point that prevented them from becoming a host for the first time? And along that line, among the initiatives that you\u2019ve rollout for them this year was resonated in those? And as a follow-up, how are these newer host cohorts performing versus your historical cohorts but didn\u2019t have the upgrade that now hosts have today.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you for the question, Dave \u2013 Doug. Why don\u2019t I take the first part of the question about what the biggest friction points for hosts are and then Dave can have the follow-on. Now a really, really great question. there\u2019s really three parts of the funnel. Number one, do people know about hosting. Number two, is it easy? And number three, can they get help. To me, those are the three parts of the funnel. So number one, do people even know about hosting Well, Airbnb\u2019s brand is very much mainstream. So we\u2019ve seen a huge opportunity in people being able to host. I don\u2019t think most people realize that the average host can make $9,600, which is more than the stimulus check they\u2019ve been getting the United States and the amount of effort is surprisingly easy. And so the first thing we have to do is continue to tell story of hosting, and we\u2019ve been doing that, and that is working. The next thing we have to do is make it easier to host. The easier we make something, the more people do it. Airbnb really innovated and built a lot of custom tools to make it easier to host than ever before. This was really the core innovation we have. We built a system of trust where we\u2019re continually making it easier to host. We obviously simplified the number of steps to become a host to 10 really simple basic steps. You can do it now quite quickly from your phone or a desktop device. And we have more innovations that are going to make it even easier that we\u2019re showing next Tuesday, November 9. So that\u2019s the second part, making it easier as we do that conversion rate goes up. And then finally, sometimes people like say, this is \u2013 some people want to talk to other hosts. They want to know what it\u2019s like, what\u2019s it like to let a stranger in your home. How much should I change? What are the local rules and regulations. And so having another host to talk to is really important. Now this is the power the Airbnb model. One of the things that makes me so special is we\u2019re a community. And we\u2019re a community where host tell other hosts about Airbnb and they bring them on to the platform. And so what I\u2019m really excited about is the Ask a Superhost program. We\u2019ve had more than 50,000 prospective host sign up to use that. And we\u2019re going to continue to scale that, and we\u2019re announcing on November 9 that we\u2019re going to be scaling the Ask a Superhost program. So these are three parts of the journey. We continue to focus on these. We\u2019re going to get a lot more host. Dave, you want to take the next part on the host retention.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. What we\u2019re seeing \u2013 I can step back some of the new host acquisition that it makes it a little too early to tell exactly how the retention and things are going to work for all the new hosts. But let me step back and broadly share that overall, we\u2019re seeing churn rate of our hosts or has improved. It\u2019s lower than it had been historically that the actual success rate of new hosts is increasing. Like 50% of new listings receiving a booking in three days. 75% of new listings are receiving a booking within eight days. So they\u2019re actually more successful, more quickly. We\u2019re seeing of the new hosts that are coming on, that they are \u2013 the traditional host that have been successful in Airbnb, individual host that are largely \u2013 have exclusive to Airbnb that may only have a property or two, it\u2019s that core individual host. That\u2019s still the majority of the host that we\u2019re kind of bringing on. And the cross listing of our host is actually down from where it was in kind of pre-COVID times. So I think the overall health of our hosting community is quite strong, and the growth that we\u2019re seeing in new host is very consistent with the historic types of host we\u2019ve had in the past.\nDae Lee: Got it. Thank you.\nDave Stephenson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Justin, please go ahead.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you. Brian, you\u2019ve clearly had a lot of success with flexible stays. What have your learnings been around that, the marketing of that feature to consumers? And what do you think the next steps are to make this a broader consumer behavior? Is that more brand marketing? Or is that something within the app? That\u2019s question one. And then for Dave\u2019s question, two, how should I think about the pace of the urban recovery going forward? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Yes. Thank you very much for the question, Justin. I\u2019m really excited with I\u2019m Flexible. So just to recap what this feature is \u2013 On May 24, we announced I\u2019m Flexible, a new search tool that allows people to search on Airbnb, if they\u2019re flexible about where or when they\u2019re traveling. And so to go to Airbnb\u2019s home page right now, actually, if you do it, you\u2019ll see a really big button, it says I\u2019m Flexible. If you click on that button, it now takes you to a whole new view of Airbnb, where you can completely browse. Now this is a really special new product we built. We actually went through millions of listings, and we had to do this really extensive process of organizing our structured data, essentially getting an organized catalog of all of our inventory. If something says it\u2019s a tree house, is it a tree house? We made sure every photo is the properly labeled. And this feature has been really, really successful. We also have flexible dates allows people, if they\u2019re flexible when they\u2019re traveling to say, I\u2019m looking for a place for a weekend for a week or a month any time over the next six months. Well, that \u2013 those features have been used more than 0.5 billion times. So what are our lessons? Well, the first lesson, if conversion rates up, the more people use I\u2019m Flexible, the more likely they\u2019re going to book on Airbnb because they\u2019re more likely to find a property. Number two, what it\u2019s showing is we\u2019re able to point demand to where we have supply. There\u2019s a lot of really unique listings that are in locations that people wouldn\u2019t have thought to type in, right? It might be in a small town you never heard of. With I\u2019m Flexible, it really levels the playing field and allows many more properties to be discovered. Maybe another way of thinking about it is on flexible turns the home into the destination, so you don\u2019t have to type in the destination. And I\u2019m really excited about this. So this tells us that we\u2019re on to something. It also tells us that there\u2019s a new paradigm in travel. And so I think that this flexibility is here to stay. I think one of the holy grails in travel is to answer a question for a guest of where should I go and when should I go. And by having this new flexible features, we\u2019re able to really be able to do that. So what\u2019s next for us is that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in this feature. On November 9, we\u2019re announcing four new categories of I\u2019m Flexible. There\u2019s going to be some really cool features that we can show. So I hope you tune in. We\u2019re also expanding the flexible date feature from six months to 12 months. So now you can see when these really incredible properties available anytime in the next 12 months. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in this feature. And I think down the road, this will be a major way that people are searching on Airbnb, and it\u2019s so important because, again, it allows us to balance supply and demand. Dave, do you want to take the second question?\nDave Stephenson: Yes. I think one thing to kind of step back and remember is that Airbnb strength has traditionally been cross-border and more urban. I mean, that\u2019s traditionally where our business strength has been, right? Cross-border has been 50% of our business. The urban has been about 60% and yet our really strong Q3 results happened while even those two parts of the business are not yet returned to kind of pre-pandemic levels, right? Cross-border still at 33%, the urban \u2013 high-density urbans at 46%. So it\u2019s not quite back, but it\u2019s growing nicely. So I think what you say about the pace of urban recovery is that, that will continue to be additive to our business and the strength that we\u2019re seeing overall. I think what\u2019s also interesting about the pace of the urban recovery is that the nature of it is even a little bit different. Historically, our top 10 cities in the world contributed approximately 11% of revenue and now the top 10 cities are comprising about 6%. So it\u2019s just getting more diverse, more spread in terms of where our distribution of travel is. So as urban comes back, I think it\u2019s still going to be even a more broad spread version of the revenue across the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Jed, please go ahead.\nJed Kelly: Great. Thanks for taking my question. We\u2019ve seen a couple of larger call them, property managers and urban accommodation providers start to scale up inventory that will probably use your platform for bookings. So Brian, can you just provide us an update on how you\u2019re working with some of the larger property managers. And then in your opening remarks, you did call out some major companies on the work from anywhere trends. Is there any way for you to work closer to them and provide benefits to the workers?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thank you for the question, Jed. Yes, let me take both of these large property managers and work from anywhere trends and how opportunities to work with companies. So on the first one, though our platform is 90% of individuals, the 10% of our hosts or professionals are very important to Airbnb, and we continue to build new tools for them. And so this just past year alone, we\u2019ve had 150 upgrades and innovations and around half of those happened for a host. And many of the upgrades we have also applied to the more professional host as well. And so we\u2019re going to be showing off a number of features on November 9, and many of these are going to be innovations for professional hosts in addition to individual hosts. So we\u2019re still very focused in this area, and I continue to believe that we\u2019re going to be growing really quickly. And just to give you an example, as Dave said, we\u2019ve seen our fastest-growing areas of inventory in North America and Europe in nonurban areas. And certainly, professional hosts are a part of this. And I think they really love the amount of demand that we provide for them. Now as far as the work from anywhere approach. Yes, I think this is a really exciting area. I mean, as we said, Amazon, Ford, PwC, Procter & Gamble are just the beginning of the number of companies that have offered a more remote policy. I think it\u2019s safe to say that very few companies that have office workers are going to be asking those workers to come back to an office five days a week. And all you have to believe as that people don\u2019t come back five days a week, maybe they come back four days a week, maybe they come back three days a week, maybe they had even more flexible policies. And all we have to do is believe that, to believe that Zoom is here to stay, to believe that work from anywhere is here to stay. And so we\u2019re starting to see a lot of companies certainly reach out to us. We don\u2019t have anything to announce right now, but we are going to continually make it easier for people to be able to live anywhere and work anywhere on Airbnb and integrating with companies if that\u2019s what it takes of course, would be something that we continue to do more of.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin, your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Reese on for Colin. I was just wondering if you could talk about kind of the trends you\u2019re seeing between the growth in nights booked versus adoption of experiences? And is there any difference in the trajectory of recovery there? And then maybe just how your relationships with communities are doing? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I can take these. So obviously, the growth of our core business of homes has been very, very strong. With experiences, I really expected last year to be a breakout year for Airbnb experiences. And of course, the opposite happened. The pandemic put that product on pause. That being said, it\u2019s now been more than 1.5 years, and I feel like people can only stay home so many nights watching Netflix. And eventually, they want to get out of house. And I do think people want alternative things like restaurants, especially when they\u2019re traveling. And Airbnb experiences are very popular amongst our guests. They actually love even more than homes statistically from a five star standpoint. In other words, more guests leave a five star review for experiences in the homes after they stay. So I\u2019m very bullish on this product. It\u2019s been gradually ramping back up and reopening. We\u2019ve seen strong growth over the last couple of quarters, and I\u2019m expecting this to be a big area of growth over the coming five years or so. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with experiences. Now with regards to our relationship with communities, let me just start by saying this. Even before the pandemic, we worked with thousands of cities all over the world. You see we created this new category of travel, and we had to work with cities to educate them and work collaboratively with them to be able to really make sure everybody works best for these communities. To give you a stat, we have today, collected $4 billion in hotel occupancy tax or transient occupancy tax. You can\u2019t collect hotel tax without working with those cities and jurisdictions. So we\u2019ve had really close relationships with them. And what I\u2019ve seen in the last year is that the pandemic has actually been a bit of a reset for our relationship with cities. And reset probably in a good way because what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of cities that we\u2019re concerned with tourism in their markets are in a different concern now. Now over tourism the number of cities have to under tourism. The reduction of business travel, fewer international travelers crossing borders going into big cities means that many of these cities and destinations have revenue shortfalls and just general travel shortfalls. And so what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve had a lot of cities reaching out to us to collaborate. And in fact, we\u2019ve done 100 partnerships with destination marketing organizations, around the world. And I think our new and flexible features where we can point demand to where we have supply also means we can point demand to cities that want it. And so I think this is a really exciting period for us to, really renew a great relationship with cities all over the world.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Brian, please go ahead.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys. On the cross-border travel, I open up, we\u2019re just wondering if you could comment on lengths of stay trends there. Our intuition is that people are going to get on a plane in the current environment, they probably want to amortize that across a longer stay. But just wondering what you\u2019re seeing there. And then second thing on about the length of stay more generally. You spoke to 28-days plus, and just wondering if you could talk to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of maybe a seven day stay becoming a 14-day and any trends there? And any thoughts on how the competitiveness of Airbnb increases versus hotels as one week stays, become two week stays.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Why don\u2019t I start with that very last question, Brian. And then, Dave, I can hand over to you. You can talk a little bit more about cross-border, its impact on length of stay and just the growth of maybe weekly stays is what I think Brian\u2019s asking. But let me start with this question of the competitiveness of long-term stays. It\u2019s really quite interesting to think about how we started Airbnb. I started the company when I was 26 years old with two of my friends, and the category we entered was hotels. That was the incumbent industry. An industry that most people liked, and travelers have a lot of other options. If you were to try to stay somewhere for two weeks, three weeks a month or multiple months, and let\u2019s say you\u2019re staying somewhere other than the city you live, what are your current options? There\u2019s not a lot of players doing this. There\u2019s a lot of friction. So we think essentially, the longer the length of stay, the more compelling it is to stay in a home. It gets very expensive to stay in a hotel for weeks at a time. And the longer you\u2019re away from home, the more I think you want to be in a home. You want a kitchen, you might want a backyard, you want to be able to cook. You just want to feel like your home and you\u2019re not like an outsider. And so I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity for us. And this is partly why I\u2019m really excited about long-term stays or even stays that are for a week or longer. Dave, do you want to talk about some of the stats we\u2019re seeing?\nDave Stephenson: Yes. We highlighted on the shareholder letter that 45% of our nights were from stays at least seven nights. And this is the trend that we\u2019re seeing is that the length of stay continues to increase. The number of use cases that people find working with Airbnb in the same way that Brian just mentioned, it\u2019s just a better way to travel for longer. You\u2019re not going to want to stay in a hotel room for 28 nights, but those trends are continuing. And I don\u2019t have anything specific to say about cross-border and the length of stay directly related to that. But just more broadly that the length of stay continues to increase. And to the extent that it does, it accretes to Airbnb.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Great. Appreciated guys.\nDave Stephenson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nNaved Khan: Great. Thank you. Two questions. Did you see any impact on the Apple iOS changes on your social ad campaigns? And then the second question I had is just around some news articles we saw that showed that you continue to work on technology to basically help onboard hotels. Maybe just talk about where it sits in your list of priorities.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I can take both of those, Naved. Number one, just in Apple, their iOS changes. No, we\u2019ve not seen any impact on Airbnb, and that\u2019s not really the business we\u2019re in. With regards to our efforts to invest in technology to onboard hotels. Let\u2019s just talk a little bit about our strategy with hotels. Last year, we had to make some difficult decisions to put a number of initiatives on pause, like transportation and scale back some others. And one of the initiatives that we had to scale back a bit was our investment in hotels. That being said, hotels are still a very important part of Airbnb\u2019s strategy. We believe that people come to Airbnb because we have something unique. We have unique host to offer something you can\u2019t get anywhere else. And so we think that the majority of people come to Airbnb direct to book individual host. That being said, we want to make sure that people come to Airbnb, they always find a place to stay. And sometimes we have network gaps. And we think that hotels are really great ways to fill a network gap. So when somebody comes to Airbnb, they can always find a place to stay. HotelTonight has been growing really steadily in the last couple of years. I\u2019m very excited about the progress, and we\u2019re continually investing in this area. Now it\u2019s not as big a priority as our core business of supporting individual hosts, but we\u2019re continually supporting them. We\u2019re continually investing in this area.\nNaved Khan: Maybe just to follow up on that, Brian, would we be seeing hotels on the core Airbnb time in the future or anytime soon?\nBrian Chesky: Will we be seeing what?\nNaved Khan: Would we see hotels on core Airbnb at all?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I mean, yes. And we have tens of thousands of other terms now on Airbnb, and I expect you to see more in the future for sure. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s really just a matter of prioritization. Right now, we are focused on the most perishable opportunities the most perishable opportunities right now are scaling as quickly as possible to get as many hosts ready to host as many guests as possible. And so our big priorities are recruiting hosts, simplifying the guest experience, educating the world that would make certain be different, that\u2019s hosting, and getting world-class service to getting our service to be at a world-class level. Those are our major priorities, but we are continually investing in hotels.\nNaved Khan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak, please go ahead.\nZach Morrissey: Thanks. This is Zach on from Deepak. Just first on ADRs, I know you kind of called out that the primary driver so far has been this kind of mix shift. But you also noted that you\u2019re starting to see some price appreciation in certain high-demand areas. Just curious if you can kind of parse this out a little further. And is that trend kind of concerning to you in the context of Airbnb\u2019s long-term growth? And then second, just related to COVID, I know it\u2019s very dynamic and hard to predict. But the restrictions seem to be generally easing, but we are seeing pockets of rising cases and some kind of impediments to travel demand. Do you see any kind of differences in the restrictions today and the impediment to demand behavior today versus six or 12 months ago? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take these?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. Let me start with the ADR. The trend that we saw in ADR late last year, the increase in ADR was almost exclusively driven by mix. And so that was the regional mix urban, nonurban mix, size of home. And then what we saw earlier in the year is some price appreciation as a larger portion of the ADR increase. And that increased a little bit further here in Q3, kind of the peak kind of summer travel season. And then what we\u2019re seeing, as I said in Q4, is our ADRs are relatively stable with what they were in Q3. Even with these elevated ADRs, again, the majority of the increase has been just on a relative basis due to mix. So there\u2019s really no change in the price where there is some price appreciation. I think we still have a great value. We\u2019re still able to give people, homes and stays that they find very valuable in terms of all the amenities they get. Maybe a larger place, more amenities, kitchen, more bedrooms, there\u2019s more space to be. And so we think we continue to give a great value. And so we\u2019ll continue to monitor it and be mindful of it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an existential threat to us. And then the second question is just rising cases, any differences versus the pandemic. I guess I think what we\u2019ve seen is just a bit more resilience in guests being willing to travel around the world, right? There\u2019s a little bit of \u2013 there could be pockets of variation depending on what governments frankly do in terms of opening up borders. And \u2013 but the general trend has continued to be more positive, more up into the right and more consistent. And I think people, even in the face of various strains of COVID continue to be wanting to travel, and they find that doing that on Airbnb is the best way to do it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for the color.\nBrian Chesky: I\u2019ll just add one last comment. We\u2019re living in a really fast-changing world. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of big existential changes in the world. And if you can\u2019t predict the future, the best thing to do is adapt to it. And I think our business model is incredibly adaptable to whatever changes are to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks a lot. This is Ben on for Mark. So in the last 18 months, COVID has allowed Airbnb to really pivot their product priorities to refocus on the core business. As you look to next year, do you anticipate your investment priorities to change somewhat? Are you going to start focusing on stuff a little bit outside of your core business? And then the second question, if I could. Just in the letter you talked about in relation to APAC, just the short-term rental restrictions as being somewhat of a drag on the recovery in that region. Are those new restrictions versus 2019? And how significant are they? Do you expect them to be a permanent drag? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Thanks for the question. Dave, do you want to take APAC and start with that and then I can be to talk about new investments.\nDave Stephenson: Yes. On APAC, we\u2019re not anticipating that any short-term rental regulation changes as being a major negative drag on our business over time. We\u2019re just mindful that there can be some variation in what governments are wanting to do, especially during this kind of COVID crisis time, and it varies by area. And we saw a little more restrictions in APAC than we did elsewhere.\nBrian Chesky: And then on your question of new investments. Here\u2019s what I would say. I mean, we learned some very valuable lessons last year about focus. I remember once I was in college and my teachers told me, Brian, you can do everything you want in your life just not all at the same time. Yes, we certainly learned that less than last year. We had to scale back initiatives. But one of the benefits of all that, we took our very best people and we focused them only on a few problems, including recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest journey, improving a world-class service and educating the world about Airbnb. And as we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ve not only reduced costs in the business, but we\u2019ve actually been growing even faster. And so this year has been a year of a relentless innovation to perfect our core service nearly one innovation every 48 hours on our core service. That being said, we are going to do new things Airbnb. We created this category of travel. And I think there\u2019s a lot more categories that we can create in Airbnb. And so we\u2019ve done two releases this year. We did one in May and one in November, and we\u2019re going to do a couple more again next year. And so November will not be the last time you hear from us. You\u2019ll hear from us again in the spring, where we\u2019ll introduce a summer release for the summer, and we\u2019re going to have some really big new offerings as well. And again, the really big areas I\u2019m excited about that we\u2019re currently doing, short-term stays. I think we\u2019re realizing that we are just scratching the surface of this incredibly huge opportunity as home sharing continues to grow. Long-term stays is an entirely new category for Airbnb. And I think now that people are getting comfortable crossing borders, can get outside and getting gathering with other people, experience will be a big opportunity. But this is just the beginning. We have many more innovations in front of us, and we will continue to use our creativity to design new possibilities for people.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: We currently have no further questions. So I will now hand back over to Brian Chesky for any closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky : All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. Just to recap everything 2021 for Airbnb has been a year of relentless innovation. We launched more than 100 upgrades already this year. And next week, we\u2019re going to announce 50 more. That\u2019s 150 upgrade innovations this year. Our design-driven approach means that we\u2019re constantly improving our service to adapt to this changing world. And the world will continue to change because for the first time ever, millions of people can now travel anytime, anywhere for any length and even live anywhere on Airbnb. And this is a travel revolution. So we\u2019re just getting started. We have many more innovations to share with you, starting with some exciting announcements next Tuesday. So thank you all for joining today and we\u2019ll see you next week.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining, and I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Stephenson",
            "content": "Yes. The majority of the decrease is simply the increase of short-term stays kind of coming back. It still remains to be \u2013 long-term stay has been one of the fastest-growing parts of our business, pre-COVID. That is a trend that we are seeing in the pre-COVID era it just continued to be strong during COVID, and it remains strong today. And so yes, the decrease is just the fact that short-term stays continue to come back. And in terms of the market opportunity of long-term state \u2013 market opportunity in long-term stays, we think this adds hundreds of billions of dollars to our overall long-term TAM opportunity with long-term space. Sure. In terms \u2013 again, one of the things to remember is \u2013 and the reason why we kind of highlighted on the call that the growth in our supply in the nonurban areas of on North America and Europe is that we get the supply when we have the demand, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s gone up 15% since the beginning of the year because that\u2019s also where there\u2019s biggest demand. Now, we\u2019re obviously seeing greater demand pickup in our more urban areas. So the percentage of nights in the urban area has started to increase or now made 46% of our nights. We\u2019re still down to maybe 60% of our nights kind of pre-COVID. And so we\u2019ll continue to see listings growth in those more urban areas as the demand kind of keeps coming back. So until I think we\u2019re back to full demand, we actually don\u2019t need incremental growth because we\u2019re still below our nights that we had back in 2019. But again, the important part is that we get the supply when we need it because the supply will follow that demand and we\u2019ll continue to make it easier for new supply to come on board. In terms of forward-looking ADRs, the high average daily rate we\u2019ve seen throughout this last year has been primarily driven by the mix of types of space and the location. So it\u2019s a mix of Europe and North America have higher average daily rates. Non-urban whole home, larger homes, all those reasons have been driving up the rates overall. And the other thing we start seeing a little bit more in Q3 with some price appreciation in high demand areas. And so it was a combination in Q3 of both the mix of types of stays and some of the price appreciation. And what we do anticipate is as urban comes back, and more markets like Asia and Latin America, which have lower average daily rates. We anticipate the overall ADR to moderate some, but we also believe that some of the higher ADR will sustain for the future. So in terms of \u2013 and then what we did say also in our shareholder letter is that we anticipate that the ADRs in Q4 should be relatively consistent with the ADRs we had here in Q3. In terms of marketing, we\u2019re really happy with the adjusted marketing approach that we\u2019ve taken. Now again, this was a pre-COVID change that we made, where we were \u2013 began to invest in our strength. And our strength is the brand of Airbnb. And we modified that marketing approach pre-COVID. We reduced our reliance on search-engine marketing. And then in COVID, we have shifted even just more significantly more quickly, and we\u2019re really pleased with those results. As Brian mentioned, this broader brand campaign, talking about made possible by hosts, it gets to talk to both sides of our marketplace. It both recruits new host to Airbnb, and talks to guests about why you\u2019d want to stand Airbnb, and we\u2019re really happy with those results and plan to continue the strength of that. We\u2019ve increased our relative marketing rate this year, just given the fact that our \u2013 the business has been going quite well. And so \u2013 but on a relative basis, our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue are down from levels we had in 2019. And we should anticipate that this \u2013 it will be in this kind of range for the foreseeable future. Sure. what we\u2019re seeing is continued strength in growing strength in the business as borders are starting to open up, people are more vaccinate more willing to kind of travel. We\u2019re continuing to see bookings strength, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be seeing gross booking rate of gross booking value growth increasing from Q3 to Q4. I don\u2019t have a specific percentage that we\u2019re sharing on the call today. There can be some variability on the overall growth, but it is accelerating. And that\u2019s what\u2019s included in our guidance estimate that we\u2019ve shared. No, I think that\u2019s the key. Our cross-border travel, it\u2019s 33% here in Q3, but we\u2019re continuing to see strengthening here in October. More continued countries are reducing their travel restrictions and the travel trends continue to improve. Sure. We\u2019re continuing to see sequential improvement in the net nights booked in October relative to September. So travel restrictions as they come off. We\u2019re continuing to see that sequential increase \u2013 We have more global net nights booked in October 21 that we did in 2019. So, I think that\u2019s a really positive sign for Europe. And there are some week-to-week variations, but the trends continue to be up and to the right. Well, the reality it tends to vary by country, right? Different countries will have different levels of restrictions in opening. There\u2019s obviously a lot of pent-up demand for kind of peak kind of travel. We saw that in Q3 is a big part of the strength of our results in Q3 or Europeans wanting to get into their traditional kind of summer holidays in Spain and Italy and other places. And so there can be some variation by country throughout, but the strengthening of the business in Europe just kind of continues. We\u2019re seeing a nice uptick in bookings, especially even leading into 2022. So some of the bookings growth that we\u2019re seeing now is going to obviously be for travel in early next year and throughout in 2022. Sure. What we\u2019re seeing \u2013 I can step back some of the new host acquisition that it makes it a little too early to tell exactly how the retention and things are going to work for all the new hosts. But let me step back and broadly share that overall, we\u2019re seeing churn rate of our hosts or has improved. It\u2019s lower than it had been historically that the actual success rate of new hosts is increasing. Like 50% of new listings receiving a booking in three days. 75% of new listings are receiving a booking within eight days. So they\u2019re actually more successful, more quickly. We\u2019re seeing of the new hosts that are coming on, that they are \u2013 the traditional host that have been successful in Airbnb, individual host that are largely \u2013 have exclusive to Airbnb that may only have a property or two, it\u2019s that core individual host. That\u2019s still the majority of the host that we\u2019re kind of bringing on. And the cross listing of our host is actually down from where it was in kind of pre-COVID times. So I think the overall health of our hosting community is quite strong, and the growth that we\u2019re seeing in new host is very consistent with the historic types of host we\u2019ve had in the past. Thank you. Yes. I think one thing to kind of step back and remember is that Airbnb strength has traditionally been cross-border and more urban. I mean, that\u2019s traditionally where our business strength has been, right? Cross-border has been 50% of our business. The urban has been about 60% and yet our really strong Q3 results happened while even those two parts of the business are not yet returned to kind of pre-pandemic levels, right? Cross-border still at 33%, the urban \u2013 high-density urbans at 46%. So it\u2019s not quite back, but it\u2019s growing nicely. So I think what you say about the pace of urban recovery is that, that will continue to be additive to our business and the strength that we\u2019re seeing overall. I think what\u2019s also interesting about the pace of the urban recovery is that the nature of it is even a little bit different. Historically, our top 10 cities in the world contributed approximately 11% of revenue and now the top 10 cities are comprising about 6%. So it\u2019s just getting more diverse, more spread in terms of where our distribution of travel is. So as urban comes back, I think it\u2019s still going to be even a more broad spread version of the revenue across the world. Yes. We highlighted on the shareholder letter that 45% of our nights were from stays at least seven nights. And this is the trend that we\u2019re seeing is that the length of stay continues to increase. The number of use cases that people find working with Airbnb in the same way that Brian just mentioned, it\u2019s just a better way to travel for longer. You\u2019re not going to want to stay in a hotel room for 28 nights, but those trends are continuing. And I don\u2019t have anything specific to say about cross-border and the length of stay directly related to that. But just more broadly that the length of stay continues to increase. And to the extent that it does, it accretes to Airbnb. Thank you. Sure. Let me start with the ADR. The trend that we saw in ADR late last year, the increase in ADR was almost exclusively driven by mix. And so that was the regional mix urban, nonurban mix, size of home. And then what we saw earlier in the year is some price appreciation as a larger portion of the ADR increase. And that increased a little bit further here in Q3, kind of the peak kind of summer travel season. And then what we\u2019re seeing, as I said in Q4, is our ADRs are relatively stable with what they were in Q3. Even with these elevated ADRs, again, the majority of the increase has been just on a relative basis due to mix. So there\u2019s really no change in the price where there is some price appreciation. I think we still have a great value. We\u2019re still able to give people, homes and stays that they find very valuable in terms of all the amenities they get. Maybe a larger place, more amenities, kitchen, more bedrooms, there\u2019s more space to be. And so we think we continue to give a great value. And so we\u2019ll continue to monitor it and be mindful of it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an existential threat to us. And then the second question is just rising cases, any differences versus the pandemic. I guess I think what we\u2019ve seen is just a bit more resilience in guests being willing to travel around the world, right? There\u2019s a little bit of \u2013 there could be pockets of variation depending on what governments frankly do in terms of opening up borders. And \u2013 but the general trend has continued to be more positive, more up into the right and more consistent. And I think people, even in the face of various strains of COVID continue to be wanting to travel, and they find that doing that on Airbnb is the best way to do it. Yes. On APAC, we\u2019re not anticipating that any short-term rental regulation changes as being a major negative drag on our business over time. We\u2019re just mindful that there can be some variation in what governments are wanting to do, especially during this kind of COVID crisis time, and it varies by area. And we saw a little more restrictions in APAC than we did elsewhere."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I\u2019m really excited to share our results with you. The travel rebound that began earlier this year accelerated in the third quarter. Q3 was Airbnb\u2019s best quarter yet. Revenue of $2.2 billion with our highest ever, surpassing 2019 by 36%. Net income of $834 million was our highest ever, nearly 4x larger than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1 billion, also our best ever. Our EBITDA margin was 49%, an increase of 30%, or 3,000 basis points compared to Q3 2019. Over the summer, we also reached a major milestone with one billion cumulative guest arrivals. This means that Airbnb has been used more than one billion times since we started. Now finally, I\u2019m delighted to report that our hosts earned a record $12.8 billion in the quarter. Our results show that the growing strength of the travel rebound is here despite the continued pandemic. We saw continued strength in North America and EMEA and an acceleration in Latin America despite sequential increase of cancellations. Now excluding APAC, our total global Nights and Experiences Booked exceeded 2019 levels. Gross booking value of $11.9 billion shot above 2019\u2019s levels by 23%, driven by the strength of ADR. But something bigger than a travel rebound that\u2019s happening. The world is undergoing a revolution in how we live and work. The pandemic has suddenly untethered tens of millions of people from the need to go into an office. Technologies like Zoom make it possible to work from home. Airbnb makes it possible to work from any home. And this new found flexibility is bringing about a revolution in how we travel, because for the first time ever, millions of people can now travel anytime, anywhere for any length and even live anywhere on Airbnb. And we believe that this trend towards more flexibility will only accelerate. In recent months, some of the world\u2019s largest companies Procter & Gamble, Amazon, Ford, PricewaterhouseCoopers have announced increased flexibility for employees to work remotely and we expect many more companies follow this. And so what we\u2019re seeing our several trends as a result of this travel revolution. First, people can travel anytime, because many people don\u2019t have to be in the office at specific times, they have more flexibility and when they can travel. So families are increasingly travelling traveling outside the traditional week, weekend trip. And in fact, Mondays and Tuesdays are currently our highest growing days of the week to travel. This is really interesting. The second trend we\u2019re seeing is that people are traveling everywhere, literally everywhere. During the pandemic, over 100,000 cities have had at least one booking on Airbnb. And that includes 6,000 towns and cities that received their first booking ever on Airbnb. The third trend we\u2019re seeing is people aren\u2019t just traveling in Airbnb, they\u2019re now living on Airbnb. Long-term stays, up 28 days or more, remained our fastest-growing category by trip length. People are traveling Airbnb for extended vacations, relocation, temporary housing, student housing and many other reasons. Now finally, more people were also interested in hosting than ever before. We ended Q3 with the most active listings ever, and there are two reasons for this. First, our demand is driving more supply. In fact, our highest supply growth is in our highest demand destinations, particularly in North America and EMEA. And second our marketing and product initiatives to attract new hosts are working. Now we\u2019re constantly improving our service to meet this new way of traveling and the wave of guests it will bring. On May 24, we introduced the Airbnb 2021 release, which included more than 100 upgrades across every aspect of Airbnb service. On November 9, which is next Tuesday we\u2019ll be announcing the Airbnb 2021 Winter Release and this release will include another 50 upgrades and innovations that make it easier to host and support the changing needs of guests, and you can watch it right at our home page next Tuesday at 8:00 AM Pacific Standard Time. So, I hope you can tune in and to see I\u2019m really excited about what we have to share. So, now let\u2019s turn to our progress on our 2021 plan. Now as a reminder, our single priority in 2021 has been to prepare for the travel rebound. To do this, we\u2019ve been perfecting the end-to-end experience of our core service. And this includes educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest experience and delivering world-class service. So, let me give you an update on each of these. First, we are educating the world about what makes Airbnb different, and that is hosting. Earlier this year, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years, made possible by hosts. We\u2019re educating guests about the benefits of being hosted, and we\u2019re also inspiring more people to become hosts, and we continue to be encouraged by the results of this campaign. Second, we\u2019re recruiting more hosts and setting them up for success. On May 24, we launched a completely redesigned host onboarding flow that makes it simpler for anyone to start hosting. Throughout the process, potential hosts can now be paired with Superhosts to answer their questions or concerns. We began Ask a Superhost in nine countries, and we\u2019ve since expanded the program to over 30 languages in 196 countries. Third, we\u2019re simplifying every part of the guest experience. Earlier this year, we introduced I\u2019m Flexible, a whole new way to search on Airbnb when guests are flexible about where or when they\u2019re traveling. Now since launch, guests have used I\u2019m Flexible more than 500 million times. Now due to the popularity of this feature, we\u2019re soon making it even more flexible by expanding the date range of this feature as well as adding more categories of unique space. We\u2019re really excited about the progress of this feature. And finally, fourth, whenever a host or guest need us, we must deliver world-class service. In September, we launched dedicated Superhost support in North America, giving our most experienced hosts priority access to our most experienced support agents. We\u2019re expanding the support to all Superhosts globally by the end of the year. So that is our plan for 2021. Now, before I go to questions, I have one update that bittersweet. Three years ago, Ann Mather became the second independent director to join our Board after Ken Chenault. Since then, our team has benefited from her guidance. Now Ann recently made the decision to reduce the number of Board she sits on, and sadly for us that means she\u2019ll be departing our Board of Directors on December 15. Now Ann has been a critical member of our team as we transition from a private to a public company, and we appreciate everything she\u2019s done. We look forward to adding another independent director as soon as possible. I know that being on the Airbnb born in the midst of a global pandemic is no easy task. And I want to once again thank you, Ann, for everything you\u2019ve done. So to recap, Q3 was Airbnb\u2019s best quarter ever. Revenue, adjusted EBITDA and net income were our highest ever. Travel is undergoing a revolution. People are now taking longer trips traveling to more locations and even living on Airbnb. As the world changes, we continue to innovate. We\u2019ve made more than 150 upgrades innovations this year alone. So with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions. Yes. Thank you very much, Eric. So yes, this has been a really great year for supply growth. We have more active listings on Airbnb today than we ever have. And it\u2019s important to just share a few thoughts on supply. Number one, we are quite different than our competitors. Airbnb, we have four million hosts, and 90% of our hosts are individual. That means they could never have posted, if not for the tools that we provide. And the vast majority are only listed on Airbnb. And we found that if we make hosting easier and as more people know about hosting and we give host more support, more people will become hosts. And so our strategy is a full life cycle. It starts with making sure more people know about hosting. You see the Airbnb brand is very mainstream. Our brand is now \u2013 use all over the world, but hosting is not as mainstream. And so the first thing we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re raising awareness about hosting. This year, we did our first brand campaign in five years, made possible by hosts. It uses real photos from real trips to highlight what makes Airbnb different in that host. The great thing about that ad is that also is able to track more host to Airbnb as well. So once we\u2019re able to increase awareness of hosting, then the name of the game is making it easier to host. And on May 24, we showed a simple 10-step process to become a host where we\u2019ve radically reduced the number of steps and made it easier to host and conversion rate for people starting to leisure their space low is up. Third, if a host needs help we\u2019re going to give them support. So, we launched Ask a Superhost. Ask a Superhost pairs prospective host with our very best Superhost on Airbnb. And since we launched this feature in May, more than 50,000 prospective hosts have used this, and we\u2019re now expanding this to 196 countries globally. And finally, we\u2019re continually investing more tools to allow hosts to expand their business. And what all this means is that you\u2019re going to see continued innovation from us. What we\u2019ve seen is an increase in the trajectory of a number of people becoming a host. The other point, though, Eric, I just want to make is the following. On [indiscernible], we ever supply constraint globally on Airbnb, the vast majority hosts only rent occasionally. And so the holy grail of travel is pointing demand to where we have supply. Before the pandemic, most people were very fixed in their search parameters. They had a destination of mine and they had dates in mind. But now because many people don\u2019t have to go back to an office, they\u2019re more flexible. And this means that we can point them to where we have supply. And this is the power of being flexible. Over 500 million searches have used flexibility. More than 40% of our searches, guests are flexible on where or when they\u2019re traveling. So this is what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re focused on a full funnel approach to supply acquisition, and we\u2019re pointing demand to where we have supply. And I expect that we\u2019ll have plenty of supply years to come. Yes, Mario, why don\u2019t I give the mix shift to Dave and I spent to talk a little bit more broadly about the strategy. Dave? And I\u2019ll just share a few more thoughts, Mario. We\u2019ve just seen a major paradigm shift in travel. Before the pandemic, short-term stays is really the primary business that we were in. What we actually saw was that long-term stays was our fastest-growing segment of business even before the pandemic. So, I think what the pandemic did is an accelerated inevitable trend. There was already this emerging category between classic traveling and really kind of permanent housing which was people seeking stays of weeks at a time or even months at a time. And I think what the pandemic has done has just accelerated this. We\u2019re going to see a lot more people going away as they have newfound flexibility. Even people with families who can\u2019t go away during the year, they may be able to travel a little bit longer during summer as well. So this is really exciting. And the only other thing I\u2019d just add is nearly half of our business is for more than a week as well. So these are really exciting categories. I think there\u2019s a huge amount of growth going forward for these different segments. All right. So thank you, Jen. I heard three questions. One is about supply growth in urban. The next is mix shift, it\u2019s impacting at ADR and then marketing spend. Dave, do you want to take these? I think these would be great for you to take. And I can just share just to really recap briefly our marketing strategy. We take a really different approach than our competitors at the full funnel integrated marketing strategy. And it really starts with PR and word of mouth. And really word of mouth and PR\u2019s how we build the brand for the vast majority of the years before you even have enough money to have a marketing budget. And because of that, Airbnb is a really well-known brand that\u2019s a noun and a verb used all over the world. And because of this, more than 90% of our traffic was free or unpaid in Q3. And so we think of marketing is really education. Brand marketing is really about educating people that are highly differentiated product. And then performance marketing for us isn\u2019t really a way to buy customers. It\u2019s the way the laser in on balancing supply and demand. So we think this is a really unique approach. And I think that it\u2019s just really all about continually investing in our brand. And over time, we think the amount of the loyalty to the brand will only increase. Hey, Kevin, thanks for the question. Dave, do you want to take this? Thanks for the question, Stephen. I don\u2019t think we have that data specifically, but I can just share a couple of high-level thoughts with you. I think that we\u2019re going to be entering a new golden age of travel. I tend to think that the last 18 months have been \u2013 the world has been turned on its head. And I think that many people yearned for what was taken away from them. Now not everything that was taken away from us. Do I think we all want that. But I think one of the things that\u2019s taken away from a lot of people, they want back is the ability to travel and the ability to travel freely and the ability to travel freely or cross borders. And just to give you one anecdote or one data point on October 15, I believe it was that date that President Biden announced the reopening of the borders for international travelers come to the United States. Within one week of that announcement, we saw a 44% spike in nights booked for stays, crossing borders coming into United States on Airbnb for stays November 9 and later, which is when the borders would open. So, what we are seeing kind of across the board is evidence of pent-up demand. I think all the new emerging use cases that exist in Airbnb are here to stay, because I think flexibility is here to stay. So, I think a lot of the nearby destinations of people getting cars here to stay, I think the longer stays, people living in Airbnb Tuesday. But I think what I\u2019m really excited about is the emergence of cross-border travel. Cross-border travel is now 80% of what it was at its peak in Airbnb. It used to be half of our business. It went down quite a bit. Now it\u2019s about one-third of our business and growing again. So yes, we are seeing a lot of pent-up demand. And Dave, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to this. Dave, do you want to take that? All right. Thank you for the question, Dave \u2013 Doug. Why don\u2019t I take the first part of the question about what the biggest friction points for hosts are and then Dave can have the follow-on. Now a really, really great question. there\u2019s really three parts of the funnel. Number one, do people know about hosting. Number two, is it easy? And number three, can they get help. To me, those are the three parts of the funnel. So number one, do people even know about hosting Well, Airbnb\u2019s brand is very much mainstream. So we\u2019ve seen a huge opportunity in people being able to host. I don\u2019t think most people realize that the average host can make $9,600, which is more than the stimulus check they\u2019ve been getting the United States and the amount of effort is surprisingly easy. And so the first thing we have to do is continue to tell story of hosting, and we\u2019ve been doing that, and that is working. The next thing we have to do is make it easier to host. The easier we make something, the more people do it. Airbnb really innovated and built a lot of custom tools to make it easier to host than ever before. This was really the core innovation we have. We built a system of trust where we\u2019re continually making it easier to host. We obviously simplified the number of steps to become a host to 10 really simple basic steps. You can do it now quite quickly from your phone or a desktop device. And we have more innovations that are going to make it even easier that we\u2019re showing next Tuesday, November 9. So that\u2019s the second part, making it easier as we do that conversion rate goes up. And then finally, sometimes people like say, this is \u2013 some people want to talk to other hosts. They want to know what it\u2019s like, what\u2019s it like to let a stranger in your home. How much should I change? What are the local rules and regulations. And so having another host to talk to is really important. Now this is the power the Airbnb model. One of the things that makes me so special is we\u2019re a community. And we\u2019re a community where host tell other hosts about Airbnb and they bring them on to the platform. And so what I\u2019m really excited about is the Ask a Superhost program. We\u2019ve had more than 50,000 prospective host sign up to use that. And we\u2019re going to continue to scale that, and we\u2019re announcing on November 9 that we\u2019re going to be scaling the Ask a Superhost program. So these are three parts of the journey. We continue to focus on these. We\u2019re going to get a lot more host. Dave, you want to take the next part on the host retention. All right. Yes. Thank you very much for the question, Justin. I\u2019m really excited with I\u2019m Flexible. So just to recap what this feature is \u2013 On May 24, we announced I\u2019m Flexible, a new search tool that allows people to search on Airbnb, if they\u2019re flexible about where or when they\u2019re traveling. And so to go to Airbnb\u2019s home page right now, actually, if you do it, you\u2019ll see a really big button, it says I\u2019m Flexible. If you click on that button, it now takes you to a whole new view of Airbnb, where you can completely browse. Now this is a really special new product we built. We actually went through millions of listings, and we had to do this really extensive process of organizing our structured data, essentially getting an organized catalog of all of our inventory. If something says it\u2019s a tree house, is it a tree house? We made sure every photo is the properly labeled. And this feature has been really, really successful. We also have flexible dates allows people, if they\u2019re flexible when they\u2019re traveling to say, I\u2019m looking for a place for a weekend for a week or a month any time over the next six months. Well, that \u2013 those features have been used more than 0.5 billion times. So what are our lessons? Well, the first lesson, if conversion rates up, the more people use I\u2019m Flexible, the more likely they\u2019re going to book on Airbnb because they\u2019re more likely to find a property. Number two, what it\u2019s showing is we\u2019re able to point demand to where we have supply. There\u2019s a lot of really unique listings that are in locations that people wouldn\u2019t have thought to type in, right? It might be in a small town you never heard of. With I\u2019m Flexible, it really levels the playing field and allows many more properties to be discovered. Maybe another way of thinking about it is on flexible turns the home into the destination, so you don\u2019t have to type in the destination. And I\u2019m really excited about this. So this tells us that we\u2019re on to something. It also tells us that there\u2019s a new paradigm in travel. And so I think that this flexibility is here to stay. I think one of the holy grails in travel is to answer a question for a guest of where should I go and when should I go. And by having this new flexible features, we\u2019re able to really be able to do that. So what\u2019s next for us is that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in this feature. On November 9, we\u2019re announcing four new categories of I\u2019m Flexible. There\u2019s going to be some really cool features that we can show. So I hope you tune in. We\u2019re also expanding the flexible date feature from six months to 12 months. So now you can see when these really incredible properties available anytime in the next 12 months. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in this feature. And I think down the road, this will be a major way that people are searching on Airbnb, and it\u2019s so important because, again, it allows us to balance supply and demand. Dave, do you want to take the second question? Yes. Thank you for the question, Jed. Yes, let me take both of these large property managers and work from anywhere trends and how opportunities to work with companies. So on the first one, though our platform is 90% of individuals, the 10% of our hosts or professionals are very important to Airbnb, and we continue to build new tools for them. And so this just past year alone, we\u2019ve had 150 upgrades and innovations and around half of those happened for a host. And many of the upgrades we have also applied to the more professional host as well. And so we\u2019re going to be showing off a number of features on November 9, and many of these are going to be innovations for professional hosts in addition to individual hosts. So we\u2019re still very focused in this area, and I continue to believe that we\u2019re going to be growing really quickly. And just to give you an example, as Dave said, we\u2019ve seen our fastest-growing areas of inventory in North America and Europe in nonurban areas. And certainly, professional hosts are a part of this. And I think they really love the amount of demand that we provide for them. Now as far as the work from anywhere approach. Yes, I think this is a really exciting area. I mean, as we said, Amazon, Ford, PwC, Procter & Gamble are just the beginning of the number of companies that have offered a more remote policy. I think it\u2019s safe to say that very few companies that have office workers are going to be asking those workers to come back to an office five days a week. And all you have to believe as that people don\u2019t come back five days a week, maybe they come back four days a week, maybe they come back three days a week, maybe they had even more flexible policies. And all we have to do is believe that, to believe that Zoom is here to stay, to believe that work from anywhere is here to stay. And so we\u2019re starting to see a lot of companies certainly reach out to us. We don\u2019t have anything to announce right now, but we are going to continually make it easier for people to be able to live anywhere and work anywhere on Airbnb and integrating with companies if that\u2019s what it takes of course, would be something that we continue to do more of. Yes. I can take these. So obviously, the growth of our core business of homes has been very, very strong. With experiences, I really expected last year to be a breakout year for Airbnb experiences. And of course, the opposite happened. The pandemic put that product on pause. That being said, it\u2019s now been more than 1.5 years, and I feel like people can only stay home so many nights watching Netflix. And eventually, they want to get out of house. And I do think people want alternative things like restaurants, especially when they\u2019re traveling. And Airbnb experiences are very popular amongst our guests. They actually love even more than homes statistically from a five star standpoint. In other words, more guests leave a five star review for experiences in the homes after they stay. So I\u2019m very bullish on this product. It\u2019s been gradually ramping back up and reopening. We\u2019ve seen strong growth over the last couple of quarters, and I\u2019m expecting this to be a big area of growth over the coming five years or so. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with experiences. Now with regards to our relationship with communities, let me just start by saying this. Even before the pandemic, we worked with thousands of cities all over the world. You see we created this new category of travel, and we had to work with cities to educate them and work collaboratively with them to be able to really make sure everybody works best for these communities. To give you a stat, we have today, collected $4 billion in hotel occupancy tax or transient occupancy tax. You can\u2019t collect hotel tax without working with those cities and jurisdictions. So we\u2019ve had really close relationships with them. And what I\u2019ve seen in the last year is that the pandemic has actually been a bit of a reset for our relationship with cities. And reset probably in a good way because what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of cities that we\u2019re concerned with tourism in their markets are in a different concern now. Now over tourism the number of cities have to under tourism. The reduction of business travel, fewer international travelers crossing borders going into big cities means that many of these cities and destinations have revenue shortfalls and just general travel shortfalls. And so what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve had a lot of cities reaching out to us to collaborate. And in fact, we\u2019ve done 100 partnerships with destination marketing organizations, around the world. And I think our new and flexible features where we can point demand to where we have supply also means we can point demand to cities that want it. And so I think this is a really exciting period for us to, really renew a great relationship with cities all over the world. Yes. Why don\u2019t I start with that very last question, Brian. And then, Dave, I can hand over to you. You can talk a little bit more about cross-border, its impact on length of stay and just the growth of maybe weekly stays is what I think Brian\u2019s asking. But let me start with this question of the competitiveness of long-term stays. It\u2019s really quite interesting to think about how we started Airbnb. I started the company when I was 26 years old with two of my friends, and the category we entered was hotels. That was the incumbent industry. An industry that most people liked, and travelers have a lot of other options. If you were to try to stay somewhere for two weeks, three weeks a month or multiple months, and let\u2019s say you\u2019re staying somewhere other than the city you live, what are your current options? There\u2019s not a lot of players doing this. There\u2019s a lot of friction. So we think essentially, the longer the length of stay, the more compelling it is to stay in a home. It gets very expensive to stay in a hotel for weeks at a time. And the longer you\u2019re away from home, the more I think you want to be in a home. You want a kitchen, you might want a backyard, you want to be able to cook. You just want to feel like your home and you\u2019re not like an outsider. And so I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity for us. And this is partly why I\u2019m really excited about long-term stays or even stays that are for a week or longer. Dave, do you want to talk about some of the stats we\u2019re seeing? Yes. I can take both of those, Naved. Number one, just in Apple, their iOS changes. No, we\u2019ve not seen any impact on Airbnb, and that\u2019s not really the business we\u2019re in. With regards to our efforts to invest in technology to onboard hotels. Let\u2019s just talk a little bit about our strategy with hotels. Last year, we had to make some difficult decisions to put a number of initiatives on pause, like transportation and scale back some others. And one of the initiatives that we had to scale back a bit was our investment in hotels. That being said, hotels are still a very important part of Airbnb\u2019s strategy. We believe that people come to Airbnb because we have something unique. We have unique host to offer something you can\u2019t get anywhere else. And so we think that the majority of people come to Airbnb direct to book individual host. That being said, we want to make sure that people come to Airbnb, they always find a place to stay. And sometimes we have network gaps. And we think that hotels are really great ways to fill a network gap. So when somebody comes to Airbnb, they can always find a place to stay. HotelTonight has been growing really steadily in the last couple of years. I\u2019m very excited about the progress, and we\u2019re continually investing in this area. Now it\u2019s not as big a priority as our core business of supporting individual hosts, but we\u2019re continually supporting them. We\u2019re continually investing in this area. Will we be seeing what? Yes. I mean, yes. And we have tens of thousands of other terms now on Airbnb, and I expect you to see more in the future for sure. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s really just a matter of prioritization. Right now, we are focused on the most perishable opportunities the most perishable opportunities right now are scaling as quickly as possible to get as many hosts ready to host as many guests as possible. And so our big priorities are recruiting hosts, simplifying the guest experience, educating the world that would make certain be different, that\u2019s hosting, and getting world-class service to getting our service to be at a world-class level. Those are our major priorities, but we are continually investing in hotels. Dave, do you want to take these? I\u2019ll just add one last comment. We\u2019re living in a really fast-changing world. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the end of big existential changes in the world. And if you can\u2019t predict the future, the best thing to do is adapt to it. And I think our business model is incredibly adaptable to whatever changes are to come. Thanks for the question. Dave, do you want to take APAC and start with that and then I can be to talk about new investments. And then on your question of new investments. Here\u2019s what I would say. I mean, we learned some very valuable lessons last year about focus. I remember once I was in college and my teachers told me, Brian, you can do everything you want in your life just not all at the same time. Yes, we certainly learned that less than last year. We had to scale back initiatives. But one of the benefits of all that, we took our very best people and we focused them only on a few problems, including recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest journey, improving a world-class service and educating the world about Airbnb. And as we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ve not only reduced costs in the business, but we\u2019ve actually been growing even faster. And so this year has been a year of a relentless innovation to perfect our core service nearly one innovation every 48 hours on our core service. That being said, we are going to do new things Airbnb. We created this category of travel. And I think there\u2019s a lot more categories that we can create in Airbnb. And so we\u2019ve done two releases this year. We did one in May and one in November, and we\u2019re going to do a couple more again next year. And so November will not be the last time you hear from us. You\u2019ll hear from us again in the spring, where we\u2019ll introduce a summer release for the summer, and we\u2019re going to have some really big new offerings as well. And again, the really big areas I\u2019m excited about that we\u2019re currently doing, short-term stays. I think we\u2019re realizing that we are just scratching the surface of this incredibly huge opportunity as home sharing continues to grow. Long-term stays is an entirely new category for Airbnb. And I think now that people are getting comfortable crossing borders, can get outside and getting gathering with other people, experience will be a big opportunity. But this is just the beginning. We have many more innovations in front of us, and we will continue to use our creativity to design new possibilities for people. All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. Just to recap everything 2021 for Airbnb has been a year of relentless innovation. We launched more than 100 upgrades already this year. And next week, we\u2019re going to announce 50 more. That\u2019s 150 upgrade innovations this year. Our design-driven approach means that we\u2019re constantly improving our service to adapt to this changing world. And the world will continue to change because for the first time ever, millions of people can now travel anytime, anywhere for any length and even live anywhere on Airbnb. And this is a travel revolution. So we\u2019re just getting started. We have many more innovations to share with you, starting with some exciting announcements next Tuesday. So thank you all for joining today and we\u2019ll see you next week."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call.  I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's Second Quarter of 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky, and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson.  Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2021. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance.  Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And with that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you, Ellie, and hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today. I'm dialing in from an Airbnb listing in Italy, and I'm very excited to share our Q2 results with you. Since the beginning of the year, we've been preparing for the travel rebound. After months of being stuck at home, millions of people have been yearning to travel, explore the world and connect with others. And we anticipated a travel rebound unlike any other in history.  And in Q1, we saw the start of this rebound. And now that Q2 is behind us, we can definitively say that the travel rebound is upon us, and Airbnb is leading the way. But as we predicted, travel is different than before. Airbnb has benefited from our adaptable business model, which is able to meet the changing needs of our guests. We haven't just been sitting passively around waiting for travel to return. For the past year, we've been relentlessly driving product innovations to meet this historic moment. And as a result, Airbnb has emerged from this crisis faster than others, and we're better positioned for the future of travel.  Now while we recognize the persistence of COVID and the Delta variant, we expect Q3 to be our strongest revenue quarter ever. The fact that we expect Q3 revenue to be our highest revenue quarter ever speaks to the inherent resiliency of our business.  So now turning to our Q2 results. As vaccination rates increased and travel restrictions lifted in Q2, we saw consistent strength in North America, followed by significant recovery in Europe. One year ago in Q2, our business was significantly impacted with the onset of COVID. Now like many others, our year-over-year comparison to 2020 does show a dramatic improvement. But what is most notable are our results relative to pre-COVID levels. Across all key metrics, we nearly met or exceeded our Q2 2019 performance. Q2 nights and experiences booked nearly tripled from a year ago. More importantly, Q2 nights and experiences booked nearly matched pre-COVID levels in 2019. Gross booking value of $13.4 billion, more than quadrupled from a year ago and also shot up above 2019 levels by 37% based on the recovery of nights, combined with the strength of our ADR. Meanwhile, Q2 revenue of $1.335 billion, also nearly quadrupled from a year ago, and it exceeded 2019 levels by 10%. What this demonstrates is an acceleration in our recovery from Q1. Our Q2 results not only demonstrate our leadership in the travel rebound, but also our continued operating discipline. Our adjusted EBITDA profit was $217 million. Now this represents a 16% EBITDA margin. This was more than $600 million of improvement in EBITDA from a year ago, and it represents 20% or 2,000 basis points margin expansion from 2019. And this is on a similar level of revenue. Now over the past year, as our top line recovered, we consistently focused on improving our profitability. For example, over the last 4 quarters, we've improved EBITDA margins on average more than 20% every quarter as compared to periods in 2019.  Now that is a 2,000 basis point improvement on average, every single quarter. And we've done this by improving our variable cost by driving up marketing efficiency and by very tightly managing our fixed cost. Now I'm really proud of these results. And what they demonstrate is that we are emerging from this crisis as a stronger and more efficient company.  Now turning to business highlights and travel trends. Despite the continued impact of COVID around the world, we have seen clear evidence that travel is recovering. We're incredibly encouraged by what we've seen in Q2. And what we've seen is an accelerating pace of global travel, particularly in Europe, as well as continued popularity of nonurban and domestic destinations.  In Q2, we had the highest number of gross nights booked of any quarter in our history. And we just had the biggest night on Airbnb since the pandemic began. Last Saturday night, more than 4 million guests from around the world, were staying in an Airbnb. That is more people than the entire population of Los Angeles. And we're also seeing travelers once again cross borders and business cities. These 2 categories of travel have been historic strengths of Airbnb, and we're really excited to see them begin to recover. But at the same time, the way that people travel and live continues to change. We believe that many of the new booking trends that emerge over the past year are here to stay. People are traveling to many more destinations than before. And when they travel, they're staying longer. We believe these 2 categories of travel are in fact here to stay. And as a result, what we focused on are product innovations that support these new ways that people travel. You see many people have a greater freedom about where and when they travel, and we've improved our product to better meet their needs. Our new search products offer guests the flexibility that they want when planning and booking trips. And finally, we're seeing more people around the world consider hosting. We ended Q2 with the largest number of active listings in Airbnb's history. Now there are a couple of reasons for this. First, our demand is driving supply. This is what's so powerful about our model. For example, in Q2, our highest supply growth was actually in high-demand destination. And second, our marketing and product initiatives have been really accelerating to support host recruitment, and they're working. So now let me go into a little more detail on what we've been doing to prepare for and support this travel recovery.  Now as a reminder, our single priority in 2021 has been to prepare for the travel rebound. To do this, we've been perfecting the end-to-end experience of our core service. And this includes 4 themes: first, educating the world about hosting; second, recruiting more hosts; third, simplifying the guest journey; and finally, delivering world-class service. So let me just briefly give you an update on how we're executing on each of these 4 areas.  So first, we\u2019re educating the world about what makes Airbnb different, and that is hosting. In Q1, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in 5 years, Made Possible by Hosts, and we expanded this campaign in Q2. We're educating guests about the benefits of being hosted, and we're also inspiring more people to become hosts.  Now we continue to be really encouraged by the result of this campaign in terms of traffic, first-time bookers, interest in hosting and brand favorability. Second, we are recruiting more hosts, and we are setting them up for success. On May 24, just a few months ago, we launched a completely redesigned host onboarding flow that makes it simpler for anyone to start hosting. This new flow has made it faster to become a host, which has helped drive our listings growth in Q2.  Third, we are simplifying every part of the guest experience. On May 24, we expanded the tools for guests to offer more flexibility when they're searching for a place to stay. We announced flexible dates, flexible destinations and flexible matching. And all 3 of these features are to support the new ways that guests are looking to plan and book trips. And finally, whenever our host or guests need us, we must deliver world-class service. So we recently launched a redesigned Help Center. We've more than tripled our supported languages, and we've updated our safety resources. And all of it is to ensure that we are supporting our guests and hosts whenever they need us.  So to summarize, travel is recovering and our Q2 results show that Airbnb's leading the way. For the past year, we've been preparing for this rebound. We've driven product innovation to support changes to the way people are traveling and living all over the world. And as a result, we've emerged from this crisis faster than others and as a stronger, more efficient company.  So with that, we look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. You just talked about having this record day. I think you said last Saturday, and I think you're also maybe appropriately cautioning about third quarter trends and variants and Delta. So just kind of put those things together. Record day still sounds like things are good, but I'm sure there are some warnings out there. Can you be more specific about you're seeing that's causing you to be just a little more cautious about Q3 and the back half of the year?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Mark, thank you for the question. Before I hand it over to Dave, let me just say that, yes, we had a record night. There was more than 4 million guests staying with hosts all over the world. And we're really encouraged that this is the biggest night we've had since the pandemic began.  And the one other thing I'll just say is that we have an incredibly adaptable model. So however, travel changes, we'll be able to meet that demand. But Dave, why don't we talk about what we're seeing right now?\nDavid Stephenson: A lot of the trends we're seeing in Q2 are consistent with some of the trends we saw in Q1 and Q4. People continue to be flexible. That's why we built all these flexible tools where because 40% of searchers are showing flexibility in either the date or location and people are traveling to more destinations and people are staying longer.  And one of the elements is that we're seeing the trends of long-term stays, which we highlighted as a key strength in Q1, stays of 28 days or longer, remain being one of the largest and strongest growing parts of our business. So that was 19% of our nights booked in Q2, following being 24% in Q1, just as the mix of short-term stays kind of rebounded strongly in Q2.  We've seen a strong increase in month-over-month performance across Q2. So April to May to June nights booked, all were strong leading in anticipation of the summer peak travel. Now in July, we've seen some of the pullback in demand, but it's likely due to summer peak and possibly [Indiscernible] to the Delta variant. But all of those lead to still being the Q3 revenue, the nights that people stay and the revenue that we recognize will be the strongest ever. And concurrently, our profit in Q3 will be the strongest ever.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Brian, as a follow-up to the product announcement that you had, I think this was late May when you hosted that session, and it seems like to me you're giving consumers broader recommendations. And if this is really successful, hopefully, it's something that they really didn't know that they even really wanted.  So I know it's probably really early, but anything you can share in terms of what their response has been? Are they delighted with what you're showing them? Or do you still think you have some tinkering that you need to do?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Stephen -- yes, Stephen, thanks. It's a great question. Let me like preface this by saying the following. There's been a major paradigm shift in how people search for travel on the Internet. Before the pandemic, the way search was on the Internet for travel was the vast, vast majority of people came to a website, a travel website, typically an OTA, and they would type in a location. They have a location in mind, and they go to date, and they check -- type a date to check-in, and a date to check-out.  So this is really fixed search. People know where they're going to go. With the pandemic, I think it's safe to say the world is never going back to the way it was, and that means travel isn't going back to the way it was. And the way travel is evolving is that people because they're able to work more remotely, they're more flexible. And what we are seeing, Stephen, is that 40% of our guests have flexibility about where or when they travel. And to give you one example of one of the things we've done, flexible dates. We have a couple of flexible date features. We have a feature that you can tap, I'm flexible, and you can say I'm looking for a place for a weekend, a week or a month, sometime in the next few months. And what we have seen is with our flexible date feature, it's being used more than 500 million times. This is a feature that's been used 0.5 billion times since we launched this feature in the beginning of the year.  We've also seen a very big uptick in the use of flexible destinations as well, where people -- if they're flexible about where they travel, we can recommend them to where to go. Now these features are really important. The reason they're really important isn't just because this is the paradigm shift and how people are searching for travel, but it's also important because this means that we can point demand to where we have supply. And this is a major, major shift for our business.  And so we are going to continue to tweak the products. When you have hundreds of millions of data points on a feature, you learn, and we're continually innovating. But I will also just say that this is just the very beginning because our team is not going to rest on their laurels. We are working really, really hard to continue to offer more flexibility to guests and continue to be able to inspire them and point them to where we have available supply.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Great. Just on the work-from-anywhere trends you were just mentioning, Brian, can you provide anything you're seeing in sort of the shoulder season that kind of gives you confidence? Are you seeing any improvement there? And then on the yield management capabilities, you're providing the host of the new tools, any of that providing the ADR uplift?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Dave, actually, you want to take these questions?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Maybe I'll start with the yield management. The majority of the ADR uplift that we're seeing is being driven by mix. It continues to be mix. The strength of our rebound has been in North America and Europe. Those have higher ADRs. It's been in nonurban, which is higher ADR than urban and in larger kind of whole home, larger homes. So the majority of the ADR has been driven by that. To a lesser extent, a newer trend that we saw in Q2 was the impact of some pricing pressure in peak markets that are highly constrained for the summer, but that was still [Indiscernible] minority relative to the overall mix. So ADR is not really being driven by features.  Over time, our ADR on a revenue to gross booking value adjusted basis where you line them up at the same time of booking has been very consistent. Over time, I think there are opportunities for us to increase our monetization through new opportunities, whether that be test travel insurance, maybe promoted listings or other things that we could do, but we don't see those as perishable opportunities as they are kind of evergreen opportunities.  And instead, what we're focusing on right now, as Brian has talked about, is the travel rebound and making sure that we are addressing the needs of travelers today. And their needs today are the additional flexibility that they have in where and when they travel. So 40% of our searches in Q2 actually had flexible dates or flexible destinations, which is why we built those tools and capabilities and seeing that strength.  And so in terms of the work-from-anywhere trends, I think that we're seeing people are continuing to find Airbnb is the best place for them to be able to both live and work. And one of the things that we launched in Q2 is directly in response to people's demand there. It sounds small, but I think it's a really unique item, which is it allows hosts to measure the speed of their WiFi and then actually post it on their listing. And that's because guests were wanting to know how easy will it be for me to -- how good is the WiFi here? Can I work from this location? So I think that's kind of a unique small element that can just show us how we're innovating in order to kind of support these broader travel trends.  So what we do know is just that people are incrementally more flexible. If we can a take 1-hour Zoom call on a Thursday, you're likely to be able to do a longer weekend with the family than maybe historically you've been kind of struck in the office to kind of go do. And so we believe that all of these kind of trends will just continue to accrete to Airbnb and be tailwinds to our business going forward.\nBrian Chesky: And I'll just add one more really interesting fact. Not long ago, we did a contest online, on social, a contest that allowed people to apply to be able to live on Airbnb. And to be able to be part of this contest, you have to fill out an application and it takes a while to fill out. We got 315,000 applications for people wanting to live on Airbnb, 315,000. And I think what this says is that travel is never going to be the same again because it's completely opened up now.  When we started Airbnb, like stays of longer than a month really wasn't a major part of our business. It really wasn't a major use case for us to be able to serve. But flexibility is now a permanent part of travel. It's just a permanent part now because it's all we have to believe is that Zoom is here to stay. And if we believe that Zoom is here to stay, we believe that flexibility in remote living is here to stay. And therefore, it's pretty obvious that what would happen is that we are going to continue to see more and more longer-term stays. And I think this is going to help us smooth out our seasonality over the coming years to come.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: So you guys mentioned some slowdown in the nights booked in the third quarter. Just wanted to get some color on how that looks like. Maybe can you talk about July and how it compared to the second quarter? And how does this look across different regions? Is it more pronounced in the U.S. versus Europe? Or are they about the same?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take this one?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. I mean, again, what we saw in Q2 is very strong bookings growth in advance of the third quarter kind of pre-travel season. We saw this kind of in the depths of COVID in 2020 as well. People are wanting to travel. They want to get out of their homes, and they especially want to do that in the summer. And so we saw a lot of peak travel demand coming in Q2. So as we exit Q2 and come into Q3, we have a combination of fewer bookings for the fall, just given the nature of some of the seasonality and any kind of impact potentially on COVID concerns going into early Q3.  So we're not seeing a substantial deceleration. Always identified in the outlook is that our nights and experiences booked in Q3 will be lower than in Q2, given just the extreme strength that we saw in the business in Q2, but we continue to be very bullish on the business. As I said, the revenue that we're going to have in Q3 will be the highest ever, while the profits are going to be the highest ever. And so the business remains very strong. And what we've seen is that people want to travel, and they are really resilient in finding ways to travel. One of the benefits that we see with Airbnb is that you don't actually have to hop on a plane always or cross a border in order to travel with Airbnb. The big part of our strength has been in nights with less than 300 miles, that continues to be one of the strongest parts of our business. And then in Q2, we saw strengthening where the faster parts are growing was growing of 300 miles longer, and we saw an increase of urban nights booked. And so some of those trends have continue -- started to pick up to more kind of historic levels. So I'm very bullish on the long-term view of our business overall.\nNaved Khan: Got it. And maybe just a clarification on this, maybe slowdown with the Delta variant COVID spreading, is this possible that with people getting more cautious and maybe having or wanting to optionality to maybe cancel even last minute. Could that be delivering some demand away to maybe more like traditional hotel types where you could cancel like literally the day before or something like that?\nDavid Stephenson: Again, we feel like the ability for Airbnb to provide the kinds of stays and experiences that people desire all around the world, it remains incredibly strong. We've been the best way for people to kind of travel and live through Airbnb throughout the pandemic. And I think that the tailwinds that we've talked about, the tailwinds of flexibility, the tailwinds of people staying longer, the tailwinds of even how people are traveling for business in the future are always that they will travel more likely with Airbnb for the longer term. These travel trends are directly supporting the strength of Airbnb's business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: We want to ask about the growth you're seeing in Hosts, maybe particularly -- in particular high-demand locations. Any way to characterize the new Hosts who are coming online, maybe the level of professionalism -- professionalization, maybe is a better word -- versus the rest of your base? And how much of their calendar they're making available to you? Are these pros or are these people who are looking at doing this seasonally or opportunistically? Just trying to get a feel for that.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you, Brian, for the question. Dave, before I hand over to you, let me just kind of recap a couple of high-level things about our host community. Number one, we have more than 4 million Hosts. 90% of them are individuals, and most of them couldn't have hosted, if not for the tools we provide. And what we saw in Q2 was that we had the fastest listing growth where we had demand. And the reason why is because we have individual hosts, as they get booked, word of mouth typically increases and they often tell their friends. But the other thing that we've often seen is that as more guests become flexible, we're able to point demand where you have supply.  Now specific to your question about the nature of the host that we did add in Q2 and whether they were individuals or professionals, Dave, do you want to take that?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, we continue to see 90% of our Hosts are individual Hosts, and that remains to be the case. So as we continue to add new individuals, and this is where we focus on, we focus our tools and capabilities to uniquely enable individual Hosts to be successful in hosting Airbnb. And when they come on Airbnb, the vast majority of their listings are unique to Airbnb, and that has remained the case in Q2 where the vast majority of our new Hosts coming on are also individuals.  That's our focus, but -- so we're going to build the tools and capabilities, and those are the results that we're continuing to see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Great. And nice to see the progress on listings growth. But first off, just in terms of the trend in ADRs and the commentary in the letter, is that something -- is the moderation there? Is that something you're already seeing in terms of bookings? Or is this more of a seasonal trend you expect to happen as summer holidays give way to a different profile of travel?  And then, secondly, on the EBITDA margins, should we think about the sustainability of those in context of a step function higher from this point? Or are there other investments in the quarters a year ahead that will moderate some of that near-term leverage we're seeing?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take one of these?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. On the trend in ADR, again, the vast majority of the ADR has been driven by mix. And so as other parts of the mix towards urban and maybe towards Latin America and Asia changes and reverts to more historic levels, we will see ADRs moderate, but that will be purely as part of mix and as the other parts of the business come back and they have that lower overall kind of ADR rates.  So the strength of North America and Europe, we believe to continue to remain strong. And then as other parts of the business come back then the mix comes out and the ADRs moderate. So that's all we're kind of indicating.  And in terms of the EBITDA margins, I think we're all -- we're proud of the progress we're making in EBITDA and that accelerating towards our long term. We've stated that we could achieve 30% or more EBITDA margins over time. Clearly, we've accelerated our way there. I think that a piece of that is clearly the improvements we've done on fixed costs, marketing costs, improvements in our variable costs.  We also see some benefits on the higher ADR rates as well. And so over time, we will see some variation in our EBITDA margins kind of over time, but I think what we've demonstrated is the capability to dramatically expand those margins. And I think it just proves the point that we've kind of talked about more verbally, which is we can achieve this 30% margin or more. And now we're actually showing how we can do that.\nBrian Chesky: And I think the one thing I'll just add on -- the one thing I'd just add on, the efficiency of our business. And we've said this in the letter. I also mentioned this in the opening comments. But COVID was a crucible moment for the company. And in that moment, this company, we've gotten significantly more disciplined and much more efficient. And I think that we've all seen the incredible benefits and focus because we've put our very best people on the most important problems in the company.  And because what we've seen does not only have margins improved but actually, we're able to move much more quickly. We can pivot, and I think this explains why we were able to announce and launch more than 100 upgrades on the heels of our IPO in time for the travel season. And so I think that you're going to see a continued acceleration of product innovation because of our discipline and because of our focus.  These are lessons that we will never ever forget. These are lessons that will leave indelible marks for this company.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJustin Patterson: Great. With flexible dates rolling out, how has the booking window changed? Are there more instances of last minute stays coming into play? And then the second question, you provided a lot more value to Hosts this year. Conceptually, how are you thinking about factors behind when the right time it is to increase take rate?\nBrian Chesky: Thank you for the question. So why don't -- Justin, why don't, Dave, I take the second question around take rate for Hosts, and then you can take the first question about flexible dates and how that has affected the booking window.  So with regards to factors to be able to increase take rate, as -- and I'll kind of say what Dave said before, we think there's -- one -- our guiding principle is that we want to make sure that every single year, we are providing incrementally more value to hosts than we're charging them because the name of the game is to make sure that our really strong business model continues to grow, and that means that hosts feel like they have the very best opportunity to host on Airbnb. We want them to always feel like we're giving them more value than we're taking away -- so taking. So that's number one.  Number two, I do think there's a lot of opportunities for us to be able to increase take rate. And if we do that, I think the way we would think about that is by charging for some incremental services that we can provide for hosts. And the more that hosts really rely on Airbnb to be able to continue to grow their business, the more we think they're going to be willing to be able to buy or participate in new services and offerings. But the way we think about this is a nonperishable opportunity.  So as Dave said, we have a number of years in front of us where we can continue to look at offering new services. But what we have focused on this year is this unprecedented travel rebound that's upon us. And so we've worked really, really hard to simplify the guest experience to introduce more flexibility for guests to make it much easier for hosts to come on the platform so that we get thousands and thousands more hosts in time for the travel season.  So with that, I don't know if, Dave, you want to talk about the booking window for flexible dates.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. What we saw in Q2 is actually a fairly stable booking new window in line with our Q2 of 2019. It was actually a little bit shorter booking window than Q1 of this year, but that's largely been due to seasonality.  So yes, you're right, that during COVID, we've seen variations in booking windows where last year in COVID, the booking windows would shorten when people felt more only would book when they felt more confident in staying. But it's interesting, in Q2, the booking window has been consistent with more historic levels.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJustin Post: A couple of questions. You mentioned a lot of positive trends for the company. I wonder if you have any thoughts on the market opportunity or the TAM for alternative accommodations versus hotel nights, is that changing? And do you think alternative accommodations is growing? Maybe any thoughts also on your opportunity within hotel bookings. And then second, I'll take a swing at this. Any updates on actual supply metrics like Hosts or active listings? Or is that something we'll get once a year?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. On the latter, on supply metrics, I think we've highlighted what's really important. Remember that we do not need to grow supply one-to-one for revenue growth. And why is that? It's because we have millions of listings all around the world. And what we need to do is have the right listing for the right guest at the right time. And as people continue to get more flexible on when and where they travel as we get better focusing those hosts on the flexible locations and dates that they have in mind, we're going to get better at utilizing the supply we have all around the world.  But what we have highlighted is that when there is great demand in specific areas, and that was in North America and Europe nonurban, we are very effective at growing at supply, and that's what we saw in Q2. We had some of the strongest growth of our supply specifically in the areas of our strongest areas of demand. And we do that both organically and then inorganically through all the actions that Brian talked about, about making inspiring hosts and what the benefits are being of hosted or being a host, talking to them about how they can make it easier for them to host and then having existing Hosts help new Hosts be successful. So those are all the ways that we'll be driving it.  So I think we will be talking about listing infrequently as it is helpful to guide the overall direction of the business, but not as a routine measure because it's not the primary driver of revenue growth. In terms of TAM for alternatives versus hotels, if you really think about Airbnb, it's -- we're not just a travel company. We're -- if it's all about travel and living. And really, any kind of stay, any kind of accommodation, really short of kind of a full year lease can be accommodated in Airbnb. And that's what we're seeing with the fact that we're seeing such strong growth in stays of 28 days or longer. And that, that was 19% of nights in Q2.  And we highlighted in the letter the fact that even the nights of 7 days or longer were 50% of our nights. And so that is not hotels. Hotels average much lower, maybe 1 to 2 nights on average. We're going to be 4-plus, and 50% of our nights were of 7 days or longer. So clearly, during this time period, we have taken share from traditional accommodations.  And I think that a lot of these changes that we've talked about on the call today, the increased flexibility of how people are traveling and living, I think that just actually increases the overall TAM of what Airbnb is able to address because if you're going to be staying longer, if you're going to have more flexibility, you're much more likely to want to stay in a hosted Airbnb with the amenities that you have in Airbnb versus being in a hotel room.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, and I'll just kind of just add to that just a little bit. In addition to long-term stays, which is essentially an entirely new category that is not even really traveling, it's living, which has, I think, been significantly expanded by COVID, you have a number of other dynamics happening. People are traveling to many more locations. And oftentimes, people are now traveling to places that don't even have hotels. So that would explain some expansion of TAM there. There's also a general shift from business travel to leisure travel because we think that as fewer people travel for business in their home, they're going to have a greater desire to travel for leisure. And Airbnb obviously is a disproportionately offering new to travel.  And again, over the course of the pandemic, many people, millions of people, in fact, have tried Airbnb for the first time. And the most important thing about growth for Airbnb is you just got to try it because our retention is really strong.  And I think what this says is that Airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel. I think the term alternative accommodations might be a dated term because maybe it was appropriate 10 years ago. 10 years ago, the TAM was significantly smaller. If you see what it is today, just imagine what it could be 10 years from now. And that's what we're focused on is continually increasing the market by continually adding more categories of travel we can offer and making sure that more people know about this, the new way of traveling.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho.\nJames Lee: On the Hosts acquisition side, obviously, you guys did a lot of upgrades there and did a great job ramping up listings in the quarter. And just curious, what other areas of Hosts acquisition are you looking to improve kind of going forward? And also secondly, in APAC, where you are more dependent on cross-border travel, how are you making any adjustments there to shift your demand to these domestic states?\nBrian Chesky: James, I'll answer the first question, and Dave can answer the second question about APAC. So with regards to host acquisition, there's a number of things we've done. One of the things you mentioned is making it easier to host. And so what we've done, as I said, is we've reduced the number of steps to 10 really simple steps to become a host. And this means that now the amount of time it takes to be able to list on Airbnb is reduced in half.  Now this is a really, really big deal because the thing we know is that the easier you make a conversion funnel, the more people get through the funnel. And we're talking about very small optimizations could yield thousands and thousands of new hosts. But in addition to that, we've also been increasing the top of funnel. We've been doing a brand marketing campaign. The company -- our Made Possible by Hosts campaign, to target and recruit more Hosts and what we've seen in the 5 countries where we've run this campaign, traffic to the Hosts -- to become a host page has more than doubled. And so this has worked really, really well.  And finally, one of the things that Dave mentioned is, number one, we got to make sure we get a host in the funnel. Number two, we have to reduce the number of steps. But three, we want to make sure that we provide help if anyone has any questions about hosting.  And so we've created is a host ambassador program. We have many of our Superhosts who now are able to provide assistance to a new host. So when they go through the funnel, they go through the conversion flow to become a host. If they have a question, we say, \"Hey, would you like to talk to a Superhost?\" And so we find that one of the strongest factors we've seen, our Hosts recruiting other Hosts. And this is in addition to the fact that the bigger we grow and the bigger our guest base, the more that we get host because many of our guests also become host. In fact, the #1 source of new host are prior guests. Over 30% of our Hosts were guests, and that number is continually increasing.  So these are some of the things we're doing to continue to increase the number of Hosts around the world. And obviously, we're going to continue to do a lot more in the coming years ahead. Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. In regards to APAC, I mean it's amazing how resilient the domestic business has been all around the world. So we're actually seeing have seen strength in domestic business in all regions. I think the issue has been in Asia and Latin America have typically been more reliant on outbound and international travel to come back. And so -- but the domestic business is within those countries has actually been quite strong. So we're very happy with the performance of domestic. We just need more borders to open for those businesses to return to kind of pre-pandemic levels.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: I was curious if you could just talk a little bit about Europe in more detail and kind of what you're seeing in that region and any other observations you have as it relates to cross-border?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Europe, what we've seen over the last several months is that the pent-up demand that people have had to travel, it kind of varies a bit by the travel restrictions within those countries. We saw increase in the people's willingness to book in Q2, they were ready for their summer travel. And we saw a particular kind of strength in areas of Spain and France throughout the year, throughout the quarter as people want to kind of travel for the summer season. So I don't have much more to say about Europe than kind of what we've included in the letter here.\nBrent Thill: Dave, did you see -- when you're talking about all the decel, did you see EMEA drop off more or less? Was this consistent across regions when you saw a little bit of a pullback that you've been talking about?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, again, the pullback we're seeing has been -- is incredibly modest. I really don't want to overstate it. I mean what we're seeing is that Q2 was incredibly strong as people want to travel for Q3 and that our stays in Q3 are incredibly strong, which is driving our strength in revenue and why we articulated that Q3 revenue and profit will be the highest ever. So all that is incredibly strong.  And then it is -- we're kind of waiting and seeing to see what the rest of the impact of travel expectations are in Q3 for the back half of the year. So I don't really have much more that I can share.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: The first one, on listings. You guys grew that sequentially this quarter. So just trying to think through where the scores of new license growth will come over the next few quarters. Is there a component of, say, like urban and cross-border listings that were deactivated during the pandemic that will be reactivated as mobile travel resumes? Any color there?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean if you think about it, we have 4 million Hosts around the world. 90% of those are individual Hosts. Then the vast majority of those individual Hosts lists only on Airbnb. And most of their listings are their own personal property or maybe a second home that they have.  And so I think one of the benefits we have is that people don't get rid of their primary home and not always their secondary home just because of the near-term impacts of what we're seeing with COVID. And so I think that fact, that resilience of our individual hosts is what's leading to the fact that we have had stable overall listings growth. I think that's why we're quite proud about it in Q1 and then while we're seeing increases from Q1 to Q2 in the areas where we have the most demand.  And so as people are ready to travel back to urban locations and as people are going back to the kind of the historic strengths of Airbnb, our Hosts are ready to and bring them back. And I think that's been the power. The inverse could have easily been true, where if you're more reliant on professional Hosts, they may be delisting, not ready for the travel rebound and not ready to accept our guests. That's not the case of Airbnb. Our Airbnb Hosts are ready to accept travelers whenever they're ready to travel.\nBrian Chesky: And I think the key point, again, is that we've seen, as demand in markets increase, supply in those markets correspondingly increase.\nMario Lu: Got it. And just a quick follow-up. In terms of the Hosts campaign, you guys mentioned there's early signs of success there. Anything to talk about in terms of existing Hosts and whether there's any actions on your end to kind of retain them to prevent competitors from onboarding them to their platforms as well?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I can just share and, Dave, if you're going to add as well. Number one, what we've seen is that the vast majority of Hosts on Airbnb, because they're individuals, what they really just want to do is make sure they get enough bookings to fill their calendar, and we found that we can get them enough bookings to fill their calendar. That's not been a problem this year.  And the other thing about our Hosts is they care about the quality of guest on Airbnb. Because these are mostly people's real homes, their primary home or their secondary home, they care a lot about who's in their home. And we provide a huge amount of trust and safety features and protocols to be able to give them peace of mind. And this is what they tell us. And we've really also worked on providing best-in-class customer service.  For example, on May 24, one of the things we announced is the dedicated Superhosts line. This is something that our very best host, our Superhosts, have been asking for. And I think the reception was very, very positive. And so in addition to investing in our hosts, one of the most important thing we can do is to continue and invest in our Superhosts. And if we continue to invest in our Superhosts, there will be no reason for them to list anywhere else.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The Superhosts program is really -- that is a loyalty program for Hosts, right? And that's why we continue to invest. Those are our best Hosts. We have over 800,000 around the world. I think that's really key. And then, actually, what we've seen with our Hosts churn has actually decreased from what we saw pre-COVID. So it was lower in 2020 than it was in 2019, and it's lower in 2021 than it was in 2020. So we'd be overall can certainly continue to actually decline right now.\nOperator: And your next question line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. A quick one. Can you just give us an update on where your revenue take rate is today as a percentage of GPV just given all the timing differences? It's hard to tell from the outside where that is.\nBrian Chesky: Kevin, Dave can take this.\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Our take rate has actually been very consistent. So if you time adjust our revenue to gross booking value, the take rate is approximately 15%, and it's been very stable during -- so when you time adjust it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe.\nDeepak Mathivanan: I wanted to ask about how you think about the travel demand trends. I know there's COVID uncertainty near term. But as you think about the sustained benefit of pent-up travel demand, there's still a lot of unspent travel dollars out there even in markets where we've seen good recovery like U.S. and parts of Europe.  So as you think about second half and then even into 2022, do you think this incremental benefit that we're seeing near term from pent-up travel demand likely to sustain? Or you think we'll go through a period where the activity rebound to normal travel levels and the recovery moderates to some extent? Not looking for any specific guidance, but curious to hear your thoughts on how you think about this.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thank you very much, Deepak. I think I can maybe take this at a high level. And Dave, feel free to chime in as well. I think there's been a number of lessons from this pandemic. And I think one of the general lessons is we tend to appreciate things more when they're taken away from us. And I think that not everything that was taken away from us during the pandemic did people appreciate. But I think that travel was one of the things that people miss the most from the pandemic.  In fact, we did surveys of travelers around the world, and travel was the out-of-home activity that people miss the most. They missed it more than going to sport events, more than going to restaurants, out-of-home dining and other opportunities. And we think that we've not even obviously tapped into the pent-up demand because, obviously, not everyone has been able to travel.  And also remember that before the pandemic, about 50 -- just almost 50% of our business, was cross-border travel and urban travel. There hasn't been nearly the cross-border travel recovery yet that is possible in the coming year. So I think what we're going to see is you can only imagine that as things get more under control in the coming travel seasons, people will once again be more comfortable crossing borders, but will be different this time is that people will have flexibility they didn't have before.  And so I think that we're very, very bullish about the future for cross-border travel. A lot of people haven't left their country in quite a long time, and we think they're going to desire to do so. And this is in addition to many new opportunities to be able to travel the city.  So I think there's a lot of reason to be extremely optimistic in the coming years about what's going to happen to travel. There's many things that may not come back to levels before the pandemic. But one thing I think we know for certain is that travel will, and it will probably be bigger than ever. Dave, do you want to add anything else?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I guess I just will add that, remember, that we're not really just a travel company. We are about stays of any kind. And I think we talked about a lot on the call today, the fact of the trends of 28-day stays and longer, even 7 days and longer, the flexibility that people have when they travel, the fact that travel and living is blurring, I think all of these are kind of incremental ways in which people will travel and can travel on Airbnb.  And so clearly, there's this pent-up demand, and people are yearning to travel again. But I just think all of these other tailwinds of travel trends are really benefiting our business over the long term.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson with Loop Capital.\nRobert Sanderson: Great. Question for Brian. So this year, you've been very clear in your focus and that's, of course, to position for recovery. So you'll basically be 2 years now when we finally get through this where your priorities have been shifted and dislocated. So how would you expect to focus to shift as we get back to this new normal?  I know development of experiences was really hamstrung and put on hold. But what are some of the more important focus areas that you would like to be spending time on? Or what's -- and maybe how the pandemic may have shifted those goals from what they may have been otherwise?\nBrian Chesky: It's a great question, Rob. I think there's 4 things. Number one, I think what the pandemic has shown in this travel recovery that is upon us is that I think the opportunity, number one, for our core business is probably greater than anyone ever really imagined before the pandemic. And part of this is just because, again, more people are traveling to more locations, many of which don't even have hotels, millions of people have been introduced to Airbnb. And I think as cross-border and urban travel recover, you're going to see the huge amount of strength in our core.  So number one, we have a lot of opportunity in our core, and I want to make sure our team is really focused. Number two, as we said, long-term stays is a huge boon to our business. This is an entire category of travel that really wasn't -- didn't really exist when Joe, Nate and I started this company more than 13 years ago. But I think there's this entire new category of travel where travel and living is blurring, so that will be number two.  Three, you mentioned experiences. We thought last year could be a breakout year for experiences. Obviously, the opposite happened. We had to put the product on pause. But I think that people are going to be yearning for experiences. And the reason why is a very simple one.  I think people are yearning to have a meaningful experience. I think you can only sit at home and watch Netflix or streaming services for so many nights in a row before you actually want to get out of house and do something and be with other people. And I think there's going to be a huge amount of pent-up demand for people having authentic experiences all over the world.  And then finally, number four, I think there's a huge number of opportunities to unlock more hosting. We are now living in a world where there's still great economic distress all over the world. And take one example, women have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. And 55% of our Hosts are women all over the world. And so we think there's a huge opportunity to continue to unlock more hosting. And we're going to take guidance from the creativity of our community.  When we started the Airbnb, it was really just a way to rent your living room or your bedroom, but our Hosts and their creativity started listing entire homes. And not only did they list entire homes, they started listing castles and boats and tree houses. And so we're going to continue to take guidance from our host community as well, and they will continue to point the way towards where we go, and we're going to continue to innovate to unlock more hosting.  So those are some of our priorities. The good news is they're not really different. It's what we've always been focused on. I think it's just a renewed focus on our core, this amazing new opportunity around long-term stays. We're continuing to double down on experiences, and we'll continue to unlock hosting.  We do all those things. And I think we're going to look back on this is still the very early innings of a much, much bigger business. We're 13 years old, but I think -- as a Founder, I say you don't raise a 13-year old to be a great 14-year-old. You raise them to be a great adult many years from now. And I think that there's a lot of opportunities in this coming decade for us.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Brian Chesky for final remarks.\nBrian Chesky: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I just wanted to say, once again, it was -- we're very, very proud of the results for this quarter. I think what this proves is that number one, our model is inherently adaptable. We can adapt to the changing use cases of guests, and that's because we have hosted nearly every community offering nearly any type of space at every price point.  And number two, we're continuing to focus on product innovation. We're going to continue to build new products. And these 2 things, I think, have demonstrated that this pandemic, as hard as it's been for us and hard as it's been for everyone all around the world, it's made us a stronger, more efficient and a better company. And we are prepared for what's to come and for the future of travel and the future of living.  So with that, thank you all very much for joining us today. We'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "A lot of the trends we're seeing in Q2 are consistent with some of the trends we saw in Q1 and Q4. People continue to be flexible. That's why we built all these flexible tools where because 40% of searchers are showing flexibility in either the date or location and people are traveling to more destinations and people are staying longer.  And one of the elements is that we're seeing the trends of long-term stays, which we highlighted as a key strength in Q1, stays of 28 days or longer, remain being one of the largest and strongest growing parts of our business. So that was 19% of our nights booked in Q2, following being 24% in Q1, just as the mix of short-term stays kind of rebounded strongly in Q2.  We've seen a strong increase in month-over-month performance across Q2. So April to May to June nights booked, all were strong leading in anticipation of the summer peak travel. Now in July, we've seen some of the pullback in demand, but it's likely due to summer peak and possibly [Indiscernible] to the Delta variant. But all of those lead to still being the Q3 revenue, the nights that people stay and the revenue that we recognize will be the strongest ever. And concurrently, our profit in Q3 will be the strongest ever. Sure. Maybe I'll start with the yield management. The majority of the ADR uplift that we're seeing is being driven by mix. It continues to be mix. The strength of our rebound has been in North America and Europe. Those have higher ADRs. It's been in nonurban, which is higher ADR than urban and in larger kind of whole home, larger homes. So the majority of the ADR has been driven by that. To a lesser extent, a newer trend that we saw in Q2 was the impact of some pricing pressure in peak markets that are highly constrained for the summer, but that was still [Indiscernible] minority relative to the overall mix. So ADR is not really being driven by features.  Over time, our ADR on a revenue to gross booking value adjusted basis where you line them up at the same time of booking has been very consistent. Over time, I think there are opportunities for us to increase our monetization through new opportunities, whether that be test travel insurance, maybe promoted listings or other things that we could do, but we don't see those as perishable opportunities as they are kind of evergreen opportunities.  And instead, what we're focusing on right now, as Brian has talked about, is the travel rebound and making sure that we are addressing the needs of travelers today. And their needs today are the additional flexibility that they have in where and when they travel. So 40% of our searches in Q2 actually had flexible dates or flexible destinations, which is why we built those tools and capabilities and seeing that strength.  And so in terms of the work-from-anywhere trends, I think that we're seeing people are continuing to find Airbnb is the best place for them to be able to both live and work. And one of the things that we launched in Q2 is directly in response to people's demand there. It sounds small, but I think it's a really unique item, which is it allows hosts to measure the speed of their WiFi and then actually post it on their listing. And that's because guests were wanting to know how easy will it be for me to -- how good is the WiFi here? Can I work from this location? So I think that's kind of a unique small element that can just show us how we're innovating in order to kind of support these broader travel trends.  So what we do know is just that people are incrementally more flexible. If we can a take 1-hour Zoom call on a Thursday, you're likely to be able to do a longer weekend with the family than maybe historically you've been kind of struck in the office to kind of go do. And so we believe that all of these kind of trends will just continue to accrete to Airbnb and be tailwinds to our business going forward. Sure. I mean, again, what we saw in Q2 is very strong bookings growth in advance of the third quarter kind of pre-travel season. We saw this kind of in the depths of COVID in 2020 as well. People are wanting to travel. They want to get out of their homes, and they especially want to do that in the summer. And so we saw a lot of peak travel demand coming in Q2. So as we exit Q2 and come into Q3, we have a combination of fewer bookings for the fall, just given the nature of some of the seasonality and any kind of impact potentially on COVID concerns going into early Q3.  So we're not seeing a substantial deceleration. Always identified in the outlook is that our nights and experiences booked in Q3 will be lower than in Q2, given just the extreme strength that we saw in the business in Q2, but we continue to be very bullish on the business. As I said, the revenue that we're going to have in Q3 will be the highest ever, while the profits are going to be the highest ever. And so the business remains very strong. And what we've seen is that people want to travel, and they are really resilient in finding ways to travel. One of the benefits that we see with Airbnb is that you don't actually have to hop on a plane always or cross a border in order to travel with Airbnb. The big part of our strength has been in nights with less than 300 miles, that continues to be one of the strongest parts of our business. And then in Q2, we saw strengthening where the faster parts are growing was growing of 300 miles longer, and we saw an increase of urban nights booked. And so some of those trends have continue -- started to pick up to more kind of historic levels. So I'm very bullish on the long-term view of our business overall. Again, we feel like the ability for Airbnb to provide the kinds of stays and experiences that people desire all around the world, it remains incredibly strong. We've been the best way for people to kind of travel and live through Airbnb throughout the pandemic. And I think that the tailwinds that we've talked about, the tailwinds of flexibility, the tailwinds of people staying longer, the tailwinds of even how people are traveling for business in the future are always that they will travel more likely with Airbnb for the longer term. These travel trends are directly supporting the strength of Airbnb's business. Yes, we continue to see 90% of our Hosts are individual Hosts, and that remains to be the case. So as we continue to add new individuals, and this is where we focus on, we focus our tools and capabilities to uniquely enable individual Hosts to be successful in hosting Airbnb. And when they come on Airbnb, the vast majority of their listings are unique to Airbnb, and that has remained the case in Q2 where the vast majority of our new Hosts coming on are also individuals.  That's our focus, but -- so we're going to build the tools and capabilities, and those are the results that we're continuing to see. Sure. On the trend in ADR, again, the vast majority of the ADR has been driven by mix. And so as other parts of the mix towards urban and maybe towards Latin America and Asia changes and reverts to more historic levels, we will see ADRs moderate, but that will be purely as part of mix and as the other parts of the business come back and they have that lower overall kind of ADR rates.  So the strength of North America and Europe, we believe to continue to remain strong. And then as other parts of the business come back then the mix comes out and the ADRs moderate. So that's all we're kind of indicating.  And in terms of the EBITDA margins, I think we're all -- we're proud of the progress we're making in EBITDA and that accelerating towards our long term. We've stated that we could achieve 30% or more EBITDA margins over time. Clearly, we've accelerated our way there. I think that a piece of that is clearly the improvements we've done on fixed costs, marketing costs, improvements in our variable costs.  We also see some benefits on the higher ADR rates as well. And so over time, we will see some variation in our EBITDA margins kind of over time, but I think what we've demonstrated is the capability to dramatically expand those margins. And I think it just proves the point that we've kind of talked about more verbally, which is we can achieve this 30% margin or more. And now we're actually showing how we can do that. Yes. What we saw in Q2 is actually a fairly stable booking new window in line with our Q2 of 2019. It was actually a little bit shorter booking window than Q1 of this year, but that's largely been due to seasonality.  So yes, you're right, that during COVID, we've seen variations in booking windows where last year in COVID, the booking windows would shorten when people felt more only would book when they felt more confident in staying. But it's interesting, in Q2, the booking window has been consistent with more historic levels. Sure. On the latter, on supply metrics, I think we've highlighted what's really important. Remember that we do not need to grow supply one-to-one for revenue growth. And why is that? It's because we have millions of listings all around the world. And what we need to do is have the right listing for the right guest at the right time. And as people continue to get more flexible on when and where they travel as we get better focusing those hosts on the flexible locations and dates that they have in mind, we're going to get better at utilizing the supply we have all around the world.  But what we have highlighted is that when there is great demand in specific areas, and that was in North America and Europe nonurban, we are very effective at growing at supply, and that's what we saw in Q2. We had some of the strongest growth of our supply specifically in the areas of our strongest areas of demand. And we do that both organically and then inorganically through all the actions that Brian talked about, about making inspiring hosts and what the benefits are being of hosted or being a host, talking to them about how they can make it easier for them to host and then having existing Hosts help new Hosts be successful. So those are all the ways that we'll be driving it.  So I think we will be talking about listing infrequently as it is helpful to guide the overall direction of the business, but not as a routine measure because it's not the primary driver of revenue growth. In terms of TAM for alternatives versus hotels, if you really think about Airbnb, it's -- we're not just a travel company. We're -- if it's all about travel and living. And really, any kind of stay, any kind of accommodation, really short of kind of a full year lease can be accommodated in Airbnb. And that's what we're seeing with the fact that we're seeing such strong growth in stays of 28 days or longer. And that, that was 19% of nights in Q2.  And we highlighted in the letter the fact that even the nights of 7 days or longer were 50% of our nights. And so that is not hotels. Hotels average much lower, maybe 1 to 2 nights on average. We're going to be 4-plus, and 50% of our nights were of 7 days or longer. So clearly, during this time period, we have taken share from traditional accommodations.  And I think that a lot of these changes that we've talked about on the call today, the increased flexibility of how people are traveling and living, I think that just actually increases the overall TAM of what Airbnb is able to address because if you're going to be staying longer, if you're going to have more flexibility, you're much more likely to want to stay in a hosted Airbnb with the amenities that you have in Airbnb versus being in a hotel room. Yes. In regards to APAC, I mean it's amazing how resilient the domestic business has been all around the world. So we're actually seeing have seen strength in domestic business in all regions. I think the issue has been in Asia and Latin America have typically been more reliant on outbound and international travel to come back. And so -- but the domestic business is within those countries has actually been quite strong. So we're very happy with the performance of domestic. We just need more borders to open for those businesses to return to kind of pre-pandemic levels. Yes. Europe, what we've seen over the last several months is that the pent-up demand that people have had to travel, it kind of varies a bit by the travel restrictions within those countries. We saw increase in the people's willingness to book in Q2, they were ready for their summer travel. And we saw a particular kind of strength in areas of Spain and France throughout the year, throughout the quarter as people want to kind of travel for the summer season. So I don't have much more to say about Europe than kind of what we've included in the letter here. Well, again, the pullback we're seeing has been -- is incredibly modest. I really don't want to overstate it. I mean what we're seeing is that Q2 was incredibly strong as people want to travel for Q3 and that our stays in Q3 are incredibly strong, which is driving our strength in revenue and why we articulated that Q3 revenue and profit will be the highest ever. So all that is incredibly strong.  And then it is -- we're kind of waiting and seeing to see what the rest of the impact of travel expectations are in Q3 for the back half of the year. So I don't really have much more that I can share. Yes. I mean if you think about it, we have 4 million Hosts around the world. 90% of those are individual Hosts. Then the vast majority of those individual Hosts lists only on Airbnb. And most of their listings are their own personal property or maybe a second home that they have.  And so I think one of the benefits we have is that people don't get rid of their primary home and not always their secondary home just because of the near-term impacts of what we're seeing with COVID. And so I think that fact, that resilience of our individual hosts is what's leading to the fact that we have had stable overall listings growth. I think that's why we're quite proud about it in Q1 and then while we're seeing increases from Q1 to Q2 in the areas where we have the most demand.  And so as people are ready to travel back to urban locations and as people are going back to the kind of the historic strengths of Airbnb, our Hosts are ready to and bring them back. And I think that's been the power. The inverse could have easily been true, where if you're more reliant on professional Hosts, they may be delisting, not ready for the travel rebound and not ready to accept our guests. That's not the case of Airbnb. Our Airbnb Hosts are ready to accept travelers whenever they're ready to travel. Yes. The Superhosts program is really -- that is a loyalty program for Hosts, right? And that's why we continue to invest. Those are our best Hosts. We have over 800,000 around the world. I think that's really key. And then, actually, what we've seen with our Hosts churn has actually decreased from what we saw pre-COVID. So it was lower in 2020 than it was in 2019, and it's lower in 2021 than it was in 2020. So we'd be overall can certainly continue to actually decline right now. Sure. Our take rate has actually been very consistent. So if you time adjust our revenue to gross booking value, the take rate is approximately 15%, and it's been very stable during -- so when you time adjust it. Yes. I guess I just will add that, remember, that we're not really just a travel company. We are about stays of any kind. And I think we talked about a lot on the call today, the fact of the trends of 28-day stays and longer, even 7 days and longer, the flexibility that people have when they travel, the fact that travel and living is blurring, I think all of these are kind of incremental ways in which people will travel and can travel on Airbnb.  And so clearly, there's this pent-up demand, and people are yearning to travel again. But I just think all of these other tailwinds of travel trends are really benefiting our business over the long term."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Ellie, and hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today. I'm dialing in from an Airbnb listing in Italy, and I'm very excited to share our Q2 results with you. Since the beginning of the year, we've been preparing for the travel rebound. After months of being stuck at home, millions of people have been yearning to travel, explore the world and connect with others. And we anticipated a travel rebound unlike any other in history.  And in Q1, we saw the start of this rebound. And now that Q2 is behind us, we can definitively say that the travel rebound is upon us, and Airbnb is leading the way. But as we predicted, travel is different than before. Airbnb has benefited from our adaptable business model, which is able to meet the changing needs of our guests. We haven't just been sitting passively around waiting for travel to return. For the past year, we've been relentlessly driving product innovations to meet this historic moment. And as a result, Airbnb has emerged from this crisis faster than others, and we're better positioned for the future of travel.  Now while we recognize the persistence of COVID and the Delta variant, we expect Q3 to be our strongest revenue quarter ever. The fact that we expect Q3 revenue to be our highest revenue quarter ever speaks to the inherent resiliency of our business.  So now turning to our Q2 results. As vaccination rates increased and travel restrictions lifted in Q2, we saw consistent strength in North America, followed by significant recovery in Europe. One year ago in Q2, our business was significantly impacted with the onset of COVID. Now like many others, our year-over-year comparison to 2020 does show a dramatic improvement. But what is most notable are our results relative to pre-COVID levels. Across all key metrics, we nearly met or exceeded our Q2 2019 performance. Q2 nights and experiences booked nearly tripled from a year ago. More importantly, Q2 nights and experiences booked nearly matched pre-COVID levels in 2019. Gross booking value of $13.4 billion, more than quadrupled from a year ago and also shot up above 2019 levels by 37% based on the recovery of nights, combined with the strength of our ADR. Meanwhile, Q2 revenue of $1.335 billion, also nearly quadrupled from a year ago, and it exceeded 2019 levels by 10%. What this demonstrates is an acceleration in our recovery from Q1. Our Q2 results not only demonstrate our leadership in the travel rebound, but also our continued operating discipline. Our adjusted EBITDA profit was $217 million. Now this represents a 16% EBITDA margin. This was more than $600 million of improvement in EBITDA from a year ago, and it represents 20% or 2,000 basis points margin expansion from 2019. And this is on a similar level of revenue. Now over the past year, as our top line recovered, we consistently focused on improving our profitability. For example, over the last 4 quarters, we've improved EBITDA margins on average more than 20% every quarter as compared to periods in 2019.  Now that is a 2,000 basis point improvement on average, every single quarter. And we've done this by improving our variable cost by driving up marketing efficiency and by very tightly managing our fixed cost. Now I'm really proud of these results. And what they demonstrate is that we are emerging from this crisis as a stronger and more efficient company.  Now turning to business highlights and travel trends. Despite the continued impact of COVID around the world, we have seen clear evidence that travel is recovering. We're incredibly encouraged by what we've seen in Q2. And what we've seen is an accelerating pace of global travel, particularly in Europe, as well as continued popularity of nonurban and domestic destinations.  In Q2, we had the highest number of gross nights booked of any quarter in our history. And we just had the biggest night on Airbnb since the pandemic began. Last Saturday night, more than 4 million guests from around the world, were staying in an Airbnb. That is more people than the entire population of Los Angeles. And we're also seeing travelers once again cross borders and business cities. These 2 categories of travel have been historic strengths of Airbnb, and we're really excited to see them begin to recover. But at the same time, the way that people travel and live continues to change. We believe that many of the new booking trends that emerge over the past year are here to stay. People are traveling to many more destinations than before. And when they travel, they're staying longer. We believe these 2 categories of travel are in fact here to stay. And as a result, what we focused on are product innovations that support these new ways that people travel. You see many people have a greater freedom about where and when they travel, and we've improved our product to better meet their needs. Our new search products offer guests the flexibility that they want when planning and booking trips. And finally, we're seeing more people around the world consider hosting. We ended Q2 with the largest number of active listings in Airbnb's history. Now there are a couple of reasons for this. First, our demand is driving supply. This is what's so powerful about our model. For example, in Q2, our highest supply growth was actually in high-demand destination. And second, our marketing and product initiatives have been really accelerating to support host recruitment, and they're working. So now let me go into a little more detail on what we've been doing to prepare for and support this travel recovery.  Now as a reminder, our single priority in 2021 has been to prepare for the travel rebound. To do this, we've been perfecting the end-to-end experience of our core service. And this includes 4 themes: first, educating the world about hosting; second, recruiting more hosts; third, simplifying the guest journey; and finally, delivering world-class service. So let me just briefly give you an update on how we're executing on each of these 4 areas.  So first, we\u2019re educating the world about what makes Airbnb different, and that is hosting. In Q1, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in 5 years, Made Possible by Hosts, and we expanded this campaign in Q2. We're educating guests about the benefits of being hosted, and we're also inspiring more people to become hosts.  Now we continue to be really encouraged by the result of this campaign in terms of traffic, first-time bookers, interest in hosting and brand favorability. Second, we are recruiting more hosts, and we are setting them up for success. On May 24, just a few months ago, we launched a completely redesigned host onboarding flow that makes it simpler for anyone to start hosting. This new flow has made it faster to become a host, which has helped drive our listings growth in Q2.  Third, we are simplifying every part of the guest experience. On May 24, we expanded the tools for guests to offer more flexibility when they're searching for a place to stay. We announced flexible dates, flexible destinations and flexible matching. And all 3 of these features are to support the new ways that guests are looking to plan and book trips. And finally, whenever our host or guests need us, we must deliver world-class service. So we recently launched a redesigned Help Center. We've more than tripled our supported languages, and we've updated our safety resources. And all of it is to ensure that we are supporting our guests and hosts whenever they need us.  So to summarize, travel is recovering and our Q2 results show that Airbnb's leading the way. For the past year, we've been preparing for this rebound. We've driven product innovation to support changes to the way people are traveling and living all over the world. And as a result, we've emerged from this crisis faster than others and as a stronger, more efficient company.  So with that, we look forward to answering your questions. Yes, Mark, thank you for the question. Before I hand it over to Dave, let me just say that, yes, we had a record night. There was more than 4 million guests staying with hosts all over the world. And we're really encouraged that this is the biggest night we've had since the pandemic began.  And the one other thing I'll just say is that we have an incredibly adaptable model. So however, travel changes, we'll be able to meet that demand. But Dave, why don't we talk about what we're seeing right now? Yes, Stephen -- yes, Stephen, thanks. It's a great question. Let me like preface this by saying the following. There's been a major paradigm shift in how people search for travel on the Internet. Before the pandemic, the way search was on the Internet for travel was the vast, vast majority of people came to a website, a travel website, typically an OTA, and they would type in a location. They have a location in mind, and they go to date, and they check -- type a date to check-in, and a date to check-out.  So this is really fixed search. People know where they're going to go. With the pandemic, I think it's safe to say the world is never going back to the way it was, and that means travel isn't going back to the way it was. And the way travel is evolving is that people because they're able to work more remotely, they're more flexible. And what we are seeing, Stephen, is that 40% of our guests have flexibility about where or when they travel. And to give you one example of one of the things we've done, flexible dates. We have a couple of flexible date features. We have a feature that you can tap, I'm flexible, and you can say I'm looking for a place for a weekend, a week or a month, sometime in the next few months. And what we have seen is with our flexible date feature, it's being used more than 500 million times. This is a feature that's been used 0.5 billion times since we launched this feature in the beginning of the year.  We've also seen a very big uptick in the use of flexible destinations as well, where people -- if they're flexible about where they travel, we can recommend them to where to go. Now these features are really important. The reason they're really important isn't just because this is the paradigm shift and how people are searching for travel, but it's also important because this means that we can point demand to where we have supply. And this is a major, major shift for our business.  And so we are going to continue to tweak the products. When you have hundreds of millions of data points on a feature, you learn, and we're continually innovating. But I will also just say that this is just the very beginning because our team is not going to rest on their laurels. We are working really, really hard to continue to offer more flexibility to guests and continue to be able to inspire them and point them to where we have available supply. Yes, Dave, actually, you want to take these questions? And I'll just add one more really interesting fact. Not long ago, we did a contest online, on social, a contest that allowed people to apply to be able to live on Airbnb. And to be able to be part of this contest, you have to fill out an application and it takes a while to fill out. We got 315,000 applications for people wanting to live on Airbnb, 315,000. And I think what this says is that travel is never going to be the same again because it's completely opened up now.  When we started Airbnb, like stays of longer than a month really wasn't a major part of our business. It really wasn't a major use case for us to be able to serve. But flexibility is now a permanent part of travel. It's just a permanent part now because it's all we have to believe is that Zoom is here to stay. And if we believe that Zoom is here to stay, we believe that flexibility in remote living is here to stay. And therefore, it's pretty obvious that what would happen is that we are going to continue to see more and more longer-term stays. And I think this is going to help us smooth out our seasonality over the coming years to come. Dave, do you want to take this one? Thank you, Brian, for the question. Dave, before I hand over to you, let me just kind of recap a couple of high-level things about our host community. Number one, we have more than 4 million Hosts. 90% of them are individuals, and most of them couldn't have hosted, if not for the tools we provide. And what we saw in Q2 was that we had the fastest listing growth where we had demand. And the reason why is because we have individual hosts, as they get booked, word of mouth typically increases and they often tell their friends. But the other thing that we've often seen is that as more guests become flexible, we're able to point demand where you have supply.  Now specific to your question about the nature of the host that we did add in Q2 and whether they were individuals or professionals, Dave, do you want to take that? Dave, do you want to take one of these? And I think the one thing I'll just add on -- the one thing I'd just add on, the efficiency of our business. And we've said this in the letter. I also mentioned this in the opening comments. But COVID was a crucible moment for the company. And in that moment, this company, we've gotten significantly more disciplined and much more efficient. And I think that we've all seen the incredible benefits and focus because we've put our very best people on the most important problems in the company.  And because what we've seen does not only have margins improved but actually, we're able to move much more quickly. We can pivot, and I think this explains why we were able to announce and launch more than 100 upgrades on the heels of our IPO in time for the travel season. And so I think that you're going to see a continued acceleration of product innovation because of our discipline and because of our focus.  These are lessons that we will never ever forget. These are lessons that will leave indelible marks for this company. Thank you for the question. So why don't -- Justin, why don't, Dave, I take the second question around take rate for Hosts, and then you can take the first question about flexible dates and how that has affected the booking window.  So with regards to factors to be able to increase take rate, as -- and I'll kind of say what Dave said before, we think there's -- one -- our guiding principle is that we want to make sure that every single year, we are providing incrementally more value to hosts than we're charging them because the name of the game is to make sure that our really strong business model continues to grow, and that means that hosts feel like they have the very best opportunity to host on Airbnb. We want them to always feel like we're giving them more value than we're taking away -- so taking. So that's number one.  Number two, I do think there's a lot of opportunities for us to be able to increase take rate. And if we do that, I think the way we would think about that is by charging for some incremental services that we can provide for hosts. And the more that hosts really rely on Airbnb to be able to continue to grow their business, the more we think they're going to be willing to be able to buy or participate in new services and offerings. But the way we think about this is a nonperishable opportunity.  So as Dave said, we have a number of years in front of us where we can continue to look at offering new services. But what we have focused on this year is this unprecedented travel rebound that's upon us. And so we've worked really, really hard to simplify the guest experience to introduce more flexibility for guests to make it much easier for hosts to come on the platform so that we get thousands and thousands more hosts in time for the travel season.  So with that, I don't know if, Dave, you want to talk about the booking window for flexible dates. Dave? Yes, and I'll just kind of just add to that just a little bit. In addition to long-term stays, which is essentially an entirely new category that is not even really traveling, it's living, which has, I think, been significantly expanded by COVID, you have a number of other dynamics happening. People are traveling to many more locations. And oftentimes, people are now traveling to places that don't even have hotels. So that would explain some expansion of TAM there. There's also a general shift from business travel to leisure travel because we think that as fewer people travel for business in their home, they're going to have a greater desire to travel for leisure. And Airbnb obviously is a disproportionately offering new to travel.  And again, over the course of the pandemic, many people, millions of people, in fact, have tried Airbnb for the first time. And the most important thing about growth for Airbnb is you just got to try it because our retention is really strong.  And I think what this says is that Airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel. I think the term alternative accommodations might be a dated term because maybe it was appropriate 10 years ago. 10 years ago, the TAM was significantly smaller. If you see what it is today, just imagine what it could be 10 years from now. And that's what we're focused on is continually increasing the market by continually adding more categories of travel we can offer and making sure that more people know about this, the new way of traveling. James, I'll answer the first question, and Dave can answer the second question about APAC. So with regards to host acquisition, there's a number of things we've done. One of the things you mentioned is making it easier to host. And so what we've done, as I said, is we've reduced the number of steps to 10 really simple steps to become a host. And this means that now the amount of time it takes to be able to list on Airbnb is reduced in half.  Now this is a really, really big deal because the thing we know is that the easier you make a conversion funnel, the more people get through the funnel. And we're talking about very small optimizations could yield thousands and thousands of new hosts. But in addition to that, we've also been increasing the top of funnel. We've been doing a brand marketing campaign. The company -- our Made Possible by Hosts campaign, to target and recruit more Hosts and what we've seen in the 5 countries where we've run this campaign, traffic to the Hosts -- to become a host page has more than doubled. And so this has worked really, really well.  And finally, one of the things that Dave mentioned is, number one, we got to make sure we get a host in the funnel. Number two, we have to reduce the number of steps. But three, we want to make sure that we provide help if anyone has any questions about hosting.  And so we've created is a host ambassador program. We have many of our Superhosts who now are able to provide assistance to a new host. So when they go through the funnel, they go through the conversion flow to become a host. If they have a question, we say, \"Hey, would you like to talk to a Superhost?\" And so we find that one of the strongest factors we've seen, our Hosts recruiting other Hosts. And this is in addition to the fact that the bigger we grow and the bigger our guest base, the more that we get host because many of our guests also become host. In fact, the #1 source of new host are prior guests. Over 30% of our Hosts were guests, and that number is continually increasing.  So these are some of the things we're doing to continue to increase the number of Hosts around the world. And obviously, we're going to continue to do a lot more in the coming years ahead. Dave? Dave? Dave? And I think the key point, again, is that we've seen, as demand in markets increase, supply in those markets correspondingly increase. Yes, I can just share and, Dave, if you're going to add as well. Number one, what we've seen is that the vast majority of Hosts on Airbnb, because they're individuals, what they really just want to do is make sure they get enough bookings to fill their calendar, and we found that we can get them enough bookings to fill their calendar. That's not been a problem this year.  And the other thing about our Hosts is they care about the quality of guest on Airbnb. Because these are mostly people's real homes, their primary home or their secondary home, they care a lot about who's in their home. And we provide a huge amount of trust and safety features and protocols to be able to give them peace of mind. And this is what they tell us. And we've really also worked on providing best-in-class customer service.  For example, on May 24, one of the things we announced is the dedicated Superhosts line. This is something that our very best host, our Superhosts, have been asking for. And I think the reception was very, very positive. And so in addition to investing in our hosts, one of the most important thing we can do is to continue and invest in our Superhosts. And if we continue to invest in our Superhosts, there will be no reason for them to list anywhere else. Kevin, Dave can take this. Yes. Thank you very much, Deepak. I think I can maybe take this at a high level. And Dave, feel free to chime in as well. I think there's been a number of lessons from this pandemic. And I think one of the general lessons is we tend to appreciate things more when they're taken away from us. And I think that not everything that was taken away from us during the pandemic did people appreciate. But I think that travel was one of the things that people miss the most from the pandemic.  In fact, we did surveys of travelers around the world, and travel was the out-of-home activity that people miss the most. They missed it more than going to sport events, more than going to restaurants, out-of-home dining and other opportunities. And we think that we've not even obviously tapped into the pent-up demand because, obviously, not everyone has been able to travel.  And also remember that before the pandemic, about 50 -- just almost 50% of our business, was cross-border travel and urban travel. There hasn't been nearly the cross-border travel recovery yet that is possible in the coming year. So I think what we're going to see is you can only imagine that as things get more under control in the coming travel seasons, people will once again be more comfortable crossing borders, but will be different this time is that people will have flexibility they didn't have before.  And so I think that we're very, very bullish about the future for cross-border travel. A lot of people haven't left their country in quite a long time, and we think they're going to desire to do so. And this is in addition to many new opportunities to be able to travel the city.  So I think there's a lot of reason to be extremely optimistic in the coming years about what's going to happen to travel. There's many things that may not come back to levels before the pandemic. But one thing I think we know for certain is that travel will, and it will probably be bigger than ever. Dave, do you want to add anything else? It's a great question, Rob. I think there's 4 things. Number one, I think what the pandemic has shown in this travel recovery that is upon us is that I think the opportunity, number one, for our core business is probably greater than anyone ever really imagined before the pandemic. And part of this is just because, again, more people are traveling to more locations, many of which don't even have hotels, millions of people have been introduced to Airbnb. And I think as cross-border and urban travel recover, you're going to see the huge amount of strength in our core.  So number one, we have a lot of opportunity in our core, and I want to make sure our team is really focused. Number two, as we said, long-term stays is a huge boon to our business. This is an entire category of travel that really wasn't -- didn't really exist when Joe, Nate and I started this company more than 13 years ago. But I think there's this entire new category of travel where travel and living is blurring, so that will be number two.  Three, you mentioned experiences. We thought last year could be a breakout year for experiences. Obviously, the opposite happened. We had to put the product on pause. But I think that people are going to be yearning for experiences. And the reason why is a very simple one.  I think people are yearning to have a meaningful experience. I think you can only sit at home and watch Netflix or streaming services for so many nights in a row before you actually want to get out of house and do something and be with other people. And I think there's going to be a huge amount of pent-up demand for people having authentic experiences all over the world.  And then finally, number four, I think there's a huge number of opportunities to unlock more hosting. We are now living in a world where there's still great economic distress all over the world. And take one example, women have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. And 55% of our Hosts are women all over the world. And so we think there's a huge opportunity to continue to unlock more hosting. And we're going to take guidance from the creativity of our community.  When we started the Airbnb, it was really just a way to rent your living room or your bedroom, but our Hosts and their creativity started listing entire homes. And not only did they list entire homes, they started listing castles and boats and tree houses. And so we're going to continue to take guidance from our host community as well, and they will continue to point the way towards where we go, and we're going to continue to innovate to unlock more hosting.  So those are some of our priorities. The good news is they're not really different. It's what we've always been focused on. I think it's just a renewed focus on our core, this amazing new opportunity around long-term stays. We're continuing to double down on experiences, and we'll continue to unlock hosting.  We do all those things. And I think we're going to look back on this is still the very early innings of a much, much bigger business. We're 13 years old, but I think -- as a Founder, I say you don't raise a 13-year old to be a great 14-year-old. You raise them to be a great adult many years from now. And I think that there's a lot of opportunities in this coming decade for us. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I just wanted to say, once again, it was -- we're very, very proud of the results for this quarter. I think what this proves is that number one, our model is inherently adaptable. We can adapt to the changing use cases of guests, and that's because we have hosted nearly every community offering nearly any type of space at every price point.  And number two, we're continuing to focus on product innovation. We're going to continue to build new products. And these 2 things, I think, have demonstrated that this pandemic, as hard as it's been for us and hard as it's been for everyone all around the world, it's made us a stronger, more efficient and a better company. And we are prepared for what's to come and for the future of travel and the future of living.  So with that, thank you all very much for joining us today. We'll talk to you next quarter."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ian Lee, Airbnb's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nIan Lee: Good afternoon and welcome to Airbnb's First Quarter of 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of 2021. These items are also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of the time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-looking Statements in our shareholder letter and in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And with that, I'll pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you very much, Ian. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I want to start by acknowledging the state of the pandemic. COVID-19 cases continue to surge in parts of the world such as India. And our thoughts go out to our hosts, guests and employees in India during this difficult time. There is much more work to do to limit the spread of the pandemic, and many people are still hurting. And we know how lucky we are to be in the position we're in today. 2020 was a year that none of us will ever forget. It was also a year when travel fundamentally changed forever. Airbnb changed as well. We sharpened our focus on our core business of hosting. And we got back to our roots, back to what is truly special by Airbnb: the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. And we emerged as a stronger and more efficient company. Our business rebounded faster than anyone expected, and it showed that as the world changes, we are able to adapt. Now turning to our Q1 results. Our business dramatically improved with the rollout of vaccines and the easing of some travel restrictions. While conditions aren't yet normal, they are improving. People's desire to travel, combined with our tightly managed expenses, drove a return to our positive top line growth and materially improved adjusted EBITDA. In Q1, our revenue was $887 million. This was an increase of 5% year-over-year, and it exceeded Q1 2019 levels as well. But here is the most important fact: Our business improved without the recovery of two of our strongest historical segments: urban travel and cross-border travel. We expect the return of urban and cross-border travel to be significant tailwinds over the coming quarters. Now as our top line recovers, we are maintaining our focus and our financial discipline to improve our profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA loss was $59 million. This was approximately $190 million better than the same period in 2019, and it was $275 million better than a year ago on essentially the same revenue. Now these results show that we are improving our variable costs, we're being disciplined with our marketing and our fixed costs. Our strong performance also indicates the beginning of the travel rebound. Just a few hours ago, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control said, \"If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.\" What we think this means is that more people will be comfortable traveling. And it further strengthens our view that we are going to see a significant travel rebound. In fact, we expect this rebound to be unlike anything that we have ever seen before, and we expect travel to be very different than before. People are discovering that they don't have to be tethered to one location to live and work. And what this means is that people are more flexible about where and when they travel. People can now travel any time. People are also traveling everywhere. They're not just going to the same 20 or 30 cities. They're visiting smaller cities, towns and rural communities. And when people do travel, they're staying longer. 24% of our nights booked in Q1 were for stays of 28 nights or longer. People are not just traveling in Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. And these trends are not going away. The world is never going back to the way it was, and that means that travel is never going back to the way it was either. So let me tell you about what we're doing to prepare for what's ahead. Our single priority in 2021 is to prepare for the coming travel rebound. To do this, we're professing the end-to-end experience of our core service. This includes educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest experience, and delivering a world-class service. Now I'm going to briefly share how we're executing against each of these areas. First, we are educating the world about what makes Airbnb different: hosting. In late February, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years, Made possible by Hosts. We're educating guests about the benefits of being hosted, and we're aspiring more people to become hosts. Now while it's still early, the campaign is being well received. In markets where we're running the campaign, overall traffic is up, first-time bookers are up, traffic from prospective hosts is up, and our brand favorability is up. Second, we are recruiting more hosts, and we are setting them up for success. To build on the momentum of our marketing campaign, we launched an accompanying digital campaign that's focused on recruiting new hosts. And we've completely redesigned the end-to-end experience of being a host on Airbnb. We're making it easier for anyone to start hosting. Third, we are simplifying every part in the guest experience. In February, we launched a Flexible Dates feature. It allows guests to browse options while being flexible on the exact dates of their trip. Now since the feature launched, there have been more than 90 million Flexible Dates searches on Airbnb, 90 million searches since just February with Flexible Dates, this new feature we created. And guests who used this feature have converted at a higher rate than guests who do not. Now this is just one of many improvements that we are making to the guest experience. And finally, whenever our guests or hosts need us, we must deliver world-class service. So to prepare for the travel rebound, we're improving our community support products, enhancing our safety protocols, and we're scaling our operation by ramping our third-party support. Now I want to wrap by highlighting a major announcement that we have coming up in less than two weeks. On May 24, we will announce the most comprehensive update to the Airbnb service in 12 years. As part of this special announcement, we're going to share insights on how travel is fundamentally changing, along with updates we've made to prepare for what's ahead. We're going to unveil a simpler and more inspiring guest experience. And we are going to show you upgrades that make it even easier to be a host on Airbnb. So watch the announcement with the airbnb.com on Monday, May 24. So to summarize, we're pleased with the strong Q1 results. We are encouraged by the trends that we're seeing driving these results, and we are executing against our 2021 plan to prepare for the travel rebound. And we think this travel rebound will be unlike anything we've seen before. We think this is the travel rebound of the century. So travel is coming back, and Airbnb is ready. And with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: I guess I really want to focus on behavior change, which could benefit the Company, first hosts and also guests. I think in the letter, it said post listings were stable with Q4, but it seems like you're really encouraged by what you're seeing. So maybe you could dive in there and tell us what is encouraging about what you're seeing with hosts and whether you see -- expect a lot of new listings to hit the market over the next year? And then similarly on the guests side, how do you think this pandemic is going to increase willingness to use alternative accommodations? Are you seeing some positive signs there?\nBrian Chesky: Thank you very much, Justin. So why don't I start? And Dave, feel free to add in after I go. So let's start with hosts, and then we'll go to guests. So Justin, let's just start with we have 4 million hosts on Airbnb. And I think if you asked people a year ago, would we have had such a stable host community? They probably wouldn't have expected that. But what we have today are hosts that offer 5.6 million listing. And these 5.6 million listings more about 1 million more than we had this time in 2019 and what we've actually seen is a large growth in non-urban listing. So we actually have a 30% growth in non-urban and vacation rental listings as well. Now it's important to note that 90% of our hosts, our everyday people, they're individuals. And the reason why is as we've made hosting on Airbnb easier, more and more hosts are coming to Airbnb as well. Now specific to what we're doing, we launched our first global campaign in five years, Made possible by Hosts. As I said, we also have an accompanying host campaign. Both of these campaigns, we are seeing significantly larger traffic of prospective hosts to the platform. The next thing we're doing is we're making it even easier to become a host by reducing number of steps to become a host. And as we reduce the number of steps, conversion rate for hosts gets even easier. We now are allowing hosts to be paired with other super hosts to help them get started, and we have webinars as well. And then finally, we have new tools and services that's going to make it even easier for hosts to list and be successful. I'll just end this in by saying on May 24 we will unveil a number of new tools and service that I think are going to make it much easier for hosts to get started. And I want to point out that new hosts that join Airbnb, 50% of them get a booking within four days of activation. And I think hosting is something at the perfect time for many people in the world. Because Airbnb, we started actually after the Great Recession in 2008. And at that time, there were many hosts, many people that were looking at Airbnb as a financial lifeline. I think if you think about the number of hosts on Airbnb, the top occupations of our hosts are health care workers, educators and people in food and hospitality. These are industries that have been hit really, really hard. So our job is to tell the story of hosting, the fact that on Airbnb you can make $8,000 on average if you have one listing, which is 5x you can make what an average American got in the stimulus check. So these are some of the things we're getting going, and we are just getting started ramping. And I expect us to get millions of more hosts in the coming years on Airbnb. Now as far as trends for guests, Justin, I'll also cover this as well. As I said before, I think two things are true. Number one, this travel rebound that is starting that is unlike anything we've ever seen before. And I think the Q1 results kind of demonstrate this. But the other thing that we're seeing is that travel is going to be very different than before. Probably the biggest changes are the following: number one, I don't think business travel is ever coming back the way it was before the pandemic. It's at least not going to look like it did. I do think a new kind of business travel may emerge. Many employees are working remotely. They're going to need to go back to headquarters occasionally. You're going to see longer stays going in cities. And so we're seeing elevated bookings in urban markets for stays of longer than 28 days. But the bigger trend is going to be flexibility. I think that all of us working around the world, most of us, if we're privileged enough to say this, are more flexible than we were before the pandemic. Because of the world of Zoom means a world where we can work anywhere, it's a world where many people are also choosing to live anywhere. And this has created three travel trends. Number one, people can travel anytime. This is why we have a Flexible Dates feature where instead of saying, \"I want to travel from July 5 to July 10,\" you can say, \"I want to go somewhere for a weekend, a week or a month anytime this summer.\" We've had over 90 million people use this feature. And as more people use this feature, conversion rate goes up. The second thing we're seeing is length of stay is increasing. In 2019 at this period of time, 14% of our nights were longer than 28 days. Now 24% of our nights are longer than 28 days. What that basically means is 1/4 of our business isn't travel, it's living. After 28 days, you're probably not traveling. And I think what this is a trend of is that traveling and living are going to begin to blur together. So this is the second trend we're seeing. And the third is people are now traveling everywhere. If you look at the concentration of our revenue, it is much more distributed than it was a couple of years ago. And this is because people aren't just going to the same 20 or 30 cities, they are getting in cars and they're traveling to small towns and rural communities, many of which don't even have a hotel. So again, the big trend is flexibility. People are traveling anytime, anywhere, and they're staying longer. We think all these trends are here to stay. And I'll just end by giving one more thought. I think there is a mass shift from mass travel to meaningful travel because people missed traveling. In fact in my surveys, people say the thing they miss the most that was taken away from the pandemic, at least from out of door activities, was travel. But they don't miss business travel. They don't miss standing in line in front of a museum or a selfie -- a landmark getting a selfie stick -- getting a photo with a selfie stick. What they really miss is spending time with the people they care about. And we call this meaningful travel. We have friends and families. We think Airbnb is really a great way to do that. So those are the trends that we're seeing. The two trends I do think are going to inverse are we are going to see a recovery of urban travel and the recovery of cross-border. This has been our bread and butter before the pandemic, and I think those are significant tailwinds for us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: The first one's on listings count. So you said you have similar levels to last quarter around 5.6 million. But with this hosting campaign that you guys are running, is there like a time line that we should expect to drive that number up? Or you mentioned in the past that 1/4 of guests eventually become hosts. When should we expect that number to increase?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, why don't I give you this question? And it's a great question, Mario. And I'll also say that in Q1, 28% of our hosts were now prior guests as well. So that number is increasing. But Dave, I'll hand it over to you.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, to be clear on the stat, it's that of guests, 25%, about 24% were former -- new hosts were former guests, so just to be clear with the percentage. It's early. We're seeing strong listing count, 5.6 million. It's been very stable. I think, actually, one of the things that's been very impressive during this time is that our host churn in Q1 '21 is actually lower than our host churn in the same period in 2019. And actually, our churn in 2020 was even lower than what it was in 2019. So I just think it all just shows kind of that resiliency and the stability of our supply. And we're just optimistic that as things continue to rebound, as we continue to educate people about the benefits of hosting and all of the tailwinds that Brian just outlined, we'll continue to see a strong host growth going forward.\nMario Lu: Great, and then just one follow-up on domestic versus international. So I'm not sure if you can see this in your data yet, but just curious to hear if you're seeing some substitution in terms of domestic bookings versus international as the vaccine rates increase? And do you think the domestic rates will remain above 2019 levels even after borders open up?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, do you want to take this one as well?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean just unsure exactly where everything will settle out for domestic versus international. Clearly, right now 80% of our nights in Q1 were domestic. So we've seen domestic travel being consistent, the strength all around the world. Historically, our strength has obviously been in urban areas cross-border. So prior to kind of pandemic, think about 50% of our nights were actually cross-border nights. And obviously with that not occurring, clearly there's going to be some substitution where people are going to stay domestically where they might have taken a cross-border trip. But again, our urban cross-border has been our strength. We know that many of these trips will be -- are incremental and such that when travel rebounds to a more typical state, we'll have growth in overall travel. Just hesitancy, right? People are hesitant to travel right now if they aren't vaccinated, or maybe they can't travel due to do some of the lockdowns in borders. So we know that many of the trips will be coming back and will be incremental to what we're seeing today.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I have a couple of questions on investments and spending. I guess first off, what gives you the confidence that you can moderate sales and marketing spend in the second half without impacting bookings or listing levels? Is that still the plan? And then in terms of product development, obviously, Brian, you'll be making some announcements soon. But how are you thinking about the pace of R&D or product development spend, now that business appears to be returning to normal, or whatever normal means now? Is it perhaps time to look at reaccelerating hiring? Or what are your thoughts on that?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thank you very much, Colin. Dave, why don't I take this at a high level, and you can obviously go into more detailed analysis? So Colin, a couple of things. Let me just first start and talk about our marketing strategy, and then I'll answer your very specific question about H2 marketing. First of all, we take a very different approach to sales and marketing, I think, than our competition. What we have is a full funnel integrated approach to marketing. And what we iterate is PR, brand marketing and performance marketing. And really PR, in addition to word of mouth, is the thing that really built our brand over the last 10 years. And because of that, Airbnb is a noun and a verb used all over the world. And this has led to 90% of our traffic being unpaid or direct even as recently as Q1. And even in this past quarter, with elevated marketing, we have similar traffic levels in 2019 but we spent 50% less on marketing. So we think that if you have a product that is unique and different, that the role of marketing isn't to buy customers, and the role of marketing is not sizzle. The role of marketing is education. And so what we have done is we're doing our first brand -- we did our first brand marketing campaign at a global level in five years. It was a campaign called Made possible by Hosts. And it's really just taking real photos from real guests on real trips to highlight what makes Airbnb different, which is hosts. We want our hosts to be as mainstream as the homes and spaces on Airbnb. Now while the results are still early, as I said, we have seen elevated traffic levels. And to answer your question on H1 versus H2, we decided to front load spending. We were prepared for a travel rebound unlike any other so we didn't want to spread the money over the course of the year. So we disproportionately put the spending in H1 to really capture as much of this demand as possible. And I think what we're seeing is that timing is going to bear out to be the right timing. And then as far as -- why don't I also answer product development at a high level? And then Dave, you can also go in. So at a high level for product development, here's what we've learned. Before the pandemic, we were a divisional structure. We had our core business of homes. We also had a business travel. We had -- we were working on a number of other divisions. We had many divisions. And because we have many divisions, we had multiple product development groups. And what we did is when we became a functional organization, and we got much more focused on hosting, we realized that we could be much, much more efficient. It's one of the reasons our product development group is much smaller than it was two years ago. And that's allowed us to move really, really fast. And I hope that you see on May 24 that even despite the team being smaller and more nimble, we've been able to increase the pace of development. I think people are going to be really impressed by what we're able to deliver. So that's at a high level. But Dave, I don't know if you want to jump in and talk specifically about the numbers.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean our product development spend will increase at a lower rate than revenue. We're not going to have to add back significant number of fixed resources in order to accommodate the business that's back to the size of 2019 and beyond. So we're just going to be very disciplined in any additions to our expenses. And then as Brian said, we're just seeing great success with our marketing strategy, which we actually started modifying prior to COVID, solidified during COVID and are continuing to see strength here in Q1. So marketing as a percentage of revenue will be higher early this first half of the year than it will be in the second half of the year, but we're very encouraged by the results.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: Brian, maybe give us your thoughts about the reopening of urban travel in terms of timing. How are you thinking about it? Is that something that you think might happen in the back half of this year? Or do you think that's further out?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thank you very much, Naved, for the question. Well, let me preface my answer with two comments. Number one, I'll be -- I'll try to be careful with predictions, because anyone that was compelled to making predictions last year was humbled. But something I'll say is no matter what happens with travel, I think one of the things we showed last year is that our model is inherently adaptable. And so we are adaptable to any travel changes. With that being said, I do think we have quite a bit of data. And so with the data we have and we're seeing, I think I can give you some indications, although it's going to be a little hard to pinpoint. We are seeing that as restrictions lift and cross-border begins, more people travel the cities. We're also seeing that the nature of travel to cities is changing. For example, more and more people are booking longer-term stays in cities. So the length of stay is going up. And one of the things we know is that the longer you stay somewhere, the more you're inclined to stay in a home. So I think that as restrictions lift in countries, as vaccinations rise, we think this is a significant tailwind to both urban travel and cross-border travel. So we're very, very bullish. It's a little hard to pinpoint, but I think the comments from the head of CDC today, the lifting of restrictions across Europe, these are all really, really good signs. There's no reason this wouldn't be a huge tailwind to urban travel and cross-border.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, our urban travel growth rate has increased every month this year and continues to do so through April and early May. So we're just seeing continued positive momentum.\nNaved Khan: That's very helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up, if I may. So Brian, you talked about business travel maybe becoming a little different where people might just travel to headquarters and maybe rent maybe an Airbnb.\nBrian Chesky: Yes.\nNaved Khan: Is there a -- do you see a good opportunity to maybe take share in that segment versus previously just targeting business travelers going into cities?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I mean in New York City, in Los Angeles, a number of these cities, we almost have as many nights booked for stays longer than 28 days as we do stays under 28 days. In New York City, actually, the majority is over 28 days now. So I think that there's a huge opportunity. If you think about where business travel is going in the future, it seems completely intuitive to me that as companies offer more flexibility, more people are going to live around the world, but they're not all going to want to live remote. They're going to have to come back to visit. And so I think you're going to start to see longer stays. I think in addition to longer stays, you may also see business travelers traveling together. So let's say three different employees work in three different cities, and they have to come back to headquarters. They may not all get three different hotel rooms at Airbnb. They might get one house. They can split the cost. They can eat around the dinner -- the breakfast table in the morning. So I think the things that benefit Airbnb at business travel is group travel and longer-stay travel. Those two things, I think, are disproportionately beneficial to doing home, and these are general tailwind for business travel. Now I want to be clear. I mean people will, of course, travel for business again. I just think the bar to get on a plane to go to a meeting will be higher than before.\nOperator: And your next question comes from James Lee with Mizuho.\nJames Lee: A couple of questions regarding the supply side. And can you guys talk about maybe supply and demand balance by region a little bit here? Where do you see surpluses? Where do you see deficits? And are you also looking to increase your supply by tapping into professional hosts. I know 90% are individual, or even hotel supply? And also secondly, what are the key frictions that you're seeing right now for your hosts signing up and that you're looking to address with these new tools you're about to introduce?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, do you want to take supply and demand? I can probably take the increase in pro hosts and key friction?\nDavid Stephenson: Sounds good, yes. I mean on supply and demand, really, what we're seeing, because cross-border and urban travel has not yet fully rebounded, the places that we're seeing surpluses or deficits in demand or a surplus of supply would be more urban markets. And where we can see some tightening of it, especially U.S. non-urban for the peak in the summer is clearly going to be the most constrained of our markets. So we're actively working against each of those areas. But on each side, on the supply side, making sure that we are doing our best to recruit hosts and bring on as more supply as possible for peak periods in constrained markets. And then we're also using -- go back to our marketing expenses before, where we use search engine marketing is in targeted approach, especially in markets where we have maybe surplus supply and not maybe enough demand, and so being kind of pointed at that. So we look at every individual market as different, and we will use different levers to try to manage that balance over time.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And James, why don't I jump in and say this. One of the things that Dave just said, I want to put out underline under, highlights. Before the pandemic, most people came to Airbnb and they knew exactly where they were going and they knew when they were going. So we asked the question in the search bar, \"Where are you going?\" And we asked, \"When are you going?\" You put in date. The holy grail for matching supply and demand is to be able to also control where you can point demand. But we can't point demand to where we have supply if guests aren't flexible, if they're predisposed to where they want to travel. Now that guests are telling us that they're much more flexible about where they travel, we can point demand to where we have supply. This is probably one of the most important things we have. And it explains why when 90 million searches were used with the Flexible Dates feature, conversion rates went up. So that is just another thing I want to underline. Now regarding your next two questions, let's talk about pro hosts and hotels. Obviously, Airbnb created a new category in travel because we created tools that allowed everyday people and individuals become hosts. And yes, out of 4 million hosts, 3.5 million are individuals. That being said, we welcome all hospitality providers on Airbnb. And we have hundreds of thousands of professional hosts and professional hospitality providers. The way we think about it is when a guest comes to Airbnb, they're looking for a place to stay. And so we don't want them to leave without having found something they want. Typically, they come to look for individual hosts, that's what we're known for. But we want to make sure that we have professional hosts and hotels to serve those customers and to fill in our network gaps. So we're continuing to develop new tools and services over the coming years to continue to welcome these providers onto our platform. And I think they're going to obviously benefit from all the demand that we have. Now as far as key friction to becoming a host, one of the things we've seen, probably the main learning we've had is as we make it easier, more people do it. That's the name of the game, make it easier and more people do it. Before Airbnb, it was really hard to rent your home on the Internet. People did it, which is hard, and we made it easier. And on May 24, we're going to show a number of tools, a number of offerings and innovations that we have that are going to make hosting even easier. We're reducing the number of steps to become hosts. We're making it even easier by providing more tools and support. And we're going to offer some better tools and services for hosts once they become host. And so I think all these things will reduce the number of frictions as well.\nJames Lee: If I can ask a follow-up question also on the hosts side, too, are you seeing increased competition for acquiring hosts and maybe potentially pressure on your take rate?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take this one?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Right now what we're seeing is -- remember, it comes back to what our hosts are. We have 4 million hosts around the world. The vast majority of those are individual -- so 3.5 million of those are individual hosts. And I think that's very different than what we see kind of competitive platforms are doing. And so what we end up seeing with the 4 million hosts that we have is -- give me the last part of the question, sorry, I lost my train of thought.\nJames Lee: Yes, increased competition for hosts and maybe potentially pressure on take rates?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, no, pressure on the take rates. Right now, we're not seeing the pressure in take rates. We think that we have a really great value to the take rates that we give. We charge rates that give good value to both our guests and our hosts. And what we see on the take rate side is making sure that when we give value back to our hosts, that then we were able to take kind of appropriate revenue from that. So we're not really seeing any pressure at that driving for increasing or decreasing the number of hosts that we have on Airbnb.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one on the -- is on the 2020 new users that you added. It was a great year to sort of add a lot of new users to the platform. I'd be curious to hear about what you're seeing from those new users from a retention or booking perspective now as you're into 2021, and how that compares to what you've seen in the user cohorts in the past? Then the second one, to go a little bit more into the monetization of the take rate, can you just talk to us about any of the tests or experiments you've been doing around insurance or ancillary service sales or tiered take rates or sponsored listings, and ways we can think about that take rate potentially adjusting over time for more services to your hosts or guests?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. thank you very much, Brian. Dave, why don't I take the second question on monetization and take rates? Why don't you take the question on new users, what are we seeing for new users from retention and booking?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. So what we're seeing for new users, it's early, but all of the early data for the new users that we've acquired here during 2020 is that the retention is very consistent with what we had for users in 2019 and before. So I think one of the benefits that we've seen in 2020 is just we've actually did lower to barrier for entry for new guests to kind of come to Airbnb and try us out for the first time. You don't have to hop on a plane. You don't have to go across the border. As we said, over 50% of our nights historically have been cross-border. You don't have to do that to try Airbnb. Now you can kind of drive just a couple of hours down the road and go check us out. And what we're seeing from the early results is that the retention rates are very consistent with what we've seen in the past.\nBrian Chesky: And then Brian, to your question about monetization and take rate, we absolutely see lots of opportunities to increase our monetization and take rate for both guests and hosts. For example, one of the things we've said is that many of these tools and services we've offered in the last five years, they're incremental, we haven't charged for. For example, unlike our competitors, we offer free protection of $1 million against theft, property damage and personal liability in countries all over the world. And as we added these services, we do not charge incrementally for these. Our general principle is we always want to give away more value than we're taking, but we do think there's opportunities for us to do -- to offer some more tools and services to increase take rate. Now that being said, focus is critical. And we are focused on the most perishable opportunity. The most perishable opportunity right now is to capture as much travel demand as possible and be ready before anyone else is for this travel rebound. So we are making sure that we have enough hosts for this travel season. We simplified the guests experience, and we're providing world-class support. So that's where we're focused on this year. But make no mistake, we have many opportunities in the years ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, I'll stick with one question. Just on the supply side, will you address the issue of whether increasing local restrictions is a factor that's limiting your supply in -- especially in some of the larger cities? And I realize that travel hasn't really recovered there fully. But just address the issue of whether how much of a constraint new local regulations on rentals, et cetera, is on your ability to expand supply?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I can take this at a high level. Dave, again, feel free to jump in as well. Mark, thanks for the question. What we saw with COVID was actually a positive reset in our relationship with cities all over the world. Now first, let me just start by saying we now collect/remit taxes in 30,000 jurisdictions. We collected and remitted to date $2.6 billion of transient occupancy taxes. What happened with COVID is two things: Number one, travel went from being concentrated in very few top cities to distributing everywhere, thousand cities around the world. Though we do see an urban recovery, we don't see that trend completely reversing. Because I think in a sense, you could say the genie's out of the bottle, a number of people have realized that there's all these really cool small towns, rural communities and small cities, many of which don't even have hotels. And so they're really important destinations. The other thing that we've noticed, though, is that a lot of cities have been hit really hard by the devastating economic effects of the pandemic. So you'll see major cities have had major tourism shortfalls, major tax shortfalls. And because of this, what we're actually seen is a lot of cities reaching out to us. In fact, we struck over 100 partnerships over the course of just the pandemic with destination marketing organizations, which as you know are basically tourism bureaus and tourism arms. From Scotland to Portland, we've been doing partnerships with cities all over the world. And to scale our partnerships to thousands of cities, we launched last year the City Portal as well. So this is what we're seeing. I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything to that.\nDavid Stephenson: I think that's key. We also added this new capability last year of the City Portal, which is another tool to enable cities to understand what goes on with our business in each of their communities. And we think that's been another positive tool for cities to feel like they can work with Airbnb to help their economies rebound.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: I guess, Brian, going back to business travel, I guess it's kind of like a two-part question. I guess number one would be, where are you in terms of talking to companies, talking to businesses sort of making the ability to work from anywhere through Airbnb and benefit? And then as, like, a follow-up, you mentioned work from anywhere. Your company is, of course, based in San Francisco. So how do you see basically potentially using the work-from-anywhere trend to sort of save costs to make your business more efficient if you can have more employees working outside the Bay Area?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, these are two really good questions. Let me start with the first one. So as you point out and as I said, one of the kind of -- one of the trends that has been pretty remarkable over the last year is as more people have more flexibility, they can work from home. And that means they can work from any home, often on Airbnb. And so one of the things we're doing is we're continually trying to make it even easier for guests to be able to search anywhere around the world. And on May 24, we're going to show you some new tools and new ways to make the experience of searching on Airbnb, especially allowing you to search with more flexibility, even easier. Again, the type of flexibility we're looking at is people staying longer, booking any time and be able to go anywhere, not just to the same top destination. So we are going to continue to look at innovation in this area. And I think the other thing I'll just point out is, again, in 2019, only 14% of our nights booked were longer than 28 days. That's now 24%. And so we think this is a huge growth area for us. We think basically, 1/4 of our business is not even travel anymore. There's a lot of innovation opportunities for us. We're a design-led company at our heart. And I think they're going to offer a lot of really interesting opportunities. Now specific to our San Francisco employee base, let me talk a little bit about what I told our employees a couple of weeks ago. I told them there's two guiding principles. Number one, we want to model the live anywhere lifestyle. So by modeling the live-anywhere lifestyle, we're going to allow more flexibility for our employees. So I told our employees, they don't have to come back to the office until next September. We're going to allow a lot of flexibility. And even when we do ask people to come back, they're going to have a lot more flexibly before. People aren't going to be expected to come back to the office five days week every week. We think that is really not how most workplaces in the 21st century are going to operate. That being said, as an incredibly light company, we also do think that in-person collaboration is important. So we want to find some balance between modeling the live-anywhere lifestyle and allowing for in-person creative collaboration. And that's what we're designing. We want to get it right. We don't want to rush into this. So that's what we're going to be working on over the course of next year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: Brian, just expanding on the prior question, it does sound like this platform experience update is really designed around inspiration and discovery. Without spoiling your announcement on the 24th, I'm curious about how you think about the opportunity to broaden the funnel on Airbnb, provide inspiration for travelers as they think about places they can stay and things to do such that Airbnb really starts to drive natural inspiration for the much broader spectrum of the customer base than before.\nBrian Chesky: Thank you, Justin. It was a little bit hard for me to hear you, but I think the question was what are we doing to drive more inspiration and discovery on Airbnb, inspiring where you can go and what you can do, correct? I just want to make sure I -- I couldn't the end of that last question. Okay. I'll answer that. So yes, so inspiration is something that we're really focused on. Actually if you go to airbnb.com right now, if you type Airbnb.com, you're going to notice on our top of our homepage, there's a big piece of art and it says, \"the greatest outdoors.\" So we just launched wish lists that are curated by Airbnb. And if you click on Get Inspired, you're going to see a number of wish lists. So this is just the beginning of a number of things we're doing to try to inspire more travel. On the home page below that, you're going to see that we're now merchandising places you can go nearby. So between wish lists, nearby travel and then some of the updates we have on May 24, I think that's going to continue to drive more and more inspiration. On May 24, though, we are going to showcase some new exciting features that I think are going to inspire people around flexibility. Because one of the things we've seen is if you are more flexible about where you travel and when you travel, then what that kind of means for some people is the home becomes the destination, suddenly where you go is less important than the type of home you say in. And so this is how we're thinking about it, and hopefully, if you can tune in, we can show you some of the things we're working on.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Two questions, if I can. First, can you talk about how you think about occupancy rates or kind of room nights per active listing over the medium term? It seems like it's been pretty stable over the past few years. But wondering if this notion of, like, blending of travel and living is kind of increasing shoulder season demand in a way where you can grow room nights in excess of listings, or getting more out of your existing listings? And then the second one, the average booking value per night looked really high in 1Q. If you peel back the onion and look within the same region, the same-property type, are you seeing pricing up? Or is most of this just mix shift? And how do you think about this as maybe as travel normalizes a bit? How would that impact ADRs going forward?\nBrian Chesky: Great, Lloyd. So I'll take the first question on occupancy rate. Dave, you can take the second one. The answer to your question is yes. Occupancy rates, we think, average on global level will go up as we get better at matching supply and demand. The basic name of the game is in classic travel a lot of people try to go to the same place on the same date. That's why kind of when you show up to Paris in the summer, and there's a whole bunch of people in line at a landmark is because they're going to the same place at the same time. So to increase occupancy rates, there's one or two things we can do. We can add more hosts to the same places that everyone is going to, or we can point demand to other places. And as length of stay increases, as people shift from going to 20 or 30 cities to thousands of communities, and as people become more flexible when they travel, we can then show them deals. We can show them, for example, I know you want to go to -- we'll make up the place, France, in July. But if you went in September, you could get -- you could save a lot of money because there's fewer people there. Or we can point you instead of in Paris, we can point you to Brittany or some other community. So there's a lot of opportunities for us, I think, to point demand to where we have available supply, which will allow us to steadily increase occupancy. What it means is we don't need to increase supply linearly with increasing revenue. We can get more productivity out of the supply that we have. And Dave, I don't know if you want to take ADR.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. And our ADRs in Q1 were up 35% year-over-year. That was after being up 13% year-over-year in Q4. The significant majority driver of the ADR increase is driven by mix. The rebound has been earlier in the U.S., which has a higher average daily rate. It's been in non-urban whole home and even larger homes, and each one of those is just, on average, a higher ADR. So the majority of the ADR that we're seeing is from mix. When you actually look at some highly constrained markets in a highly constrained time period, we're seeing some pricing pressure within there that will drive ADR rates up. So the vast majority of it is just driven by mix.\nBrian Chesky: And the other thing I want to say, again, is -- yes, another thing I'll just say is as demand increases on Airbnb, that can also correspondingly increase supply. So again, one of the things we published in our S-1 was 23% of our new available hosts in 2019 were guests. That increased to 28% in our new available hosts that started out as guests in Airbnb in 2020. So we also think there's a really interesting flywheel where we can point demand where we have supply. We have a muscle to continue to add hosts, and but we can also convert guests to hosts. And as that number keeps increasing, that's another big lever for us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Dave, I don't know any color you can add around the final unlock that comes over the next week of close to 500 million shares. I know not all of those are eligible. But is there any way you could just frame that? There's been some fear of this unlock, and what it means. Can you just -- any color around that you could give would be helpful.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, you want to take that?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. So clearly, our unlock comes on Monday. And the key thing that we're doing to try to make sure that we're ready for that unlock, is to do what we've been doing, which is deliver outstanding results, deliver outsized kind of gross booking value revenue and driving for profitability. So there's not a lot more color I can give you on the unlock on Monday beyond that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: We wanted to ask if you could tell us what you're seeing with respect to experiences, supply dynamics there, online versus offline, linkages to travel conversion rates there, anything with experiences?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Thank you very much for the question. So here's what I'd say about experiences. When we came back in the beginning of 2020, I really thought experiences would be a breakout year last year. It turns out a pandemic was a very difficult year for experiences. We had to put products on hold. We remain very, very bullish about experiences over the long term. One of the reasons we remain bullish is because the percent of guests leaving a five-start review with experiences is higher and remains higher than percent of guests who leave a five-star review for homes. But the pandemic was a difficult time for experiences. So we launched online experiences, which is the way to have an experience without leaving your living room. And I am thinking that in the coming years, experiences will be successful because there's fewer alternatives. There's fewer mass tour operators, bars, lounges and restaurants that are going to be operating at full capacity. So we do think there's a window, and we're playing the long game on this one.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. So Brian, I asked the same question to one of your competitors last week. So I'd be interested in your opinion what is probably more of a macro consideration. So the consumer savings rate, at least in the United States, is probably at the highest level it's been since World War II. It will take some time for all of this to widen down to, I guess, normalized levels, which brings up the scenario of consumer spend probably accelerating for the next several years. And hopefully, one of the likely destinations for all of these dollars is going to be in travel. So I know it's early days of the recovery, but what are you seeing in terms of, I guess, greater willingness to maybe, say, upgrade to the more expensive Airbnb, or just in general stepping up in the frequency as we recover here?\nBrian Chesky: Very good question, Stephen. Let me tell you what we're seeing so far. One of the things is we did travel surveys in the beginning of the year. And we surveyed people in the United States. We also surveyed people around the world. And in our surveys, what we found is that the out-of-home activity people missed the most, more than restaurants, more than bars, more than sporting events, more than concerts, was travel. The kind of travel people missed was not business travel. It was not mass travel, going to crowded destinations. It was really just spending time with people that they've not been able to see during the pandemic. I think that we generally just yearn for what was taken away from us. And travel and spending time with people was something that was taken away from us. Now with regard to your question about are we seeing people upgrading? We have seen, as we mentioned, a material increase in the average daily rate in the United States. And this does give us a sense of consumer willingness to spend. Maybe another way of saying it is maybe before the pandemic, people were booking studio apartments in cities. Now what we're seeing is a pretty big expansion of people booking entire homes, typically even more bedrooms, the number of guests per reservation has increased considerably. And so correspondingly, people are spending more money. I think that trend, of course, will get normalized over some period of time when other geographies recover and urban recovers. But I do think that we are going to see sustained confidence, there's no question.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Just a couple of quick ones. So first, can you talk about the implications of booking window trends on second quarter and second half? There's a lot of summer bookings happening right now already in markets like Europe and even in North America. Is that earlier than usual? Or does that mean that the recovery is being pulled forward by some capacity? Just wondering if you can now provide some insights on that, and then second question, not sure if this was asked already. How are you thinking about the ROI on the targeted digital marketing programs in the hosts? Are these on performance channels? Any color that you can add there would be great.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, why don't you take these two questions.\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. So regarding the booking window, we're seeing the booking window, obviously, in 2020 shrank dramatically, right? People were hesitant to travel. They only started booking when they had high confidence that they were going to travel. What we've seen here early in Q1 of '21 is the booking windows have expanded. And in March, we actually saw booking windows consistent with those from March of 2019. And so the windows are expanding. I think that what you're seeing is still even more confidence in the U.S. So that the willingness of travel and the booking window in the U.S. has expanded further than it has in Europe. But we're starting to see some greater acceleration of our European business. We're seeing the European nights increasing the rate of year-over-year growth every month of the year since the beginning of the year, including through April and May. And we're seeing that as things like the lockdowns in France are removed. And after the U.K. Prime Minister announced plans to exit lockdown in February, we started seeing more acceleration in Europe. So the booking window trends are positive and give us encouragement for what we're going to see in the back half of the year. But we'll just have to see what the lockdowns and other kind of travel restrictions look like for Europe for the back half. And then regarding the ROI and targeted digital marketing for hosts, this is one of the levers that we have. When we do target digital marketing for hosts, it would be in specific areas that we know are more supply-constrained and where we want to focus on it. We established a return on that investment for value of the hosts that we acquire through that channel. And it is one channel, but it's not the only one, and it's not the primary one. Again, the most important thing is to kind of step back and educate people about the benefits of hosting, and then make it easier for them to host once they start considering it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: A quick one, could you give us an update on cancellation rate trends this year compared to 2019 with I think the average listing being a little bit more flexible than it was in the past?\nBrian Chesky: You're welcome. Dave, do you want to take this one for Kevin?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. So the cancellation rates obviously were substantially elevated in 2020 versus 2019. They've begun to moderate so that they are sequentially below where they were at in 2020, but they're still moderately elevated versus the 2019 rate. So we're seeing a bit more returns than normal but it's not quite to historical level rates.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nTom White: Just one from me to follow up on ADRs and specifically your expectations for the second half. I know there's some color in the letter, but can you maybe unpack your thoughts on kind of all the different moving pieces there between the recovery and some of the kind of structurally lower ADR markets, recovery in urban and cross-border. Just curious to hear your thoughts on how it all kind of nets out, you think, in the back half?\nBrian Chesky: Thanks, Tom. Dave, I'll give you this one.\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Yes, I think that the best thing to do is actually kind of look at some of the guidance figures that we gave in the earnings call itself where we're basically expecting -- because it's harder to have visibility in the back half of the year. We're highly confident in the rebound that it's going to be coming. All the early indications are that it's there. But it's hard to kind of precisely pin down what Q3 and Q4 are going to do. So what we did do is give some perspective on what we expect out of Q2. And that is that our gross booking value in Q2 of this year will be higher than in Q2 of 2019, and that our revenue rate in Q2 will be similar to that of 2019, and that our EBITDA will be -- our adjusted EBITDA will be breakeven to slightly positive in Q2 of this year. So I think those are kind of the key things. Because as you said, as rebound comes back, the pace at which it comes back in the geographies that come back will affect the mix on those ADRs. And we do expect the ADRs to moderate, but it's hard to perfectly pinpoint down the specific of that mix.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to the management team for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I just want to recap. We are really proud of our strong Q1 results. We believe they're a testament to our focus and the adaptability of our model. And we've shown over the past year that as the world changes, Airbnb can adapt. I think we're now well positioned for the travel rebound ahead. As travel returns, Airbnb will be ready, and our hosts will be ready as well. So I hope you'll join us on May 24, where we'll share insights on how travel is fundamentally changing and announce the most comprehensive update to Airbnb service in 12 years. Thank you, and we'll see you then.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "Yes, to be clear on the stat, it's that of guests, 25%, about 24% were former -- new hosts were former guests, so just to be clear with the percentage. It's early. We're seeing strong listing count, 5.6 million. It's been very stable. I think, actually, one of the things that's been very impressive during this time is that our host churn in Q1 '21 is actually lower than our host churn in the same period in 2019. And actually, our churn in 2020 was even lower than what it was in 2019. So I just think it all just shows kind of that resiliency and the stability of our supply. And we're just optimistic that as things continue to rebound, as we continue to educate people about the benefits of hosting and all of the tailwinds that Brian just outlined, we'll continue to see a strong host growth going forward. Yes. I mean just unsure exactly where everything will settle out for domestic versus international. Clearly, right now 80% of our nights in Q1 were domestic. So we've seen domestic travel being consistent, the strength all around the world. Historically, our strength has obviously been in urban areas cross-border. So prior to kind of pandemic, think about 50% of our nights were actually cross-border nights. And obviously with that not occurring, clearly there's going to be some substitution where people are going to stay domestically where they might have taken a cross-border trip. But again, our urban cross-border has been our strength. We know that many of these trips will be -- are incremental and such that when travel rebounds to a more typical state, we'll have growth in overall travel. Just hesitancy, right? People are hesitant to travel right now if they aren't vaccinated, or maybe they can't travel due to do some of the lockdowns in borders. So we know that many of the trips will be coming back and will be incremental to what we're seeing today. Yes. I mean our product development spend will increase at a lower rate than revenue. We're not going to have to add back significant number of fixed resources in order to accommodate the business that's back to the size of 2019 and beyond. So we're just going to be very disciplined in any additions to our expenses. And then as Brian said, we're just seeing great success with our marketing strategy, which we actually started modifying prior to COVID, solidified during COVID and are continuing to see strength here in Q1. So marketing as a percentage of revenue will be higher early this first half of the year than it will be in the second half of the year, but we're very encouraged by the results. Yes, our urban travel growth rate has increased every month this year and continues to do so through April and early May. So we're just seeing continued positive momentum. Sounds good, yes. I mean on supply and demand, really, what we're seeing, because cross-border and urban travel has not yet fully rebounded, the places that we're seeing surpluses or deficits in demand or a surplus of supply would be more urban markets. And where we can see some tightening of it, especially U.S. non-urban for the peak in the summer is clearly going to be the most constrained of our markets. So we're actively working against each of those areas. But on each side, on the supply side, making sure that we are doing our best to recruit hosts and bring on as more supply as possible for peak periods in constrained markets. And then we're also using -- go back to our marketing expenses before, where we use search engine marketing is in targeted approach, especially in markets where we have maybe surplus supply and not maybe enough demand, and so being kind of pointed at that. So we look at every individual market as different, and we will use different levers to try to manage that balance over time. Sure. Right now what we're seeing is -- remember, it comes back to what our hosts are. We have 4 million hosts around the world. The vast majority of those are individual -- so 3.5 million of those are individual hosts. And I think that's very different than what we see kind of competitive platforms are doing. And so what we end up seeing with the 4 million hosts that we have is -- give me the last part of the question, sorry, I lost my train of thought. Yes, no, pressure on the take rates. Right now, we're not seeing the pressure in take rates. We think that we have a really great value to the take rates that we give. We charge rates that give good value to both our guests and our hosts. And what we see on the take rate side is making sure that when we give value back to our hosts, that then we were able to take kind of appropriate revenue from that. So we're not really seeing any pressure at that driving for increasing or decreasing the number of hosts that we have on Airbnb. Yes. So what we're seeing for new users, it's early, but all of the early data for the new users that we've acquired here during 2020 is that the retention is very consistent with what we had for users in 2019 and before. So I think one of the benefits that we've seen in 2020 is just we've actually did lower to barrier for entry for new guests to kind of come to Airbnb and try us out for the first time. You don't have to hop on a plane. You don't have to go across the border. As we said, over 50% of our nights historically have been cross-border. You don't have to do that to try Airbnb. Now you can kind of drive just a couple of hours down the road and go check us out. And what we're seeing from the early results is that the retention rates are very consistent with what we've seen in the past. I think that's key. We also added this new capability last year of the City Portal, which is another tool to enable cities to understand what goes on with our business in each of their communities. And we think that's been another positive tool for cities to feel like they can work with Airbnb to help their economies rebound. Yes. And our ADRs in Q1 were up 35% year-over-year. That was after being up 13% year-over-year in Q4. The significant majority driver of the ADR increase is driven by mix. The rebound has been earlier in the U.S., which has a higher average daily rate. It's been in non-urban whole home and even larger homes, and each one of those is just, on average, a higher ADR. So the majority of the ADR that we're seeing is from mix. When you actually look at some highly constrained markets in a highly constrained time period, we're seeing some pricing pressure within there that will drive ADR rates up. So the vast majority of it is just driven by mix. Sure. So clearly, our unlock comes on Monday. And the key thing that we're doing to try to make sure that we're ready for that unlock, is to do what we've been doing, which is deliver outstanding results, deliver outsized kind of gross booking value revenue and driving for profitability. So there's not a lot more color I can give you on the unlock on Monday beyond that. Sure. So regarding the booking window, we're seeing the booking window, obviously, in 2020 shrank dramatically, right? People were hesitant to travel. They only started booking when they had high confidence that they were going to travel. What we've seen here early in Q1 of '21 is the booking windows have expanded. And in March, we actually saw booking windows consistent with those from March of 2019. And so the windows are expanding. I think that what you're seeing is still even more confidence in the U.S. So that the willingness of travel and the booking window in the U.S. has expanded further than it has in Europe. But we're starting to see some greater acceleration of our European business. We're seeing the European nights increasing the rate of year-over-year growth every month of the year since the beginning of the year, including through April and May. And we're seeing that as things like the lockdowns in France are removed. And after the U.K. Prime Minister announced plans to exit lockdown in February, we started seeing more acceleration in Europe. So the booking window trends are positive and give us encouragement for what we're going to see in the back half of the year. But we'll just have to see what the lockdowns and other kind of travel restrictions look like for Europe for the back half. And then regarding the ROI and targeted digital marketing for hosts, this is one of the levers that we have. When we do target digital marketing for hosts, it would be in specific areas that we know are more supply-constrained and where we want to focus on it. We established a return on that investment for value of the hosts that we acquire through that channel. And it is one channel, but it's not the only one, and it's not the primary one. Again, the most important thing is to kind of step back and educate people about the benefits of hosting, and then make it easier for them to host once they start considering it. Sure. So the cancellation rates obviously were substantially elevated in 2020 versus 2019. They've begun to moderate so that they are sequentially below where they were at in 2020, but they're still moderately elevated versus the 2019 rate. So we're seeing a bit more returns than normal but it's not quite to historical level rates. Sure. Yes, I think that the best thing to do is actually kind of look at some of the guidance figures that we gave in the earnings call itself where we're basically expecting -- because it's harder to have visibility in the back half of the year. We're highly confident in the rebound that it's going to be coming. All the early indications are that it's there. But it's hard to kind of precisely pin down what Q3 and Q4 are going to do. So what we did do is give some perspective on what we expect out of Q2. And that is that our gross booking value in Q2 of this year will be higher than in Q2 of 2019, and that our revenue rate in Q2 will be similar to that of 2019, and that our EBITDA will be -- our adjusted EBITDA will be breakeven to slightly positive in Q2 of this year. So I think those are kind of the key things. Because as you said, as rebound comes back, the pace at which it comes back in the geographies that come back will affect the mix on those ADRs. And we do expect the ADRs to moderate, but it's hard to perfectly pinpoint down the specific of that mix."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Thank you very much, Ian. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I want to start by acknowledging the state of the pandemic. COVID-19 cases continue to surge in parts of the world such as India. And our thoughts go out to our hosts, guests and employees in India during this difficult time. There is much more work to do to limit the spread of the pandemic, and many people are still hurting. And we know how lucky we are to be in the position we're in today. 2020 was a year that none of us will ever forget. It was also a year when travel fundamentally changed forever. Airbnb changed as well. We sharpened our focus on our core business of hosting. And we got back to our roots, back to what is truly special by Airbnb: the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. And we emerged as a stronger and more efficient company. Our business rebounded faster than anyone expected, and it showed that as the world changes, we are able to adapt. Now turning to our Q1 results. Our business dramatically improved with the rollout of vaccines and the easing of some travel restrictions. While conditions aren't yet normal, they are improving. People's desire to travel, combined with our tightly managed expenses, drove a return to our positive top line growth and materially improved adjusted EBITDA. In Q1, our revenue was $887 million. This was an increase of 5% year-over-year, and it exceeded Q1 2019 levels as well. But here is the most important fact: Our business improved without the recovery of two of our strongest historical segments: urban travel and cross-border travel. We expect the return of urban and cross-border travel to be significant tailwinds over the coming quarters. Now as our top line recovers, we are maintaining our focus and our financial discipline to improve our profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA loss was $59 million. This was approximately $190 million better than the same period in 2019, and it was $275 million better than a year ago on essentially the same revenue. Now these results show that we are improving our variable costs, we're being disciplined with our marketing and our fixed costs. Our strong performance also indicates the beginning of the travel rebound. Just a few hours ago, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control said, \"If you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.\" What we think this means is that more people will be comfortable traveling. And it further strengthens our view that we are going to see a significant travel rebound. In fact, we expect this rebound to be unlike anything that we have ever seen before, and we expect travel to be very different than before. People are discovering that they don't have to be tethered to one location to live and work. And what this means is that people are more flexible about where and when they travel. People can now travel any time. People are also traveling everywhere. They're not just going to the same 20 or 30 cities. They're visiting smaller cities, towns and rural communities. And when people do travel, they're staying longer. 24% of our nights booked in Q1 were for stays of 28 nights or longer. People are not just traveling in Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. And these trends are not going away. The world is never going back to the way it was, and that means that travel is never going back to the way it was either. So let me tell you about what we're doing to prepare for what's ahead. Our single priority in 2021 is to prepare for the coming travel rebound. To do this, we're professing the end-to-end experience of our core service. This includes educating the world about hosting, recruiting more hosts, simplifying the guest experience, and delivering a world-class service. Now I'm going to briefly share how we're executing against each of these areas. First, we are educating the world about what makes Airbnb different: hosting. In late February, we launched our first large-scale marketing campaign in five years, Made possible by Hosts. We're educating guests about the benefits of being hosted, and we're aspiring more people to become hosts. Now while it's still early, the campaign is being well received. In markets where we're running the campaign, overall traffic is up, first-time bookers are up, traffic from prospective hosts is up, and our brand favorability is up. Second, we are recruiting more hosts, and we are setting them up for success. To build on the momentum of our marketing campaign, we launched an accompanying digital campaign that's focused on recruiting new hosts. And we've completely redesigned the end-to-end experience of being a host on Airbnb. We're making it easier for anyone to start hosting. Third, we are simplifying every part in the guest experience. In February, we launched a Flexible Dates feature. It allows guests to browse options while being flexible on the exact dates of their trip. Now since the feature launched, there have been more than 90 million Flexible Dates searches on Airbnb, 90 million searches since just February with Flexible Dates, this new feature we created. And guests who used this feature have converted at a higher rate than guests who do not. Now this is just one of many improvements that we are making to the guest experience. And finally, whenever our guests or hosts need us, we must deliver world-class service. So to prepare for the travel rebound, we're improving our community support products, enhancing our safety protocols, and we're scaling our operation by ramping our third-party support. Now I want to wrap by highlighting a major announcement that we have coming up in less than two weeks. On May 24, we will announce the most comprehensive update to the Airbnb service in 12 years. As part of this special announcement, we're going to share insights on how travel is fundamentally changing, along with updates we've made to prepare for what's ahead. We're going to unveil a simpler and more inspiring guest experience. And we are going to show you upgrades that make it even easier to be a host on Airbnb. So watch the announcement with the airbnb.com on Monday, May 24. So to summarize, we're pleased with the strong Q1 results. We are encouraged by the trends that we're seeing driving these results, and we are executing against our 2021 plan to prepare for the travel rebound. And we think this travel rebound will be unlike anything we've seen before. We think this is the travel rebound of the century. So travel is coming back, and Airbnb is ready. And with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions. Thank you very much, Justin. So why don't I start? And Dave, feel free to add in after I go. So let's start with hosts, and then we'll go to guests. So Justin, let's just start with we have 4 million hosts on Airbnb. And I think if you asked people a year ago, would we have had such a stable host community? They probably wouldn't have expected that. But what we have today are hosts that offer 5.6 million listing. And these 5.6 million listings more about 1 million more than we had this time in 2019 and what we've actually seen is a large growth in non-urban listing. So we actually have a 30% growth in non-urban and vacation rental listings as well. Now it's important to note that 90% of our hosts, our everyday people, they're individuals. And the reason why is as we've made hosting on Airbnb easier, more and more hosts are coming to Airbnb as well. Now specific to what we're doing, we launched our first global campaign in five years, Made possible by Hosts. As I said, we also have an accompanying host campaign. Both of these campaigns, we are seeing significantly larger traffic of prospective hosts to the platform. The next thing we're doing is we're making it even easier to become a host by reducing number of steps to become a host. And as we reduce the number of steps, conversion rate for hosts gets even easier. We now are allowing hosts to be paired with other super hosts to help them get started, and we have webinars as well. And then finally, we have new tools and services that's going to make it even easier for hosts to list and be successful. I'll just end this in by saying on May 24 we will unveil a number of new tools and service that I think are going to make it much easier for hosts to get started. And I want to point out that new hosts that join Airbnb, 50% of them get a booking within four days of activation. And I think hosting is something at the perfect time for many people in the world. Because Airbnb, we started actually after the Great Recession in 2008. And at that time, there were many hosts, many people that were looking at Airbnb as a financial lifeline. I think if you think about the number of hosts on Airbnb, the top occupations of our hosts are health care workers, educators and people in food and hospitality. These are industries that have been hit really, really hard. So our job is to tell the story of hosting, the fact that on Airbnb you can make $8,000 on average if you have one listing, which is 5x you can make what an average American got in the stimulus check. So these are some of the things we're getting going, and we are just getting started ramping. And I expect us to get millions of more hosts in the coming years on Airbnb. Now as far as trends for guests, Justin, I'll also cover this as well. As I said before, I think two things are true. Number one, this travel rebound that is starting that is unlike anything we've ever seen before. And I think the Q1 results kind of demonstrate this. But the other thing that we're seeing is that travel is going to be very different than before. Probably the biggest changes are the following: number one, I don't think business travel is ever coming back the way it was before the pandemic. It's at least not going to look like it did. I do think a new kind of business travel may emerge. Many employees are working remotely. They're going to need to go back to headquarters occasionally. You're going to see longer stays going in cities. And so we're seeing elevated bookings in urban markets for stays of longer than 28 days. But the bigger trend is going to be flexibility. I think that all of us working around the world, most of us, if we're privileged enough to say this, are more flexible than we were before the pandemic. Because of the world of Zoom means a world where we can work anywhere, it's a world where many people are also choosing to live anywhere. And this has created three travel trends. Number one, people can travel anytime. This is why we have a Flexible Dates feature where instead of saying, \"I want to travel from July 5 to July 10,\" you can say, \"I want to go somewhere for a weekend, a week or a month anytime this summer.\" We've had over 90 million people use this feature. And as more people use this feature, conversion rate goes up. The second thing we're seeing is length of stay is increasing. In 2019 at this period of time, 14% of our nights were longer than 28 days. Now 24% of our nights are longer than 28 days. What that basically means is 1/4 of our business isn't travel, it's living. After 28 days, you're probably not traveling. And I think what this is a trend of is that traveling and living are going to begin to blur together. So this is the second trend we're seeing. And the third is people are now traveling everywhere. If you look at the concentration of our revenue, it is much more distributed than it was a couple of years ago. And this is because people aren't just going to the same 20 or 30 cities, they are getting in cars and they're traveling to small towns and rural communities, many of which don't even have a hotel. So again, the big trend is flexibility. People are traveling anytime, anywhere, and they're staying longer. We think all these trends are here to stay. And I'll just end by giving one more thought. I think there is a mass shift from mass travel to meaningful travel because people missed traveling. In fact in my surveys, people say the thing they miss the most that was taken away from the pandemic, at least from out of door activities, was travel. But they don't miss business travel. They don't miss standing in line in front of a museum or a selfie -- a landmark getting a selfie stick -- getting a photo with a selfie stick. What they really miss is spending time with the people they care about. And we call this meaningful travel. We have friends and families. We think Airbnb is really a great way to do that. So those are the trends that we're seeing. The two trends I do think are going to inverse are we are going to see a recovery of urban travel and the recovery of cross-border. This has been our bread and butter before the pandemic, and I think those are significant tailwinds for us. Yes. Dave, why don't I give you this question? And it's a great question, Mario. And I'll also say that in Q1, 28% of our hosts were now prior guests as well. So that number is increasing. But Dave, I'll hand it over to you. Yes. Dave, do you want to take this one as well? Yes. Thank you very much, Colin. Dave, why don't I take this at a high level, and you can obviously go into more detailed analysis? So Colin, a couple of things. Let me just first start and talk about our marketing strategy, and then I'll answer your very specific question about H2 marketing. First of all, we take a very different approach to sales and marketing, I think, than our competition. What we have is a full funnel integrated approach to marketing. And what we iterate is PR, brand marketing and performance marketing. And really PR, in addition to word of mouth, is the thing that really built our brand over the last 10 years. And because of that, Airbnb is a noun and a verb used all over the world. And this has led to 90% of our traffic being unpaid or direct even as recently as Q1. And even in this past quarter, with elevated marketing, we have similar traffic levels in 2019 but we spent 50% less on marketing. So we think that if you have a product that is unique and different, that the role of marketing isn't to buy customers, and the role of marketing is not sizzle. The role of marketing is education. And so what we have done is we're doing our first brand -- we did our first brand marketing campaign at a global level in five years. It was a campaign called Made possible by Hosts. And it's really just taking real photos from real guests on real trips to highlight what makes Airbnb different, which is hosts. We want our hosts to be as mainstream as the homes and spaces on Airbnb. Now while the results are still early, as I said, we have seen elevated traffic levels. And to answer your question on H1 versus H2, we decided to front load spending. We were prepared for a travel rebound unlike any other so we didn't want to spread the money over the course of the year. So we disproportionately put the spending in H1 to really capture as much of this demand as possible. And I think what we're seeing is that timing is going to bear out to be the right timing. And then as far as -- why don't I also answer product development at a high level? And then Dave, you can also go in. So at a high level for product development, here's what we've learned. Before the pandemic, we were a divisional structure. We had our core business of homes. We also had a business travel. We had -- we were working on a number of other divisions. We had many divisions. And because we have many divisions, we had multiple product development groups. And what we did is when we became a functional organization, and we got much more focused on hosting, we realized that we could be much, much more efficient. It's one of the reasons our product development group is much smaller than it was two years ago. And that's allowed us to move really, really fast. And I hope that you see on May 24 that even despite the team being smaller and more nimble, we've been able to increase the pace of development. I think people are going to be really impressed by what we're able to deliver. So that's at a high level. But Dave, I don't know if you want to jump in and talk specifically about the numbers. Yes. Thank you very much, Naved, for the question. Well, let me preface my answer with two comments. Number one, I'll be -- I'll try to be careful with predictions, because anyone that was compelled to making predictions last year was humbled. But something I'll say is no matter what happens with travel, I think one of the things we showed last year is that our model is inherently adaptable. And so we are adaptable to any travel changes. With that being said, I do think we have quite a bit of data. And so with the data we have and we're seeing, I think I can give you some indications, although it's going to be a little hard to pinpoint. We are seeing that as restrictions lift and cross-border begins, more people travel the cities. We're also seeing that the nature of travel to cities is changing. For example, more and more people are booking longer-term stays in cities. So the length of stay is going up. And one of the things we know is that the longer you stay somewhere, the more you're inclined to stay in a home. So I think that as restrictions lift in countries, as vaccinations rise, we think this is a significant tailwind to both urban travel and cross-border travel. So we're very, very bullish. It's a little hard to pinpoint, but I think the comments from the head of CDC today, the lifting of restrictions across Europe, these are all really, really good signs. There's no reason this wouldn't be a huge tailwind to urban travel and cross-border. Yes. Yes. I mean in New York City, in Los Angeles, a number of these cities, we almost have as many nights booked for stays longer than 28 days as we do stays under 28 days. In New York City, actually, the majority is over 28 days now. So I think that there's a huge opportunity. If you think about where business travel is going in the future, it seems completely intuitive to me that as companies offer more flexibility, more people are going to live around the world, but they're not all going to want to live remote. They're going to have to come back to visit. And so I think you're going to start to see longer stays. I think in addition to longer stays, you may also see business travelers traveling together. So let's say three different employees work in three different cities, and they have to come back to headquarters. They may not all get three different hotel rooms at Airbnb. They might get one house. They can split the cost. They can eat around the dinner -- the breakfast table in the morning. So I think the things that benefit Airbnb at business travel is group travel and longer-stay travel. Those two things, I think, are disproportionately beneficial to doing home, and these are general tailwind for business travel. Now I want to be clear. I mean people will, of course, travel for business again. I just think the bar to get on a plane to go to a meeting will be higher than before. Yes. Dave, do you want to take supply and demand? I can probably take the increase in pro hosts and key friction? Yes. And James, why don't I jump in and say this. One of the things that Dave just said, I want to put out underline under, highlights. Before the pandemic, most people came to Airbnb and they knew exactly where they were going and they knew when they were going. So we asked the question in the search bar, \"Where are you going?\" And we asked, \"When are you going?\" You put in date. The holy grail for matching supply and demand is to be able to also control where you can point demand. But we can't point demand to where we have supply if guests aren't flexible, if they're predisposed to where they want to travel. Now that guests are telling us that they're much more flexible about where they travel, we can point demand to where we have supply. This is probably one of the most important things we have. And it explains why when 90 million searches were used with the Flexible Dates feature, conversion rates went up. So that is just another thing I want to underline. Now regarding your next two questions, let's talk about pro hosts and hotels. Obviously, Airbnb created a new category in travel because we created tools that allowed everyday people and individuals become hosts. And yes, out of 4 million hosts, 3.5 million are individuals. That being said, we welcome all hospitality providers on Airbnb. And we have hundreds of thousands of professional hosts and professional hospitality providers. The way we think about it is when a guest comes to Airbnb, they're looking for a place to stay. And so we don't want them to leave without having found something they want. Typically, they come to look for individual hosts, that's what we're known for. But we want to make sure that we have professional hosts and hotels to serve those customers and to fill in our network gaps. So we're continuing to develop new tools and services over the coming years to continue to welcome these providers onto our platform. And I think they're going to obviously benefit from all the demand that we have. Now as far as key friction to becoming a host, one of the things we've seen, probably the main learning we've had is as we make it easier, more people do it. That's the name of the game, make it easier and more people do it. Before Airbnb, it was really hard to rent your home on the Internet. People did it, which is hard, and we made it easier. And on May 24, we're going to show a number of tools, a number of offerings and innovations that we have that are going to make hosting even easier. We're reducing the number of steps to become hosts. We're making it even easier by providing more tools and support. And we're going to offer some better tools and services for hosts once they become host. And so I think all these things will reduce the number of frictions as well. Dave, do you want to take this one? Yes. thank you very much, Brian. Dave, why don't I take the second question on monetization and take rates? Why don't you take the question on new users, what are we seeing for new users from retention and booking? And then Brian, to your question about monetization and take rate, we absolutely see lots of opportunities to increase our monetization and take rate for both guests and hosts. For example, one of the things we've said is that many of these tools and services we've offered in the last five years, they're incremental, we haven't charged for. For example, unlike our competitors, we offer free protection of $1 million against theft, property damage and personal liability in countries all over the world. And as we added these services, we do not charge incrementally for these. Our general principle is we always want to give away more value than we're taking, but we do think there's opportunities for us to do -- to offer some more tools and services to increase take rate. Now that being said, focus is critical. And we are focused on the most perishable opportunity. The most perishable opportunity right now is to capture as much travel demand as possible and be ready before anyone else is for this travel rebound. So we are making sure that we have enough hosts for this travel season. We simplified the guests experience, and we're providing world-class support. So that's where we're focused on this year. But make no mistake, we have many opportunities in the years ahead. Yes, I can take this at a high level. Dave, again, feel free to jump in as well. Mark, thanks for the question. What we saw with COVID was actually a positive reset in our relationship with cities all over the world. Now first, let me just start by saying we now collect/remit taxes in 30,000 jurisdictions. We collected and remitted to date $2.6 billion of transient occupancy taxes. What happened with COVID is two things: Number one, travel went from being concentrated in very few top cities to distributing everywhere, thousand cities around the world. Though we do see an urban recovery, we don't see that trend completely reversing. Because I think in a sense, you could say the genie's out of the bottle, a number of people have realized that there's all these really cool small towns, rural communities and small cities, many of which don't even have hotels. And so they're really important destinations. The other thing that we've noticed, though, is that a lot of cities have been hit really hard by the devastating economic effects of the pandemic. So you'll see major cities have had major tourism shortfalls, major tax shortfalls. And because of this, what we're actually seen is a lot of cities reaching out to us. In fact, we struck over 100 partnerships over the course of just the pandemic with destination marketing organizations, which as you know are basically tourism bureaus and tourism arms. From Scotland to Portland, we've been doing partnerships with cities all over the world. And to scale our partnerships to thousands of cities, we launched last year the City Portal as well. So this is what we're seeing. I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything to that. Yes, these are two really good questions. Let me start with the first one. So as you point out and as I said, one of the kind of -- one of the trends that has been pretty remarkable over the last year is as more people have more flexibility, they can work from home. And that means they can work from any home, often on Airbnb. And so one of the things we're doing is we're continually trying to make it even easier for guests to be able to search anywhere around the world. And on May 24, we're going to show you some new tools and new ways to make the experience of searching on Airbnb, especially allowing you to search with more flexibility, even easier. Again, the type of flexibility we're looking at is people staying longer, booking any time and be able to go anywhere, not just to the same top destination. So we are going to continue to look at innovation in this area. And I think the other thing I'll just point out is, again, in 2019, only 14% of our nights booked were longer than 28 days. That's now 24%. And so we think this is a huge growth area for us. We think basically, 1/4 of our business is not even travel anymore. There's a lot of innovation opportunities for us. We're a design-led company at our heart. And I think they're going to offer a lot of really interesting opportunities. Now specific to our San Francisco employee base, let me talk a little bit about what I told our employees a couple of weeks ago. I told them there's two guiding principles. Number one, we want to model the live anywhere lifestyle. So by modeling the live-anywhere lifestyle, we're going to allow more flexibility for our employees. So I told our employees, they don't have to come back to the office until next September. We're going to allow a lot of flexibility. And even when we do ask people to come back, they're going to have a lot more flexibly before. People aren't going to be expected to come back to the office five days week every week. We think that is really not how most workplaces in the 21st century are going to operate. That being said, as an incredibly light company, we also do think that in-person collaboration is important. So we want to find some balance between modeling the live-anywhere lifestyle and allowing for in-person creative collaboration. And that's what we're designing. We want to get it right. We don't want to rush into this. So that's what we're going to be working on over the course of next year. Thank you, Justin. It was a little bit hard for me to hear you, but I think the question was what are we doing to drive more inspiration and discovery on Airbnb, inspiring where you can go and what you can do, correct? I just want to make sure I -- I couldn't the end of that last question. Okay. I'll answer that. So yes, so inspiration is something that we're really focused on. Actually if you go to airbnb.com right now, if you type Airbnb.com, you're going to notice on our top of our homepage, there's a big piece of art and it says, \"the greatest outdoors.\" So we just launched wish lists that are curated by Airbnb. And if you click on Get Inspired, you're going to see a number of wish lists. So this is just the beginning of a number of things we're doing to try to inspire more travel. On the home page below that, you're going to see that we're now merchandising places you can go nearby. So between wish lists, nearby travel and then some of the updates we have on May 24, I think that's going to continue to drive more and more inspiration. On May 24, though, we are going to showcase some new exciting features that I think are going to inspire people around flexibility. Because one of the things we've seen is if you are more flexible about where you travel and when you travel, then what that kind of means for some people is the home becomes the destination, suddenly where you go is less important than the type of home you say in. And so this is how we're thinking about it, and hopefully, if you can tune in, we can show you some of the things we're working on. Great, Lloyd. So I'll take the first question on occupancy rate. Dave, you can take the second one. The answer to your question is yes. Occupancy rates, we think, average on global level will go up as we get better at matching supply and demand. The basic name of the game is in classic travel a lot of people try to go to the same place on the same date. That's why kind of when you show up to Paris in the summer, and there's a whole bunch of people in line at a landmark is because they're going to the same place at the same time. So to increase occupancy rates, there's one or two things we can do. We can add more hosts to the same places that everyone is going to, or we can point demand to other places. And as length of stay increases, as people shift from going to 20 or 30 cities to thousands of communities, and as people become more flexible when they travel, we can then show them deals. We can show them, for example, I know you want to go to -- we'll make up the place, France, in July. But if you went in September, you could get -- you could save a lot of money because there's fewer people there. Or we can point you instead of in Paris, we can point you to Brittany or some other community. So there's a lot of opportunities for us, I think, to point demand to where we have available supply, which will allow us to steadily increase occupancy. What it means is we don't need to increase supply linearly with increasing revenue. We can get more productivity out of the supply that we have. And Dave, I don't know if you want to take ADR. And the other thing I want to say, again, is -- yes, another thing I'll just say is as demand increases on Airbnb, that can also correspondingly increase supply. So again, one of the things we published in our S-1 was 23% of our new available hosts in 2019 were guests. That increased to 28% in our new available hosts that started out as guests in Airbnb in 2020. So we also think there's a really interesting flywheel where we can point demand where we have supply. We have a muscle to continue to add hosts, and but we can also convert guests to hosts. And as that number keeps increasing, that's another big lever for us. Yes. Dave, you want to take that? Yes. Thank you very much for the question. So here's what I'd say about experiences. When we came back in the beginning of 2020, I really thought experiences would be a breakout year last year. It turns out a pandemic was a very difficult year for experiences. We had to put products on hold. We remain very, very bullish about experiences over the long term. One of the reasons we remain bullish is because the percent of guests leaving a five-start review with experiences is higher and remains higher than percent of guests who leave a five-star review for homes. But the pandemic was a difficult time for experiences. So we launched online experiences, which is the way to have an experience without leaving your living room. And I am thinking that in the coming years, experiences will be successful because there's fewer alternatives. There's fewer mass tour operators, bars, lounges and restaurants that are going to be operating at full capacity. So we do think there's a window, and we're playing the long game on this one. Very good question, Stephen. Let me tell you what we're seeing so far. One of the things is we did travel surveys in the beginning of the year. And we surveyed people in the United States. We also surveyed people around the world. And in our surveys, what we found is that the out-of-home activity people missed the most, more than restaurants, more than bars, more than sporting events, more than concerts, was travel. The kind of travel people missed was not business travel. It was not mass travel, going to crowded destinations. It was really just spending time with people that they've not been able to see during the pandemic. I think that we generally just yearn for what was taken away from us. And travel and spending time with people was something that was taken away from us. Now with regard to your question about are we seeing people upgrading? We have seen, as we mentioned, a material increase in the average daily rate in the United States. And this does give us a sense of consumer willingness to spend. Maybe another way of saying it is maybe before the pandemic, people were booking studio apartments in cities. Now what we're seeing is a pretty big expansion of people booking entire homes, typically even more bedrooms, the number of guests per reservation has increased considerably. And so correspondingly, people are spending more money. I think that trend, of course, will get normalized over some period of time when other geographies recover and urban recovers. But I do think that we are going to see sustained confidence, there's no question. Yes. Dave, why don't you take these two questions. You're welcome. Dave, do you want to take this one for Kevin? Thanks, Tom. Dave, I'll give you this one. All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I just want to recap. We are really proud of our strong Q1 results. We believe they're a testament to our focus and the adaptability of our model. And we've shown over the past year that as the world changes, Airbnb can adapt. I think we're now well positioned for the travel rebound ahead. As travel returns, Airbnb will be ready, and our hosts will be ready as well. So I hope you'll join us on May 24, where we'll share insights on how travel is fundamentally changing and announce the most comprehensive update to Airbnb service in 12 years. Thank you, and we'll see you then."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call.  I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's Fourth Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Arrium's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky, and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson.  Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter of 2022. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance.  Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our IR website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.  And with that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you very much, Elie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Before I share our results, I want to tell a quick personal story. As you may have seen, I've started hosting again. Last November, I listed my guest room on Airbnb. My listing is called Beyond the Airbed. And the run guests is a histologically themed around the early years of Airbnb. There's memorabilia in the walls. From the receipt for the original airbed to old photos and me hacking boxes of Obama Os and Cat McCain breakfast cereal. When guests arrive, I have welcome basket waiting for them. And the first night we make dinner together, followed by desert. We bake [indiscernible] Chip, chocolate chip cookies from my cherished family recipe that I got off Google. The next day, we tour the airbnb office with my golden retriever, Seltenova, and I tell the story of building Airbnb.  Now why am I doing this? Well, because I love hosting. Joe and I were the first host on Airbnb 15 years ago. And having guests staying at your home with you is the original idea behind Airbnb. It's been an amazing way to connect with people. But I also believe that companies that makes the best products make products for themselves. And Airbnb will only be as successful as our host. And the best way to understand our host is to be one.  Since I've resumed hosting, I've got new first-hand insights that have informed some of the new products we'll be releasing, including some exciting updates this May as part of our 2023 summer release.  Now before we get into our quarterly results, I want to recap the full year of 2022. While we're 3 years out from the start of pandemic, we are still living with this impact. We've also seen high inflation, recessionary fears and the war in Ukraine, all of which we're still dealing with in 2023.  And yet, through all this, people continue to travel, and 2022 was a record year for Airbnb. Revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year. Net income was $1.9 billion, which marks 2022 as our first profitable year -- full year on a GAAP basis. And finally, free cash flow was $3.4 billion. And this $3.4 billion of free cash flow represented a free cash flow margin of over 40%. And because of our strong balance sheet, we are able to begin buying back stock last year, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in shares in just the past 5 months.  Now during the height of the pandemic, we made some very difficult choices to reduce our spending making us a leaner and more focused company, and we've kept this discipline ever since. In over each of the past 2 years, we've only modestly increased our headcount.  In fact, compared to 2019, our headcount is actually down 5%, while our revenue is up 75%. In every single quarter in 2022 outperformed past comparable periods. In Q4, net income was $319 million. Now this is $264 million higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $506 million, which is 52% higher than Q4 of 2021. And we generated $455 million of free cash flow, and this is 20% higher than Q4 2021.  During the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand at Airbnb remains strong. Nights and experiences booked increased 20% in Q4. We had our highest number of active bookers ever in Q4, demonstrating guest excitement of travel on Airbnb despite evolving economic uncertainties. During the quarter, we also continued to see guest booking trips further advance supporting a strong backlog for Q1.  Second, guests are increasingly returning to cities and crossing border. And this is the bread-and-butter before the pandemic. Now both segments continue to accelerate while non-urban and domestic travel remains strong. Cross-border growth nights booked increased 49% compared to last year. High density urban nights grew 22%. And globally, we saw cross-border travel to all regions increased despite continued foreign currency volatility.  Third, the guests continue to book longer stays on Airbnb. During Q4, long-term stays remained stable from a year ago at 21% of total gross nights booked in Airbnb. And finally, we saw tremendous growth in our supply on Airbnb. We ended 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. Now excluding all the Mainland China listings we removed in July, we grew supply by 900,000 listings, or 16% compared to a year ago, representing an acceleration in growth in listings relative to Q3.  Now why are listings accelerating in growth? We believe there's probably 2 factors that drove this growth. First, demand to drive supply. Post or attracted the supplemental income that they can earn an Airbnb, which is often critical during tough times. Second, our product improvements are working. Over the past 2 years, we've made it more attractive and easier to become a host. Just this past November, we introduced Airbnb set up where prospective host can connect with Super Host for free one-to-one guidance all the way through their first reservation. The number of new active hosts recruited with the help of our super House increased by more than 20% compared to prelaunch. But we are not stopping there.  In 2023, we're focused on 3 strategic priorities. First, we want to make posting mainstream. If you're listening to this call, you've likely travel on Airbnb or you know someone who have. We want hosting on Airbnb to be just as popular and to achieve this, we'll continue to raise awareness around hosting, make it easier to get started and provide even better tools for hosts.  Second, we are perfecting our core service. We want people who love our service. And that means obsessing over every single detail, and we've listened to our hosting guests and based on their feedback, we're making a large number of upgrades to our service this year, including improving customer service, making it easier to find the right home and delivering greater value and much, much more. And you'll see more of this in the forthcoming in the coming months, especially our release.  And finally, third, we're expanding beyond the core. We have some pretty big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. And this year, we're going to build the foundation for future products and services that will provide incremental growth for many years to come.  So with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Great. Great quarter and great execution. Just 2, if I may. Just one, can you talk about how your urban supply is trending and sort of some of the initiatives you're doing around apartments?  And then, Brian, you did mention headcount. In Silicon Valley, there's obviously a lot of layoffs. You're one of the companies that are growing, having expanding margins. So can you talk about like your ability to attract top tech talent to execute on some of the initiatives you just talked about?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, absolutely. Yes. So let's start with the first one, urban supply growth. Let me kind of first start, Jed, by just talking a little bit more about how we think about supply. The great thing about our supply is that the vast majority of hosts that come to Airbnb come organically, and that's because of our global network. In fact, the #1 source of host are prior guests. And in Q4, 36% of our hosts were prior guests.  And one of the other things we see is the fastest-growing market where we have supply is also the fastest-growing market we have demand. And I think what's happening is a lot of our hosts are regular people. And as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends. And so this network is something that has a kind of self-growing effect to it. Now in addition to that, we've been doing a number of initiatives. Number one, we've been focused to make hosting easier with Airbnb set up. And between that and a new campaign we've been running Jed called Airbnb, which is basically this idea that if you have a space, you have an Airbnb. Between these 2 initiatives, we've seen twice the amount of traffic to our host landing page, the landing page to learn about hosting. And then we also have made big improvements to making hosting easier.  Now in addition, you might have seen that last November, we announced a new initiative called Airbnb from the apartment. Airbnb from the apartments, I think can unlock a large amount of inventory in multifamily homes in urban areas, and we worked with Greystar and a number of the other largest real estate developers in the United States. We have 175 buildings in Phoenix, in Jacksonville, in Houston and other cities. And the response from landlords have been very, very positive. So we are seeing a lot of traction on urban supply. I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything before I talk of headcount.\nDavid Stephenson: You covered really well because this has been a historic strength of ours has been kind of the urban part of the business, it's taken longer for that to kind of recover. It's now well above 2019 rates, and it's actually part of the areas that accelerated our growth in Q4. So we're very happy with where we're at with Urban. And as Brian said, the early days of Airbnb friendly apartments has been very well adopted, and we're excited about the potential in that part of the business.\nBrian Chesky: And just on your question, Jed, on headcount, something was really interesting happened. So obviously, in 2020, we had to make some really difficult decisions -- and we became a much smaller and more focused company. And the obvious result of that is that we got more efficient and more profitable. But there was a less obvious result. What ended up happening is we have fewer people in meetings and people can move a lot faster. And we concentrate all of our very best people and put them on only a few problems. And I think that's been an explanation for why the company has grown really quickly.  But also, I think it's made us a much more attractive place to work because it's much easier to get work done. And we have a general philosophy that we want the very best people in every field to come to Airbnb in every function. We're functionally organized. And I think that we're one of the few tech companies that isn't doing layoffs. We're not cutting. We're not freezing. We're actually stepping on the gas. But in our mind, stepping on the gas doesn't mean adding a huge amount of people, we're going to continue to stay really lean, but we're really focused on just really hiring in key positions.  And we -- and again, I kind of use this analogy that we're not building like a giant Navy, it's more like the special forces that's what we're focused on. So we've had a lot of success with talent. And of course, we're getting a lot of inbound.\nDavid Stephenson: Add to a couple of things. One is our headcount is actually still 5% below where it was in 2019. We have a revenue is 75% higher. So we're nearly twice as big as we were previously with fewer people. And I'd say the other is our Live and Work Anywhere approach, our approach to being very intentional about how we gather in person. We believe that actually working together in person is very important, just need to do it in a very coordinated way. So actually having people being back in the office on random days of the week is not very effective, but being -- doing it in a very controlled and planful way is respectful of employees' time and is more efficient for the company, and our employees love it. And I think that's also enabling us to attract great talent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Sanford C. Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Two, if I may. The first one, just around, I guess, some of the changes that might come over the coming years with regard to the distribution landscape. One of your rivals is going to wrap their vacation rental business into a loyalty program, lots of talk around conversational AI and what that can do to the distribution landscape. So just any comments to whether Airbnb needs to do anything further on the distribution platform? And then second one, a little bit more preset, but obviously, it looks like Q4 was a very good quarter for take rate. Have you done anything in particular there on take rate to achieve that result?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to start with take rate and I'll end with distribution after.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. With take rate, there's nothing in particular that we've done with take rate there. Absolutely, on a time-adjusted basis, the amount that we take from each night's day has been very stable. And so any variation in take rate of revenue over gross booking value is just variation quarter-to-quarter. So nothing on take rate.\nBrian Chesky: And maybe, Richard, just if -- can you just clarify what you mean by distribution landscape? Do you mean like the competitive environment or how?\nRichard Clarke: The competitive landscape, competitive environment with regard to distribution, whether you see any threat or increased threats from loyalty program wrapping around your competitors and maybe the conversational AI that's coming into various other search platforms at the moment.\nBrian Chesky: No. I mean, like, I think there's just 2 things. On the competitive front, I mean, we have a lot of competitors and a lot of different categories. But I think Airbnb kind of stands in a class of its own. I mean we're now in over used all over the world. We're not just the U.S. business. We're not just the European business. We're a global business. We're not just vacation rentals. We're also urban and [indiscernible] and off the grid. We're known as an affordable way to travel, but we also have a lots of offering and everything in between.  So I think we have a pretty unique offering. And I think ultimately, 90% of our traffic comes direct. And that's because we have something that's unique. The vast majority of our homes don't exist anywhere else.  And what we're really just focused on doing is we're obsessing over providing the very best experience for guests. And if we do that and we perfect that experience and then we do really great marketing, I think we'll do quite well.  The only thing I'll say, Richard, on the distribution front is we have some unique assets that most other travel brands don't have. Let's take PR. There were 600,000 articles written about Airbnb last year. Airbnb is on social media a lot and a lot of people are talking about Airbnb on social media. So we generally have a slightly different approach to distribution, where we think just continually innovating on our product is great. The best loyalty program is building a product people love so much they want to come back and you have to pay them to come back. And we just take a full funnel approach to marketing around PR, and we think of our general advertising as really educating people on new products.  Now as far as the changing landscape for technology, I'm actually very excited about the possibilities of AI. I think Airbnb will uniquely benefit from this. And the reason why it's because Airbnb is a fairly difficult product challenge, which is unlike hotels, we don't have SKUs. There's no representative inventory. Every single 1 of our 6.6 million listings are unique guests left more than 100 million reviews last year. And to parse through all these reviews is very glorious. And I think that AI is going to really benefit our long tail of data. And the fact that our search problem isn't really a search problem, so much as a matching problem. -- right? If there's like 50,000 homes in a city, what's the right 1 for you, that's less of a search problem than a matching problem. And I think that AI is going to be a really good opportunity for us. And just stay tuned for some developments there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi.\nRonald Josey: Brian, you mentioned investments for 2023 and extending beyond the core, that's been a key question that we consistently get in terms of what's next. Any insights you can provide there would be helpful, maybe just is it building out the tech infrastructure? Or is it more sort of newer products that are coming down the pike?  And then I believe in the letter, we talked about 1.4 billion cumulative guest arrivals. And so I was wondering if you can talk more about the brand, the awareness overall and just that user mix in terms of returning users versus newer users.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Awesome. Well, let me start with investments for 2023. So the good news is that -- though we're investing this year and some new products and services to expand beyond the core, I don't think you're going to see any material changes in the P&L. We kind of think like I started my in my 2 friends. We didn't have very many resources back then. And the great thing about Airbus business is we're essentially a global network. So I think that we can incubate new opportunities, products and services for a relatively low amount of investment.  And as far as what you're going to see, I'd say there's going to be innovations on the guest and host side. On the host side, our general principle is that we want to always deliver more value for host number charging. And we have a 3% take rate on the host side, and we've been giving away a lot of products for free, like AirCover. And we launched aircover for host 2 Novembers ago. NPS for claims, reimbursement claims has gone up 70 points, so it's been pretty amazing.  And our general view on host are we're going to primarily give away most of our product service and innovation to them. But we do think there's some opportunities for eco services that Host might pay for. On the guest side, we started very modestly. You might have seen that we launched travel insurance, which is now in 8 countries, and that's been really, really successful. But I think there's many more opportunities around the like services.  Obviously, Airbnb experiences is something that we're beginning to really ramp up. And I think you're going to see a lot more traction in that product in the coming years. And I think there's going to be just a lot more around creating a step change in new service level and matching people to the right homes and experiences for them. So that's what I would say. Services on the host side, services on the guest side, there's going to be a lot of opportunities to revisit some of the end-to-end travel opportunities that we have, and you'll stay tuned for some cool innovation.  Oh, I'm sorry, brand awareness, sorry. Yes, brand awareness. On the brand awareness, again, we generally try to -- as I said the last part, we generally focus on a full funnel approach. 90% of our traffic is now direct. It's sustained that since we went public, it's always been about 90%. We have extremely high efficiency on things like performance marketing. And generally, the way we approach our brand is that Airbnb is a pretty ubiquitous brand. So what we really want to do now is continue to invest in awareness around our different innovations.  And there are going to be 2 things. Number one, we're going to be focused on educating people on our new services and offerings. So for example, there will be categories we've been running campaigns around that. And people have viewed 500 million -- people viewed listings, 500 million times for every categories. We're also continuing to raise awareness around hosting. We're going to grow as fast as we have host.  Now as far as how much traffic is coming from new returning, I don't know, Dave, do you want to share anything about that on where branded?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean the majority of our bookings come from past guests, and it's actually been the strong guest retention that we've had over years since the beginning of Airbnb, that's been a powerful driver of our growth. But I think what's also interesting is that we've introduced Airbnb to millions of new users since COVID. And the performance of those new users, the booking frequency of those new users from '21 that we saw into '22 has been very strong. And so really pleased with the new users that we've been able to track that look very, very similar to the historic type of users that we've had on Airbnb.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Two questions, please. I know you mentioned that guess to host ratio, I think you said something like 36% or something. I imagine you've got cohort data that shows that the percentage of guests that have converted into being host or and additionally, our host is actually higher, maybe much higher. Could you just qualify that or quantify that at all? I'm sure that's a pipeline, but just how robust is that pipeline when you look at the cohort data?  And then just very briefly on China. Just on the China outbound, can you just remind us how material that was to your business back when back in 2019, so we can get a sense of -- I know you've said that the China outbound market will gradually reopen -- but as it fully reopens, how much of an opportunity that is for you?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I mean I'll start, Mark. Yes. We've seen that third in Q4 2022, 36% of new available hosts who started out as guest in Airbnb. This is more than prior year. So this has been going up actually like year-over-year. So that number is going up. And it makes sense as Airbnb becomes more ubiquitous, but also it makes sense because a lot of people, they'll connect with a host, and they realize, wow, I can do this too. And the vast majority of our new listings are by individuals, not property managers. So there's this kind of interesting network effect where guest becomes host and then host becomes guest.  As far as China, we expect the recovery to be pretty gradual in China. We think the big prize in China is the outbound business. We think that there are going to be hundreds of millions of people that want to leave China to travel the world, and we think is going to be the best way for essentially Gen Z people to travel. I think they really want an authentic experience when they're traveling around the world. That being said, we are expecting a pretty gradual recovery in China.\nDavid Stephenson: And China kind of pre-COVID was in the kind of low single-digit percentage of our gross booking value. So it gives you some perspective of our opportunity. I think we think very -- could be large over an extended period of time, but it will take a while for it to be larger.\nBrian Chesky: And Mark, And just 1 other thing, yes, you are right that the cohorts are trending up. So for example, I think in Q4 2021, 33% of guests became host. In 2020, 28%. In 2019, 23%. So it is picking up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. Just the first one, and I'll talk about guests and hosts. Could you just sort of help us understand a little bit how fast did your new guests grow in 2022? And how are you thinking about sort of new guest growth in '23 sort of talk about EBITDA margins? Or what's your first cut and how fast guests could grow this year?  And then the second one, just any update on metrics or quantifying adoption around unflexible or any of the other tools that you've rolled out to sort of better improve the load balancing between supply and demand.\nBrian Chesky: Great. Yes, Dave, if you want to.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. No, sure. On the new guests, we don't disclose the exact number of the new guest growth. Like I said, I think the thing that I'm really pleased is that we've introduced Airbnb to millions of new guests since COVID and that they're performing similarly, not even stronger than kind of historic guests in terms of their rebooking rates. So I feel really good about the position we have for new guests.  A big piece of it is some of the brand marketing that Brian kind of mentioned earlier, is just making sure we have a lot of awareness of Airbnb, but just to also make sure that we're getting strong consideration of Airbnb as a true option for them. And again, in this last several years, we've been able to introduce Airbnb to millions of new people that might not have thought about trying us before. So I think that's been really helpful.  And I don't have a lot to say on flexible except that we have a very strong adoption of the feature that -- and we think that it's a great way for us to distribute demand to where we have supplied. And the flexibility features are a key benefit for Airbnb because we have this more difficult problem, as Brian mentioned earlier, of matching and trying to match the right guest to the right host and the flexible gives us the ability to do a better match.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And one of the things I'd just say, Brian, is that we've seen a permanent like shift in some of the travel booking behaviors on Airbnb since before the pandemic. And a lot of those changes have endured. And probably one of the most pronounced ones is just is incremental flexibility for people. We noticed more people are searching with more locations and using more flexibility features. And even before we built these features, we were seeing people entering a lot of different gate variations when they were searching. And so we were just really responding to where things are going.  And I think where this goes down the road is there's always going to be business travelers and families that know exactly where they want to go and when they want to go. But I think the long-term game here is increasingly, we're in 100,000 markets, people have not heard of 100,000 places. So the name of the game is pointing demand to where we have available supply, and that's kind of a big part of our product strategy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: So maybe on ADRs, you guys continue to surpass expectations with FX-neutral growth that probably came in the quarter at mid-single digits up year-on-year. Would appreciate that looking at the '23 pricing initiatives and mix will impact your ability to grow. but we've seen underlying pricing continue to offset these mix impacts.  So when you think about 2023, why can't ADRs grow again, given the strength of the overall industry is supportive of pricing for you guys.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Thanks on the ADRs. Yes, we were pleasantly -- there's 2 edges of the ADR. ADRs were up 5% year-over-year in Q4, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Obviously, foreign exchange brings you down to kind of minus 1% when you bring back nights that come, say, from euro or our GBP-denominated nights. And what we forecasted for going forward is modest decline year-over-year in ADRs largely driven by changes in mix, right? People going back to cities, cities are accelerating more cross-border travel mix towards lower ADR regions. It's a double-edged sword, clearly for the financials. It's helpful to have the higher ADR rates because they drive greater revenue, greater flow-through and greater profitability. But obviously, also ADRs are 36% higher than they were in 2019. So it's more expensive for guests to stay on Airbnb and frankly, other places.  I think the benefit that we've had is that even while ADRs are higher, we're providing great value. right? The ADRs on Airbnb still can provide a great location, maybe a fully stocked kitchen, a washer and dryer, all the reasons why you might want to stand at Airbnb versus other alternatives.  And so as we look forward in the year, we just want to make sure that we continue to provide great value to our guests. And that's why we're building some of the tools that Brian's talked about, which are things like giving tools to host to make sure that they understand the prices that guests are paying and making sure that they are providing -- continue to provide great value to guests.  So then the other thing we're doing is, even as ADRs might come down modestly through the year through -- largely through mix, and maybe some through pricing. It's just making sure that we're being really rigorous in our cost structure to kind of support declining ADRs, which is why we anticipate our EBITDA margins for the full year to be roughly the same as 2022 in that the headwinds from lower ADR rates will be offset by our efficiencies that we kind of drive internally.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Helpful. And then one follow-up on supply, if I could. Clearly, the product initiatives are driving impressive supply growth as everyone by seller rates and you guys are showing at this point. When I think about how that plays through into 2023, is there anything that we should be thinking about that can keep you from maintaining at these elevated rates, particularly given the fact that you will continue to iterate on the supply funnel to make it easier for hosts to come to the platform?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Very proud of the continued growth in our supply. And we highlighted in the letter because it's super important that we do our best to get a -- have a balanced marketplace, right? If we get too much supply too quickly, then hosts aren't happy because they're not getting enough bookings. We don't get enough supply early enough, then guests are not happy because they don't get the kind of selection they want. And actually, what we highlighted in the letter is that we have grown our supply by 26% since 2019, and yet our nights and experiences booked have grown by 24%. So we've actually had a nice balance in that, and then I'm very proud of the fact that we've had 6.6 million active listings here in the last year and $900,000 more from the beginning of the year, which just shows the strength of Airbnb and why host want to come to where there is demand. And then we'll just make it easier for hosts to become host on Airbnb.  So this will be a forever journey for us to keep providing supply where there is demand. And I think we've been doing it incredibly well for the last 10, 12 years, and we'll continue to do that.\nBrian Nowak: Yes. I think we just say, look, I think we're I think we're building a bit more of a muscle to around this. And I think it's been a really big focus of ours. So whether it's the product innovations, the awareness, focusing on even building, supply in key markets. I think it's been a really great muscle the team has built.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: I wanted to start with the new pricing and discounting tools that you're rolling out. It sounds like the expectation is that they're going to be sort of a net headwind to ADR. So can you just walk through the strategic rationale for the new products. I assume it's about sort of improved customer experience, but it would be great to get your perspective on that.  And second, nights and experiences on a quarter-on-quarter basis in 4Q and 1Q seem to be back on trend with the historical seasonality we saw pre-pandemic. Is this sort of the right way to think about the trend in nights and experiences throughout the cadence of the year?\nBrian Chesky: John, I'll start. On pricing and discounts, let's just take a step back. Airbnb, we started 15 years ago. And when we started, we started as an affordable alternative to hotels. And I think that affordability and great value is 1 of the key reasons that people use Airbnb, and we have to continue to make sure that we have that value. And as long as people feel like they have the best product at the best value for Airbnb, I think we're going to deliver a huge amount of growth in years to come.  And so there's really 3 things that we're doing. The first thing is transparent pricing with all-in pricing display. In Europe, in many countries around the world, we actually do show total price. But in the United States, the convention for travel companies show a low base rate. And then when you get to check out, there's additional fees. But we spent a lot of time listening to our guests and hosts. And we've heard from our guests, it's not -- a lot of them want to be able to see the total price upfront. And we spent a bunch of time in December, we rolled out total pricing includes all fees before taxes -- Since we've rolled it out, the impact on our bookings has been neutral.  Now I know there was a lot of -- we did -- there was a lot of speculation around what happened to show up on pricing. But I think that the response has been very positive. And we chose a very specific implementation and implementation we chose as a price toggle where you can turn it on or off. The basic idea is if people to control of how they want to see prices but also the active can the toggle on helps people understand why our prices are changing and why they might be displayed different than competitors.  So again, the impact has been neutral on bookings in the short run, but I actually think the impact on booking in the long run is going to be very positive because it's just a better experience, and it gives people more control.  The second thing is we are now prioritizing better value listing in search results. So in other words, we're going to take the total price in the total price into account when we're prioritizing bookings.  And then the third thing we're going to be doing is we're building new tools, pricing tools for hosts so that they understand the final price that they're showing to guests. One of the things we learned when we talk to hosts, they don't know the final price guests are paying. And if they did, they modulate some of the fees.  I think in the short run, it may have some modest impacts on ADR, but in the long run, I think what it's going to do is drive a lot more demand here at Airbnb, I don't know, Dave, do you want to add anything or take the second question.\nDavid Stephenson: No, I think you hit on all the key points on ADR. We're not anticipating a significant decrease in ADR as a result of the pricing tools. We just want to make sure that we're being transparent and helping host make sure that they're setting prices that are appropriate for their listings. So I think that on the nights and experiences trends, we're finally beginning to reach a point where the year-over-year comparisons are much more consistent. And so I think 2023 won't look exactly like 2022, but it's a much better guide than kind of historic years. So we are getting back to -- you'd be able to use year-over-year as a trend line for your forecasting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: First one is on the listings growth number, the $900,000 year-over-year. I was wondering if you could help break down that number further. For example, were most of these listings completely new listings or were a good portion of it reactivated say in urban areas? Just trying to see how this growth organic versus travel normalizing?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean the real thing about listings is think about how all listings work. In any given year, we have brand new listings, we have reactivated listings and then we have deactivated listings and some combination of each of those 3.  I'd say that the trends of each of those have been kind of up and to the right. In other words, I think we're showing improvement in fewer deactivations and strengthening of our new activations. And so the sum total of each of those is all contributing towards our growth, but I don't have any other more specific breakout to give to you.  I mean I think the other -- maybe the only other highlight I would give is it wasn't in just kind of 1 region, like we were seeing broad-based growth of listings around the world and then even by listing type. It was like 1 of the earlier questions about how is the listing growth around urban again, in Urban was 1 of the accelerating areas. So we've seen really nice growth in the urban where that comes back.  It just leads back to this marketplace dynamic that we have for Airbnb, which is we both work hard to get listings, proactively on our own and get them more organically where there's demand. and where there's not demand, that's also where you'll see deactivations or fewer listing growth. It tends to be self-healing over time.\nMario Lu: And the second one is on the lead time for bookings. In your outlook, you mentioned Europeans were booking summer travel earlier this year. So any commentary you could provide on just globally how lead times look thus far versus pre-pandemic? And any puts and takes to consider when thinking about the 20% room night growth is sustainable for the rest of the year?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. We're really pleased with the European lead times coming up. Europeans will tend to book their summer travel here in the beginning of the year. and to see them booking even earlier on Airbnb relative to our historic rates has been really great to see. Just, I think, shows the optimism that they have to kind of travel this summer.  And then broad-based, we are just seeing a slightly longer lead time more generally across Airbnb overall. So again, I just think that shows a nice optimism for people feeling confident that they can book for their summer travel season. So I think not much more to say than that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. I think you give it in the K, but can you give us the mix of Asia in '22? I don't know if you can now -- And then secondly, how do you think about the Asia recovery in China cross-border impacting results over the next 12 months?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The -- in the next 12 months, Asia is still recovering, right? Asia has still been down versus 2022 -- I mean 2019 and -- but they were the fastest kind of growing region in the fourth quarter. So we think it's pretty optimistic about the opportunity. And as Brian even mentioned about China, like the long-term outlook for, for example, Chinese outbound travelers is something that we feel very bullish on for over the long term. And in terms of the fourth quarter, APAC was 12% of the business in the fourth quarter.\nBrian Chesky: And maybe I'll just say that I think the Asia Pacific is a huge growth area for us going forward. And it's been a little bit of a slower recovery. And I think the reason why is Asia is historically more of a cross-border market. a lot of people in Asia is basically travel across countries. They don't have as big of a domestic market in any of these countries for the most part. And that's just been a slower recovery. But I think the one thing we've seen is that just means probably more pent-up demand, and Asia index is even higher on Gen Z travelers, which is a strong suit of Airbnb. So we're really bullish over the next few years on Asia.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Chris on for Lloyd. Just can you start by helping us think about the range of outcomes for ADRs in the 1Q '23 guide? I guess as we kind of lay out your guidance saying that take rates would be very similar to 1Q '22 levels and gets you to, say, $20.7 billion potentially of gross bookings in 1Q, '23, and you assume maybe a slight detail on room nights.  I could get to a situation where ADRs are potentially flat to better. I guess, is you're talking to ADRs being down slightly on a year-over-year basis. I guess, is -- what would need to happen here for ADRs to be flat to better on a year-over-year basis in 1Q?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, to be flat to better would be if there's stronger overall just pricing? And if the mix came in differently, for example, maybe urban didn't come in quite as strong as or cross-border Latin America, Asia didn't come in quite as strong. So a lot of our ADR forecast for Q1 comes from the anticipated continued growth of urban, cross-border and regional mix. And that's why we're forecasting it down for just down slightly year-over-year. the implied take rate, it should be directionally the same as last year and maybe not precisely the same, I think you look back in 2022 and it will be a good guide for your take rate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. And just maybe 1 quick follow-up question on the product side as you guys were talking about really kind of expansion opportunities. How should we be thinking about hotel within that? Or should we be thinking about more of the expansion opportunities being related to the core business and experiences in '23.\nBrian Chesky: Chris, I would just say, I mean all of the above, I think hotels are important ways to fill a network gaps. I think people come to be here because we have something unique they can't get anywhere else. But we also have a huge amount of traffic, and so we want to make sure people come here to me they don't leave without finding something.  So I think you can think about our product a few ways. Number one, our core business has a huge amount of growth ahead of us. And so we just want to first perfect the core experience by making it easier to find the right Airbnb, providing better service each step of the way and providing better value. Next, we have a lot of emerging use cases. those emerging use cases are longer stays, obviously, which is more than 1/5 of our nice book. We also have experiences that we're really focused on and continuing to fill out our network gaps. And then finally, beyond just all those are obviously new products and services over the horizon. So we kind of have a very balanced portfolio of all of the above.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: So a quick one. Given you have $10 billion in cash on the balance sheet and generated $3 billion in cash flow last year, not including the funds held on behalf of guests. Can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about capital allocation and share repurchases? And do you see a potential for repurchases to go beyond offsetting stock comp?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. really pleased with our cash position, right? We ended with $9.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year. That is after buying back $1.5 billion of stock.  We have $500 million left on the existing repurchase approval, and we anticipate that will be executing early in the year. But clearly, we're also in -- still in growth mode like we are using this balance sheet to make sure that we can invest in growth for the business in the future. Clearly keep enough cash for potential M&A opportunities, which could exist. And then to the extent that we can return stock and cash to shareholders through share repurchases that will be our primary vehicle that you would anticipate this year.  We're going to have about $1 billion of stock-based compensation. We'll at least be offsetting that through share repurchases and -- but I don't have anything more to say beyond that at this time, but we'll continue to evaluate what the appropriate amount of cash is to keep and how much we should continue to return to shareholders. But remember, we are still heavily in growth. We want to be able to invest in the long-term growth of this business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So can you talk about the typical behavior from the new host when they're onboarded? Do they start making only a small number of days available. And as time goes on and they get more comfortable with hosting they maybe make more time slots available throughout the course of the year because it seems like we're really preoccupied with the total host number because honestly, as disclosed, but I'm wondering if the aggregate availability growth has historically been a number that's been much higher than the property host growth?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Stephen, I can start. The general trend we see is that most people come to Airbnb with kind of more casual intent to host occasionally. Sometimes people come dara host on a one-off basis, for example, on this past weekend in Phoenix, we saw a really big surge of new listings for Super Bowl.  What we noticed is that over time, hosts generally increase the number of days available and they tend to get more productive every year. And so more and more nights get booked on a single listing. And then we also see a number of hosts add a second, third or fourth listing depending upon what markets they're in. So the general idea is that host get more productive, they eventually book more nights. Their ADR typically goes up as they accumulate more reviews. One of the things we recommend new hosts do is when they don't have reviews to start a little bit more affordably.  And then as they accumulate rate reviews, they can command a little bit higher kind of market pricing. And so those are the general trends we see a general uptick in ADR is to get more reviews and to build a reputation. They add more nights. And then occasionally, you'll see some people add additional listings depending upon the kind of segment they're in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: I just wanted to circle back on your comments on EBITDA margins for '23. You talked about maintaining margins with the variable cost efficiencies kind of being the offset to lower ADRs? Can you just walk us through a little bit more on those cost efficiencies that you're thinking about?  And then kind of related, how should we think about marketing spending? It sounds like you're going to shift more of the brand into 1Q. Is that just driven by a pull forward in bookings or more of just a shift in your strategy?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The way we anticipate our EBITDA margins for this year is that one of the headwinds is this anticipated ADR decline that we talked about earlier on the call, and that the ways in which we are going to be able to offset the margin impact of those declines will be through fixed cost discipline. We're going to continue to grow, but we're going to grow modestly. So think of our headcount growth being in the 2%, 3%, 4% range. So we'll keep having very good fixed cost discipline.  We've already addressed marketing in a minute because we've already addressed a lot of the marketing reductions, but we're just seeing strong improvements in our variable cost reductions as well, everything from community support costs, cost of payments costs, infrastructure costs. All those areas are just important and ongoing efforts for us to drive profitability.  As I mentioned earlier, we're still in heavy growth mode. I am not in profit maximization mode. I have a long list of things that we can invest in to drive further profitability. But I know that I can also afford with our headcount growth profitability improvements that can offset the ADR declines, and that's what we'll be investing in this year. And then we can keep working on the other variable cost improvements over time.  And then in terms of marketing, we've had the major step change reduction in our marketing expense. That was actually a strategic change all the way back in 2019. That's proven to be incredibly effective from 2020 all the way through 2022.  And what we've seen in 2023 is that marketing costs as a percentage of revenue for the full year will be about the same as what it was in 2022. But what we are doing is shifting some of the timing. We're just getting even earlier in the year to make sure that we're getting our message out to guests around the world. So they're ready to kind of make their bookings for kind of peak summer travel season, which is in the summer.  And so I think it's just we're getting more efficient and effective at the timing. And we think bringing forward a little bit more marketing into Q1 as a more effective use of our dollars.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Jones with JMP Securities.\nNicholas Jones: Can I go back to kind of the Airbnb friendly apartments. What does it look like to get property managers on board with this? And I guess, how much of the apartments that they're managing start to get unlocked? And I guess, what kind of runway do you see in these key markets to add on kind of meaningfully more property managers?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I can start, Nick. So yes, I mean this new program is something that we developed because actually, we started getting a lot of inbound from real estate developers. And they started -- we started saying if we made our buildings Airbnb friendly, would it make the building more appealing, especially to young people that are moving to markets in certain cities. And so we did a partnership. We started with working with Greystar, Equity Residential, over 10 other companies, and we've launched. We have 175 buildings in like Houston, Phoenix, Jacksonville -- and the vast majority of these units are kind of -- we expect if they were put on Airbnb, that would be a typical kind of ADR. They're usually 1 bedroom studios.  The tenants sign a sublease to a fixed number of days a year, they can rent typically less than 180 days. So the whole idea is these are people's primary homes, and they rent them when they're gone. And I think we're going to get a lot of demand because there's a lot of benefits to landlords.  Number one, a landlord get visibility control around who's doing what in their building. Number two, they get a lot of free demand of people that want to lease their apartments. And three, they get a cut on the commission. So based on what we're seeing, there's been a lot of positive word of mouth, many REITs and developers are engaging with Airbnb. We think we're going to be able to send a lot of traffic to them. And so I think this is a program that's going to grow quite a lot. And I also think what is strategic to us beyond all the incremental apartments that unlocks is we're now developing relationships with many of the biggest landlords in United States. And if that happens, I think you're going to see leases generally being more friendly to Airbnb.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham.\nBernard McTernan: On margins. So 2 impacts on ADRs, the mix shift in the pricing. It sounds like mix shift is contemplated in that flat EBITDA margin guide for '23, but can you still achieve flat EBITDA margins if that pricing benefit does come out modestly of ADRs. And as a follow-up, just if there's an estimate for how much FX weighed on EBITDA margins in '22, that would be helpful.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. On the 2 impacts, I mean, as you said, large forecast that we have for ADR moderation is due to the mix shift. Clearly, we want to make sure that we are giving tools to host to price effectively so that we have great value. We're not -- it will be -- time will tell how much change we're seeing ADR from those overall changes. I do have a fair amount of levers, as I said, over time, that I can pull in order to continue to improve the cost efficiency.  And if ADRs come down more, then I may need to pull a few more levers, but I feel confident we can deliver our EBITDA margin neutral in the face of whatever ADR headwinds that we see this year. So I think that's the main end piece. And then your second question again?\nBernard McTernan: Just if there is an estimate for how much FX weighed on EBITDA margins this year given the differential between where revenues are generated and where the costs are in the U.S.\nDavid Stephenson: Maybe we can follow up off-line on that. I mean it was a material probably several hundred million dollars, but we would have to give you the -- maybe we work off-line on a specific calculation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nThomas White: Any color or metrics you guys can provide on how cohorts of guests that you acquired during the height of the pandemic have been performing over the last several months kind of relative to customers acquired pre-pandemic. I'm just curious whether it looks like there might be any meaningful differences when it comes to, I don't know, frequency, spend levels, repeat rates, anything like that?\nDavid Stephenson: No, the actual frequencies take rate spend rates have obviously been very consistent with kind of pre-COVID acquired guests. So we feel really good about the new guests coming on and having them look very similar to historic guests, and so very consistent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Just a couple of ones. First, it's nice to see the supply growth, but can you talk about trends on the utilization side? I know you don't look at occupancy in a traditional sense. But any color on how the product initiatives like changing the search experience or I'm flexible from 2022 is kind of helping with utilization or occupancy on the platform?  And then second question, mix of long-term stays remains stable near 20%. How should we think about that for 2023? Is that a potential opportunity and an area of focus for 2023? What sort of product initiatives can you do to kind of take that mix higher given that it obviously helps with the marketplace balance.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Deepak, on the supply growth, I think the best measure to look at is you just look at the growth in supply that we had versus 2019 that we grew at 26% and our nights and Experiences book grew 24%, kind of largely in line -- we're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern. We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance, as I mentioned earlier in the call. If one gets out of whack too much than either the host aren't happy or the guests aren't happy. But I'm very pleased with the way in which we've been able to keep that balanced.  And then in terms of long-term stays, I mean, if you actually rewind the tape all the way back to pre-COVID time. Q1 of 2019, our long-term stays were about 13% of nights. By the end of the year, it was maybe 16% at nights. So I think 13% to 16%. Last year, it was kind of 19% to 21% or so, 21%, obviously, in the fourth quarter. So it's been elevated and fairly stable.  I think we see in Q1 this year is that we continue to see really strong growth in short-term stays and short-term stays kind of outpacing our growth a little bit in -- versus long-term stays here in the first quarter. So I anticipate it coming down just a little bit here in the first quarter on a mix basis, but it's largely just driven by the short-term acceleration that we're seeing and it's still remaining significantly elevated over 2019 rates.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session for today. I turn the call back over to Brian for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To recap, we had another record year in 2022. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both record high and free cash flow was $3.4 billion. I'm really proud of these results. And before I go, I just want to say how proud I am of our team. If you think about what we -- what this team has been through the last 3 years, initially losing 80% of our business, kind of rebuilding the company from the ground up and now just becoming a much more focused, disciplined company. This is a lot of momentum inside the company. And looking forward, we're already seeing some really strong demand in Q1. Consumer confidence to travel remains really high.  I think part of that is like no matter what happens in the world, people want to travel. And for many people, the office is now Zoom, the Mall of now Amazon, the theater is now Netflix. Travel is going to become a very important way that people experience the world this year. And so therefore, this is going to be an exciting year for Airbnb and for traveling all around the world. So with that, thank you all, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "You covered really well because this has been a historic strength of ours has been kind of the urban part of the business, it's taken longer for that to kind of recover. It's now well above 2019 rates, and it's actually part of the areas that accelerated our growth in Q4. So we're very happy with where we're at with Urban. And as Brian said, the early days of Airbnb friendly apartments has been very well adopted, and we're excited about the potential in that part of the business. Add to a couple of things. One is our headcount is actually still 5% below where it was in 2019. We have a revenue is 75% higher. So we're nearly twice as big as we were previously with fewer people. And I'd say the other is our Live and Work Anywhere approach, our approach to being very intentional about how we gather in person. We believe that actually working together in person is very important, just need to do it in a very coordinated way. So actually having people being back in the office on random days of the week is not very effective, but being -- doing it in a very controlled and planful way is respectful of employees' time and is more efficient for the company, and our employees love it. And I think that's also enabling us to attract great talent. Yes. With take rate, there's nothing in particular that we've done with take rate there. Absolutely, on a time-adjusted basis, the amount that we take from each night's day has been very stable. And so any variation in take rate of revenue over gross booking value is just variation quarter-to-quarter. So nothing on take rate. Yes. I mean the majority of our bookings come from past guests, and it's actually been the strong guest retention that we've had over years since the beginning of Airbnb, that's been a powerful driver of our growth. But I think what's also interesting is that we've introduced Airbnb to millions of new users since COVID. And the performance of those new users, the booking frequency of those new users from '21 that we saw into '22 has been very strong. And so really pleased with the new users that we've been able to track that look very, very similar to the historic type of users that we've had on Airbnb. And China kind of pre-COVID was in the kind of low single-digit percentage of our gross booking value. So it gives you some perspective of our opportunity. I think we think very -- could be large over an extended period of time, but it will take a while for it to be larger. Yes. No, sure. On the new guests, we don't disclose the exact number of the new guest growth. Like I said, I think the thing that I'm really pleased is that we've introduced Airbnb to millions of new guests since COVID and that they're performing similarly, not even stronger than kind of historic guests in terms of their rebooking rates. So I feel really good about the position we have for new guests.  A big piece of it is some of the brand marketing that Brian kind of mentioned earlier, is just making sure we have a lot of awareness of Airbnb, but just to also make sure that we're getting strong consideration of Airbnb as a true option for them. And again, in this last several years, we've been able to introduce Airbnb to millions of new people that might not have thought about trying us before. So I think that's been really helpful.  And I don't have a lot to say on flexible except that we have a very strong adoption of the feature that -- and we think that it's a great way for us to distribute demand to where we have supplied. And the flexibility features are a key benefit for Airbnb because we have this more difficult problem, as Brian mentioned earlier, of matching and trying to match the right guest to the right host and the flexible gives us the ability to do a better match. Yes. Thanks on the ADRs. Yes, we were pleasantly -- there's 2 edges of the ADR. ADRs were up 5% year-over-year in Q4, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Obviously, foreign exchange brings you down to kind of minus 1% when you bring back nights that come, say, from euro or our GBP-denominated nights. And what we forecasted for going forward is modest decline year-over-year in ADRs largely driven by changes in mix, right? People going back to cities, cities are accelerating more cross-border travel mix towards lower ADR regions. It's a double-edged sword, clearly for the financials. It's helpful to have the higher ADR rates because they drive greater revenue, greater flow-through and greater profitability. But obviously, also ADRs are 36% higher than they were in 2019. So it's more expensive for guests to stay on Airbnb and frankly, other places.  I think the benefit that we've had is that even while ADRs are higher, we're providing great value. right? The ADRs on Airbnb still can provide a great location, maybe a fully stocked kitchen, a washer and dryer, all the reasons why you might want to stand at Airbnb versus other alternatives.  And so as we look forward in the year, we just want to make sure that we continue to provide great value to our guests. And that's why we're building some of the tools that Brian's talked about, which are things like giving tools to host to make sure that they understand the prices that guests are paying and making sure that they are providing -- continue to provide great value to guests.  So then the other thing we're doing is, even as ADRs might come down modestly through the year through -- largely through mix, and maybe some through pricing. It's just making sure that we're being really rigorous in our cost structure to kind of support declining ADRs, which is why we anticipate our EBITDA margins for the full year to be roughly the same as 2022 in that the headwinds from lower ADR rates will be offset by our efficiencies that we kind of drive internally. Yes. Very proud of the continued growth in our supply. And we highlighted in the letter because it's super important that we do our best to get a -- have a balanced marketplace, right? If we get too much supply too quickly, then hosts aren't happy because they're not getting enough bookings. We don't get enough supply early enough, then guests are not happy because they don't get the kind of selection they want. And actually, what we highlighted in the letter is that we have grown our supply by 26% since 2019, and yet our nights and experiences booked have grown by 24%. So we've actually had a nice balance in that, and then I'm very proud of the fact that we've had 6.6 million active listings here in the last year and $900,000 more from the beginning of the year, which just shows the strength of Airbnb and why host want to come to where there is demand. And then we'll just make it easier for hosts to become host on Airbnb.  So this will be a forever journey for us to keep providing supply where there is demand. And I think we've been doing it incredibly well for the last 10, 12 years, and we'll continue to do that. No, I think you hit on all the key points on ADR. We're not anticipating a significant decrease in ADR as a result of the pricing tools. We just want to make sure that we're being transparent and helping host make sure that they're setting prices that are appropriate for their listings. So I think that on the nights and experiences trends, we're finally beginning to reach a point where the year-over-year comparisons are much more consistent. And so I think 2023 won't look exactly like 2022, but it's a much better guide than kind of historic years. So we are getting back to -- you'd be able to use year-over-year as a trend line for your forecasting. Yes. I mean the real thing about listings is think about how all listings work. In any given year, we have brand new listings, we have reactivated listings and then we have deactivated listings and some combination of each of those 3.  I'd say that the trends of each of those have been kind of up and to the right. In other words, I think we're showing improvement in fewer deactivations and strengthening of our new activations. And so the sum total of each of those is all contributing towards our growth, but I don't have any other more specific breakout to give to you.  I mean I think the other -- maybe the only other highlight I would give is it wasn't in just kind of 1 region, like we were seeing broad-based growth of listings around the world and then even by listing type. It was like 1 of the earlier questions about how is the listing growth around urban again, in Urban was 1 of the accelerating areas. So we've seen really nice growth in the urban where that comes back.  It just leads back to this marketplace dynamic that we have for Airbnb, which is we both work hard to get listings, proactively on our own and get them more organically where there's demand. and where there's not demand, that's also where you'll see deactivations or fewer listing growth. It tends to be self-healing over time. Yes. We're really pleased with the European lead times coming up. Europeans will tend to book their summer travel here in the beginning of the year. and to see them booking even earlier on Airbnb relative to our historic rates has been really great to see. Just, I think, shows the optimism that they have to kind of travel this summer.  And then broad-based, we are just seeing a slightly longer lead time more generally across Airbnb overall. So again, I just think that shows a nice optimism for people feeling confident that they can book for their summer travel season. So I think not much more to say than that. Yes. The -- in the next 12 months, Asia is still recovering, right? Asia has still been down versus 2022 -- I mean 2019 and -- but they were the fastest kind of growing region in the fourth quarter. So we think it's pretty optimistic about the opportunity. And as Brian even mentioned about China, like the long-term outlook for, for example, Chinese outbound travelers is something that we feel very bullish on for over the long term. And in terms of the fourth quarter, APAC was 12% of the business in the fourth quarter. Well, to be flat to better would be if there's stronger overall just pricing? And if the mix came in differently, for example, maybe urban didn't come in quite as strong as or cross-border Latin America, Asia didn't come in quite as strong. So a lot of our ADR forecast for Q1 comes from the anticipated continued growth of urban, cross-border and regional mix. And that's why we're forecasting it down for just down slightly year-over-year. the implied take rate, it should be directionally the same as last year and maybe not precisely the same, I think you look back in 2022 and it will be a good guide for your take rate. Yes. really pleased with our cash position, right? We ended with $9.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year. That is after buying back $1.5 billion of stock.  We have $500 million left on the existing repurchase approval, and we anticipate that will be executing early in the year. But clearly, we're also in -- still in growth mode like we are using this balance sheet to make sure that we can invest in growth for the business in the future. Clearly keep enough cash for potential M&A opportunities, which could exist. And then to the extent that we can return stock and cash to shareholders through share repurchases that will be our primary vehicle that you would anticipate this year.  We're going to have about $1 billion of stock-based compensation. We'll at least be offsetting that through share repurchases and -- but I don't have anything more to say beyond that at this time, but we'll continue to evaluate what the appropriate amount of cash is to keep and how much we should continue to return to shareholders. But remember, we are still heavily in growth. We want to be able to invest in the long-term growth of this business. Yes. The way we anticipate our EBITDA margins for this year is that one of the headwinds is this anticipated ADR decline that we talked about earlier on the call, and that the ways in which we are going to be able to offset the margin impact of those declines will be through fixed cost discipline. We're going to continue to grow, but we're going to grow modestly. So think of our headcount growth being in the 2%, 3%, 4% range. So we'll keep having very good fixed cost discipline.  We've already addressed marketing in a minute because we've already addressed a lot of the marketing reductions, but we're just seeing strong improvements in our variable cost reductions as well, everything from community support costs, cost of payments costs, infrastructure costs. All those areas are just important and ongoing efforts for us to drive profitability.  As I mentioned earlier, we're still in heavy growth mode. I am not in profit maximization mode. I have a long list of things that we can invest in to drive further profitability. But I know that I can also afford with our headcount growth profitability improvements that can offset the ADR declines, and that's what we'll be investing in this year. And then we can keep working on the other variable cost improvements over time.  And then in terms of marketing, we've had the major step change reduction in our marketing expense. That was actually a strategic change all the way back in 2019. That's proven to be incredibly effective from 2020 all the way through 2022.  And what we've seen in 2023 is that marketing costs as a percentage of revenue for the full year will be about the same as what it was in 2022. But what we are doing is shifting some of the timing. We're just getting even earlier in the year to make sure that we're getting our message out to guests around the world. So they're ready to kind of make their bookings for kind of peak summer travel season, which is in the summer.  And so I think it's just we're getting more efficient and effective at the timing. And we think bringing forward a little bit more marketing into Q1 as a more effective use of our dollars. Yes. On the 2 impacts, I mean, as you said, large forecast that we have for ADR moderation is due to the mix shift. Clearly, we want to make sure that we are giving tools to host to price effectively so that we have great value. We're not -- it will be -- time will tell how much change we're seeing ADR from those overall changes. I do have a fair amount of levers, as I said, over time, that I can pull in order to continue to improve the cost efficiency.  And if ADRs come down more, then I may need to pull a few more levers, but I feel confident we can deliver our EBITDA margin neutral in the face of whatever ADR headwinds that we see this year. So I think that's the main end piece. And then your second question again? Maybe we can follow up off-line on that. I mean it was a material probably several hundred million dollars, but we would have to give you the -- maybe we work off-line on a specific calculation. No, the actual frequencies take rate spend rates have obviously been very consistent with kind of pre-COVID acquired guests. So we feel really good about the new guests coming on and having them look very similar to historic guests, and so very consistent. Yes. Deepak, on the supply growth, I think the best measure to look at is you just look at the growth in supply that we had versus 2019 that we grew at 26% and our nights and Experiences book grew 24%, kind of largely in line -- we're not seeing any major shifts in overall kind of utilization rate that give us any concern. We feel like we continue to keep, in aggregate this nice balance of growing supply and growing demand, and we want to keep that relative balance, as I mentioned earlier in the call. If one gets out of whack too much than either the host aren't happy or the guests aren't happy. But I'm very pleased with the way in which we've been able to keep that balanced.  And then in terms of long-term stays, I mean, if you actually rewind the tape all the way back to pre-COVID time. Q1 of 2019, our long-term stays were about 13% of nights. By the end of the year, it was maybe 16% at nights. So I think 13% to 16%. Last year, it was kind of 19% to 21% or so, 21%, obviously, in the fourth quarter. So it's been elevated and fairly stable.  I think we see in Q1 this year is that we continue to see really strong growth in short-term stays and short-term stays kind of outpacing our growth a little bit in -- versus long-term stays here in the first quarter. So I anticipate it coming down just a little bit here in the first quarter on a mix basis, but it's largely just driven by the short-term acceleration that we're seeing and it's still remaining significantly elevated over 2019 rates."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you very much, Elie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Before I share our results, I want to tell a quick personal story. As you may have seen, I've started hosting again. Last November, I listed my guest room on Airbnb. My listing is called Beyond the Airbed. And the run guests is a histologically themed around the early years of Airbnb. There's memorabilia in the walls. From the receipt for the original airbed to old photos and me hacking boxes of Obama Os and Cat McCain breakfast cereal. When guests arrive, I have welcome basket waiting for them. And the first night we make dinner together, followed by desert. We bake [indiscernible] Chip, chocolate chip cookies from my cherished family recipe that I got off Google. The next day, we tour the airbnb office with my golden retriever, Seltenova, and I tell the story of building Airbnb.  Now why am I doing this? Well, because I love hosting. Joe and I were the first host on Airbnb 15 years ago. And having guests staying at your home with you is the original idea behind Airbnb. It's been an amazing way to connect with people. But I also believe that companies that makes the best products make products for themselves. And Airbnb will only be as successful as our host. And the best way to understand our host is to be one.  Since I've resumed hosting, I've got new first-hand insights that have informed some of the new products we'll be releasing, including some exciting updates this May as part of our 2023 summer release.  Now before we get into our quarterly results, I want to recap the full year of 2022. While we're 3 years out from the start of pandemic, we are still living with this impact. We've also seen high inflation, recessionary fears and the war in Ukraine, all of which we're still dealing with in 2023.  And yet, through all this, people continue to travel, and 2022 was a record year for Airbnb. Revenue of $8.4 billion grew 40% year-over-year. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased by 46% year-over-year. Net income was $1.9 billion, which marks 2022 as our first profitable year -- full year on a GAAP basis. And finally, free cash flow was $3.4 billion. And this $3.4 billion of free cash flow represented a free cash flow margin of over 40%. And because of our strong balance sheet, we are able to begin buying back stock last year, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in shares in just the past 5 months.  Now during the height of the pandemic, we made some very difficult choices to reduce our spending making us a leaner and more focused company, and we've kept this discipline ever since. In over each of the past 2 years, we've only modestly increased our headcount.  In fact, compared to 2019, our headcount is actually down 5%, while our revenue is up 75%. In every single quarter in 2022 outperformed past comparable periods. In Q4, net income was $319 million. Now this is $264 million higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $506 million, which is 52% higher than Q4 of 2021. And we generated $455 million of free cash flow, and this is 20% higher than Q4 2021.  During the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand at Airbnb remains strong. Nights and experiences booked increased 20% in Q4. We had our highest number of active bookers ever in Q4, demonstrating guest excitement of travel on Airbnb despite evolving economic uncertainties. During the quarter, we also continued to see guest booking trips further advance supporting a strong backlog for Q1.  Second, guests are increasingly returning to cities and crossing border. And this is the bread-and-butter before the pandemic. Now both segments continue to accelerate while non-urban and domestic travel remains strong. Cross-border growth nights booked increased 49% compared to last year. High density urban nights grew 22%. And globally, we saw cross-border travel to all regions increased despite continued foreign currency volatility.  Third, the guests continue to book longer stays on Airbnb. During Q4, long-term stays remained stable from a year ago at 21% of total gross nights booked in Airbnb. And finally, we saw tremendous growth in our supply on Airbnb. We ended 2022 with 6.6 million active listings. Now excluding all the Mainland China listings we removed in July, we grew supply by 900,000 listings, or 16% compared to a year ago, representing an acceleration in growth in listings relative to Q3.  Now why are listings accelerating in growth? We believe there's probably 2 factors that drove this growth. First, demand to drive supply. Post or attracted the supplemental income that they can earn an Airbnb, which is often critical during tough times. Second, our product improvements are working. Over the past 2 years, we've made it more attractive and easier to become a host. Just this past November, we introduced Airbnb set up where prospective host can connect with Super Host for free one-to-one guidance all the way through their first reservation. The number of new active hosts recruited with the help of our super House increased by more than 20% compared to prelaunch. But we are not stopping there.  In 2023, we're focused on 3 strategic priorities. First, we want to make posting mainstream. If you're listening to this call, you've likely travel on Airbnb or you know someone who have. We want hosting on Airbnb to be just as popular and to achieve this, we'll continue to raise awareness around hosting, make it easier to get started and provide even better tools for hosts.  Second, we are perfecting our core service. We want people who love our service. And that means obsessing over every single detail, and we've listened to our hosting guests and based on their feedback, we're making a large number of upgrades to our service this year, including improving customer service, making it easier to find the right home and delivering greater value and much, much more. And you'll see more of this in the forthcoming in the coming months, especially our release.  And finally, third, we're expanding beyond the core. We have some pretty big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. And this year, we're going to build the foundation for future products and services that will provide incremental growth for many years to come.  So with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions. Yes, absolutely. Yes. So let's start with the first one, urban supply growth. Let me kind of first start, Jed, by just talking a little bit more about how we think about supply. The great thing about our supply is that the vast majority of hosts that come to Airbnb come organically, and that's because of our global network. In fact, the #1 source of host are prior guests. And in Q4, 36% of our hosts were prior guests.  And one of the other things we see is the fastest-growing market where we have supply is also the fastest-growing market we have demand. And I think what's happening is a lot of our hosts are regular people. And as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends. And so this network is something that has a kind of self-growing effect to it. Now in addition to that, we've been doing a number of initiatives. Number one, we've been focused to make hosting easier with Airbnb set up. And between that and a new campaign we've been running Jed called Airbnb, which is basically this idea that if you have a space, you have an Airbnb. Between these 2 initiatives, we've seen twice the amount of traffic to our host landing page, the landing page to learn about hosting. And then we also have made big improvements to making hosting easier.  Now in addition, you might have seen that last November, we announced a new initiative called Airbnb from the apartment. Airbnb from the apartments, I think can unlock a large amount of inventory in multifamily homes in urban areas, and we worked with Greystar and a number of the other largest real estate developers in the United States. We have 175 buildings in Phoenix, in Jacksonville, in Houston and other cities. And the response from landlords have been very, very positive. So we are seeing a lot of traction on urban supply. I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything before I talk of headcount. And just on your question, Jed, on headcount, something was really interesting happened. So obviously, in 2020, we had to make some really difficult decisions -- and we became a much smaller and more focused company. And the obvious result of that is that we got more efficient and more profitable. But there was a less obvious result. What ended up happening is we have fewer people in meetings and people can move a lot faster. And we concentrate all of our very best people and put them on only a few problems. And I think that's been an explanation for why the company has grown really quickly.  But also, I think it's made us a much more attractive place to work because it's much easier to get work done. And we have a general philosophy that we want the very best people in every field to come to Airbnb in every function. We're functionally organized. And I think that we're one of the few tech companies that isn't doing layoffs. We're not cutting. We're not freezing. We're actually stepping on the gas. But in our mind, stepping on the gas doesn't mean adding a huge amount of people, we're going to continue to stay really lean, but we're really focused on just really hiring in key positions.  And we -- and again, I kind of use this analogy that we're not building like a giant Navy, it's more like the special forces that's what we're focused on. So we've had a lot of success with talent. And of course, we're getting a lot of inbound. Dave, do you want to start with take rate and I'll end with distribution after. And maybe, Richard, just if -- can you just clarify what you mean by distribution landscape? Do you mean like the competitive environment or how? No. I mean, like, I think there's just 2 things. On the competitive front, I mean, we have a lot of competitors and a lot of different categories. But I think Airbnb kind of stands in a class of its own. I mean we're now in over used all over the world. We're not just the U.S. business. We're not just the European business. We're a global business. We're not just vacation rentals. We're also urban and [indiscernible] and off the grid. We're known as an affordable way to travel, but we also have a lots of offering and everything in between.  So I think we have a pretty unique offering. And I think ultimately, 90% of our traffic comes direct. And that's because we have something that's unique. The vast majority of our homes don't exist anywhere else.  And what we're really just focused on doing is we're obsessing over providing the very best experience for guests. And if we do that and we perfect that experience and then we do really great marketing, I think we'll do quite well.  The only thing I'll say, Richard, on the distribution front is we have some unique assets that most other travel brands don't have. Let's take PR. There were 600,000 articles written about Airbnb last year. Airbnb is on social media a lot and a lot of people are talking about Airbnb on social media. So we generally have a slightly different approach to distribution, where we think just continually innovating on our product is great. The best loyalty program is building a product people love so much they want to come back and you have to pay them to come back. And we just take a full funnel approach to marketing around PR, and we think of our general advertising as really educating people on new products.  Now as far as the changing landscape for technology, I'm actually very excited about the possibilities of AI. I think Airbnb will uniquely benefit from this. And the reason why it's because Airbnb is a fairly difficult product challenge, which is unlike hotels, we don't have SKUs. There's no representative inventory. Every single 1 of our 6.6 million listings are unique guests left more than 100 million reviews last year. And to parse through all these reviews is very glorious. And I think that AI is going to really benefit our long tail of data. And the fact that our search problem isn't really a search problem, so much as a matching problem. -- right? If there's like 50,000 homes in a city, what's the right 1 for you, that's less of a search problem than a matching problem. And I think that AI is going to be a really good opportunity for us. And just stay tuned for some developments there. Yes. Awesome. Well, let me start with investments for 2023. So the good news is that -- though we're investing this year and some new products and services to expand beyond the core, I don't think you're going to see any material changes in the P&L. We kind of think like I started my in my 2 friends. We didn't have very many resources back then. And the great thing about Airbus business is we're essentially a global network. So I think that we can incubate new opportunities, products and services for a relatively low amount of investment.  And as far as what you're going to see, I'd say there's going to be innovations on the guest and host side. On the host side, our general principle is that we want to always deliver more value for host number charging. And we have a 3% take rate on the host side, and we've been giving away a lot of products for free, like AirCover. And we launched aircover for host 2 Novembers ago. NPS for claims, reimbursement claims has gone up 70 points, so it's been pretty amazing.  And our general view on host are we're going to primarily give away most of our product service and innovation to them. But we do think there's some opportunities for eco services that Host might pay for. On the guest side, we started very modestly. You might have seen that we launched travel insurance, which is now in 8 countries, and that's been really, really successful. But I think there's many more opportunities around the like services.  Obviously, Airbnb experiences is something that we're beginning to really ramp up. And I think you're going to see a lot more traction in that product in the coming years. And I think there's going to be just a lot more around creating a step change in new service level and matching people to the right homes and experiences for them. So that's what I would say. Services on the host side, services on the guest side, there's going to be a lot of opportunities to revisit some of the end-to-end travel opportunities that we have, and you'll stay tuned for some cool innovation.  Oh, I'm sorry, brand awareness, sorry. Yes, brand awareness. On the brand awareness, again, we generally try to -- as I said the last part, we generally focus on a full funnel approach. 90% of our traffic is now direct. It's sustained that since we went public, it's always been about 90%. We have extremely high efficiency on things like performance marketing. And generally, the way we approach our brand is that Airbnb is a pretty ubiquitous brand. So what we really want to do now is continue to invest in awareness around our different innovations.  And there are going to be 2 things. Number one, we're going to be focused on educating people on our new services and offerings. So for example, there will be categories we've been running campaigns around that. And people have viewed 500 million -- people viewed listings, 500 million times for every categories. We're also continuing to raise awareness around hosting. We're going to grow as fast as we have host.  Now as far as how much traffic is coming from new returning, I don't know, Dave, do you want to share anything about that on where branded? Yes. I mean I'll start, Mark. Yes. We've seen that third in Q4 2022, 36% of new available hosts who started out as guest in Airbnb. This is more than prior year. So this has been going up actually like year-over-year. So that number is going up. And it makes sense as Airbnb becomes more ubiquitous, but also it makes sense because a lot of people, they'll connect with a host, and they realize, wow, I can do this too. And the vast majority of our new listings are by individuals, not property managers. So there's this kind of interesting network effect where guest becomes host and then host becomes guest.  As far as China, we expect the recovery to be pretty gradual in China. We think the big prize in China is the outbound business. We think that there are going to be hundreds of millions of people that want to leave China to travel the world, and we think is going to be the best way for essentially Gen Z people to travel. I think they really want an authentic experience when they're traveling around the world. That being said, we are expecting a pretty gradual recovery in China. And Mark, And just 1 other thing, yes, you are right that the cohorts are trending up. So for example, I think in Q4 2021, 33% of guests became host. In 2020, 28%. In 2019, 23%. So it is picking up. Great. Yes, Dave, if you want to. Yes. And one of the things I'd just say, Brian, is that we've seen a permanent like shift in some of the travel booking behaviors on Airbnb since before the pandemic. And a lot of those changes have endured. And probably one of the most pronounced ones is just is incremental flexibility for people. We noticed more people are searching with more locations and using more flexibility features. And even before we built these features, we were seeing people entering a lot of different gate variations when they were searching. And so we were just really responding to where things are going.  And I think where this goes down the road is there's always going to be business travelers and families that know exactly where they want to go and when they want to go. But I think the long-term game here is increasingly, we're in 100,000 markets, people have not heard of 100,000 places. So the name of the game is pointing demand to where we have available supply, and that's kind of a big part of our product strategy. John, I'll start. On pricing and discounts, let's just take a step back. Airbnb, we started 15 years ago. And when we started, we started as an affordable alternative to hotels. And I think that affordability and great value is 1 of the key reasons that people use Airbnb, and we have to continue to make sure that we have that value. And as long as people feel like they have the best product at the best value for Airbnb, I think we're going to deliver a huge amount of growth in years to come.  And so there's really 3 things that we're doing. The first thing is transparent pricing with all-in pricing display. In Europe, in many countries around the world, we actually do show total price. But in the United States, the convention for travel companies show a low base rate. And then when you get to check out, there's additional fees. But we spent a lot of time listening to our guests and hosts. And we've heard from our guests, it's not -- a lot of them want to be able to see the total price upfront. And we spent a bunch of time in December, we rolled out total pricing includes all fees before taxes -- Since we've rolled it out, the impact on our bookings has been neutral.  Now I know there was a lot of -- we did -- there was a lot of speculation around what happened to show up on pricing. But I think that the response has been very positive. And we chose a very specific implementation and implementation we chose as a price toggle where you can turn it on or off. The basic idea is if people to control of how they want to see prices but also the active can the toggle on helps people understand why our prices are changing and why they might be displayed different than competitors.  So again, the impact has been neutral on bookings in the short run, but I actually think the impact on booking in the long run is going to be very positive because it's just a better experience, and it gives people more control.  The second thing is we are now prioritizing better value listing in search results. So in other words, we're going to take the total price in the total price into account when we're prioritizing bookings.  And then the third thing we're going to be doing is we're building new tools, pricing tools for hosts so that they understand the final price that they're showing to guests. One of the things we learned when we talk to hosts, they don't know the final price guests are paying. And if they did, they modulate some of the fees.  I think in the short run, it may have some modest impacts on ADR, but in the long run, I think what it's going to do is drive a lot more demand here at Airbnb, I don't know, Dave, do you want to add anything or take the second question. And maybe I'll just say that I think the Asia Pacific is a huge growth area for us going forward. And it's been a little bit of a slower recovery. And I think the reason why is Asia is historically more of a cross-border market. a lot of people in Asia is basically travel across countries. They don't have as big of a domestic market in any of these countries for the most part. And that's just been a slower recovery. But I think the one thing we've seen is that just means probably more pent-up demand, and Asia index is even higher on Gen Z travelers, which is a strong suit of Airbnb. So we're really bullish over the next few years on Asia. Chris, I would just say, I mean all of the above, I think hotels are important ways to fill a network gaps. I think people come to be here because we have something unique they can't get anywhere else. But we also have a huge amount of traffic, and so we want to make sure people come here to me they don't leave without finding something.  So I think you can think about our product a few ways. Number one, our core business has a huge amount of growth ahead of us. And so we just want to first perfect the core experience by making it easier to find the right Airbnb, providing better service each step of the way and providing better value. Next, we have a lot of emerging use cases. those emerging use cases are longer stays, obviously, which is more than 1/5 of our nice book. We also have experiences that we're really focused on and continuing to fill out our network gaps. And then finally, beyond just all those are obviously new products and services over the horizon. So we kind of have a very balanced portfolio of all of the above. Yes, Stephen, I can start. The general trend we see is that most people come to Airbnb with kind of more casual intent to host occasionally. Sometimes people come dara host on a one-off basis, for example, on this past weekend in Phoenix, we saw a really big surge of new listings for Super Bowl.  What we noticed is that over time, hosts generally increase the number of days available and they tend to get more productive every year. And so more and more nights get booked on a single listing. And then we also see a number of hosts add a second, third or fourth listing depending upon what markets they're in. So the general idea is that host get more productive, they eventually book more nights. Their ADR typically goes up as they accumulate more reviews. One of the things we recommend new hosts do is when they don't have reviews to start a little bit more affordably.  And then as they accumulate rate reviews, they can command a little bit higher kind of market pricing. And so those are the general trends we see a general uptick in ADR is to get more reviews and to build a reputation. They add more nights. And then occasionally, you'll see some people add additional listings depending upon the kind of segment they're in. Yes, I can start, Nick. So yes, I mean this new program is something that we developed because actually, we started getting a lot of inbound from real estate developers. And they started -- we started saying if we made our buildings Airbnb friendly, would it make the building more appealing, especially to young people that are moving to markets in certain cities. And so we did a partnership. We started with working with Greystar, Equity Residential, over 10 other companies, and we've launched. We have 175 buildings in like Houston, Phoenix, Jacksonville -- and the vast majority of these units are kind of -- we expect if they were put on Airbnb, that would be a typical kind of ADR. They're usually 1 bedroom studios.  The tenants sign a sublease to a fixed number of days a year, they can rent typically less than 180 days. So the whole idea is these are people's primary homes, and they rent them when they're gone. And I think we're going to get a lot of demand because there's a lot of benefits to landlords.  Number one, a landlord get visibility control around who's doing what in their building. Number two, they get a lot of free demand of people that want to lease their apartments. And three, they get a cut on the commission. So based on what we're seeing, there's been a lot of positive word of mouth, many REITs and developers are engaging with Airbnb. We think we're going to be able to send a lot of traffic to them. And so I think this is a program that's going to grow quite a lot. And I also think what is strategic to us beyond all the incremental apartments that unlocks is we're now developing relationships with many of the biggest landlords in United States. And if that happens, I think you're going to see leases generally being more friendly to Airbnb. All right, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To recap, we had another record year in 2022. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were both record high and free cash flow was $3.4 billion. I'm really proud of these results. And before I go, I just want to say how proud I am of our team. If you think about what we -- what this team has been through the last 3 years, initially losing 80% of our business, kind of rebuilding the company from the ground up and now just becoming a much more focused, disciplined company. This is a lot of momentum inside the company. And looking forward, we're already seeing some really strong demand in Q1. Consumer confidence to travel remains really high.  I think part of that is like no matter what happens in the world, people want to travel. And for many people, the office is now Zoom, the Mall of now Amazon, the theater is now Netflix. Travel is going to become a very important way that people experience the world this year. And so therefore, this is going to be an exciting year for Airbnb and for traveling all around the world. So with that, thank you all, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon and welcome to Airbnb\u2019s third quarter of 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2022. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u2019s website. During the call, we will make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, expressed or implied, in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Well, thank you, Ellie and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Q3 was another record quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds. We had nearly 100 million Nights and Experiences Booked, which is up 25% year-over-year. Gross booking value was $15.6 billion. This is up 31% year-over-year. Revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, our highest ever. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 36% year-over-year. Now, we also had our most profitable quarter ever. Net income was $1.2 billion. And this is up $400 million from a year ago. Now, this represents a 42% net income margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, also our highest ever and we generated $960 million of free cash flow. In fact, over the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. What our Q3 results demonstrate is that Airbnb continues to drive growth and profitability at scale. And even with the macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that we are well positioned for the road ahead. Now why is this? Well, new use cases such as long-term stays and non-urban travel are here to stay. And this is because millions of people now have the flexibility that they didn\u2019t have before the pandemic. At the same time, we have seen recovery in urban and cross-border travel, two of our strongest segments before the pandemic. And just like during the Great Recession in 2008, when everything started, people today are especially interested in earning extra income through hosting. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand on Airbnb remains strong. Globally, we exceeded 90 million guest arrivals during the quarter and this is another record. Now even with macroeconomic headwinds, Nights and Experiences Booked increased 25%. And during the quarter, we also continued to see longer lead times, supporting a stronger backlog for Q4. Second, guests are increasingly returning to cities and crossing borders. Both segments continue to accelerate. Cross-border gross nights booked increased 58% compared to a year ago. High density urban nights booked grew 27%. And now even as these two segments return, demand for domestic and non-urban travel remains strong. Third, guests continue to stay longer on Airbnb. Over the last year, we have seen many companies require their employees to return to the office. And at the same time, long-term stay remains 20% of our total gross nights booked on Airbnb. And finally, four, our host community continues to grow. We believe there are several factors that are driving this growth. The first reason is the demand drives supply. For instance, in Q3, as guests were returning to cities, we saw urban supply accelerate. Second, since Airbnb began in 2008, posts have consistently churned Airbnb to earn extra income. In fact, since 2008, hosts on Airbnb have earned $180 billion in our platform. Third, over last year, we made several product improvements to help onboard and support our hosts, but we are not stopping there. On November 16, we are going to introduce an all-new super easy way for millions of people to turn to Airbnb their homes as part of our winter release. We are also delivering a major upgrade to AirCover that provides even more top or bottom protection for every host. Now with these upgrades and more, we aim to unlock the next generation of hosts and improve the experience for more than 4 million people that are already hosting. So just to recap, we had a record Q3, Nights and Experiences Booked were our highest Q3 ever, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were record high, free cash flow was $950 million. And in the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. So with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Lloyd Walmsley at UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two, if I can. First, just the classic kind of macro question, anything you guys are seeing globally, any pockets where you are seeing weaker trends in bookings or ADRs that would be kind of early warning sign that you would flag heading into next year? And then second one you guys have talked a little bit about starting to invest again in Experiences. I guess if we step back, how should we think about the cost growth outlook heading into 2023? And are you \u2013 is there anything you are doing in light of just questions around macro to kind of keep a lid on costs heading into next year? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Thanks, Lloyd. Dave, why don\u2019t I answer these and then you can go at a high level and you can go specifically into the booking side question. But Lloyd, what I am going to do is I\u2019ll answer it at a little more of a high level. So one of the things that we have seen is, despite a lot of consumers pulling back on spending, the one area that I haven\u2019t seen them pullback on as much is travel. And in particular, like travel, where you can go and see your friends, see your family, more inspirational type of travel, in other words, meaningful travel and not just mass travel. And I think the reason why is just because many people are now working from home, the mall is now Amazon. The movie theater is now Netflix, people still want to get out of their house. They still want to have memories. They still want to have meaningful experiences. And I think that\u2019s why they continue to turn to Airbnb. And so just like people continue to travel this quarter, we expect really strong demand for Airbnb next year. And again, the new use cases are sticking. In other words, a fifth of our nights booked are for longer than a month and half of our nights booked are longer than a week. And this has basically been a boon because of the flexibility that people have and being able to essentially work from home or have a hybrid work lifestyle. At the same time, our urban and cross-border businesses are incredibly strong because of the value that we provide. And we think that value and having great deals is going to be a key driver as the economy slows down. On the supply side, I just would remind everyone that we started Airbnb in 2008 during the Great Recession. And at that time, many people were turning to Airbnb to earn extra income. And so we think this will be also a great time for millions of people to consider hosting, which is why we are focused on this on November 16. So we are feeling really positive about the path forward. With regards to Experiences, to answer your question very simply, the great thing about Experiences is we don\u2019t have to have very much incremental investment to make this work. It\u2019s really just a matter of incorporating Experiences more into our existing marketing and incorporating Experiences more into our existing products. So I don\u2019t think you will see that in the P&L from a cost perspective next year at all. Dave, feel free to take \u2013 anything else you want to add.\nDave Stephenson: No, I will just double click in a few areas. We are just doing incredibly well despite the macroeconomic environment. We saw continued strength in Q3. The Q3 nights experiences grew 25% year-over-year and our revenue grew 29% year-over-year. And as we stated, it\u2019s actually 36% growth year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And what we are seeing in Q4 is not seeing any overall changes in booking behaviors from our guests. 4 weeks in this quarter, we are seeing really strong promising trends in cross-border, renewed interest in urban stays, stabilizing cancellations and just strong future bookings. And that we included in our guidance here. On our guidance for Q4, we are anticipating revenue growth between 17% and 23%. And that\u2019s 23% to 29%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And maybe I will just take a minute to double click here, because one of the things we are seeing is the difference in the behavior that we had last year. If you actually go back to 2019 at historic rates, we are actually seeing stable to increasing demand for bookings here from Q3 into Q4. The decel that we see from Q3 into Q4 is really a hard comp on Q4 last year, where we had really strong demand after Delta and before Omicron. And so this is really kind of a hard year-over-year comp. And if you go back and compare back to 2019, we are seeing stable to increasing demand across the globe. And have actually aimed areas to highlight and you see it in our letter, is that APAC had some of the stronger growth, 65% growth in APAC. And excluding China, APAC is now kind of above 2019 level. So, that\u2019s been kind of the last major region to kind of return to 2019.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will move next to Naved Khan at Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: Yes, thanks a lot. Is there anything worth calling out in terms of incremental demand for European sales from travelers outside of Europe, given the decline in the currencies in that area? And then the other question I had is just on advertising, can you share anything in terms of ROI on the advertising dollars? And are you seeing more opportunities to deploy these more broadly?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Naved. Why don\u2019t Dave \u2013 you take these, I can round out the answers.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. In terms of European demand, we are seeing strong European demand from places like the U.S., where the dollar is stronger than the euro. It\u2019s not a material part of the business. It\u2019s hard to see it impact the overall materiality given just the size of our business being in 220 countries and regions around the world. And conversely, the European travel is going to be maybe less likely to come say to the U.S. where the U.S. dollar is so strong. So there is some offset in there. Overall, the impact of foreign exchange isn\u2019t as large on the business because of the regional impacts. More people kind of travel either domestically or within their own regions. And then in terms of advertising ROI, we are really pleased with our approach to the marketing strategy that we have had. Our brand marketing results are delivering excellent results overall with a strong rate of return. And it\u2019s been so successful that we are actually expanding to more countries. And so that\u2019s what you will be still be seeing over the course of this next year is to expand more countries to support our brand advertising.\nNaved Khan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Nick Jones at JMP Securities.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, I guess when we look at kind of U.S. to international travel, is the strength in U.S. dollar maybe helping drive more interest in going overseas? And then the second question on durability of kind of ADRs, as elevated home prices may be making host less likely to lower the rate at which they are willing to take kind of from here. I mean, are these going to be maybe more durable than we think? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, why don\u2019t you take the first question, I can take the second.\nDave Stephenson: Yes. Again, as I just said, on the U.S. international, we clearly do have a strong U.S. dollar, which enables Americans to travel abroad quite well and we are seeing nice strength there. And again, that part of the business is not so large as to have a material impact on the overall business, because you also have some of the offsets of weaker currencies, not necessarily travel in the U.S. Again, more of the travel is domestic and intra-regional, that\u2019s what\u2019s really going to kind of drive things and more of the foreign exchange issues are not as pronounced within the given region.\nBrian Chesky: And I think just regarding elevated home prices and what that does to average daily rate on Airbnb, I mean just to zoom out, people come to Airbnb because they can find a great value. And you can often get significantly more for your money than a hotel room. You can often get an entire home with a lot of amenities. And continuing to deliver value is going to be really important for the next travel season. And that means that we need to make sure we have really competitive prices. And that means that we need to give tools for host, more tools for them to be able to better price their listings. So, one of the things we are doing is we are going to continue to move towards a more all-in pricing, where when you see pricing, instead of seeing more of a nightly rate, you are going to see a little bit more of a fully loaded rate. And then our search ranking is going to prioritize great value, great deal for the fully loaded price. I think this will really help host understand what they are charging and then we are going to give them more tools so they can see and understand what their all-in pricing is for guests and we are going to provide more discount tools and other features to allow hosts to remain competitive. And if we do all these things, I believe we will be even more competitive from a pricing standpoint than we are today.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. I think you will have more to say about supply with the upcoming winter release, but just wondering if you could talk about what you see as continuing pain points for host, Brian, maybe you just talk to that a little bit and maybe also structural drivers around supply like local regulations and zoning? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, yes. So let me dive into this, because this is a pretty important topic. Just to zoom out, we have a global network where demand drives supply. And that means that where we see our highest growth of bookings is also typically where we see our highest growth of supply. And just to give you an example, this past quarter, approximately 35% of our new available hosts had started as guests. So this is a really strong network where guests become host and the host as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends about it, and then we get more supply that way. And so this is, I think, one of the things that\u2019s really, really important. But beyond that, obviously, we want to be very aggressive about recruiting more hosts to Airbnb, because this is a great time. And because of the softening economy, we think increasingly now more than ever before, people are interested in putting their homes on Airbnb to make supplemental income. So to answer your question, what are the pain points? I would highlight too, as we\u2019ve talked to people that are considering hosting, they have told us two things. The first thing they said is that they want it to be easier to get started. They need help getting started becoming a host. The second thing is they are a little nervous about having strangers in their house. And so we have tackled both of these. On November 16, as part of our winter release, number one, we are going to unveil an all new super easy way for millions of people to put their home on Airbnb. I am pretty excited about this. We have been working on this for quite a while. Second, to make people feel comfortable about having other people in their home, which will unlock a lot more everyday people putting their real homes on Airbnb, we are going to be providing some huge upgrades and improvements to AirCover for host. If we do these two things, I think we are going to help unlock significantly greater amounts of supply, which is already on top of the momentum that we have and we have seen in Q3. Maybe the final thing I\u2019ll just say is in addition to adding more supply in Airbnb, the Holy Grail is pointing demand to where we have supply, because I know night globally on Airbnb, are we ever close to 100% occupied. It\u2019s just a matter of pointing demand to where we have supply. And this is the whole theory around Airbnb categories that instead of hoping people type in the place you have available supply in the search box, you can then come and have more of a browse experience where we highlight homes that are available. So this is our holistic strategy. As far as pain points, as far as like from a regulatory standpoint, I mean, one of the things we\u2019ve seen is a redistribution away from very large city kind of to everywhere. And a lot of cities and a lot of local communities have been actually reaching out to us, because they can see the economic opportunity we provide. So we are working really, really closely with these markets, but we are feeling very optimistic about our supply for 2023.\nDave Stephenson: Let me just double click it too on a couple of Brian\u2019s points, because I think they are really important because of these partnerships that we\u2019ve had with local governments, especially on tax collection, we have delivered more than $6 billion in tourism-related taxes to local governments. I mean, this is a material amount of money. And collecting \u2013 remitting taxes, we do it in over 30,000 jurisdictions around the globe. And I think in terms of like zoning regulations, we believe that the reasonable regulation actually normalizes hosting. And when you normalize hosting, it can really be a foundation for future growth. So we actually think that you do this in a reasonable way, and it will actually be a tailwind to growth in the future.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Next, we will move to Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, just to maybe try to cut the business a little bit different way. What can you tell us about sort of your growth in active bookers or stairs versus spend per booker that\u2019s sort of driving the business right now? And how have those cohorts that came in during COVID, how have they aged versus COVID which is cohorts you had prior to COVID. And then the second one, Brian, you made so many improvements to the platform over the years from unflexible and trying to load balance supply and demand, etcetera. What can you tell us about the conversion of traffic now versus where it was, say, in 2019?\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Yes, Dave, do you want to take the first question?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, in terms of the active bookers, I think you kind of step back and look at the marketing approach that we\u2019ve had since pre COVID and that we really has accelerated in COVID in sense has been to continue to focus on the overall brand of Airbnb and to be less reliant on search engine marketing. We\u2019ve been incredibly effective at that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid which is driving a great return on investment for kind of new active bookers. And so I think the return that we\u2019re getting on new has been quite good. And in terms of the cohorts of new, we\u2019re actually seeing that the cohorts that are coming in since COVID are actually as strong, if not even stronger than they were in prior to COVID. The people that are willing to kind of travel right now and experience Airbnb have are really sticky, and the cohorts are as strong and not stronger than we saw previously.\nOperator: We will go next to the...\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Sorry, sorry, I just want to answer about conversion of traffic for unflexible. So yes, at a high level, conversion on a year-over-year basis is up. But I would actually generally say, Brian, that we actually think about it even more broadly. When we launch Airbnb Categories, for example, one of the goals was not just increased conversion, but was actually to increase traffic. And there is a scenario where you can increase traffic, initially conversion can go down because you are a little bit more in the inspiration business. And there were people who are coming and they are dreaming and planning travel. So you really want to look at conversion over a longer period of time. But we have actually seen metronomic improvement in our conversion rate. But stays listings in Airbnb Categories since we launched on May 11 have been viewed more than 300 million times and with homes they would have never otherwise have known existed. So we are really excited about the progress we\u2019re making between Airbnb Categories, which is really bringing a lot more traffic to Airbnb, plenty demand were half supply, bringing us top of funnel. There would be AirCover for guests, which is making people feel more assured about their experience and allowing a more consistent form of reliability. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to see a step change in improvement in the product from a guest experience. And this, of course, will continue to lead to greater conversion.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: We will go next to Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, Brian, I know you talked about strong growth in new hosts and a lot of them seeing new income opportunities. But within that, is the macro environment and interest rates, is that putting any pressure on second homes in your view? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the early returns on the spring update categories. Is there anything you can add just around conversion rates or what you might be seeing in incremental bookings? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Doug, I mean, I\u2019ll let Dave fill in, in more detail. But at the highest level, I think it\u2019s actually pretty simple. In \u2013 as the economy slows down, I think people are looking for more ways to make either supplemental income or like greater yield on the assets they have. And so we generally see a selling economy as a moment when more and more people are going to be presumably turning to Airbnb for hosting. And so whether it\u2019s second homes or primary homes, I think there is going to be a pretty big opportunity for us. And we just want to make sure that we provide great tools for people so they continue to lift on Airbnb. As far as some of the metrics we\u2019ve seen, again, as I said, conversion has steadily picked up. Homes and Airbnb experiences have been viewed more than 300 million times. We\u2019re seeing us continue to spread out bookings to more and more markets, which is a bit of the Holy Grail to be on the point demand we have supply. With AirCover for guests, which is another very important upgrade that we made because this is AirCover for guests really addresses a bit of the chilly fuel of Airbnb, which is on the one hand, we have this incredible one-of-a-kind homes. Other hand, one of a kind can be variable in consistency. And so what we\u2019ve seen with AirCover is we provide protection in the unlikely event that a host cancels or you get to a home and it\u2019s not as described. And we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve launched AirCover for guests, NPS is up and probably even more importantly, rebooking rates when I guess it dissatisfied is also up. And so if we can do these two things: on the front end, continue to be more in the inspiration business, point demand already have supply. On the back end, make sure that Airbnb\u2019s are meeting your expectations. And in the rare event that they don\u2019t, we make it right, then these are going to continue to unlock significantly greater growth for us in the year ahead.\nDave Stephenson: Just to double quick on the strong \u2013 the second home impact question. If you go back and think about the 4 million hosts that we have a very different business than many others. So 90% of those hosts are individual hosts. They are the people that own a first \u2013 a primary home or maybe a secondary home and a big strength of our business, we saw this in COVID is that people even during an economic kind of shock period, they don\u2019t get rid of their primary home. They don\u2019t get necessarily getting rid of their secondary home, which is very different than professional hosts that maybe are doing an arbitrage of exact cost of ownership and return on the investment they can get on that specific property versus other alternatives. And so I think that this helps buffer any of those kind of impacts on our businesses, that individual host community.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Justin Post at Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great, thanks. One quick one. When you say ADRs could face some pressure. Is that quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year in Q4? And then much bigger picture, solid bookings for 31% growth. Guidance probably implies well over 20 in Q4. How do we think about the backlog for \u201823 on revenues or associate that with potential revenue growth next year? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Alright, Dave, I think you can take this one.\nDave Stephenson: Sure. On the year-over-year for Q4 \u2013 the Q4 pressure ADR is year-over-year. In terms of the backlog for \u201823, it\u2019s a little early to tell, but really, what we\u2019re seeing is continued strong demand for travel overall. And like I said, when you look back to historic levels of growth back to 2019, we\u2019re seeing stable to increasing demand. We have strong bookings on the books for Q4, but then there will be fewer on the books yet for it kind of tails off into 2023. So it\u2019s a little early to say. But we\u2019re seeing no hints of a decline in people\u2019s demand and willingness to travel. It\u2019s just a little early to extrapolate much further.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We will move next to Mario Lu at Barclays.\nMario Lu: Thanks for taking the questions. First one is for Brian. You mentioned earlier this one that redesigning pricing and better transparency is a top priority for you. How much of an uplift could this be to conversion potentially? And what changes should we expect to see?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Mario, yes. Just to give a little more context to those listening about pricing. Right now, we have pricing that is primarily displayed on a nightly rate. Post, you can then choose to add a cleaning fee and then Airbnb ad service fees. And one of the things that we\u2019ve been hearing from guests, and we heard it loud and clear, is that people would like a little more transparency about what they are actually paying when they first get to Airbnb. And so we are working on redesigning how pricing works on Airbnb, so people better understand the total price they are going to pay the moment they arrive at Airbnb, and it\u2019s not a surprise for them. So I think the north star for us on this matter is transparency. I think the benefit of this is going to be \u2013 we also want to make it easier for a host to understand what they are charging. And sometimes to tell us that they are not aware of what guests are paying because as you know, we add a guest service fee on top of the price that the host charge and occasionally hosts that they are charging more than they intended to. And so we are updating some of the tools to make it easier for hosts to understand what they are charging, and this will allow them to be more competitive. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to be updating our search ranking algorithm. We\u2019ve been making some refinements to prioritize home that offer a better value. And of course, when a guest checks out, they leave a 5-star rating. One of the questions we ask is on a scale of 1 to 5, how good of a value was this, and home to offer a great value are going to be prioritized higher in search results. And in addition to that, we\u2019re going to continue to develop new discounting tools, discounting tools like seasonal discounts, weekly discounts, peak season discounts and really tools to make host more competitive. If we do all this, I do believe the prices will get even more competitive. And one of the things we know is obviously as the prices get more competitive, conversion rate goes up and as conversion rate goes up, bookings go up. And just the final thing to say is we will have some updates on this soon. I\u2019ll be in making some announcements soon.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks, Brian. And just one on the operational take rate. I believe it\u2019s still above 14% and has not changed much over the past few years. So firstly, one, is that correct? And if so, what are your thoughts on adjusting up or down in the future to drive demand?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Mario. I\u2019ll start and Dave, you can feel free to jump in. We do not have an intention to increase take rate. I mean this is a company that, obviously, in the last quarter did more than $1 billion in net income, nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. So I think there is a lot of levers to increase monetization on Airbnb, but I don\u2019t think we have to increase take rate to do that. In other words, there is opportunities like to allow additional services to host that we could charge for, and we think they pay for that we can do. So there is a lot of ways to increase the take rate on Airbnb. There are going to be some areas where we can probably optimize and improve take rates and potentially lower a little bit like on long-term space. If you\u2019re booking a place for 2, 3, 4 months, we think conversion rate might go up if we were to lower the take rate a little bit. But I don\u2019t think this would cut into our current business. I think that might actually keep more bookings on the platform. So we are going to continue to look at some optimization, but we think that we provide a great value. And I think if we make some of these pricing and discount changes in the coming future, I think the value on Airbnb will get even better. We\u2019re going to remain disciplined on our expenses. And there is a lot of monetization opportunities going forward. But our general view is if we\u2019re going to charge more, we should provide more. That\u2019s our North Star.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Bernie McTernan at Needham & Company.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you for taking question. I realize that you guys are saying you\u2019re not seeing any negative impact yet from the macro on the consumer. But as you think about different scenarios playing out and the potential impact of a recessionary environment, is there any cohort or demographic data that you see from your consumers that makes you think Airbnb could be more resilient than broader travel?\nBrian Chesky: I mean I could answer the high level and Dave, you can go in. I mean, Bernie, it\u2019s a very great question. One of the things we noticed during the pandemic \u2013 one of the lessons of the pandemic is I think Airbnb is the most adaptable business model in all of travel. And the reason why is we\u2019re not just the European business, we\u2019re not just a North American business. We are a truly global business. We\u2019re in 100,000 cities all over the world. We\u2019re not just a vacation rental business. We\u2019re also an urban business, also a cross-border business. We\u2019re not just a family business. We\u2019re also popular with millennials, Gen Z and retiree at nearly every type of price point. So I think that however travel demand changes, we will be able to adapt. And that\u2019s one of the great things about our model. It\u2019s a global network, guests become hosts. Most hosts are regular people that tell their friends about Airbnb, which is why when a market occupancy increases, it tends in itself create more supply. So these are some of the reasons why we feel very, very excited about our ability to continue to adapt given this challenging macroeconomic environment. Dave, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to it?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I\u2019ll just double click. I mean, it\u2019s just a great value that we provide, right, that can people can pick anything from budget to luxe. And if a person has a certain kind of budget constraint, they can choose to maybe get a slightly smaller place or place with fewer amenities maybe they are well further out, like they can adjust the type of home they want based on their budget. And I think Airbnb has such a diversity of offerings that, that enables them to do it uniquely with us, which is very different than the flexibility they might have in hotels.\nOperator: We will move next to James Lee at Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And when we spoke with hoteliers in general, I think they are planning to keep the ADRs high and with reduced staffing levels. So just curious what you\u2019re thinking, does that present an opportunity for you to price your product more dynamically to demand and gain share? And also considering \u2013 are you also considering a price structure change charging guest fees given the tighter consumer budget? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, James, yes, I think that as we give more tools to host to be able to dynamically price, they can be more competitive. And as they are more competitive, then we will continue to gain more share. So anything that allows greater value allows for more share. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 other than changing how pricing will be displayed to make it more transparent, intuitive and to continue to offer better value, we\u2019re not actually looking at a fundamental change to our pricing structure.\nOperator: We will move next to Richard Clarke at Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Alright. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering, based on commentary, you\u2019re seeing urban coming back. How normal are we in that mix at the moment? And can you possibly quantify what the ADR headwind might be as urban continues to come back? And then maybe just the same question regionally, you\u2019re more skewed to the North American market than you were pre-COVID. Is that because those use cases are a bigger factor in North America or do you expect further changes in the geographical mix over time as well?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Dave, you want to take this one?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. In terms of like urban coming back, it just continues to be a higher and higher percentage of our overall mix. It\u2019s not quite back to where it was in 2019, and it may never quite be because we see such great strength in our non-urban but urban is strengthening each quarter. And so that\u2019s the trend that we\u2019re seeing on the urban side. And I think it\u2019s actually similar on the cross-border international side. We\u2019re not back to where we were in kind of 2019 level. Gross nights were like 48% were cross-border back in 2019. And what we\u2019ve just seen is a cross-border continues to be a greater, greater percentage every quarter, but we\u2019re not quite back to where we were in 2019.\nOperator: We will move next to Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thanks. Let\u2019s see. David, could I ask you just adjust the over-earning question that the free cash flow margins are truly very impressive. Just you really see them you\u2019ve been at 40% plus or roughly for the last three quarters on a trailing 12-month basis. What would cause those margins to go materially higher or lower from here? Or is there a reason to think that they are roughly sustainable? And then can I just ask about Categories? I know somebody asked about this earlier. But Brian, these features can sometimes take quite a long time to kind of get broadly used and the doubt that they can have a major impact. And I think this is one of those that could, how long do you think it\u2019s going to take for Categories to be kind of widely adopted used and really start impacting and helping people better match up that supply \u2013 all the supply you have with the demand that\u2019s out there? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. So we have two questions. I think, Dave, you can take the first one, and then I\u2019ll take Categories.\nDave Stephenson: Excellent. So yes, the free cash flow, I\u2019m really proud of our delivery of the free cash flow and the free cash flow margin. So thanks for calling it out. I mean we\u2019ve just made substantial improvement in the overall profitability of our business, right? We\u2019ve radically adjusted our marketing expenditures to be substantially lower. We\u2019ve made metronomic improvement in our variable costs. We\u2019re seeing great leverage in our fixed costs. We\u2019re being incredibly disciplined in our fixed cost growth, and that will continue going forward. And so all of those will be tailwinds to being able to maintain or even increase our free cash flow margins over time. As average daily rates could moderate next year, that does put a little bit of a headwind towards our margins. But I think the improvements in our variable costs and the fixed cost leverage should enable us to maintain or even increase free cash flow margins over the longer-term. What we will continue to have greater expansion in free cash flow margin to be some of the things that Brian talked about a little bit ago, it would be kind of incremental services or activities that we add for guests or host over time. And there is no immediate announcements of major changes that you should anticipate in \u201823, but know that, that is a focus for us and over a more extended period will drive incremental revenue for us and incremental margin.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And to answer your other question about the kind of timing for wide adoption of Airbnb Categories, it\u2019s a great question. I think just to kind of zoom out, customers of travel have been, as you know, trained over the last 25 years to search a certain way. And that way is to go to a website, there is a search box, you type in where you want to go and you search. And then what you get is a list of results. You refine the results, you compare sometimes the different websites, different apps and then you make a booking. And I think this is going to be a year transition to retrain kind of customers about how they can search for travel on Airbnb. But I think we\u2019re going to start to see some really great momentum next year. Again, we are already seeing people discover home they never knew existed. We are seeing a lot more people engage with categories. The homes and categories have been viewed more than 300 million times, we are going to continue to be making improvements to this every single year. We have some upgrades coming out in two weeks in November. And of course, you are going to see some upgrades beyond that as well. So, I think this is a really great opportunity for us. And again, because we are a little more concentrated in vacation travel, the business travel, and because people are increasingly more flexible when they travel, we think they are going to be much more open to ideas from Airbnb. And part of this is idea of Airbnb becoming more at the top of the funnel. The way the travel funnel used to be, if you go to one website to figure out where to travel, these are typically travel content sites. Then you go to the next site, typically to book your flight, and then the third thing you do is get your hotel or get your housing. So, with Airbnb was kind of step three. And we like Airbnb to go from kind of step three to step one. This is going to take some retraining for everything to go from step three to step one, but I think there is definitely a line of sight to getting there.\nOperator: We will go next to Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. Hi Brian.\nBrian Chesky: Hey.\nStephen Ju: So, you guys took off you \u2013 you guys took out the China supply, but maintained your outbound business. It\u2019s probably a little bit too early to tell and there probably isn\u2019t a lot of outbound happening as of yet. But is there anything we should worry about from a customer acquisition funnel or retention standpoint because the Airbnb use case for, I guess the Chinese traveler is going to get reduced to, I guess international only versus what was previously domestic plus international? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Stephen, I mean the crown jewel of our China business was always and we thought always was going to be the China outbound business. And the reason why is the take rate was higher for the outbound business than it was for the domestic business. The inventory is more unique. There is less competition and the average daily rate is a lot higher. So, the outbound business was always the price part of our business. And that\u2019s what we are focused on. Now, as you know, not a lot of people are leaving the country right now, but we want to be prepared for when they do. And they eventually will, of course. And so the two things we are doing to prepare is, number one, we are going to be continuing to invest in our brand in China. And number two, if people are traveling and they are leaving China, they are going to other countries, and we would call these the core to countries. And the primary place, they are first probably going to go with intra-region. So, they are presumably going to be going to Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan. Eventually, they will go a little further to Europe and then they will presumably come back to the United States, especially maybe the kind of some of the coastal cities. And this is kind of how I think travel may recover. And so what we need to do is make sure we have enough supply in these corridors and continue to invest in our brand in China. And I think by only having an outbound business, we can actually focus all of our investments just on that, and it actually makes a lot more cost effective, a lot more efficient. And one thing I have learned is more focused we are, the more likely we are to achieve our results. So, that\u2019s what we are feeling. We are actually feeling really confident about the prospects for China. It\u2019s just going to be a longer like payoff than because of the fact that not a lot of people are leaving the country and traveling right now.\nOperator: We will go next to Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I can on investment strategy. Obviously, we have a lot of technology companies that are talking about slowing hiring, possibly pruning talent out of their organizations. How do you think that positions you to possibly upgrade talent within the organization, Brian? And how are you thinking about hiring goals over the next sort 12 months to 18 months? And then the second part of the question is, obviously, a slow in the economy would not be like the existential crisis that travel belt in spring of 2020. But what\u2019s your broader philosophy of investing through a soft patch in the economy or more closely aligning revenue growth with expense growth if you did see a soft patch over a couple of quarters? Thanks so much.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey Eric, good to talk to you. Yes, let me just recap how we think about expense management and investments. Before the pandemic, we were essentially a nearly breakeven business doing like a little under $250 million in loss from an EBITDA perspective. And of course, in the pandemic hit, we lost 80% of our business, and we completely changed our cost structure. And out of that crisis, we made a decision. And the decision we made is we weren\u2019t going to wait for another crisis, another weakened economy or a recession to change how we invest or we run the company that we were going to be lean regardless of the economy. In other words, we were going to go from the Navy to the Navy seal, a small, lean, elite group. And so we are a small team, we are functionally organized. We are only slightly more than 6,000 people in the beginning of this year. Before obviously, the economy took a turn for the worst, we still only had a plan to hire 7% to 8% more employees. In other words, we had a plan to be really profitable and we were planning for a storm. And so we have not had a change anything about our hiring plans. We don\u2019t intend to change anything about our hiring plans in the next 12 months to 18 months regardless of the economy because one of the lessons we have learned is a smaller we are, the more nimble we are, the faster we can move. And not only can we be more profitable, we can actually grow faster. And we have been actually more productive than we ever were in our history. We have made more than 150 upgrades in innovation across the core service. So, we are still really aggressive about trying to attract the best of our generation to this company, but that doesn\u2019t mean hiring a lot of people. We are really embracing being a lean organization, which is partly our functional structure. We are not a business organization where you would have four marketing departments. We have one functional organization, and so that allows us to be quite a bit leaner. And I guess that goes to your other question, which is slowness in the economy. Well, regardless of what happens to the economy, our model is highly adaptable. We have a very low expense base. And we are pretty efficient with marketing. We spend a lot less on marketing than our competitors and the vast majority of our traffic is direct. So, whatever happens to the economy, I think we are in a pretty good position where we won\u2019t have to change the way we run the company. But I think we have proven if we ever have to, of course, we will. But I don\u2019t expect for us to have to make a lot of changes because of how much cash we are generating, because of how lean we already are.\nDave Stephenson: And if I double-click on one area is that we announced our Live and Work Anywhere policy this year, and I think that has enabled us to hire the best people in the world regardless of where they live. And so to Brian\u2019s point about hiring fewer, more senior, and more experts in areas, this has clearly been able to make sure that we are getting the best talent in the world.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And maybe the last thing I will just say is I think that we learned a lot of lessons probably a year or 2 years earlier than a lot of other tech companies because we were hit so hard so early. But I think the adversity, the challenge we had just made us a much more focused, a much better company. And one of the commitments we made is we are never going to forget the lessons from the pandemic. We are never going to lose our discipline. Because the more disciplined we are, the more focused we are, not only to become more profitable, but we actually innovate faster. And so those principles are here to stay.\nOperator: We will move next to Ron Josey at Citi.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger picture question first, Brian, and then Dave, one for you on just guidance. Just I think, Brian, you were talking maybe intra-quarter about AirCover being a major franchise going forward. Clearly, we will hear more about this in the winter release. But just talk to us about how AirCover might expand longer term. We clearly see it for guests, for host. We know we will have more updates here in the next week or two weeks. But just bigger picture, how you see it as a franchise. And then, Dave, just on guidance, I think in the letter, we mentioned longer lead time for bookings, stronger backlog for 4Q. Just trying to understand how that might compare to where we were maybe in prior periods at the same time. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Alright. I will take obviously the first one, Ron. Thanks. So yes, questions around kind of the longer-term strategy around AirCover. And maybe the way to explain AirCover, let\u2019s just take as an analogy, let\u2019s take Amazon. So, my recollection of Amazon, this will go back maybe 20 years, because 20 years ago, Amazon even back then, their core retail business was an amazing product. They had the most amount of selection on the Internet, and they have the lowest prices. But the problem with Amazon is they had an Achilles\u2019 heel. And the Achilles\u2019 heel was they were competing with walking in a store and taking something out at that moment. And so one of the things they created was Amazon Prime, which was obviously addressing the core Achilles\u2019 heel, which was shipping. I think every business has to understand what its potential weakness is. I think the great thing about Airbnb\u2019s model is we similarly have probably the widest selection of accommodations and everything we have is truly one of a kind at a great value. But our challenge is unlike a hotel, we don\u2019t control the inventory and it cannot structurally always be as consistent. We can\u2019t expect every property. So, AirCover similar for consistency addresses something similar to what Prime did for Amazon with shipping, which is to say, what if we could take this off the table, this question of consistency. And on the host side, the protections have led to a huge increase in NPS. Our NPS for AirCover for a host is over 60. And this is after something happened to your home. So clearly, this was a huge hit. And it was so popular that we decided to bring it to guests. And I think where this can go is over the coming years, we can offer increasingly more protection, more coverage for more different use cases. And I think the North Star for AirCover is if a listing was across \u2013 most of our inventory is only in Airbnb. But let\u2019s say a home was on two different websites, Airbnb and another website, we want AirCover to be so compelling that just by having AirCover alone, it would be reason to go direct and book on Airbnb and not book anywhere else. And we are going to continue to make improvements every single year, and I want AirCover to be the gold standard for customer service for our category. And that\u2019s what we are really focused on. And then down the road, there may be opportunities to offer like a paid version of this or some other type of membership program, but that would be down the road, but it\u2019s a very popular customer request.\nOperator: We will go next to Deepak \u2013 I apologize.\nDave Stephenson: And then in terms of \u2013 to answer the question on guidance, too. On the guidance, articulation of the longer lead times for bookings and just the Q4 bookings that we have already on the books for the rest of this quarter is just to indicate that we have stable to accelerating demand for growth, right. And demand from our guests around the world. It\u2019s that we are not seeing a softening in that demand especially when you look back to historic levels of 2019, that any of the deceleration in revenue growth between Q3 and Q4 is largely due to the uniqueness of the 2021 timing of growth between Delta and Omicron. So, I just think it just shows the stability of people wanting to get out their homes, wanting to travel, regardless of the macroeconomic uncertainties.\nOperator: We will move now to Deepak Mathivanan at Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones. So first, there has been a lot of press recently about how occupancies on the platform are down for certain house hosts. Is it just anecdotal or seasonal or whether there is anything more to it? I mean your 4Q guidance is pretty strong, but just trying to understand how much of this is just kind of noise out there. And then second question, maybe for Brian. Long-term stays is stabilizing near 20% of the mix on the platform, even as sort of your room nights is growing pretty nicely, you have talked about sort of like the flexibility and lifestyle for many people keeping this \u2013 or helping this growth. But curious whether there is also like a bigger macro drivers like maybe rental markets being very difficult right now that\u2019s helping this trend. Just kind of trying to understand how much you are reaching already into the addressable markets beyond travel currently.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I can \u2013 I will take both, and then Dave can feel free to dive in, especially on the bookings. I mean I think our \u2013 just to answer your question on whether bookings were down for hosts. I mean at the macro level, at the high level, they are not down. And I mean I think the Q3 results speak for themselves. There are anecdotal descriptions of some host bookings are down, some host bookings are up. And this \u2013 there is many possible explanations for this. It\u2019s just that travel is continuing to change. One of the other things though is that our search rank algorithm is prioritizing all-in pricing and host with the best value. So, it\u2019s possible that might be one possible explanation. But again, it\u2019s primarily what we have seen is anecdotal. And it really depends \u2013 you really have to take it on a case-by-case basis. But overall, obviously, bookings are up. In fact, it\u2019s a record quarter. Now, with regard to long-term stays beyond travel, I mean feedback, I would just say that we have only scratched the surface. A fifth of our nights book are for stays longer than a month. And this is before making some really big fundamental improvement to this product in this category. And I think in the coming years, flexibility is here to stay. I think more people are going to work remotely in a hybrid way 5 years from now than they do today. I think increasingly, fewer people are going to have 1-year leases, not to say no one will, but more and more people are going to value the flexibility and want to live in different places. And we think there is a real opportunity. And one of the things we are going to also see over the coming years isn\u2019t just that people are going to live in different parts of the United States, but people are going to choose to live for short periods of time abroad in different countries. So, we think we are going to start to see more long-term cross-border business, too. So, there is a lot of opportunities here. And we are going to be making some upgrades to our long-term stay business to tap into this large market. I mean the largest expense that most people have in their life is their housing, it\u2019s their housing costs. And we have built many of the tools and features that you would need to provide for a longer term stay offering already. But we are going to continue to make improvements. And as we do, I think we will continue to take more and more of that market.\nOperator: Next, we will move to Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks. So, building on the comments earlier about expense growth. Given that your advertising strategy has moved away from, say, purely demand linked performance advertising and more towards longer-dated ROI investments and brand advertising. How do you think about actively flexing down your advertising spend in a perhaps a tougher macro environment versus investing into that environment to continue to teach the customers \u2013 retrain the customers about your ever-expanding product set?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to start with this?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. I mean if you look at our actual advertising strategy and the amount of money we are spending on it, it\u2019s going to be relatively flat from \u201822 over \u201821, and you should anticipate similar marketing as a percentage of revenue in \u201823. And so we can certainly flex it in line with revenue. We will be kind of mindful of that. But what we have already kind of hit this new kind of lower overall rate. And what we have actually seen is, to the extent that we are keeping it flat even as we grow, it\u2019s because we are actually seeing such success that we are wanting to be able to invest in other countries. Certainly, we can moderate that over time, but we are already so low that I wouldn\u2019t anticipate us dropping it dramatically in face of substantial headwinds over growth. But we can flex it with the revenue within a reasonably a few hundred basis points here and there.\nBrian Chesky: And I will just say \u2013 just to jump in. I mean we don\u2019t really think of marketing as a way to buy customers because, obviously, as we have mentioned, more than 90% of our traffic is direct or organic. And so the main thing is we take a full funnel approach to marketing. And actually the top of the funnel is PR and communication. And we think that\u2019s one of the biggest drivers of our traffic is PR. And then brand marketing is actually important. And actually, we think a bit more like product marketing. We want to educate people about our new features. So, right now, we are advertising and educating people about Airbnb Categories and AirCover. And then we think that performance marketing is more of a way the laser in to balance supply and demand rather than a way purchased a large amount of customers. And that\u2019s essentially the way we think about marketing. And this allows for a very efficient, very dynamic approach to marketing that should get more efficient every single year.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Brad Erickson at RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Erickson: Hey. Thanks. Few follow-ups. First, nights came up just a bit light of where we all had it forecasted. So, obviously, that\u2019s on us. But I guess in cases where you are maybe seeing a little bit of nights booked softness, are you seeing those hosts making moves on price, or are your pricing tools sending any message to those hosts about making moves? Just curious if you look to affect some elasticity in the event of any pockets of softness. And then second, Dave, I know you spoke to this just a minute ago on the backlog, but asked in a different way. Are you basically saying that you are seeing booking windows expand more than prior years here as we start out Q4? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Brad, I will take the first question. I think Dave can take the second. Yes, I mean what we do see is that many hosts do bring their prices up or down as demand goes up or down. That being said, I think there is opportunities for us to have more dynamic tools and give more visibility that would make prices even more competitive. To answer your question, they do, many hosts do adjust their prices, but I think hosts probably adjust their prices less frequently than hotels. And so in periods of time where prices are generally coming down in the industry, we might be a little bit slower. But as we build more tools to provide more dynamic changes, we will be \u2013 continue to be more competitive. And I will let Dave take next question.\nDave Stephenson: Yes. Well, a couple of things. One thing is we are not focused on optimizing just night side. I think nights is an important measure, and it\u2019s an important driver of kind of overall demand. But we could also drive a lot of nights and looking and try to just drive them towards lower rate nights. Like we are trying to drive a balance of making sure that we have nights growth and revenue growth. And revenue growth obviously pays the bills. And so we are seeing strong growth in the business. I am very happy with our Q3 results. And on our full guide like you said, I think we are seeing stable to increasing demand, and we are just really impressed with the resiliency of guests and their willingness to travel and interest in traveling Airbnb. And I guess it goes back to the backlog, too, is that the reason why we kind of highlight is just that people are having confidence in travel. So, what we are seeing is that, yes, the booking windows are up year-over-year. There are a little bit \u2013 there is some seasonality in that. So, they are actually booking windows a little bit down from Q3. And so as \u2013 the lead times are just up from historical levels because the people are confident in being able to travel, I think that\u2019s the important thing you should take away.\nOperator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to Brian for any concluding remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nBrian Chesky: Alright. Well, first of all, thank you all for joining today. I just want to recap and just say we are incredibly proud of our results. And I believe we are incredibly well positioned for the future ahead. I hope you all join us in two weeks for 2022 winter release. You will be able to watch it right from our homepage on Wednesday, this is November 16th, 8 a.m. Eastern. Thank you all and I will see you then.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Stephenson",
            "content": "No, I will just double click in a few areas. We are just doing incredibly well despite the macroeconomic environment. We saw continued strength in Q3. The Q3 nights experiences grew 25% year-over-year and our revenue grew 29% year-over-year. And as we stated, it\u2019s actually 36% growth year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And what we are seeing in Q4 is not seeing any overall changes in booking behaviors from our guests. 4 weeks in this quarter, we are seeing really strong promising trends in cross-border, renewed interest in urban stays, stabilizing cancellations and just strong future bookings. And that we included in our guidance here. On our guidance for Q4, we are anticipating revenue growth between 17% and 23%. And that\u2019s 23% to 29%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And maybe I will just take a minute to double click here, because one of the things we are seeing is the difference in the behavior that we had last year. If you actually go back to 2019 at historic rates, we are actually seeing stable to increasing demand for bookings here from Q3 into Q4. The decel that we see from Q3 into Q4 is really a hard comp on Q4 last year, where we had really strong demand after Delta and before Omicron. And so this is really kind of a hard year-over-year comp. And if you go back and compare back to 2019, we are seeing stable to increasing demand across the globe. And have actually aimed areas to highlight and you see it in our letter, is that APAC had some of the stronger growth, 65% growth in APAC. And excluding China, APAC is now kind of above 2019 level. So, that\u2019s been kind of the last major region to kind of return to 2019. Sure. In terms of European demand, we are seeing strong European demand from places like the U.S., where the dollar is stronger than the euro. It\u2019s not a material part of the business. It\u2019s hard to see it impact the overall materiality given just the size of our business being in 220 countries and regions around the world. And conversely, the European travel is going to be maybe less likely to come say to the U.S. where the U.S. dollar is so strong. So there is some offset in there. Overall, the impact of foreign exchange isn\u2019t as large on the business because of the regional impacts. More people kind of travel either domestically or within their own regions. And then in terms of advertising ROI, we are really pleased with our approach to the marketing strategy that we have had. Our brand marketing results are delivering excellent results overall with a strong rate of return. And it\u2019s been so successful that we are actually expanding to more countries. And so that\u2019s what you will be still be seeing over the course of this next year is to expand more countries to support our brand advertising. Yes. Again, as I just said, on the U.S. international, we clearly do have a strong U.S. dollar, which enables Americans to travel abroad quite well and we are seeing nice strength there. And again, that part of the business is not so large as to have a material impact on the overall business, because you also have some of the offsets of weaker currencies, not necessarily travel in the U.S. Again, more of the travel is domestic and intra-regional, that\u2019s what\u2019s really going to kind of drive things and more of the foreign exchange issues are not as pronounced within the given region. Let me just double click it too on a couple of Brian\u2019s points, because I think they are really important because of these partnerships that we\u2019ve had with local governments, especially on tax collection, we have delivered more than $6 billion in tourism-related taxes to local governments. I mean, this is a material amount of money. And collecting \u2013 remitting taxes, we do it in over 30,000 jurisdictions around the globe. And I think in terms of like zoning regulations, we believe that the reasonable regulation actually normalizes hosting. And when you normalize hosting, it can really be a foundation for future growth. So we actually think that you do this in a reasonable way, and it will actually be a tailwind to growth in the future. Yes, in terms of the active bookers, I think you kind of step back and look at the marketing approach that we\u2019ve had since pre COVID and that we really has accelerated in COVID in sense has been to continue to focus on the overall brand of Airbnb and to be less reliant on search engine marketing. We\u2019ve been incredibly effective at that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid which is driving a great return on investment for kind of new active bookers. And so I think the return that we\u2019re getting on new has been quite good. And in terms of the cohorts of new, we\u2019re actually seeing that the cohorts that are coming in since COVID are actually as strong, if not even stronger than they were in prior to COVID. The people that are willing to kind of travel right now and experience Airbnb have are really sticky, and the cohorts are as strong and not stronger than we saw previously. Just to double quick on the strong \u2013 the second home impact question. If you go back and think about the 4 million hosts that we have a very different business than many others. So 90% of those hosts are individual hosts. They are the people that own a first \u2013 a primary home or maybe a secondary home and a big strength of our business, we saw this in COVID is that people even during an economic kind of shock period, they don\u2019t get rid of their primary home. They don\u2019t get necessarily getting rid of their secondary home, which is very different than professional hosts that maybe are doing an arbitrage of exact cost of ownership and return on the investment they can get on that specific property versus other alternatives. And so I think that this helps buffer any of those kind of impacts on our businesses, that individual host community. Sure. On the year-over-year for Q4 \u2013 the Q4 pressure ADR is year-over-year. In terms of the backlog for \u201823, it\u2019s a little early to tell, but really, what we\u2019re seeing is continued strong demand for travel overall. And like I said, when you look back to historic levels of growth back to 2019, we\u2019re seeing stable to increasing demand. We have strong bookings on the books for Q4, but then there will be fewer on the books yet for it kind of tails off into 2023. So it\u2019s a little early to say. But we\u2019re seeing no hints of a decline in people\u2019s demand and willingness to travel. It\u2019s just a little early to extrapolate much further. Yes, I\u2019ll just double click. I mean, it\u2019s just a great value that we provide, right, that can people can pick anything from budget to luxe. And if a person has a certain kind of budget constraint, they can choose to maybe get a slightly smaller place or place with fewer amenities maybe they are well further out, like they can adjust the type of home they want based on their budget. And I think Airbnb has such a diversity of offerings that, that enables them to do it uniquely with us, which is very different than the flexibility they might have in hotels. Sure. In terms of like urban coming back, it just continues to be a higher and higher percentage of our overall mix. It\u2019s not quite back to where it was in 2019, and it may never quite be because we see such great strength in our non-urban but urban is strengthening each quarter. And so that\u2019s the trend that we\u2019re seeing on the urban side. And I think it\u2019s actually similar on the cross-border international side. We\u2019re not back to where we were in kind of 2019 level. Gross nights were like 48% were cross-border back in 2019. And what we\u2019ve just seen is a cross-border continues to be a greater, greater percentage every quarter, but we\u2019re not quite back to where we were in 2019. Excellent. So yes, the free cash flow, I\u2019m really proud of our delivery of the free cash flow and the free cash flow margin. So thanks for calling it out. I mean we\u2019ve just made substantial improvement in the overall profitability of our business, right? We\u2019ve radically adjusted our marketing expenditures to be substantially lower. We\u2019ve made metronomic improvement in our variable costs. We\u2019re seeing great leverage in our fixed costs. We\u2019re being incredibly disciplined in our fixed cost growth, and that will continue going forward. And so all of those will be tailwinds to being able to maintain or even increase our free cash flow margins over time. As average daily rates could moderate next year, that does put a little bit of a headwind towards our margins. But I think the improvements in our variable costs and the fixed cost leverage should enable us to maintain or even increase free cash flow margins over the longer-term. What we will continue to have greater expansion in free cash flow margin to be some of the things that Brian talked about a little bit ago, it would be kind of incremental services or activities that we add for guests or host over time. And there is no immediate announcements of major changes that you should anticipate in \u201823, but know that, that is a focus for us and over a more extended period will drive incremental revenue for us and incremental margin. And if I double-click on one area is that we announced our Live and Work Anywhere policy this year, and I think that has enabled us to hire the best people in the world regardless of where they live. And so to Brian\u2019s point about hiring fewer, more senior, and more experts in areas, this has clearly been able to make sure that we are getting the best talent in the world. And then in terms of \u2013 to answer the question on guidance, too. On the guidance, articulation of the longer lead times for bookings and just the Q4 bookings that we have already on the books for the rest of this quarter is just to indicate that we have stable to accelerating demand for growth, right. And demand from our guests around the world. It\u2019s that we are not seeing a softening in that demand especially when you look back to historic levels of 2019, that any of the deceleration in revenue growth between Q3 and Q4 is largely due to the uniqueness of the 2021 timing of growth between Delta and Omicron. So, I just think it just shows the stability of people wanting to get out their homes, wanting to travel, regardless of the macroeconomic uncertainties. Sure. I mean if you look at our actual advertising strategy and the amount of money we are spending on it, it\u2019s going to be relatively flat from \u201822 over \u201821, and you should anticipate similar marketing as a percentage of revenue in \u201823. And so we can certainly flex it in line with revenue. We will be kind of mindful of that. But what we have already kind of hit this new kind of lower overall rate. And what we have actually seen is, to the extent that we are keeping it flat even as we grow, it\u2019s because we are actually seeing such success that we are wanting to be able to invest in other countries. Certainly, we can moderate that over time, but we are already so low that I wouldn\u2019t anticipate us dropping it dramatically in face of substantial headwinds over growth. But we can flex it with the revenue within a reasonably a few hundred basis points here and there. Yes. Well, a couple of things. One thing is we are not focused on optimizing just night side. I think nights is an important measure, and it\u2019s an important driver of kind of overall demand. But we could also drive a lot of nights and looking and try to just drive them towards lower rate nights. Like we are trying to drive a balance of making sure that we have nights growth and revenue growth. And revenue growth obviously pays the bills. And so we are seeing strong growth in the business. I am very happy with our Q3 results. And on our full guide like you said, I think we are seeing stable to increasing demand, and we are just really impressed with the resiliency of guests and their willingness to travel and interest in traveling Airbnb. And I guess it goes back to the backlog, too, is that the reason why we kind of highlight is just that people are having confidence in travel. So, what we are seeing is that, yes, the booking windows are up year-over-year. There are a little bit \u2013 there is some seasonality in that. So, they are actually booking windows a little bit down from Q3. And so as \u2013 the lead times are just up from historical levels because the people are confident in being able to travel, I think that\u2019s the important thing you should take away."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "Alright. Well, thank you, Ellie and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Q3 was another record quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds. We had nearly 100 million Nights and Experiences Booked, which is up 25% year-over-year. Gross booking value was $15.6 billion. This is up 31% year-over-year. Revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, our highest ever. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 36% year-over-year. Now, we also had our most profitable quarter ever. Net income was $1.2 billion. And this is up $400 million from a year ago. Now, this represents a 42% net income margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, also our highest ever and we generated $960 million of free cash flow. In fact, over the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. What our Q3 results demonstrate is that Airbnb continues to drive growth and profitability at scale. And even with the macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that we are well positioned for the road ahead. Now why is this? Well, new use cases such as long-term stays and non-urban travel are here to stay. And this is because millions of people now have the flexibility that they didn\u2019t have before the pandemic. At the same time, we have seen recovery in urban and cross-border travel, two of our strongest segments before the pandemic. And just like during the Great Recession in 2008, when everything started, people today are especially interested in earning extra income through hosting. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand on Airbnb remains strong. Globally, we exceeded 90 million guest arrivals during the quarter and this is another record. Now even with macroeconomic headwinds, Nights and Experiences Booked increased 25%. And during the quarter, we also continued to see longer lead times, supporting a stronger backlog for Q4. Second, guests are increasingly returning to cities and crossing borders. Both segments continue to accelerate. Cross-border gross nights booked increased 58% compared to a year ago. High density urban nights booked grew 27%. And now even as these two segments return, demand for domestic and non-urban travel remains strong. Third, guests continue to stay longer on Airbnb. Over the last year, we have seen many companies require their employees to return to the office. And at the same time, long-term stay remains 20% of our total gross nights booked on Airbnb. And finally, four, our host community continues to grow. We believe there are several factors that are driving this growth. The first reason is the demand drives supply. For instance, in Q3, as guests were returning to cities, we saw urban supply accelerate. Second, since Airbnb began in 2008, posts have consistently churned Airbnb to earn extra income. In fact, since 2008, hosts on Airbnb have earned $180 billion in our platform. Third, over last year, we made several product improvements to help onboard and support our hosts, but we are not stopping there. On November 16, we are going to introduce an all-new super easy way for millions of people to turn to Airbnb their homes as part of our winter release. We are also delivering a major upgrade to AirCover that provides even more top or bottom protection for every host. Now with these upgrades and more, we aim to unlock the next generation of hosts and improve the experience for more than 4 million people that are already hosting. So just to recap, we had a record Q3, Nights and Experiences Booked were our highest Q3 ever, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were record high, free cash flow was $950 million. And in the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. So with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions. Alright. Thanks, Lloyd. Dave, why don\u2019t I answer these and then you can go at a high level and you can go specifically into the booking side question. But Lloyd, what I am going to do is I\u2019ll answer it at a little more of a high level. So one of the things that we have seen is, despite a lot of consumers pulling back on spending, the one area that I haven\u2019t seen them pullback on as much is travel. And in particular, like travel, where you can go and see your friends, see your family, more inspirational type of travel, in other words, meaningful travel and not just mass travel. And I think the reason why is just because many people are now working from home, the mall is now Amazon. The movie theater is now Netflix, people still want to get out of their house. They still want to have memories. They still want to have meaningful experiences. And I think that\u2019s why they continue to turn to Airbnb. And so just like people continue to travel this quarter, we expect really strong demand for Airbnb next year. And again, the new use cases are sticking. In other words, a fifth of our nights booked are for longer than a month and half of our nights booked are longer than a week. And this has basically been a boon because of the flexibility that people have and being able to essentially work from home or have a hybrid work lifestyle. At the same time, our urban and cross-border businesses are incredibly strong because of the value that we provide. And we think that value and having great deals is going to be a key driver as the economy slows down. On the supply side, I just would remind everyone that we started Airbnb in 2008 during the Great Recession. And at that time, many people were turning to Airbnb to earn extra income. And so we think this will be also a great time for millions of people to consider hosting, which is why we are focused on this on November 16. So we are feeling really positive about the path forward. With regards to Experiences, to answer your question very simply, the great thing about Experiences is we don\u2019t have to have very much incremental investment to make this work. It\u2019s really just a matter of incorporating Experiences more into our existing marketing and incorporating Experiences more into our existing products. So I don\u2019t think you will see that in the P&L from a cost perspective next year at all. Dave, feel free to take \u2013 anything else you want to add. Yes, Naved. Why don\u2019t Dave \u2013 you take these, I can round out the answers. Dave, why don\u2019t you take the first question, I can take the second. And I think just regarding elevated home prices and what that does to average daily rate on Airbnb, I mean just to zoom out, people come to Airbnb because they can find a great value. And you can often get significantly more for your money than a hotel room. You can often get an entire home with a lot of amenities. And continuing to deliver value is going to be really important for the next travel season. And that means that we need to make sure we have really competitive prices. And that means that we need to give tools for host, more tools for them to be able to better price their listings. So, one of the things we are doing is we are going to continue to move towards a more all-in pricing, where when you see pricing, instead of seeing more of a nightly rate, you are going to see a little bit more of a fully loaded rate. And then our search ranking is going to prioritize great value, great deal for the fully loaded price. I think this will really help host understand what they are charging and then we are going to give them more tools so they can see and understand what their all-in pricing is for guests and we are going to provide more discount tools and other features to allow hosts to remain competitive. And if we do all these things, I believe we will be even more competitive from a pricing standpoint than we are today. Yes, yes. So let me dive into this, because this is a pretty important topic. Just to zoom out, we have a global network where demand drives supply. And that means that where we see our highest growth of bookings is also typically where we see our highest growth of supply. And just to give you an example, this past quarter, approximately 35% of our new available hosts had started as guests. So this is a really strong network where guests become host and the host as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends about it, and then we get more supply that way. And so this is, I think, one of the things that\u2019s really, really important. But beyond that, obviously, we want to be very aggressive about recruiting more hosts to Airbnb, because this is a great time. And because of the softening economy, we think increasingly now more than ever before, people are interested in putting their homes on Airbnb to make supplemental income. So to answer your question, what are the pain points? I would highlight too, as we\u2019ve talked to people that are considering hosting, they have told us two things. The first thing they said is that they want it to be easier to get started. They need help getting started becoming a host. The second thing is they are a little nervous about having strangers in their house. And so we have tackled both of these. On November 16, as part of our winter release, number one, we are going to unveil an all new super easy way for millions of people to put their home on Airbnb. I am pretty excited about this. We have been working on this for quite a while. Second, to make people feel comfortable about having other people in their home, which will unlock a lot more everyday people putting their real homes on Airbnb, we are going to be providing some huge upgrades and improvements to AirCover for host. If we do these two things, I think we are going to help unlock significantly greater amounts of supply, which is already on top of the momentum that we have and we have seen in Q3. Maybe the final thing I\u2019ll just say is in addition to adding more supply in Airbnb, the Holy Grail is pointing demand to where we have supply, because I know night globally on Airbnb, are we ever close to 100% occupied. It\u2019s just a matter of pointing demand to where we have supply. And this is the whole theory around Airbnb categories that instead of hoping people type in the place you have available supply in the search box, you can then come and have more of a browse experience where we highlight homes that are available. So this is our holistic strategy. As far as pain points, as far as like from a regulatory standpoint, I mean, one of the things we\u2019ve seen is a redistribution away from very large city kind of to everywhere. And a lot of cities and a lot of local communities have been actually reaching out to us, because they can see the economic opportunity we provide. So we are working really, really closely with these markets, but we are feeling very optimistic about our supply for 2023. Alright. Yes, Dave, do you want to take the first question? Alright. Sorry, sorry, I just want to answer about conversion of traffic for unflexible. So yes, at a high level, conversion on a year-over-year basis is up. But I would actually generally say, Brian, that we actually think about it even more broadly. When we launch Airbnb Categories, for example, one of the goals was not just increased conversion, but was actually to increase traffic. And there is a scenario where you can increase traffic, initially conversion can go down because you are a little bit more in the inspiration business. And there were people who are coming and they are dreaming and planning travel. So you really want to look at conversion over a longer period of time. But we have actually seen metronomic improvement in our conversion rate. But stays listings in Airbnb Categories since we launched on May 11 have been viewed more than 300 million times and with homes they would have never otherwise have known existed. So we are really excited about the progress we\u2019re making between Airbnb Categories, which is really bringing a lot more traffic to Airbnb, plenty demand were half supply, bringing us top of funnel. There would be AirCover for guests, which is making people feel more assured about their experience and allowing a more consistent form of reliability. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to see a step change in improvement in the product from a guest experience. And this, of course, will continue to lead to greater conversion. Yes, Doug, I mean, I\u2019ll let Dave fill in, in more detail. But at the highest level, I think it\u2019s actually pretty simple. In \u2013 as the economy slows down, I think people are looking for more ways to make either supplemental income or like greater yield on the assets they have. And so we generally see a selling economy as a moment when more and more people are going to be presumably turning to Airbnb for hosting. And so whether it\u2019s second homes or primary homes, I think there is going to be a pretty big opportunity for us. And we just want to make sure that we provide great tools for people so they continue to lift on Airbnb. As far as some of the metrics we\u2019ve seen, again, as I said, conversion has steadily picked up. Homes and Airbnb experiences have been viewed more than 300 million times. We\u2019re seeing us continue to spread out bookings to more and more markets, which is a bit of the Holy Grail to be on the point demand we have supply. With AirCover for guests, which is another very important upgrade that we made because this is AirCover for guests really addresses a bit of the chilly fuel of Airbnb, which is on the one hand, we have this incredible one-of-a-kind homes. Other hand, one of a kind can be variable in consistency. And so what we\u2019ve seen with AirCover is we provide protection in the unlikely event that a host cancels or you get to a home and it\u2019s not as described. And we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve launched AirCover for guests, NPS is up and probably even more importantly, rebooking rates when I guess it dissatisfied is also up. And so if we can do these two things: on the front end, continue to be more in the inspiration business, point demand already have supply. On the back end, make sure that Airbnb\u2019s are meeting your expectations. And in the rare event that they don\u2019t, we make it right, then these are going to continue to unlock significantly greater growth for us in the year ahead. Alright, Dave, I think you can take this one. Yes. Mario, yes. Just to give a little more context to those listening about pricing. Right now, we have pricing that is primarily displayed on a nightly rate. Post, you can then choose to add a cleaning fee and then Airbnb ad service fees. And one of the things that we\u2019ve been hearing from guests, and we heard it loud and clear, is that people would like a little more transparency about what they are actually paying when they first get to Airbnb. And so we are working on redesigning how pricing works on Airbnb, so people better understand the total price they are going to pay the moment they arrive at Airbnb, and it\u2019s not a surprise for them. So I think the north star for us on this matter is transparency. I think the benefit of this is going to be \u2013 we also want to make it easier for a host to understand what they are charging. And sometimes to tell us that they are not aware of what guests are paying because as you know, we add a guest service fee on top of the price that the host charge and occasionally hosts that they are charging more than they intended to. And so we are updating some of the tools to make it easier for hosts to understand what they are charging, and this will allow them to be more competitive. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to be updating our search ranking algorithm. We\u2019ve been making some refinements to prioritize home that offer a better value. And of course, when a guest checks out, they leave a 5-star rating. One of the questions we ask is on a scale of 1 to 5, how good of a value was this, and home to offer a great value are going to be prioritized higher in search results. And in addition to that, we\u2019re going to continue to develop new discounting tools, discounting tools like seasonal discounts, weekly discounts, peak season discounts and really tools to make host more competitive. If we do all this, I do believe the prices will get even more competitive. And one of the things we know is obviously as the prices get more competitive, conversion rate goes up and as conversion rate goes up, bookings go up. And just the final thing to say is we will have some updates on this soon. I\u2019ll be in making some announcements soon. Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Mario. I\u2019ll start and Dave, you can feel free to jump in. We do not have an intention to increase take rate. I mean this is a company that, obviously, in the last quarter did more than $1 billion in net income, nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. So I think there is a lot of levers to increase monetization on Airbnb, but I don\u2019t think we have to increase take rate to do that. In other words, there is opportunities like to allow additional services to host that we could charge for, and we think they pay for that we can do. So there is a lot of ways to increase the take rate on Airbnb. There are going to be some areas where we can probably optimize and improve take rates and potentially lower a little bit like on long-term space. If you\u2019re booking a place for 2, 3, 4 months, we think conversion rate might go up if we were to lower the take rate a little bit. But I don\u2019t think this would cut into our current business. I think that might actually keep more bookings on the platform. So we are going to continue to look at some optimization, but we think that we provide a great value. And I think if we make some of these pricing and discount changes in the coming future, I think the value on Airbnb will get even better. We\u2019re going to remain disciplined on our expenses. And there is a lot of monetization opportunities going forward. But our general view is if we\u2019re going to charge more, we should provide more. That\u2019s our North Star. I mean I could answer the high level and Dave, you can go in. I mean, Bernie, it\u2019s a very great question. One of the things we noticed during the pandemic \u2013 one of the lessons of the pandemic is I think Airbnb is the most adaptable business model in all of travel. And the reason why is we\u2019re not just the European business, we\u2019re not just a North American business. We are a truly global business. We\u2019re in 100,000 cities all over the world. We\u2019re not just a vacation rental business. We\u2019re also an urban business, also a cross-border business. We\u2019re not just a family business. We\u2019re also popular with millennials, Gen Z and retiree at nearly every type of price point. So I think that however travel demand changes, we will be able to adapt. And that\u2019s one of the great things about our model. It\u2019s a global network, guests become hosts. Most hosts are regular people that tell their friends about Airbnb, which is why when a market occupancy increases, it tends in itself create more supply. So these are some of the reasons why we feel very, very excited about our ability to continue to adapt given this challenging macroeconomic environment. Dave, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to it? Yes, James, yes, I think that as we give more tools to host to be able to dynamically price, they can be more competitive. And as they are more competitive, then we will continue to gain more share. So anything that allows greater value allows for more share. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 other than changing how pricing will be displayed to make it more transparent, intuitive and to continue to offer better value, we\u2019re not actually looking at a fundamental change to our pricing structure. Yes, Dave, you want to take this one? Alright. So we have two questions. I think, Dave, you can take the first one, and then I\u2019ll take Categories. Yes. And to answer your other question about the kind of timing for wide adoption of Airbnb Categories, it\u2019s a great question. I think just to kind of zoom out, customers of travel have been, as you know, trained over the last 25 years to search a certain way. And that way is to go to a website, there is a search box, you type in where you want to go and you search. And then what you get is a list of results. You refine the results, you compare sometimes the different websites, different apps and then you make a booking. And I think this is going to be a year transition to retrain kind of customers about how they can search for travel on Airbnb. But I think we\u2019re going to start to see some really great momentum next year. Again, we are already seeing people discover home they never knew existed. We are seeing a lot more people engage with categories. The homes and categories have been viewed more than 300 million times, we are going to continue to be making improvements to this every single year. We have some upgrades coming out in two weeks in November. And of course, you are going to see some upgrades beyond that as well. So, I think this is a really great opportunity for us. And again, because we are a little more concentrated in vacation travel, the business travel, and because people are increasingly more flexible when they travel, we think they are going to be much more open to ideas from Airbnb. And part of this is idea of Airbnb becoming more at the top of the funnel. The way the travel funnel used to be, if you go to one website to figure out where to travel, these are typically travel content sites. Then you go to the next site, typically to book your flight, and then the third thing you do is get your hotel or get your housing. So, with Airbnb was kind of step three. And we like Airbnb to go from kind of step three to step one. This is going to take some retraining for everything to go from step three to step one, but I think there is definitely a line of sight to getting there. Hey. Yes. Stephen, I mean the crown jewel of our China business was always and we thought always was going to be the China outbound business. And the reason why is the take rate was higher for the outbound business than it was for the domestic business. The inventory is more unique. There is less competition and the average daily rate is a lot higher. So, the outbound business was always the price part of our business. And that\u2019s what we are focused on. Now, as you know, not a lot of people are leaving the country right now, but we want to be prepared for when they do. And they eventually will, of course. And so the two things we are doing to prepare is, number one, we are going to be continuing to invest in our brand in China. And number two, if people are traveling and they are leaving China, they are going to other countries, and we would call these the core to countries. And the primary place, they are first probably going to go with intra-region. So, they are presumably going to be going to Southeast Asia, Korea, Japan. Eventually, they will go a little further to Europe and then they will presumably come back to the United States, especially maybe the kind of some of the coastal cities. And this is kind of how I think travel may recover. And so what we need to do is make sure we have enough supply in these corridors and continue to invest in our brand in China. And I think by only having an outbound business, we can actually focus all of our investments just on that, and it actually makes a lot more cost effective, a lot more efficient. And one thing I have learned is more focused we are, the more likely we are to achieve our results. So, that\u2019s what we are feeling. We are actually feeling really confident about the prospects for China. It\u2019s just going to be a longer like payoff than because of the fact that not a lot of people are leaving the country and traveling right now. Yes. Hey Eric, good to talk to you. Yes, let me just recap how we think about expense management and investments. Before the pandemic, we were essentially a nearly breakeven business doing like a little under $250 million in loss from an EBITDA perspective. And of course, in the pandemic hit, we lost 80% of our business, and we completely changed our cost structure. And out of that crisis, we made a decision. And the decision we made is we weren\u2019t going to wait for another crisis, another weakened economy or a recession to change how we invest or we run the company that we were going to be lean regardless of the economy. In other words, we were going to go from the Navy to the Navy seal, a small, lean, elite group. And so we are a small team, we are functionally organized. We are only slightly more than 6,000 people in the beginning of this year. Before obviously, the economy took a turn for the worst, we still only had a plan to hire 7% to 8% more employees. In other words, we had a plan to be really profitable and we were planning for a storm. And so we have not had a change anything about our hiring plans. We don\u2019t intend to change anything about our hiring plans in the next 12 months to 18 months regardless of the economy because one of the lessons we have learned is a smaller we are, the more nimble we are, the faster we can move. And not only can we be more profitable, we can actually grow faster. And we have been actually more productive than we ever were in our history. We have made more than 150 upgrades in innovation across the core service. So, we are still really aggressive about trying to attract the best of our generation to this company, but that doesn\u2019t mean hiring a lot of people. We are really embracing being a lean organization, which is partly our functional structure. We are not a business organization where you would have four marketing departments. We have one functional organization, and so that allows us to be quite a bit leaner. And I guess that goes to your other question, which is slowness in the economy. Well, regardless of what happens to the economy, our model is highly adaptable. We have a very low expense base. And we are pretty efficient with marketing. We spend a lot less on marketing than our competitors and the vast majority of our traffic is direct. So, whatever happens to the economy, I think we are in a pretty good position where we won\u2019t have to change the way we run the company. But I think we have proven if we ever have to, of course, we will. But I don\u2019t expect for us to have to make a lot of changes because of how much cash we are generating, because of how lean we already are. Yes. And maybe the last thing I will just say is I think that we learned a lot of lessons probably a year or 2 years earlier than a lot of other tech companies because we were hit so hard so early. But I think the adversity, the challenge we had just made us a much more focused, a much better company. And one of the commitments we made is we are never going to forget the lessons from the pandemic. We are never going to lose our discipline. Because the more disciplined we are, the more focused we are, not only to become more profitable, but we actually innovate faster. And so those principles are here to stay. Alright. I will take obviously the first one, Ron. Thanks. So yes, questions around kind of the longer-term strategy around AirCover. And maybe the way to explain AirCover, let\u2019s just take as an analogy, let\u2019s take Amazon. So, my recollection of Amazon, this will go back maybe 20 years, because 20 years ago, Amazon even back then, their core retail business was an amazing product. They had the most amount of selection on the Internet, and they have the lowest prices. But the problem with Amazon is they had an Achilles\u2019 heel. And the Achilles\u2019 heel was they were competing with walking in a store and taking something out at that moment. And so one of the things they created was Amazon Prime, which was obviously addressing the core Achilles\u2019 heel, which was shipping. I think every business has to understand what its potential weakness is. I think the great thing about Airbnb\u2019s model is we similarly have probably the widest selection of accommodations and everything we have is truly one of a kind at a great value. But our challenge is unlike a hotel, we don\u2019t control the inventory and it cannot structurally always be as consistent. We can\u2019t expect every property. So, AirCover similar for consistency addresses something similar to what Prime did for Amazon with shipping, which is to say, what if we could take this off the table, this question of consistency. And on the host side, the protections have led to a huge increase in NPS. Our NPS for AirCover for a host is over 60. And this is after something happened to your home. So clearly, this was a huge hit. And it was so popular that we decided to bring it to guests. And I think where this can go is over the coming years, we can offer increasingly more protection, more coverage for more different use cases. And I think the North Star for AirCover is if a listing was across \u2013 most of our inventory is only in Airbnb. But let\u2019s say a home was on two different websites, Airbnb and another website, we want AirCover to be so compelling that just by having AirCover alone, it would be reason to go direct and book on Airbnb and not book anywhere else. And we are going to continue to make improvements every single year, and I want AirCover to be the gold standard for customer service for our category. And that\u2019s what we are really focused on. And then down the road, there may be opportunities to offer like a paid version of this or some other type of membership program, but that would be down the road, but it\u2019s a very popular customer request. Yes. I can \u2013 I will take both, and then Dave can feel free to dive in, especially on the bookings. I mean I think our \u2013 just to answer your question on whether bookings were down for hosts. I mean at the macro level, at the high level, they are not down. And I mean I think the Q3 results speak for themselves. There are anecdotal descriptions of some host bookings are down, some host bookings are up. And this \u2013 there is many possible explanations for this. It\u2019s just that travel is continuing to change. One of the other things though is that our search rank algorithm is prioritizing all-in pricing and host with the best value. So, it\u2019s possible that might be one possible explanation. But again, it\u2019s primarily what we have seen is anecdotal. And it really depends \u2013 you really have to take it on a case-by-case basis. But overall, obviously, bookings are up. In fact, it\u2019s a record quarter. Now, with regard to long-term stays beyond travel, I mean feedback, I would just say that we have only scratched the surface. A fifth of our nights book are for stays longer than a month. And this is before making some really big fundamental improvement to this product in this category. And I think in the coming years, flexibility is here to stay. I think more people are going to work remotely in a hybrid way 5 years from now than they do today. I think increasingly, fewer people are going to have 1-year leases, not to say no one will, but more and more people are going to value the flexibility and want to live in different places. And we think there is a real opportunity. And one of the things we are going to also see over the coming years isn\u2019t just that people are going to live in different parts of the United States, but people are going to choose to live for short periods of time abroad in different countries. So, we think we are going to start to see more long-term cross-border business, too. So, there is a lot of opportunities here. And we are going to be making some upgrades to our long-term stay business to tap into this large market. I mean the largest expense that most people have in their life is their housing, it\u2019s their housing costs. And we have built many of the tools and features that you would need to provide for a longer term stay offering already. But we are going to continue to make improvements. And as we do, I think we will continue to take more and more of that market. Dave, do you want to start with this? And I will just say \u2013 just to jump in. I mean we don\u2019t really think of marketing as a way to buy customers because, obviously, as we have mentioned, more than 90% of our traffic is direct or organic. And so the main thing is we take a full funnel approach to marketing. And actually the top of the funnel is PR and communication. And we think that\u2019s one of the biggest drivers of our traffic is PR. And then brand marketing is actually important. And actually, we think a bit more like product marketing. We want to educate people about our new features. So, right now, we are advertising and educating people about Airbnb Categories and AirCover. And then we think that performance marketing is more of a way the laser in to balance supply and demand rather than a way purchased a large amount of customers. And that\u2019s essentially the way we think about marketing. And this allows for a very efficient, very dynamic approach to marketing that should get more efficient every single year. Yes. Brad, I will take the first question. I think Dave can take the second. Yes, I mean what we do see is that many hosts do bring their prices up or down as demand goes up or down. That being said, I think there is opportunities for us to have more dynamic tools and give more visibility that would make prices even more competitive. To answer your question, they do, many hosts do adjust their prices, but I think hosts probably adjust their prices less frequently than hotels. And so in periods of time where prices are generally coming down in the industry, we might be a little bit slower. But as we build more tools to provide more dynamic changes, we will be \u2013 continue to be more competitive. And I will let Dave take next question. Alright. Well, first of all, thank you all for joining today. I just want to recap and just say we are incredibly proud of our results. And I believe we are incredibly well positioned for the future ahead. I hope you all join us in two weeks for 2022 winter release. You will be able to watch it right from our homepage on Wednesday, this is November 16th, 8 a.m. Eastern. Thank you all and I will see you then."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I'll now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's Second Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2022. These items were posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A.  Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance.  Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitute for our GAAP results.  And with that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining.  Our Q2 results demonstrate that Airbnb has achieved growth and profitability at scale. From a growth perspective, we exceeded 103 million Nights and Experiences Booked. Now this was our largest quarterly number ever. Revenue was $2.1 billion, up 58% from last year or 64%, excluding foreign exchange. Gross booking value was $17 billion, up 27% from last year or 34% if you exclude foreign exchange. Now both revenue and GBV were 73% higher than Q2 2019, significantly outperforming the travel industry.  Now from a profitability perspective, we had our most profitable Q2 ever. Net income of $379 million was a nearly $700 million improvement from Q2 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $711 million. Now this represents a 34% adjusted EBITDA margin, which is significantly up from the 16% margin in Q2 2021, a negative 4% in Q2 2019. Finally, we generated $795 million of free cash flow. Now this is a $1.1 billion improvement from the nearly $300 million cash burn 2 years ago at the depth of the pandemic. Over the last 12 months, Airbnb generated $3 billion in free cash flow, nearly $3 billion, and ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash.  So what explains this transformation in our business? Well, first, our business model is adaptable. We have nearly every type of space in nearly every location so however travel changes, we can adapt. And regardless of the economic environment, our guests come to Airbnb because they can find great value and our host can earn extra income.  Second, we've relentlessly innovated while also staying focused and disciplined. When the pandemic began in 2020, we made some incredibly difficult decisions. We significantly reduced spending, making us a leaner and more focused company. And we've kept this discipline ever since, allowing us to keep the hiring and investment plans made in the beginning of the year. And Airbnb is well positioned for whatever lies ahead. In fact, we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. And this is coming only 1.5 years after our IPO.  Now returning to our Q2 results. Our strong financial performance was driven by a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand in Airbnb is as high as ever. In Q2, we surpassed 103 million Nights and Experiences Booked, marking our highest quarterly number ever. Now despite broader macroeconomic concerns, we still saw a 25% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked compared to the quarter of 2021.  Now early in Q2, strong guest demand exceeded our expectations. This is because guests in Europe and North America booked earlier than they have historically. Now given this earlier booking, growth rates compared to last year decelerated in May and June. And since the end of Q2, what we've seen is growth in nights booked reaccelerate from June to July as we enter peak travel season.  Second, guests continue to return to cities and cross borders. In previous quarters, we've talked about how we saw significant growth driven by surges in domestic travel as well as travel to rural destinations. Now these trends continue. But we're also seeing guests returning to cities and crossing borders above pre-pandemic levels.  Third, guests continue to stay longer in Airbnb. They're not just traveling Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. We saw long-term stays of 28 days or more remain our fastest-growing category by trip nights compared to 2019. The long-term stays has increased nearly 25% from a year ago. And actually, long-term stays have increased almost 90% since Q2 2019.  Fourth, guest demand is driving growth on our host community. We continue to see the strongest supply increases in areas of greatest demand, with nonurban active listings up 50% compared to Q2 2019. But as demand is returning to cities, we're also seeing an increase in total urban supply. And we believe the upgrades we introduced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and AirCover are supporting this growth, but we're not stopping there. So you're going to see some exciting new product features to recruit the next generation of host later this year.  Finally, I'd like to share a few highlights from the 2022 summer release. In May, we introduced Airbnb Categories. Since launch, listings in the Airbnb Categories have been viewed more than 180 million times. Through Categories, we are distributing guest discovery across more destinations and dates.  Now we also introduced AirCover for guests. Since launch, the Net Promoter Score for guests that had an issue with their stay has already improved. And the real insulin -- instance where our host cancels, AirCover has led to 10% more rebookings.  So to recap. We achieved significant milestones this quarter with our results. Nights and Experiences Booked were our highest ever. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were records for Q2, and free cash flow was $795 million. In the last 12 months, we generated nearly $3 billion in free cash flow.  Now before I go to questions, I want to talk about an update on my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. Last month, Joe announced that he'll be stepping back from this full-time operating role. Joe will continue to serve on the Board of Directors of both Airbnb and Airbnb.org. Airbnb is a founder-led company. So he's going to continue to take a role at Airbnb, and this will be as an adviser to me on future concepts and creative culture.  Since the beginning, Joe has always been focused on big ideas to help others. These are uncompromising True North. So it will be fun to be able to spend more time with them on dreaming up new ideas, just like the early days. And as I reflect back on the last 14 years together, I just can't believe how lucky Joe, Nate and I have been. If anything, I've just gone a few degrees in a different direction, I wouldn't be doing this call with you right now. That's how fragile ideas are. And it's what gives me gratitude to know Joe and Nate. And what I'm most thankful for is that we're still together, still meeting every Sunday 14 years after we started. We built a dream together, and now, after all these years, we still continue to dream. So thank you, Joe.  And with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Two questions, if I can. First, just it looks like room Nights and Experiences Booked grew a little bit sequentially less in 2Q this year than it did in '19. And similarly, the guidance looks like it's calling for a little bit slower sequential growth. Just wondering if there's anything you'd call out that's behind that?  And then secondly, can you give us an update on what you're seeing around just how people are using the platform post some of the new search and discovery innovations this summer? Are you seeing demand move into a wider dispersion of areas or any changes in conversion rates? What are early learnings from some of those innovations this past summer?\nBrian Chesky: Thank you very much. Dave, why don't you take the first question about Q2, Q3 growth, and I can talk a little bit about how the launch from Airbnb Categories have affected how people use Airbnb?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. So our Q2 gross nights before the cancellations, they came in actually above our internal expectations. We did see some elevated cancellations in the back of the quarter relative to our forecast. We believe that some of the elevated cancellation's related to flight cancellations around the world, but it was mostly in North America towards the end of Q2 '22. And we're just seeing strong overall nights kind of growth, the 25% year-over-year growth in nights and experiences, we feel very confident in. And the same -- having the same results for Q3, we also feel quite good about. We're just seeing strong demand for guest travel all around the world.\nBrian Chesky: And just to answer the second question, just to give a little bit of background, for decades, travel search has worked the same way. There's a box, a search box, and you are asked to enter a location. And the problem with that is that Airbnb is in 100,000 locations all over the world. And so people can't think to type in 100,000 destinations into a search box. And so people miss millions of unique Airbnbs they would have never known to search for. And the reason this is important, as you asked is because we think that category categories can allow us to point demand to where we have supply. This, I think, is one of the really big opportunities.  So as I said, since release, listings in every categories have been viewed over 180 million times. We've also seen that guests are now showing more flexibility with their dates and their destinations than before. So for example, a typical search, properties are 30 miles further apart than they would have been before. So we are seeing search radiuses increase. And additionally, we are seeing more people continue to use the flexible date feature. So we believe our theory is working. Airbnb categories allows us to highlight what makes us unique. It allows us to point demand where we have supply. And I also think it helps us be in the inspiration business where people to start to travel on Airbnb.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: So the first one is on new initiatives. So we look at the third quarter guidance, it seems like bookings is expected to contract by more than 10 points in 3Q versus 2019 versus the second quarter. So does that change the timing or focus on these other new initiatives such as experiences? Or are more resources now being focused back on the core business?\nBrian Chesky: No. I mean we have a very consistent strategy. And our strategy is, number one, we want to unlock the next generation of hosts. We have 4 million hosts on Airbnb, and I think that millions more can turn to hosting, especially during these economic times. So that, I think, is really priority #1.  As we add more hosts, we continue to grow. We want Airbnb to be the ultimate host to our guests and host. That's why we offered AirCover where we continue to provide better service all over the world and continue to up level. And guests aren't just traveling Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. And so we want to continue to offer more opportunities for them to travel and live on Airbnb.  So we are still focused on our core business. That is the priority for us. We are also continuing to invest in long-term stays and other initiatives and most importantly, providing an incredible service that people love. And I would also just say, again, we're feeling really, really solid and good about Q3. Dave, anything you want to add.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I'll just double click on Brian's comment. Yes, I mean, we do really feel good about stable bookings in Q3. I mean, in particular, given we have long lead times that we're seeing. We're seeing some pull forward for summer travel here in Q2 and just the broader economic conditions overall. We are -- if you look at our gross booking value growth versus 2019, Q1 was 73%; Q2, 73%. We're just seeing strong gross booking value growth relative to 2019. And to see further kind of quarter-over-quarter acceleration, we just need to see continued recovery in Europe and APAC, which remains significantly depressed.\nMario Lu: Great. And just a follow-up, speaking of APAC. You guys mentioned that the domestic business is trending down in China, which I believe you guys said was around 1% of your business. Is there any other color you can provide in terms of the P&L impact from shutting that down? And any color on how large the outbound bookings for China is?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean the China business has been a small part of business overall. I mean, it's had less than a 1% impact on our revenue. One of the things that has been important in us getting out of the domestic business in China is maintaining a focus on what we think is the most valuable and important part of China, which is the outbound business. So really, what we've done is we've shifted all of the resources that we're applying and splitting between both domestic and outbound travel. We focused all that on outbound, which we think is the greater prize and the most important part for the long term.  So until China has their COVID policy kind of in place and allowing people to kind of travel outbound from China, it will kind of remain to be depressed. But as that evolves and Chinese travelers travel again, we think that will be a nice unlock for our Asia Pacific business. It's not going to have a material impact on our P&L.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company.\nBernard McTernan: Great. ADRs are hanging in there better than feared, I believe, still expecting them to be up year-over-year. Can you just talk to some of the puts and takes, demand-driven pricing versus mix shift?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. If you kind of rewind to what we've seen with ADRs back at the beginning of the pandemic, all of the increase was driven by mix, right? This initial resurgence of the travel for North America, whole home, nonurban. And then over time, we've seen mix become less and less a part of the increase in the ADR.  Here in both Q1 and Q2, what we've seen is that ADRs were up 40% year over -- 3 years back to 2019. And about 2/3 of that increase has been price appreciation, and about 1/3 due to mix. And so we do anticipate that over time, as more people return to travel to urban, more cross border, ADRs may moderate. But yes, as you see, 2/3 of that has actually been price appreciation. So it's been stickier than we anticipated, maybe 6 months ago.\nBernard McTernan: Got it. And then the dip in May and June from the earlier booking windows and then reacceleration in July, is that reacceleration for near-term bookings in terms of late summer? Or is that kind of early bookings for the fall and winter period?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, it's a bit of both. I mean, really, we have on the books for Q4 of this year, we have more nights on the books in Q4 than relative to the same kind of period a year ago. It's very strong. We're seeing really strong demand in the back half of the year. So we're seeing a bit of both.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Two, if I can. Brian, when you look at host right now and just the friction to onboarding, what are you looking to really solve with this upcoming release? And then secondly, perhaps for both you and Dave, you've clearly shown a lot of margin progress, free cash flow progress over the next few years. How should we think about just the puts and takes between overall growth and showing more margin, more free cash flow generation ahead?\nBrian Chesky: And just to confirm, you're talking about with this upcoming release, right, this winter?\nJustin Patterson: Yes. Well, I mean it can be a little broader in there. Just where the friction point on onboarding is.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So that's a great question. Let me -- why don't I answer the first question, and then, Dave, you can talk about margin improvement, and then I can potentially elaborate on that answer as well. We have -- as we said, we have 4 million hosts on Airbnb, but we think there are millions more people that could turn to hosting. I mean, honestly, hosting is one of the easiest ways to be able to make money with an asset that you already have. For most people, they don't need to have a start-up cost and the majority of people get a booking within the first week.  And so there are a number of things that we're going to be doing this fall -- this winter and beyond, but one of the most important things we want to do is continue to make it easier to host. And one of the high -- things I want to highlight that we launched last year was Ask a Super Host. Ask A Super Host pairs our very best super hosts with prospective hosts. And this is really cool because, basically, what it does is it allows our community to help train new community members, new hosts to come on the platform. That's made a big difference.  And we're going to continue to double down on that product. We're going to -- but we're looking at some other opportunities to continue to reduce friction. So you're going to see some really cool products to just continue to make it even easier to host. And so that's probably the primary thing that we're going to be focused on this fall. We're also looking at some additional protections for hosts, and just ways to really try to get everyday people with their primary homes that want to host occasionally to host on Airbnb.  A lot of people don't realize that the number -- the top professions for a host in the United States, for example, are school teachers, they're health care workers, they're students, these are top 3 kind of professions and locations in Airbnb. And so what we really think the big opportunity is to continue to attract regular people to become host. And we think one of the biggest sources of new hosts are prior guests on Airbnb, 36% of new hosts last quarter were prior guests.  So this is where we're going to be focused on. It's a really big opportunity for us. And I think, again, Airbnb was founded during a recession in 2008, financial crisis. People were worried about being able to pay their bills, pay for their homes and their income. And so they turned to hosting. And we think a lot of people may turn to hosting once again. So this is a big opportunity for us. Dave, if you want to talk about the margin improvement?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Thanks. We're really proud of the progress we made to reduce our fixed costs and make improvements in our variable costs. We've really exercised discipline on our spending here in 2022, and we're going to continue to do so. But while we're thrilled with this margin expansion, we're heavily in growth mode. We are not in profit maximization mode. We really want to balance profitability with growth.  We -- one of the things we're very proud in Q2 is that we are showing both growth and profitability at scale. But we'll continue to invest in growth. We're going to prioritize things. We'll grow the business over the long haul.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: Just hoping you can talk a little bit about just kind of macro environment, just what you're seeing in terms of consumer activity or types of trips being booked. And also just to get your view on long-term stays. I think you talked about 25% growth year-over-year, but just the trends there going forward.\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Well, if you start the macro environment, again, we are very pleased with our results despite any kind of macroeconomic. We're seeing strong demand here in Q3. And as I said, the Q2 nights and experiences grew 25% year-over-year, we're seeing a similar growth for Q3, and our demand in Q4 reservations is really strong, as I mentioned kind of earlier.  What we've seen so far is North America and Europe have been our strengths. We're seeing -- but we are seeing an uptick in more cross-border and more urban. So those are historic strength areas for us, and we're starting to see those parts of the businesses come back. But ultimately, if you just kind of step back, you just see the resilience of our business overall, right, that because we have so much different kinds of supply in so many places around the world, we have any kind of place for anyone that wants to travel. And there's just so much pent-up demand for travel and just so much demand for travel in general, that people would like to spend money on the experience of travel and getting out of their home more than on things that we're just continuing to see that great strength in our business.  And then in terms of long-term stays, it continues to be the fastest-growing business by tripling. So if you look at nights of 28 days or longer, that part of the business is growing faster since 2019 than any other segment stays. And actually, if you kind of subsegment it, nearly 50% of our nights are 7 days or longer. And which I think, again, you start to stay any place 7 days or more, an Airbnb is the best way to kind of experience that stay. So long-term stay trend continues to be very solid, growing faster than any other part of the business.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Jones with JMP Securities.\nNicholas Jones: Two. I guess, first, can you just kind of give us an update on the I'm Flexible option and how that's kind of playing out and what kind of experiences you're able to provide in those markets that maybe are less dense? And then a follow-up.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, yes. So Nick, I'm Flexible, essentially with the product that we launched last year, it really has 2 components. There's flexible dates that allows people to say, I'm flexible when to travel, and we can say, I'm really interested in traveling anywhere for a week and a week or a month anytime in the next year. And we also had I'm Flexible destinations.  We rebuilt I'm Flexible destination from the ground up, and that became Airbnb Categories. So that's the product that has been used or people have seen listings that have been featured in the Airbnb categories over 180 million times since May 11. This has definitely been like a huge boon for us. And what we're seeing is that people are, in fact, discovering homes they would have never otherwise seen in their books. We're seeing the search radius widen by, I think, it was 30 miles, what I said before.  The other thing we're seeing is that people are continuing to be more flexible about their dates. So more and more people are using the I'm Flexible dates feature as well.  And so we're really excited about this. I think this is a really big thing that we're going to be focusing on, and we're going to continue to be investing in this product because I think this is a bit of a paradigm shift for how people will travel. Not everyone is going to be flexible about how they travel. But for anyone that's not traveling for business or not visiting family, if you were doing leisure travel, almost by definition, you probably have some flexibility.  And as fewer and fewer people are going to be required to go into office 5 days a week, I think this option is going to be more and more important. And our business model works uniquely for this because we have a lot of unique inventory. So it has been used quite a lot, and hopefully, that answers your question.\nNicholas Jones: Yes. And then, I guess a follow-up is in some of the areas that are outside of urban areas, less dense, less, I guess, arguably activities, how are you thinking about adding more optionality to make these types of experience more engaging for the guests?\nBrian Chesky: Sorry, can you elaborate outside of urban areas. Or I'm trying...\nNicholas Jones: Like if you're in a rural area and there's less activities, arguably, because there's less population, how are you adding -- looking to add more experiences for those guests in those regions?\nBrian Chesky: Oh, I see. Yes. Well, it's a great question. So number one, Airbnb Categories and the new products we're doing are great ways to highlight really interesting home and communities you never know existed, right? We have like these incredible barns and farm stays and capsules and treehouses. And many of these are in towns you've probably never even heard of, most of them.  But there's another good question, if you go to Paris, you have the Eiffel Tower. But if you go to a rural area in upstate New York or in California or some other place, what do you do when you're there? And we do think Airbnb Experiences are great. Obviously, for like places that are not iconic tourism destination. So that's why we're continuing to invest in that product and people really love Airbnb Experiences. They actually have a higher 5-star rating even than home.  So I think this is a great opportunity for rural destinations, and we have a lot of really popular experiences. So like if you go on a farm, you can do a farm stay and then you can have interesting experiences on that farm. So that's just one example. We have really popular experiences, for example, in Tuscany. You can make pasta with a nearly 90-year-old grandmother who's been making pasta the same way for more than half a century. So these are experiences you would have never been able to find, and we're really excited about that.\nOperator: The next question is from James Lee with Mizuho.\nJames Lee: And maybe as we look into FY '23, obviously, we have a lot of economic uncertainties here. If the economy indeed slows down and consumers start to trade down, how do you think that impacts Airbnb's business?  And also on the other hand, if you look at expenses, the demand slowdown, is there anything in your cost structure you could optimize to offset any potential headwinds?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take that?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. I think we've highlighted this a bit on the call that you don't know what the economy is going to bring, but we do know that Airbnb is resilient to almost any kind of economic shock. As Brian mentioned, we're founded in a recession, and we've obviously thrived in the era of COVID despite COVID. And what we're just finding is that people can come to Airbnb because we have any kind of property, whether it's a small shared room or a private room to luxury stays, we have something for anyone depending on their travel needs.  And we likely saw on COVID, if they can't cross borders, they're going to stay domestically. They get in the car and they go down the road. If domestic -- if air travel gets too expensive, they -- again, they can stay domestically, and they can basically, within their budget, find the perfect place for them because we have such a diversity of types of offerings for them. So I think that is one of the things that just gives us this great resilience.  And then in terms of expenses, if the business slows down, I mean, again, we've already made the hard choices. In 2020, we substantially reduced our fixed costs. We eliminated a number of positions. We moved from being divisional to functional. So we are a leaner, tighter machine, and we will remain that way. We're going to continue to grow. We're growing headcount maybe high single-digit percentage rates, but that is going to be able to support us for the very long term, and we're going to remain very focused and disciplined in our investments. So I feel really good about the position that we're in with our investment model.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: We wanted to ask about the recovery of supply that you continue to see, maybe particularly in urban areas. Are you seeing hosts who had come off the platform now coming back, wondering how you're making these hosts aware of the increased urban demand and helping to reactivate them? And any color there on that, maybe latent supply capacity, if you could, that'd be awesome.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take this?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. A couple of notes on the supply growth. We just continue to see strong supply growth. I think since 2019, our Nights and Experiences Booked, they grew 24%, and our active listings have grown 23%. And we have over 6 million active listings now even taking down the domestic listings in China. So as you mentioned on the urban side, the active listings -- well, I'll start with the nonurban. Nonurban increased 7% quarter-over-quarter and 16% from Q2 '21.  And then in North America, they've increased 23%. But then to your specific question, yes, as demand returns to cities, we're seeing a return to growth in the total urban supply. And exactly right, the people that have properties, they come back on to Airbnb and are ready to host again. I mean, if you kind of step back and think about it, because the vast majority of our hosts are individual hosts, and then therefore, the vast majority of their listings are either their primary home or maybe a secondary home, they don't get rid of those in a recessionary environment and other things.  I mean it's not like a professional host, which may be looking at the pure return on investment opportunity of the property at a particular point in time. And so with those individual houses, when the demand comes back, they come back on to Airbnb and the listings are there. So it's precisely what we're seeing. When the demand comes back, the supply is right there ready for them to stay.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. I think I'll ask two questions. Just talk about the China outbound market and how you tap into that, how material that's been for you to date? And then on experiences, I know that's in that list of -- a long list of things that you've been working on in terms of product innovations. It seems like it was less -- it's been less of a priority, but is there anything that suggested it's rising a little bit in your list of priorities and that you want to lean into it more aggressively in '23?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Dave, why don't you take China, I can expand on the answer and I'll take Experiences.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean we're very bullish on China over the longer term. I mean it's obviously been significantly impacted due to COVID. People are not traveling outbound. I mean that's actually right how we started the business, is seeing great outbound travel from China all around the world. And then -- and that is still the prize for us to kind of continue to focus on.  So right now, APAC is still significantly depressed. I mean if you look at our overall nights growth, as we said, it's 25% up from Q2 of 2019. But if you exclude APAC, it's actually up 35%. So you can see what kind of a drag that has. And I think the reacceleration -- further acceleration of the business from where we're at today will be benefited by having -- trying to outbound come back and resurrecting our APAC business.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I would just add to that, that we have absolutely seen in every other geography in the world that there is pent-up demand. In North America, there was pent-up demand. In Europe, there was pent-up demand. We expect there will probably be a lot of pent-up demand for travel from China outbound and more broadly in APAC.  And so how we've been preparing? Well, number one way to prepare for the China outbound business is to make sure we have really great supply in the corridors where people in China are traveling to. This includes like Japan and Korea, Southeast Asia and beyond. The next thing is just making sure that once people are ready to travel, our product is continuing to be updated, and we have the marketing campaign ready to go. So it's a pretty simple strategy.  The great thing is we don't have to make a lot of changes. We think our product as it is, is going to be great once the China outbound rebounds, and we think it will. We expect -- everything suggests it will, just like every other market. So we're pretty excited about that. And I think that in the coming years, this will actually be a pretty important part of our APAC business.  Now with regards to experiences, yes, I mean, Mark, let me just give a little bit of context. 2018, 2019 experiences is going along pretty well, and we expected that 2020 was going to be a breakout year for experiences. And I was going to -- we were going to focus quite a lot of energy on it. And then, of course, the opposite happened. There was a pandemic. We had to pause the business, people were not comfortable gathering in person, let alone meeting strangers.  And so during the depths of the pandemic, we got focused back on our core business. We got back to basics. And I think that explains a lot of the business transformation we experienced, especially now we've generated nearly [indiscernible] of free cash flow. That being said, we remain incredibly bullish about the long-term potential of experiences. The average 5-star rating for Experiences, as I mentioned, is higher than the average 5-star ratings even for homes. And we just think people need to know more about this product. It needs to be continually integrated into the search flow, and we need to continue to market it.  So the answer to your question, yes, Experiences will become once again a rising priority, and we are making quite a few investments in the product to continue to highlight experiences. And I think it's going to be a big part of our story in 2023 and beyond over really the next 5 years. So I'm really excited about them.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Colantuoni with Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: So last quarter, you mentioned an expectation for marketing as a percentage of revenue to remain relatively flat compared to 2021. Maybe -- is it possible for you to update us on whether or not that's still your expectation following marketing in the first half coming in a few hundred basis points below last year? And I have a follow-up.\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The short answer is we anticipate marketing as a percentage of revenue in 2022 will be consistent with 2021. So a very modest increase in the back half of the year.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay. Great. And second question on take rate. It looks like outlook for the third quarter implies a take rate that's better than what we were expecting and up a decent chunk versus the same quarter in 2019. Any chance you can give us some detail about the puts and takes driving that take rate?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. The underlying kind of -- if you shifted take rate is unchanged. So any of the variation in take rate is just a timing difference between revenue stays versus timing of bookings.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Brian, I think you yourself signed up to be a digital nomad and joined your employees who could now, I guess, work from anywhere. So is there anything you can share in terms of what you're seeing from the organization overall regarding pickups or declines in productivity or your ability to innovate?  And Dave, at the time of the IPO, I think you guys had disclosed that the different cohorts of guests were displaying pretty similar revenue retention as they age. But as we enter the pandemic, you probably had a pretty good influx of new users who signed up to experience Airbnb for the first time ever. So is there anything you can share in terms of the behavior of the 2020 and the '21 cohorts relative to what you have seen for the folks who are arguably the earlier adopters.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So why don't I take the first question on really remote work. So in April, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. And why do we do this? Well, there are a couple of reasons. Number one, we had the most productive 2 years in our company history. And those 2 years were 2 years when we rebuilt the company from the ground up, fixed our cost base, accelerated growth. And all of this was done on Zoom. And so it's very clear to me that like the most productive we have ever been is on Zoom. And so I thought -- there was no question that we can maintain that productivity.  Additionally, I think a really good way to predict the future is to look at what young companies do, right? 20 years ago, young companies had open floor plans and they had a lot of perks on site, and that became the dominant way that people worked in offices around the world. If you look at a lot of young companies today, they have a lot of flexibility. They're embracing remote work. And so I think this is a really good leading indicator of what the office space -- office place -- office environment of the future will look like in the next 10 years.  Now that being said, we do think in-person interaction is really important, but I don't think that requires you to have to come to an office 3 days a week. So the guideline that we've given is we'd like to gather employees at least 1 week a quarter. So rather than kind of coming in every week, we want more meaningful, less frequent interactions and gatherings. And otherwise, we think Zoom is really, really efficient for productivity.  And the other thing I'll just say is I know a lot of CEOs are kind of nervous about productivity if their employees aren't in an office. But we have a pretty unique way we run the company. We do these 2 releases every year, and it's a really great mechanism for accountability. So you can see the productivity of everyone in the organization because all the work is kind of coming together twice a year to make these really big leaps in the organization. So it's actually, in a sense, kind of easier to track productivity when everything is really online. And so that's something that we're really embracing.\nDavid Stephenson: Great. And then relative to cohorts, what we're starting to see is we believe, to start with, that we have some of the highest guest retention rates in travel. We still -- we said it in our IPO, and we still believe that to be true. And our booking frequency remains quite strong. It's getting closer to 2019 levels. And as we manage -- look at the cohorts, really, what we're seeing in 2020 and 2021, the new guest cohorts, they've been actually very retentive, even maybe more so than kind of historical levels likely due to some self-selection.  New guests who joined in the years of pandemic are willing to kind of travel now are probably more inclined to kind of travel than others. And then in terms of rebooking rates of past guests, we've seen nice improving rates in those trends here in 2022, above kind of 2021 levels, but maybe still a bit below 2019, again, just given the nature of self-selection of who's willing to kind of travel at this time.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Can you give us a sense of what listings growth looks like ex the China shutdown? And then qualitatively, if you could talk about the key drivers and trends you're seeing there and listings.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take that?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Yes. I mean in terms of the growth, what we've stated is that we're still well above 6 million active listings, even excluding the takedown of the China domestic. So -- and as we kind of mentioned in our results, we're seeing strong listings growth, specifically in the areas where we have the strongest kind of bookings. So...\nKevin Kopelman: Did you give the number of China listings?\nDavid Stephenson: We have not specifically mentioned the China listings, no.\nKevin Kopelman: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- so on the Q2 guide, you talked about slowing later in the quarter, but you were still pretty much on your -- where you had guided for nights. Is it safe to assume for the third quarter, you're also assuming some slowdown in the remainder of that quarter?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, if anything, what we're seeing is an acceleration of the business here in July and actually kind of a very stable overall nights booked growth for the quarter on Nights and Experiences Booked. I mean, obviously, then for our revenue, it has a modest -- has a decel on a year-over-year basis, but actually will be up from kind of a year over 3 years.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one, just any update on the number of I'm Flexible queries or sort of how big that's gotten? I know it's a number that you all were disclosing for a couple of quarters. And then secondly, there remains to be an ongoing debate about how much of the shift toward Airbnb long-term accommodations was sort of COVID, and now you're going to have a mean reversion back to our hotels.  What are 2 or 3 of the KPIs that you look at that sort of give you confidence that your addressable market of users, of the hosts, everything has really expanded. Like what are you seeing in the internal KPIs that you watch now in July and August that give you confidence that you're still going to have outsized market share growth into '23.\nBrian Chesky: Dave, you want take this?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean we're continuing to see just really strong growth in our new guests. Obviously, looking at our new guests, our new guest retention, which is one of the questions we just had, which remains quite strong with people coming back on. We're continuing to see just overall utilization of Airbnb versus hotels. We didn't ever dip as much as hotels did, and we introduced Airbnb to millions of new customers. And we see the new use cases.  I mean, we've highlighted things like our long-term stays and the use cases where people aren't going to want to be at a hotel for more than 7 days. And so the portion of our business, nearly 50% that are over 7 days is really helpful in that regard and over 28 days, it's nearly 1/5 of our business. So we look at just the destinations that people are able to kind of travel. So the robustness of historically have been cross-border in urban. And now what we've seen is great growth in suburban and nonurban and some of the distribution of the nights around the world. I think that is also giving us great confidence in the growth of our business overall.  Because we don't just tap out. If we were only, say, a vacation rental destination-type company, you can tap out in either supply and even demand in those kind of areas. But that's really -- we have such a diversity of supply around the world that we're able to continue to grow quite well.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Maybe I'll just -- Brian, maybe I'll add a little bit of context. It's good to remember that before the pandemic, our bread and butter was cross-border and urban, right? That was our bread and butter, it was cross-border travel and urban travel. And of course, when the pandemic occurred, that got primarily shut off, and yet our business recovered because people were using Airbnb differently.  I think that really the key important thing here is that our model is obviously incredibly adaptable. We are in nearly every community in the world. We have nearly every type of space at nearly every type price point. And I think that the reason that people would use Airbnb will continue to endure. People are looking for value. They want to feel like they live at the local. As more and more people have flexibility and trip trick length and continues to increase, nearly half of our business is a week or longer, it's prohibitive probably to stay in hotels. So there's a lot of new use cases that we think are here to stay. So the thing I'm pretty excited about is that a lot of the older use cases, cross-border and urban, are coming back.\nOperator: The next question is from Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: I'm really surprised by the continued strength in North America and in the U.S. I think you talked about a 37% growth in Nights and Experiences versus EMEA, maybe up 25%. Is it just that EMEA continues to lag? Or just from everything that we've been hearing, it seems like EMEA saw like a burst of demand in the second quarter. So just trying to reconcile that.\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean EMEA is still lagging behind the acceleration that we've seen in North America, and we think that, that is actually one of the opportunities for future acceleration of the business. I mean, clearly, things like the impact of the war in Ukraine certainly has had an impact. And there's obviously the economic impact of even just foreign exchange rates, lower euro and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar. So there are some reasons why Europe has been lagging. It's still a strong business for us. It's still doing well, but it could even do better.\nNaved Khan: And then maybe just as a follow-up. So if I have to think about the back half and the advertising channels, do you see opportunity to increase the branded ad spend? Or do you think you're pretty much maxed out and might just stay on these levels?\nDavid Stephenson: Well, again, I think we have a very -- a modest increase in our overall marketing spend in the back half of the year. We're very happy with the approach to our brand spend. I mean, again, if you step back, one of the big strengths of Airbnb is our ability to market to both guests and hosts at the same time, to be able to bring guests with 90% of our traffic remaining direct or unpaid. And I think this brand strategy, frankly, it's more of a product marketing strategy that we have to market the features and capabilities that we have in Airbnb, what makes us different, has been a huge strength for us.  So we're really happy with that investment. We think we're investing fully at the moment there. We will look over time to maybe expand the countries that we're doing more of that investment. So later this year and into early next, you could see us expanding into more countries because we're seeing such good success with our investment right now.\nOperator: The next question is from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Great. Two, if I may. Just one on the nonurban listings, it continues to grow well, and you're adding a lot of supply. Can you sort of touch on where the share gains are coming from, like where those listings are coming from? Is it coming from people not using their second home as much and going back to more urban destination? Or are you taking more share with property managers? Or are you opening up with new destinations?  Then my second question just relates to over and all seasonality this year. It seems like the room nights is following a consistent seasonal trend as 2019. So should we expect a similar 4Q seasonality as 2019?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So maybe -- why don't I -- I can at least answer the first not the urban listings at a high level. And Dave, you can answer maybe more specifically and also talk about seasonality. So Jed, at the highest level, I would say that one of the things that we've seen is that we have a global network where the fastest-growing market from a supply basis are typically the fastest-growing markets from a demand basis. And this is not surprising because the #1 source of host are prior guests.  So specifically in non-urban listings, it's -- it's not a uniquely different composition. It's not like it's a lot more property managers or anything like that. It's pretty consistent composition from years prior. So the vast majority of listings are individuals, but there are also property managers that are continuing to come out on the platform. We're also seeing people continue to open up more nights on their calendar. As demand goes up, people are often motivated to add more availability on their calendar.  And also as people get more business, they tend to tell their friends about it. And this is one of the great things about having a business where the vast majority of your supply are individuals. So we continue to see really strong growth in nonurban listings. But as urban recovers, we are anticipating that we're going to see some solid supply growth in urban areas as well. Dave, feel free to elaborate on that and take the second question as well.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I think you covered the first really well. I mean, I'll just say on the Nights and Experiences Booked kind of seasonality. Now that we kind of enter Q3 and Q4, it's probably just better to look at the year-over-year growth rates as kind of being more normalized. And I think that's the better way to kind of look at the overall seasonal growth.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.\nThomas White: Brian, during the early days of the pandemic, you talked about narrowing your focus on Airbnb's most perishable opportunities. You guys have now achieved profitability at scale. Your cash balance has grown significantly. Can you update us on maybe your latest thinking about those nonperishable opportunities? Are any of them particularly attractive to you? Or should we maybe infer from the buyback announcement that maybe you're not super close to really exploring those opportunities again?\nBrian Chesky: Tom, yes. So again, during the 2020 pandemic curve, just to recap, we got really focused. We got back to basics. And over the last 2 years, I think we've really, really benefited by perfecting our core product. That being said, we are now looking and we are thinking very expansively. So you should look at our stock buyback as our confidence in our long-term growth and profitability. That's all you should believe that stock buyback's about.  That being said, we are going to continue to be investing aggressively over the coming years. So we are not pulling on the brake; we are now stepping on the gas. Remember, like the biggest innovations I had aren't going to be in my 20s and 30s, right? So we have some pretty big opportunities coming up. I'm excited about some of the things we're going to be releasing later this year, but we have another release coming next spring in time for the summer release and the following winter. And again, we're going to continue to focus on unlocking the next generation of host.  So we have some really exciting new products built to attract the next generation of host, especially individuals that want to host occasionally. We are going to continue to think of radical innovations around Airbnb becoming the ultimate host to our guests and host. We're going to continue to innovate on our search technology. And we have a lot of opportunities around helping people travel and live on Airbnb. So there's going to be some pretty exciting opportunities coming forward, and I'm pretty bullish about it. I don't know if, Dave, if there's anything you want to add to that?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I'll just reemphasize, our priority is investing in growth. And $10 billion cash is more than we need, $8 billion is more than sufficient to aggressively invest in growth in the business. And that is our #1 priority. At the same time, we're able to both invest and grow just given the profitability profile of our business overall. So I'm proud that we can do both, but the priority for us is investment growth.\nThomas White: Great. Maybe just one quick follow-up on FX. Over the years, I remember some of the kind of traditional OTAs talking about how maybe it's less about kind of the absolute level of one currency relative to another, but it's maybe more like the volatility of foreign exchange rates that kind of dictate customer booking behavior. Curious whether you'd say that was a similar dynamic in your business? Or just generally how to changes in FX rate, what changes impacts are you seeing kind of in terms of customer behavior?\nDavid Stephenson: I think the biggest impact you see with FX is in the cross-border travel, obviously, right? A strengthening dollar gives you the ability for Americans to travel abroad, specifically right now, probably Europe and to the U.K., and a weakening euro and pound makes it more difficult for them to kind of travel back. But again, if you look at Airbnb, the fact is that people adjust their travel to meet their overall kind of budgets. And as we saw in COVID, people are more willing to -- maybe they stay domestically if their budget doesn't allow the cross-border traveler. Maybe they stay domestically if they don't feel like they can afford the cost of airline travel. So the FX impact from a consumer standpoint is usually this kind of cross-border impact.  And then to our overall business, we're just seeing that as we generate nights stayed in euro and pounds and then we bring them back to the U.S. and into the U.S. dollar, we're just seeing the headwind of foreign exchange, which was -- which is material in Q1, it was 600 basis points of revenue growth driven by the FX move. So I'd anticipate Q3 probably be something less than that to our overall P&L.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand it over to Brian Chesky for any closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So I just want to say I'm incredibly proud of what we've delivered this quarter. Record Nights and Experiences Booked, we had our most profitable Q2, and we generated $795 million of free cash flow, bringing our total free cash flow over the last 12 months to nearly $3 billion. This transformation of our business was only possible because of our adaptable model and a relentless innovation.  And regardless of economic environment, we believe guests will continue to come to Airbnb because they can find great value and hosts can earn extra income. Airbnb is ready for whatever lies ahead, and we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. So thank you all for joining us today, and I'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "Yes. So our Q2 gross nights before the cancellations, they came in actually above our internal expectations. We did see some elevated cancellations in the back of the quarter relative to our forecast. We believe that some of the elevated cancellation's related to flight cancellations around the world, but it was mostly in North America towards the end of Q2 '22. And we're just seeing strong overall nights kind of growth, the 25% year-over-year growth in nights and experiences, we feel very confident in. And the same -- having the same results for Q3, we also feel quite good about. We're just seeing strong demand for guest travel all around the world. Yes. I'll just double click on Brian's comment. Yes, I mean, we do really feel good about stable bookings in Q3. I mean, in particular, given we have long lead times that we're seeing. We're seeing some pull forward for summer travel here in Q2 and just the broader economic conditions overall. We are -- if you look at our gross booking value growth versus 2019, Q1 was 73%; Q2, 73%. We're just seeing strong gross booking value growth relative to 2019. And to see further kind of quarter-over-quarter acceleration, we just need to see continued recovery in Europe and APAC, which remains significantly depressed. Yes. I mean the China business has been a small part of business overall. I mean, it's had less than a 1% impact on our revenue. One of the things that has been important in us getting out of the domestic business in China is maintaining a focus on what we think is the most valuable and important part of China, which is the outbound business. So really, what we've done is we've shifted all of the resources that we're applying and splitting between both domestic and outbound travel. We focused all that on outbound, which we think is the greater prize and the most important part for the long term.  So until China has their COVID policy kind of in place and allowing people to kind of travel outbound from China, it will kind of remain to be depressed. But as that evolves and Chinese travelers travel again, we think that will be a nice unlock for our Asia Pacific business. It's not going to have a material impact on our P&L. Yes. If you kind of rewind to what we've seen with ADRs back at the beginning of the pandemic, all of the increase was driven by mix, right? This initial resurgence of the travel for North America, whole home, nonurban. And then over time, we've seen mix become less and less a part of the increase in the ADR.  Here in both Q1 and Q2, what we've seen is that ADRs were up 40% year over -- 3 years back to 2019. And about 2/3 of that increase has been price appreciation, and about 1/3 due to mix. And so we do anticipate that over time, as more people return to travel to urban, more cross border, ADRs may moderate. But yes, as you see, 2/3 of that has actually been price appreciation. So it's been stickier than we anticipated, maybe 6 months ago. Well, it's a bit of both. I mean, really, we have on the books for Q4 of this year, we have more nights on the books in Q4 than relative to the same kind of period a year ago. It's very strong. We're seeing really strong demand in the back half of the year. So we're seeing a bit of both. Yes. Thanks. We're really proud of the progress we made to reduce our fixed costs and make improvements in our variable costs. We've really exercised discipline on our spending here in 2022, and we're going to continue to do so. But while we're thrilled with this margin expansion, we're heavily in growth mode. We are not in profit maximization mode. We really want to balance profitability with growth.  We -- one of the things we're very proud in Q2 is that we are showing both growth and profitability at scale. But we'll continue to invest in growth. We're going to prioritize things. We'll grow the business over the long haul. Sure. Well, if you start the macro environment, again, we are very pleased with our results despite any kind of macroeconomic. We're seeing strong demand here in Q3. And as I said, the Q2 nights and experiences grew 25% year-over-year, we're seeing a similar growth for Q3, and our demand in Q4 reservations is really strong, as I mentioned kind of earlier.  What we've seen so far is North America and Europe have been our strengths. We're seeing -- but we are seeing an uptick in more cross-border and more urban. So those are historic strength areas for us, and we're starting to see those parts of the businesses come back. But ultimately, if you just kind of step back, you just see the resilience of our business overall, right, that because we have so much different kinds of supply in so many places around the world, we have any kind of place for anyone that wants to travel. And there's just so much pent-up demand for travel and just so much demand for travel in general, that people would like to spend money on the experience of travel and getting out of their home more than on things that we're just continuing to see that great strength in our business.  And then in terms of long-term stays, it continues to be the fastest-growing business by tripling. So if you look at nights of 28 days or longer, that part of the business is growing faster since 2019 than any other segment stays. And actually, if you kind of subsegment it, nearly 50% of our nights are 7 days or longer. And which I think, again, you start to stay any place 7 days or more, an Airbnb is the best way to kind of experience that stay. So long-term stay trend continues to be very solid, growing faster than any other part of the business. Sure. I think we've highlighted this a bit on the call that you don't know what the economy is going to bring, but we do know that Airbnb is resilient to almost any kind of economic shock. As Brian mentioned, we're founded in a recession, and we've obviously thrived in the era of COVID despite COVID. And what we're just finding is that people can come to Airbnb because we have any kind of property, whether it's a small shared room or a private room to luxury stays, we have something for anyone depending on their travel needs.  And we likely saw on COVID, if they can't cross borders, they're going to stay domestically. They get in the car and they go down the road. If domestic -- if air travel gets too expensive, they -- again, they can stay domestically, and they can basically, within their budget, find the perfect place for them because we have such a diversity of types of offerings for them. So I think that is one of the things that just gives us this great resilience.  And then in terms of expenses, if the business slows down, I mean, again, we've already made the hard choices. In 2020, we substantially reduced our fixed costs. We eliminated a number of positions. We moved from being divisional to functional. So we are a leaner, tighter machine, and we will remain that way. We're going to continue to grow. We're growing headcount maybe high single-digit percentage rates, but that is going to be able to support us for the very long term, and we're going to remain very focused and disciplined in our investments. So I feel really good about the position that we're in with our investment model. Yes. A couple of notes on the supply growth. We just continue to see strong supply growth. I think since 2019, our Nights and Experiences Booked, they grew 24%, and our active listings have grown 23%. And we have over 6 million active listings now even taking down the domestic listings in China. So as you mentioned on the urban side, the active listings -- well, I'll start with the nonurban. Nonurban increased 7% quarter-over-quarter and 16% from Q2 '21.  And then in North America, they've increased 23%. But then to your specific question, yes, as demand returns to cities, we're seeing a return to growth in the total urban supply. And exactly right, the people that have properties, they come back on to Airbnb and are ready to host again. I mean, if you kind of step back and think about it, because the vast majority of our hosts are individual hosts, and then therefore, the vast majority of their listings are either their primary home or maybe a secondary home, they don't get rid of those in a recessionary environment and other things.  I mean it's not like a professional host, which may be looking at the pure return on investment opportunity of the property at a particular point in time. And so with those individual houses, when the demand comes back, they come back on to Airbnb and the listings are there. So it's precisely what we're seeing. When the demand comes back, the supply is right there ready for them to stay. Yes. I mean we're very bullish on China over the longer term. I mean it's obviously been significantly impacted due to COVID. People are not traveling outbound. I mean that's actually right how we started the business, is seeing great outbound travel from China all around the world. And then -- and that is still the prize for us to kind of continue to focus on.  So right now, APAC is still significantly depressed. I mean if you look at our overall nights growth, as we said, it's 25% up from Q2 of 2019. But if you exclude APAC, it's actually up 35%. So you can see what kind of a drag that has. And I think the reacceleration -- further acceleration of the business from where we're at today will be benefited by having -- trying to outbound come back and resurrecting our APAC business. Yes. The short answer is we anticipate marketing as a percentage of revenue in 2022 will be consistent with 2021. So a very modest increase in the back half of the year. Yes. The underlying kind of -- if you shifted take rate is unchanged. So any of the variation in take rate is just a timing difference between revenue stays versus timing of bookings. Great. And then relative to cohorts, what we're starting to see is we believe, to start with, that we have some of the highest guest retention rates in travel. We still -- we said it in our IPO, and we still believe that to be true. And our booking frequency remains quite strong. It's getting closer to 2019 levels. And as we manage -- look at the cohorts, really, what we're seeing in 2020 and 2021, the new guest cohorts, they've been actually very retentive, even maybe more so than kind of historical levels likely due to some self-selection.  New guests who joined in the years of pandemic are willing to kind of travel now are probably more inclined to kind of travel than others. And then in terms of rebooking rates of past guests, we've seen nice improving rates in those trends here in 2022, above kind of 2021 levels, but maybe still a bit below 2019, again, just given the nature of self-selection of who's willing to kind of travel at this time. Yes. Yes. I mean in terms of the growth, what we've stated is that we're still well above 6 million active listings, even excluding the takedown of the China domestic. So -- and as we kind of mentioned in our results, we're seeing strong listings growth, specifically in the areas where we have the strongest kind of bookings. So... We have not specifically mentioned the China listings, no. Well, if anything, what we're seeing is an acceleration of the business here in July and actually kind of a very stable overall nights booked growth for the quarter on Nights and Experiences Booked. I mean, obviously, then for our revenue, it has a modest -- has a decel on a year-over-year basis, but actually will be up from kind of a year over 3 years. Yes. I mean we're continuing to see just really strong growth in our new guests. Obviously, looking at our new guests, our new guest retention, which is one of the questions we just had, which remains quite strong with people coming back on. We're continuing to see just overall utilization of Airbnb versus hotels. We didn't ever dip as much as hotels did, and we introduced Airbnb to millions of new customers. And we see the new use cases.  I mean, we've highlighted things like our long-term stays and the use cases where people aren't going to want to be at a hotel for more than 7 days. And so the portion of our business, nearly 50% that are over 7 days is really helpful in that regard and over 28 days, it's nearly 1/5 of our business. So we look at just the destinations that people are able to kind of travel. So the robustness of historically have been cross-border in urban. And now what we've seen is great growth in suburban and nonurban and some of the distribution of the nights around the world. I think that is also giving us great confidence in the growth of our business overall.  Because we don't just tap out. If we were only, say, a vacation rental destination-type company, you can tap out in either supply and even demand in those kind of areas. But that's really -- we have such a diversity of supply around the world that we're able to continue to grow quite well. Yes. I mean EMEA is still lagging behind the acceleration that we've seen in North America, and we think that, that is actually one of the opportunities for future acceleration of the business. I mean, clearly, things like the impact of the war in Ukraine certainly has had an impact. And there's obviously the economic impact of even just foreign exchange rates, lower euro and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar. So there are some reasons why Europe has been lagging. It's still a strong business for us. It's still doing well, but it could even do better. Well, again, I think we have a very -- a modest increase in our overall marketing spend in the back half of the year. We're very happy with the approach to our brand spend. I mean, again, if you step back, one of the big strengths of Airbnb is our ability to market to both guests and hosts at the same time, to be able to bring guests with 90% of our traffic remaining direct or unpaid. And I think this brand strategy, frankly, it's more of a product marketing strategy that we have to market the features and capabilities that we have in Airbnb, what makes us different, has been a huge strength for us.  So we're really happy with that investment. We think we're investing fully at the moment there. We will look over time to maybe expand the countries that we're doing more of that investment. So later this year and into early next, you could see us expanding into more countries because we're seeing such good success with our investment right now. Yes, I think you covered the first really well. I mean, I'll just say on the Nights and Experiences Booked kind of seasonality. Now that we kind of enter Q3 and Q4, it's probably just better to look at the year-over-year growth rates as kind of being more normalized. And I think that's the better way to kind of look at the overall seasonal growth. Yes. I'll just reemphasize, our priority is investing in growth. And $10 billion cash is more than we need, $8 billion is more than sufficient to aggressively invest in growth in the business. And that is our #1 priority. At the same time, we're able to both invest and grow just given the profitability profile of our business overall. So I'm proud that we can do both, but the priority for us is investment growth. I think the biggest impact you see with FX is in the cross-border travel, obviously, right?

And then to our overall business, we're just seeing that as we generate nights stayed in euro and pounds and then we bring them back to the U.S. and into the U.S. dollar, we're just seeing the headwind of foreign exchange, which was -- which is material in Q1, it was 600 basis points of revenue growth driven by the FX move. So I'd anticipate Q3 probably be something less than that to our overall P&L."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining.  Our Q2 results demonstrate that Airbnb has achieved growth and profitability at scale. From a growth perspective, we exceeded 103 million Nights and Experiences Booked. Now this was our largest quarterly number ever. Revenue was $2.1 billion, up 58% from last year or 64%, excluding foreign exchange. Gross booking value was $17 billion, up 27% from last year or 34% if you exclude foreign exchange. Now both revenue and GBV were 73% higher than Q2 2019, significantly outperforming the travel industry.  Now from a profitability perspective, we had our most profitable Q2 ever. Net income of $379 million was a nearly $700 million improvement from Q2 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $711 million. Now this represents a 34% adjusted EBITDA margin, which is significantly up from the 16% margin in Q2 2021, a negative 4% in Q2 2019. Finally, we generated $795 million of free cash flow. Now this is a $1.1 billion improvement from the nearly $300 million cash burn 2 years ago at the depth of the pandemic. Over the last 12 months, Airbnb generated $3 billion in free cash flow, nearly $3 billion, and ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash.  So what explains this transformation in our business? Well, first, our business model is adaptable. We have nearly every type of space in nearly every location so however travel changes, we can adapt. And regardless of the economic environment, our guests come to Airbnb because they can find great value and our host can earn extra income.  Second, we've relentlessly innovated while also staying focused and disciplined. When the pandemic began in 2020, we made some incredibly difficult decisions. We significantly reduced spending, making us a leaner and more focused company. And we've kept this discipline ever since, allowing us to keep the hiring and investment plans made in the beginning of the year. And Airbnb is well positioned for whatever lies ahead. In fact, we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. And this is coming only 1.5 years after our IPO.  Now returning to our Q2 results. Our strong financial performance was driven by a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand in Airbnb is as high as ever. In Q2, we surpassed 103 million Nights and Experiences Booked, marking our highest quarterly number ever. Now despite broader macroeconomic concerns, we still saw a 25% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked compared to the quarter of 2021.  Now early in Q2, strong guest demand exceeded our expectations. This is because guests in Europe and North America booked earlier than they have historically. Now given this earlier booking, growth rates compared to last year decelerated in May and June. And since the end of Q2, what we've seen is growth in nights booked reaccelerate from June to July as we enter peak travel season.  Second, guests continue to return to cities and cross borders. In previous quarters, we've talked about how we saw significant growth driven by surges in domestic travel as well as travel to rural destinations. Now these trends continue. But we're also seeing guests returning to cities and crossing borders above pre-pandemic levels.  Third, guests continue to stay longer in Airbnb. They're not just traveling Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. We saw long-term stays of 28 days or more remain our fastest-growing category by trip nights compared to 2019. The long-term stays has increased nearly 25% from a year ago. And actually, long-term stays have increased almost 90% since Q2 2019.  Fourth, guest demand is driving growth on our host community. We continue to see the strongest supply increases in areas of greatest demand, with nonurban active listings up 50% compared to Q2 2019. But as demand is returning to cities, we're also seeing an increase in total urban supply. And we believe the upgrades we introduced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and AirCover are supporting this growth, but we're not stopping there. So you're going to see some exciting new product features to recruit the next generation of host later this year.  Finally, I'd like to share a few highlights from the 2022 summer release. In May, we introduced Airbnb Categories. Since launch, listings in the Airbnb Categories have been viewed more than 180 million times. Through Categories, we are distributing guest discovery across more destinations and dates.  Now we also introduced AirCover for guests. Since launch, the Net Promoter Score for guests that had an issue with their stay has already improved. And the real insulin -- instance where our host cancels, AirCover has led to 10% more rebookings.  So to recap. We achieved significant milestones this quarter with our results. Nights and Experiences Booked were our highest ever. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were records for Q2, and free cash flow was $795 million. In the last 12 months, we generated nearly $3 billion in free cash flow.  Now before I go to questions, I want to talk about an update on my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. Last month, Joe announced that he'll be stepping back from this full-time operating role. Joe will continue to serve on the Board of Directors of both Airbnb and Airbnb.org. Airbnb is a founder-led company. So he's going to continue to take a role at Airbnb, and this will be as an adviser to me on future concepts and creative culture.  Since the beginning, Joe has always been focused on big ideas to help others. These are uncompromising True North. So it will be fun to be able to spend more time with them on dreaming up new ideas, just like the early days. And as I reflect back on the last 14 years together, I just can't believe how lucky Joe, Nate and I have been. If anything, I've just gone a few degrees in a different direction, I wouldn't be doing this call with you right now. That's how fragile ideas are. And it's what gives me gratitude to know Joe and Nate. And what I'm most thankful for is that we're still together, still meeting every Sunday 14 years after we started. We built a dream together, and now, after all these years, we still continue to dream. So thank you, Joe.  And with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions. Thank you very much. Dave, why don't you take the first question about Q2, Q3 growth, and I can talk a little bit about how the launch from Airbnb Categories have affected how people use Airbnb? And just to answer the second question, just to give a little bit of background, for decades, travel search has worked the same way. There's a box, a search box, and you are asked to enter a location. And the problem with that is that Airbnb is in 100,000 locations all over the world. And so people can't think to type in 100,000 destinations into a search box. And so people miss millions of unique Airbnbs they would have never known to search for. And the reason this is important, as you asked is because we think that category categories can allow us to point demand to where we have supply. This, I think, is one of the really big opportunities.  So as I said, since release, listings in every categories have been viewed over 180 million times. We've also seen that guests are now showing more flexibility with their dates and their destinations than before. So for example, a typical search, properties are 30 miles further apart than they would have been before. So we are seeing search radiuses increase. And additionally, we are seeing more people continue to use the flexible date feature. So we believe our theory is working. Airbnb categories allows us to highlight what makes us unique. It allows us to point demand where we have supply. And I also think it helps us be in the inspiration business where people to start to travel on Airbnb. No. I mean we have a very consistent strategy. And our strategy is, number one, we want to unlock the next generation of hosts. We have 4 million hosts on Airbnb, and I think that millions more can turn to hosting, especially during these economic times. So that, I think, is really priority #1.  As we add more hosts, we continue to grow. We want Airbnb to be the ultimate host to our guests and host. That's why we offered AirCover where we continue to provide better service all over the world and continue to up level. And guests aren't just traveling Airbnb, they're now living on Airbnb. And so we want to continue to offer more opportunities for them to travel and live on Airbnb.  So we are still focused on our core business. That is the priority for us. We are also continuing to invest in long-term stays and other initiatives and most importantly, providing an incredible service that people love. And I would also just say, again, we're feeling really, really solid and good about Q3. Dave, anything you want to add. Dave? Dave? And just to confirm, you're talking about with this upcoming release, right, this winter? Yes. So that's a great question. Let me -- why don't I answer the first question, and then, Dave, you can talk about margin improvement, and then I can potentially elaborate on that answer as well. We have -- as we said, we have 4 million hosts on Airbnb, but we think there are millions more people that could turn to hosting. I mean, honestly, hosting is one of the easiest ways to be able to make money with an asset that you already have. For most people, they don't need to have a start-up cost and the majority of people get a booking within the first week.  And so there are a number of things that we're going to be doing this fall -- this winter and beyond, but one of the most important things we want to do is continue to make it easier to host. And one of the high -- things I want to highlight that we launched last year was Ask a Super Host. Ask A Super Host pairs our very best super hosts with prospective hosts. And this is really cool because, basically, what it does is it allows our community to help train new community members, new hosts to come on the platform. That's made a big difference.  And we're going to continue to double down on that product. We're going to -- but we're looking at some other opportunities to continue to reduce friction. So you're going to see some really cool products to just continue to make it even easier to host. And so that's probably the primary thing that we're going to be focused on this fall. We're also looking at some additional protections for hosts, and just ways to really try to get everyday people with their primary homes that want to host occasionally to host on Airbnb.  A lot of people don't realize that the number -- the top professions for a host in the United States, for example, are school teachers, they're health care workers, they're students, these are top 3 kind of professions and locations in Airbnb. And so what we really think the big opportunity is to continue to attract regular people to become host. And we think one of the biggest sources of new hosts are prior guests on Airbnb, 36% of new hosts last quarter were prior guests.  So this is where we're going to be focused on. It's a really big opportunity for us. And I think, again, Airbnb was founded during a recession in 2008, financial crisis. People were worried about being able to pay their bills, pay for their homes and their income. And so they turned to hosting. And we think a lot of people may turn to hosting once again. So this is a big opportunity for us. Dave, if you want to talk about the margin improvement? Dave? Yes, yes. So Nick, I'm Flexible, essentially with the product that we launched last year, it really has 2 components. There's flexible dates that allows people to say, I'm flexible when to travel, and we can say, I'm really interested in traveling anywhere for a week and a week or a month anytime in the next year. And we also had I'm Flexible destinations.  We rebuilt I'm Flexible destination from the ground up, and that became Airbnb Categories. So that's the product that has been used or people have seen listings that have been featured in the Airbnb categories over 180 million times since May 11. This has definitely been like a huge boon for us. And what we're seeing is that people are, in fact, discovering homes they would have never otherwise seen in their books. We're seeing the search radius widen by, I think, it was 30 miles, what I said before.  The other thing we're seeing is that people are continuing to be more flexible about their dates. So more and more people are using the I'm Flexible dates feature as well.  And so we're really excited about this. I think this is a really big thing that we're going to be focusing on, and we're going to continue to be investing in this product because I think this is a bit of a paradigm shift for how people will travel. Not everyone is going to be flexible about how they travel. But for anyone that's not traveling for business or not visiting family, if you were doing leisure travel, almost by definition, you probably have some flexibility.  And as fewer and fewer people are going to be required to go into office 5 days a week, I think this option is going to be more and more important. And our business model works uniquely for this because we have a lot of unique inventory. So it has been used quite a lot, and hopefully, that answers your question. Sorry, can you elaborate outside of urban areas. Or I'm trying... Oh, I see. Yes. Well, it's a great question. So number one, Airbnb Categories and the new products we're doing are great ways to highlight really interesting home and communities you never know existed, right? We have like these incredible barns and farm stays and capsules and treehouses. And many of these are in towns you've probably never even heard of, most of them.  But there's another good question, if you go to Paris, you have the Eiffel Tower. But if you go to a rural area in upstate New York or in California or some other place, what do you do when you're there? And we do think Airbnb Experiences are great. Obviously, for like places that are not iconic tourism destination. So that's why we're continuing to invest in that product and people really love Airbnb Experiences. They actually have a higher 5-star rating even than home.  So I think this is a great opportunity for rural destinations, and we have a lot of really popular experiences. So like if you go on a farm, you can do a farm stay and then you can have interesting experiences on that farm. So that's just one example. We have really popular experiences, for example, in Tuscany. You can make pasta with a nearly 90-year-old grandmother who's been making pasta the same way for more than half a century. So these are experiences you would have never been able to find, and we're really excited about that. Dave, do you want to take that? Dave, do you want to take this? Yes. Dave, why don't you take China, I can expand on the answer and I'll take Experiences. Yes. I would just add to that, that we have absolutely seen in every other geography in the world that there is pent-up demand. In North America, there was pent-up demand. In Europe, there was pent-up demand. We expect there will probably be a lot of pent-up demand for travel from China outbound and more broadly in APAC.  And so how we've been preparing? Well, number one way to prepare for the China outbound business is to make sure we have really great supply in the corridors where people in China are traveling to. This includes like Japan and Korea, Southeast Asia and beyond. The next thing is just making sure that once people are ready to travel, our product is continuing to be updated, and we have the marketing campaign ready to go. So it's a pretty simple strategy.  The great thing is we don't have to make a lot of changes. We think our product as it is, is going to be great once the China outbound rebounds, and we think it will. We expect -- everything suggests it will, just like every other market. So we're pretty excited about that. And I think that in the coming years, this will actually be a pretty important part of our APAC business.  Now with regards to experiences, yes, I mean, Mark, let me just give a little bit of context. 2018, 2019 experiences is going along pretty well, and we expected that 2020 was going to be a breakout year for experiences. And I was going to -- we were going to focus quite a lot of energy on it. And then, of course, the opposite happened. There was a pandemic. We had to pause the business, people were not comfortable gathering in person, let alone meeting strangers.  And so during the depths of the pandemic, we got focused back on our core business. We got back to basics. And I think that explains a lot of the business transformation we experienced, especially now we've generated nearly [indiscernible] of free cash flow. That being said, we remain incredibly bullish about the long-term potential of experiences. The average 5-star rating for Experiences, as I mentioned, is higher than the average 5-star ratings even for homes. And we just think people need to know more about this product. It needs to be continually integrated into the search flow, and we need to continue to market it.  So the answer to your question, yes, Experiences will become once again a rising priority, and we are making quite a few investments in the product to continue to highlight experiences. And I think it's going to be a big part of our story in 2023 and beyond over really the next 5 years. So I'm really excited about them. Dave? Yes. So why don't I take the first question on really remote work. So in April, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. And why do we do this? Well, there are a couple of reasons. Number one, we had the most productive 2 years in our company history. And those 2 years were 2 years when we rebuilt the company from the ground up, fixed our cost base, accelerated growth. And all of this was done on Zoom. And so it's very clear to me that like the most productive we have ever been is on Zoom. And so I thought -- there was no question that we can maintain that productivity.  Additionally, I think a really good way to predict the future is to look at what young companies do, right? 20 years ago, young companies had open floor plans and they had a lot of perks on site, and that became the dominant way that people worked in offices around the world. If you look at a lot of young companies today, they have a lot of flexibility. They're embracing remote work. And so I think this is a really good leading indicator of what the office space -- office place -- office environment of the future will look like in the next 10 years.  Now that being said, we do think in-person interaction is really important, but I don't think that requires you to have to come to an office 3 days a week. So the guideline that we've given is we'd like to gather employees at least 1 week a quarter. So rather than kind of coming in every week, we want more meaningful, less frequent interactions and gatherings. And otherwise, we think Zoom is really, really efficient for productivity.  And the other thing I'll just say is I know a lot of CEOs are kind of nervous about productivity if their employees aren't in an office. But we have a pretty unique way we run the company. We do these 2 releases every year, and it's a really great mechanism for accountability. So you can see the productivity of everyone in the organization because all the work is kind of coming together twice a year to make these really big leaps in the organization. So it's actually, in a sense, kind of easier to track productivity when everything is really online. And so that's something that we're really embracing. Dave, do you want to take that? Dave, you want take this? Yes. Maybe I'll just -- Brian, maybe I'll add a little bit of context. It's good to remember that before the pandemic, our bread and butter was cross-border and urban, right? That was our bread and butter, it was cross-border travel and urban travel. And of course, when the pandemic occurred, that got primarily shut off, and yet our business recovered because people were using Airbnb differently.  I think that really the key important thing here is that our model is obviously incredibly adaptable. We are in nearly every community in the world. We have nearly every type of space at nearly every type price point. And I think that the reason that people would use Airbnb will continue to endure. People are looking for value. They want to feel like they live at the local. As more and more people have flexibility and trip trick length and continues to increase, nearly half of our business is a week or longer, it's prohibitive probably to stay in hotels. So there's a lot of new use cases that we think are here to stay. So the thing I'm pretty excited about is that a lot of the older use cases, cross-border and urban, are coming back. Dave? Yes. So maybe -- why don't I -- I can at least answer the first not the urban listings at a high level. And Dave, you can answer maybe more specifically and also talk about seasonality. So Jed, at the highest level, I would say that one of the things that we've seen is that we have a global network where the fastest-growing market from a supply basis are typically the fastest-growing markets from a demand basis. And this is not surprising because the #1 source of host are prior guests.  So specifically in non-urban listings, it's -- it's not a uniquely different composition. It's not like it's a lot more property managers or anything like that. It's pretty consistent composition from years prior. So the vast majority of listings are individuals, but there are also property managers that are continuing to come out on the platform. We're also seeing people continue to open up more nights on their calendar. As demand goes up, people are often motivated to add more availability on their calendar.  And also as people get more business, they tend to tell their friends about it. And this is one of the great things about having a business where the vast majority of your supply are individuals. So we continue to see really strong growth in nonurban listings. But as urban recovers, we are anticipating that we're going to see some solid supply growth in urban areas as well. Dave, feel free to elaborate on that and take the second question as well. Tom, yes. So again, during the 2020 pandemic curve, just to recap, we got really focused. We got back to basics. And over the last 2 years, I think we've really, really benefited by perfecting our core product. That being said, we are now looking and we are thinking very expansively. So you should look at our stock buyback as our confidence in our long-term growth and profitability. That's all you should believe that stock buyback's about.  That being said, we are going to continue to be investing aggressively over the coming years. So we are not pulling on the brake; we are now stepping on the gas. Remember, like the biggest innovations I had aren't going to be in my 20s and 30s, right? So we have some pretty big opportunities coming up. I'm excited about some of the things we're going to be releasing later this year, but we have another release coming next spring in time for the summer release and the following winter. And again, we're going to continue to focus on unlocking the next generation of host.  So we have some really exciting new products built to attract the next generation of host, especially individuals that want to host occasionally. We are going to continue to think of radical innovations around Airbnb becoming the ultimate host to our guests and host. We're going to continue to innovate on our search technology. And we have a lot of opportunities around helping people travel and live on Airbnb. So there's going to be some pretty exciting opportunities coming forward, and I'm pretty bullish about it. I don't know if, Dave, if there's anything you want to add to that? All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So I just want to say I'm incredibly proud of what we've delivered this quarter. Record Nights and Experiences Booked, we had our most profitable Q2, and we generated $795 million of free cash flow, bringing our total free cash flow over the last 12 months to nearly $3 billion. This transformation of our business was only possible because of our adaptable model and a relentless innovation.  And regardless of economic environment, we believe guests will continue to come to Airbnb because they can find great value and hosts can earn extra income. Airbnb is ready for whatever lies ahead, and we're so confident in our long-term growth and profitability that today, we're announcing a $2 billion share repurchase program. So thank you all for joining us today, and I'll see you next quarter."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I'll now hand over to Ellie Mertz, VP of finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's first quarter of 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of 2022. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We've provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And with that, I'll pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right, thank you very much, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share our Q1 results with you. Now, despite the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and macroeconomic headwinds, Q1 was another incredible quarter. We exceeded 100 million Nights and Experiences Booked for the first time ever. GBV was $17 billion, which was 73% above Q1 2019. Revenue was $1.5 billion, exceeding Q1, 2019 by 80%. Net loss was $19 million. Now this is a significant improvement in the same periods from 2018 and 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $229 million. Now, this is our first positive adjusted EBITDA Q1, and this represented adjusted EBITDA margin of a positive 15%. Now this is compared to a negative 7% a year ago, and a negative 30% in Q1 2019. And finally, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. This was also an all-time high. And what these results show is that two years into the pandemic, Airbnb is stronger than ever before. Now, why is this? Well, millions of people are now more flexible about where they live and they work. And as a result, they're spreading out to thousands of towns and cities. And they're staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time. That's through our adaptability innovation, we've been able to quickly respond to this changing world of travel. And these incredible results were driven by a number of positive business trends. First, guests are booking more than ever before. In Q1 gross nights booked grew 32% compared to Q1 2019. And this is despite the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and macroeconomic headwinds. People are also more confident booking travel further in advance. And we're seeing strong demand for summer bookings and beyond. Second, guests are returning to cities and they\u2019re crossing borders. So our guests continue to travel domestically and continue to go to rural destinations at Airbnb. We are also seeing guests return to cities and cross borders at or even above pre-pandemic rates. Third, guest are also staying longer, even living on Airbnb. Now, while short-term stays rebounded strongly in Q1 2022, stays of a month or longer continue to be our fastest-growing category by tripling compared to 2019. In nearly half of our nights booked in Q1 were for stays of week or longer in one in five nights booked were for stays of a month or longer. So the world is clearly becoming more flexible about where people can work. And getting ahead of this trend, last week, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. And we've designed a way for them to live and work around the world, while collaborating in a highly collaborative way and experiencing the in-person connection that makes Airbnb special. Now fourth, our innovations are inspiring guests to discover thousands of new places. In 2021, we delivered more than 150 upgrades across every aspect of our service. And among these upgrades was the innovative I\u2019m Flexible feature. Now I\u2019m Flexible feature has now been used more than 2 billion times, 2 billion. And guests who use I\u2019m flexible are more likely to book home in less popular locations. This is really important, because this allows us to point demand to where we have supply, and it helps distribute guests more widely in communities all around the world. But we're not stopping there. On May 11, next Wednesday, we will be announcing the Airbnb 2022 summer release. This is a new Airbnb for a new world of travel. With a completely new way to search, guests will be able to discover millions of unique homes in Airbnb they never thought to search for. And when they book, guests will have the confidence knowing that Airbnb has their back each step of the way. And so you can watch this announcement right on our homepage next Wednesday at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, next Wednesday, right on our homepage. I hope you can tune in because I'm really excited about what we have to share. And then finally, our community - our host community continues to expand. We see destinations the strongest demand showing this most supply growth with non-urban active listings actually growing 15% globally. And we're also showing an increase in total urban supply as demand returns to cities. And we believe that the upgrades we announced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and AirCover, are supporting this growth and enabling success for a new host. So to recap, we had our best Q1 ever. Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV were a highest ever. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were records for Q1 and we generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. With these results, Airbnb is stronger than ever before. Now, before I go to question, I just want to talk for a minute about our efforts in Ukraine. Because over the past few months, millions of lives have been devastated by the war. And when the crisis broke out, we knew that our platform can help refugees fleeing the crisis. And within four days of the invasion, Ukraine, we announced that airbnb.org would provide free housing for up to 100,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine, and over 30,000 hosts have already signed up to open their homes to refugees for free or for a discount. But then, something even more remarkable happened. People started booking homes for hosts in Ukraine. Hosts, they never intend to stay with just to provide relief aid. And soon, more than 170,000 people joined in, and they booked approximately 600,000 nights booked in Ukraine. And because we waived our fees, $20 million went directly to host in Ukraine. And I think this speaks to the power of our community. And they are a reminder that in the world of darkness and a world of destruction, kindness still exist. And so I'm really proud of our business results this quarter. I'm also proud of how helpful we've been able to be to thousands of people in need. And with all that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks. Good afternoon, and congrats on the strong quarter. A couple of questions for me. I guess first off, Brian, drilling down a bit on some of the broader use cases that emerged through the pandemic. At a high level, the trends clearly sound very good. I'm hoping you could unpack that a little bit more in terms of the sustainability of longer stays and other use cases in markets that are furthest along in the recovery, where offices are reopening and lives are sort of getting back to normal, if you could able to break that down a bit more. And then secondly, on the plans for advertising and marketing, you're keeping that looks like fixed as a percentage of revenues, so a little bit higher spend on marketing and advertising. Can you talk about that? Is that with all the product updates, the rebound in travel, maybe the competitive landscape? If you could talk about the strategy with respect to the advertising and marketing? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, excellent. Thanks, Colin. So why don't I answer these at a high level? And Dave, feel free to jump in with some more specifics. So let's start with the question of Colin, some of the broader use cases you talked about. And let's back up. So when we started Airbnb, it was really just a way for people to book a home for just a few days at a time. But even before the pandemic, actually long-term stays, stays of a month or longer were our fastest-growing category or segment of trip by trip length, some of those are already growing very quickly before the pandemic. And I think what the pandemic did, is I think it accelerated the adoption of longer-term stays in Airbnb by hard to say how many, but certainly by years, and I think it's important to understand why this is happening. Right now, what's happened is that for millions of people, they don't need to go back to an office five days a week. And the vast majority of companies are not requiring employees to come back to an office, many have moved to a hybrid or entirely remote model. And I think that what we're going to see going forward, is you're going to see more and more flexibility. Because I think companies ultimately want to attract the very best people, and the best people are going to be everywhere. And so long as we believe that people don't need to go back to an office five days a week, millions of people, then we believe in a world of more flexibility. So long as we believe in a world where people will continue to dial in and zoom, we will again believe in a world of more flexibility. And so what we are going to continue to see we think, over the coming years is continued and sustained growth for stays of longer than a month and stays of longer than a week. I don't think this is a temporary phenomenon. I think that the genie is out of the bottle and flexibility is here to stay. And I think flexibility after compensation will probably be the most important benefit that an employer can offer. And just to give you a small anecdote. Last week, last Thursday, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere in the world. The response internally was great, but even more impressive was the response externally. Because a, our career page was visited 800,000 times after that announcement. And so I think that just speaks to the durability of this use case. And I think that it's going to continue. Now with regards to advertising, I think it's just important that I share a little bit of a recap of how we think about marketing and Dave, feel free to talk a little more detail. So we have, Colin, a little bit obviously different approach to marketing and advertising than our peers. We take a full funnel approach to marketing that combines PR, brand marketing and performance marketing. We're not really focused on buying customers. We're focused primarily in investing in our brand and educating the world about what makes Airbnb unique. So we think of marketing primarily as education. And I think this explains why 90% of our traffic or more is direct or unpaid. Airbnb is a noun and verb used all over the world, and it was really not advertising, but PR and word-of-mouth that built our brand. And just to give you an example, and - since the pandemic started, there have been more than 1 million articles written about Airbnb, 55% of articles that used to have the word travel in it, also have the word Airbnb in it. So it's pretty, so advertising is really a form of supplemental education for us. It's not the core driver of growth. We think the core driver of growth, Airbnb, is innovation. It's about building a product that people love. And the role of marketing isn't to buy customers. The role of marketing for us is to educate people about our new features and our new offerings. Dave, do you want to - I don\u2019t know if you want to go into a little more detail about advertising?\nDave Stephenson: Brian, I think you've covered it incredibly well. I mean, we're very proud of the approach to marketing this, the full funnel approach is working probably well for us. And as you said, we are actually increasing our marketing dollars. We're just keeping the marketing expenses as a percent of revenue relatively consistent to the level we had in 2021, and we think it's being really effective for us.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I guess first just want to get any insights on how supply and demand are growing relative to each other versus what was happening before the pandemic. So maybe even just utilization, how it's trending, how it was trending before the pandemic and how it's trending now. And then secondly, on capital allocation with over a $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, $9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Can you remind us and just your thoughts on if there's any sort of capital allocation, whether it's returning to shareholders, M&A, and continuing to invest in the product? We'd love to hear your thoughts there.\nBrian Chesky: Great, Bernie. So why don't I do this? Let me just talk at a high level about the first question. And then Dave, why don't you take both questions at a more specific level. So let me just say at a high level around supply and demand, number one, I think we're going to have plenty of supply this summer for the demand. We're expecting a lot of demand for the summer. But we are not supply constrained any night of the year, not even close to the global level. The challenge of most travel companies is that a lot of people try to go to the same place, the same city on the same day. And cities, essentially, like travel OTAs typically get sold out. So like a lot of people try to go to New York City on New Year's Eve, and there's only so many places to stay in New York, and so you're going to get sold out. Now, here is Airbnb. We're in 100,000, towns and cities all over the world. And we see a couple phenomenon, I think it's important to point out. The first thing we see is the fastest-growing supply markets are actually our fastest-growing demand markets. So as a market experiences more demand, more supply gets unlocked. And I think the reason why is primarily because the vast majority of host of Airbnb are individuals. The vast majority of new host get a booking within three days. And when a regular person gets a booking, and the booking might be $300, $400 or $500, they tend to tell their friends about it. And so as more people get booked, they create more word-of-mouth, and this unlocks more supply. So we have a global network, where demand in a sense, stimulates more supply. Additionally, the I'm Flexible feature is critical, because it allows us to point demand to where we have supply. So if somebody types in Paris on June 4 to 5, we are limited to the properties in Paris on those dates. But if somebody says, we\u2019re flexible, we can point them to other dates in Paris that are a little lower season, or other towns around Paris to have available supply. So I think these are really important. But Dave, I don't know if you want to go into a little more specifics about either utilization and also kind of the capital allocation theory.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, just double click on a couple areas. I mean, one is we just have more supply than we've ever had in our history. And as Brian kind of mentioned on the call, the fact that we grow more supply in the areas that we have the greatest demand, like non-urban active listings grew 21% in North America, and 15% globally, it's the area where it's kind of self-healing, where we have the demand is where we end up having this supply. And this redistribution is also incredibly important. Because we have listings in all types of markets. We're not globally constrained at any given night, which is different than if you only had supply in one type of market. And then when demand spikes in that particular more narrow market type, like vacation rentals, you don't have anywhere else to distribute demand. But because we're all around the world, in every kind of community, we end up with the benefit of being able to redistribute demand to other places. So I think that's been incredibly strong for us. Regarding the capital allocation, yes, we have $9.3 billion that take as a CFO and the continued pandemic, having a strong balance sheet continues to allow us to sleep well at night. We have noted previously that we're going to use about $1 billion of our cash to pay for employee tax obligations as they exercise their shares. And so that will be a use of cash this year. And beyond that we're continue to be in growth mode, we will continue to have a balance sheet that enables us to be ready to invest when and where we find that it's appropriate. It does enable us to do M&A in the future, if desired. Although M&A is not our primary driver of growth, we still plan to grow organically as our primary means. But we'll continue to evaluate our balance sheet use and make sure that we are deploying capital appropriately.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one for Brian, high level strategy question. So now that the total room nights has fully recovered versus 2019. How do you decide when is the right time to deaden the company's focus to other potential growth areas such as experiences, hotels and flights versus continuing to hone in on the core product?\nBrian Chesky: Great. Yes, so let me take that. So thanks, Mario. So basically, we learned some really important lessons during the pandemic. I started this company with my two friends when I was 26. I just turned 26 to start this company, and we had this enormous amount of success. And one of the things that happens when you're a first time entrepreneur, an enormous amount of success as you do something well, and you think you can kind of do everything well. And we pursue it a lot of things before the pandemic. And I remember growing up, my teacher said, you can do everything you want your life not at the same time, though. And I think that when the pandemic happened, there was a silver lining to our, to the crisis for us, which is we got really focused, we took all of our best people, we pause a lot of new initiatives. And we put our very best people on the most important problems, the company, which was stimulating core business. But I think what we saw is not only did that happen, but the total addressable market for short term stays is bigger than we ever imagined. And we are also able to extend it to long term stays. Our general approach now, going forward, is to be incredibly focused, we're going to absolutely be pursuing new opportunities. But we want to focus on the most perishable opportunities right now. And right now, the most perishable opportunity is this. Last year, we had what was probably the travel rebound in century, certainly I'd never seen the travel rebound, like last year since I started Airbnb. And I think this year is going to be even bigger than last year, because last year, it was a little bit tempered by the Delta and other strains. And I think what you're going to see this year is a true pickup of demand and cross border travel. So we're focused on this year is the perishable opportunity of trying to capture as much market share as possible, and get as many people who haven't traveled a couple years to try Airbnb, because for many people, Airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel. It's the default. But that being said, we are absolutely looking at new opportunities and new services, nothing we pause from the pandemic that is out of -- is off the table to resume. And Airbnb experiences, for example, is a big area of investment in the coming years. And so we're starting to ramp up that product this year, I think more even more next year, you're going to see some major new offerings around Airbnb experiences and set a few demand. And I think that some of our best ideas are ahead of us, I'm 40. And I don't want to feel like the best ideas we had were in my 20s, or 30s. So I think that there's some really big opportunities going forward. But the name of the game is focused, just a few things at a time, the most perishable opportunities, get as much scale as possible, get that scale into an ecosystem, and then you can do a variety of line extensions for guest and for hosts.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks. Awesome. Thanks Brian. And then just one on the travel demand post the summer month. I know you guys talked about the fourth quarter seeing a little bit higher than historical. But how do we compare that versus the 30% figure that is provided in terms of this summer's travel, travel season? Is it higher or lower? Anything you can say in terms of the demand for summer?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, David, I\u2019ll let you take that.\nDave Stephenson: I'd say that with the 30% in the summer periods, we're seeing consistently that strong or stronger on a relative basis in Q4. I think that's the fact that people are willing to plan out into the fourth quarter that far, and higher rates than they've done in the past, it just shows the resilience that people have for traveling. So now the Q4 demand is as strong relative to the Q3 demand. We're stronger.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I have a couple for you, the $2 billion, did the $2 billion I\u2019m Flexible searches, yes, that's up quite a bit from $800 million last time around. I guess I'd be curious to hear about what are you seeing when people use that I\u2019m Flexile. Is that leading to higher conversion? Is that leading to higher utilization of some radius of the search sort of? What are you seeing that sort of driving that quick inflection of that product? And then to go back to your earlier answers about your innovation in your 40s now. What are still the areas on the host front where you see sort of low hanging fruit opportunities to improve it to drive more host growth?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. These are great questions, Brian, good to talk to you again. So yes, let me go. Let me start with guests. And let me then go to host. So you're right. I think that I don't mean just preface by saying that last year, we launched I\u2019m Flexible. The reason we launched it, as we saw more people were flexible. And the challenge is this, for 25 years, travel search has basically been the same. There's a search box, in the search box to ask you, where are you going, and it presumed that where you're going, in fact, you have to come to these websites for intent, and then ask you, when are you going, and so most OTAs aren't really in the business inspiration, they're in business of converting traffic into bookings. And this is good. But we always thought this, the holy grail of online travel was to inspire people about where to go. Now the results have been flexible has exceeded our expectations, it's been used 2 billion times. And for a travel product to be used 2 billion times and people on use travel product typically a couple times a year is pretty unusual. So what are we seeing the results, I think the primary thing we're seeing with I'm Flexible, is we're seeing a very strong amount of engagement. With I\u2019m flexible, people see a lot more properties and a lot more markets. We're seeing people booked properties outside of a lot of the popular tourist destinations. And we're seeing an ability to redistribute travel demand beyond the top popular hotspots like Rome, Paris, Las Vegas, New York, and Los Angeles. So that's really the most important thing that I'm Flexible can do. I'm Flexible, can be in the inspiration game and point the mandatory half supply. And so our measures of success are how often do people come back to the website? How many properties do they wish list? How frequently they came to the product on the inspiration side and on the demand side? How well re-pointing demand to where we have available supply, rather than just kind of being at the mercy of where they think they want to go, when they want to when they come to Airbnb. And so think that what are seeing in the Q1 results is that clearly the product is working because I think that I\u2019m Flexible as a feature has helped drive fair amount of that growth. Now with regard to the host price, you aright, it\u2019s very important that we continue innovate on the host side. Last year, we made a number of improvements to the host side of our product. Number one, our general principle is the easier your make something the more people do it. That\u2019s a really basic principle of the internet. If you make something easy, you reduce friction, more people do it. In hosting, the easier we make it the more people become host. So what we did last year as we reduced the number of steps to being a host to ten easy steps. We added a new product call ask a super host I think 170,000 prospective host have used the product. So where they have a question they can ask on our very best host. And then probably most importantly, Brian, importantly Brian, last year we launched air cover for host. Air cover provides a $1 million protection against property damage, a $1 million personal liability coverage and it\u2019s free, we did not charge anything incremental to our transaction free. And we're the only company and travel to offers this for free all these feature sets to our host. Now going forward this year, we have a number of new innovations that I'm really excited about. I'm not going to go into all the details, I'd like to kind of save it until we announce it. But I'll say at a high level, we are looking at features that bring more people into hosting ecosystem. So we want to provide even more ways to make it easier for hosts to list, we want to provide more support for them to make it easier to host. And we want to provide even more kind of control so people can decide, like who sees their property, when it's available, things like that. So we have some really exciting announcements. On May 11, you'll hear some interesting features that are going to be launching. And then we're also going to have a product released later in the year in November, as well. So we'll have a couple of big updates on those two fronts. But again, it's all about making hosting easier, and making it even more appealing for people who aren't host to become hosts. And if we can do that and make hosting mainstream that will fulfill our growth for years to come.\nOperator: The next question comes from Naved Khan with Truist Securities.\nNaved Khan: Yes, thanks a lot. Question for Dave. So, Dave, last time around you kind of set expectations for ADR to be down for the year in aggregate. Is that still where you expect to be and then what are you making in terms of this new product release that's coming up next week.\nDave Stephenson: Right on ADR, yes, what was shown in the past is that ADRs are up substantially from where they were back in 2019. So they were up 37% year over three years. And what we saw throughout the time in 2021, was that by Q4, about half of that ADR increase was driven by just mix. So regional mix like North America and Europe and the type of home so nonurban whole home and so mix was driving about half of the price appreciation. And then the other half was driven by price appreciation itself. So about half and half on the drivers are ADR. Here in Q1, price appreciation has become a larger percentage overall of the driver of ADR and mix has been a little bit less than half so it shifted even a little bit more. So what we're going to see and we've shown this in the outlook is that Q2 of this year ADRs will be relatively flat with Q2 of the prior year. And so they'll give you a sense that ADR will remain elevated, both due to mix and due to price appreciation. We think that they will likely moderate throughout the back half of the year as mix continues to adjust more towards cities more cross border which have lower average daily rates. But price appreciation has remained to be high and stickier. And so I think the level of decrease in ADR I think will be maybe lower than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And then, I think, give me more on your question around new product introductions that we'll be talking about next week. I\u2019ll give those details --\nNaved Khan: Yes, just details of contract -- just the contract, does your outlook contemplate any contribution from those products?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I mean, our outlook for Q2 clearly includes a lot of the results from the investments we've made to date, and we're very bullish on these continued improvements to continue to drive the strong results that you've seen. So we're not giving kind of guidance out beyond Q2 at this time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So Brian, the rising consumer demand for longer term stays has been something you've been highlighting in terms of a fundamental change of behavior for some time now. So can you share with us how the reception from the host has been in terms of their willingness to accept longer term stays versus the more traditional shorter bursts? Because I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether there's any sort of extra push you guys may need to do in order to enable that longer duration supply with the 6 million hosts you have now? Or is this just a matter of demand, as you say, lighting up the supply? And I guess, second, I get that things are pretty depressed right now. But going back to the world pre-pandemic, like what were some of the bigger corridors of travel in Asia, so we can start thinking about what the shape of the recovery there can be? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, thank you very much, Stephen. Now, yes. So let's start with rising demand for long term stays, what has been the reception of hosts? This is actually one of the most interesting points, I would say, which is, I think, when we really started looking at this category, my assumption was, it would be a different type of host, right? Some hosts wanted to list their place for short term basis. And other different hosts wanted to list their properties for a long term basis. And this is what you say, see on Craigslist, right? There's a short term stay category, and there's apartment categories, and they're not the same people. On Airbnb is totally different. The vast majority of hosts on Airbnb, who initially list their homes for a short term basis, have now included a monthly stay discount. And that's critical. So we have a large percent of people that have a monthly stay discount, or are available to host on a long term basis. So I think that's the most important thing I would say, which is that they absolutely are interested in it. Now, why are hosts interested in this? Well, there's a number of reasons. One is seasonality. Some people live in highly seasonal areas, where on high season, they want to rent by the night because they have a really great yield. But during low season, they have low occupancy. So they'll move to over a month. In some markets in urban markets. There are some restrictions on the number of nights, you can rent on a short term basis below 30 days. But they don't have restrictions on 30 plus days. So for the most part, what hosts see long term stays as is a way to increase their annual occupancy? And they generally want to go nightly, to get as many bookings as possible but during low season where there's limits to go to monthly, and they're really the same host. Now there are some hosts that only do short term, there are some hosts that only do long term, but what we see as generally open mindedness for most hosts to offer both. And the great thing about our product is you hardly had to do anything different to offer long term stays, having long term discounts is key. There's some new amenities, having verified Wi-Fi is important. And if you're going to live someplace, there's a number of like tactical things. But I think generally speaking, the product as it exists work for short term or long term stays, the vast majority hosts are open to it. So the answer is they're very receptive. Now, I think your second question was, what were the biggest corridors in Asia? Well, yes, so let's start. Asia is a highly cross border market. Let's kind of break it out Asia Pacific, I\u2019ll start actually with Australia, which is, of course, part of Asia Pacific. Australia is a primarily outbound market, and it's very much a cross border international market because obviously Australia is very much in a center quarter of globe. And so we're seeing a real rapid recovery in our Australian demand business. Japan has historically been an inbound business, and a lot of our demand in Japan has come from other countries. That is starting to see some uptick. But that's going to take a little bit of time. China is primarily an outbound business, people go to China, but primarily, they travel in deep China, and they go to other communities, especially around Asia. And what we see in Southeast Asia primarily is these are absolutely inbound and outbound markets, they're very much cross border. So I guess the high level is the vast majority markets in Asia Pacific are cross border, a lot of that travel is intra-Asia travel. There's a fair amount of travel though, where it's inside and outside of Asia. And I'm very, very optimistic about the ability of our Asia business to more than fully recover. Because what we've seen is the longer people can travel, the more pent-up demand there is. I don't think travel ever is going to go out of style, people are going to continue to travel. And so I think that we're very, very optimistic that Asia is going to follow the recovery curves of Europe, North America and Latin America, just on a little different timescale. And sorry, just to give you one step, just to give you a couple of stats, on the first question, 87% of all available listings on Airbnb accept long term stays. 52% of hosts offer a monthly discount. And these discounts are 85% of our long term stays.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Lee with Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Two here. I'm just curious, is inflation having an impact on consumer behavior? Maybe, for example, consumer trading down on hotels to home accommodation, and also in terms of market share within home accommodation, as you see mix shift to urban markets, we have strengthened supply, how's that compare versus your peers who may be more non-urban focus? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, maybe why don't we do this day? Why don't I answer a high level of the second question, because I just wanted to share a point about our urban business? And then maybe you can go into the details about both inflation impact on consumer behavior and kind of how we're comparing to our peers in urban markets. James, the thing I would just say about our business is, I think that our business is uniquely resilient in a uniquely adaptable model. And the reason our model is adaptable is because we are not just the US business. We are not just the European business. We are a global business and we are strong in Europe, North America, Asia, Latin America, Africa, we're global. We're in 220 countries regions, one of those global companies in the world. We're not just a vacation rental business. We're vacation rental markets. But our bread and butter is urban, cross border was really how we got our start. So we're very much an urban, a rural vacation and an off the grid, we even have homes totally off the grid. We have homes that are 20, 30 bucks a night and 10s of 1000s of dollars a night. So we're really at all price points. We have catered to families and individuals. So we have nearly every type of home at every price point, and every type of space and nearly every type of community around the world. And so I think that we've been able to be uniquely resilient. And the other thing I want to say about our urban market business, is we're seeing record long term stays. I'm doing this call, for example, from New York City, Airbnb, where I have for a month. And we're seeing in New York City, for example, a huge uptick in long term stays, because a lot of people have to come here, working remotely for months at a time. So that's just a little bit of how we think about it. Dave, I'll hand it over to you and go to a little bit more detail.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I mean we're just not seeing price appreciation impact our business negatively. We had our strongest quarter ever, we have even stronger demand for Q3 and Q4 than we've ever had. And I think Brian hits right in the head because we have every type of home and every type of community, everything from budget, shared homes to luxury homes, people can make a choice about what kind of property fits their particular budget and their needs. And so I think it's that strength of diversity of product that will continue to support our business going forward. And then I think you also hit on it, which is this mix shift to urban markets, which has traditionally been our strength at Airbnb, when you compare it to others who don't have the same amount of supply and capabilities build in those cities. It's going to give us kind of a further tailwind. And really what we're seeing right now is continued strength of the domestic business that was up 65% versus 2019. Strength in our non-urban business is up 80% versus Q1 2019. And that remains incredibly strong. And now we're seeing the mix shift towards urban markets back towards 2019. And across border back to 2019. And so I think that tailwind is going to continue to help our business going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great, thanks for taking my question, just thinking about on how higher interest rates in like a potential recession, how do you think that would impact your supply? And then just thinking about the top line from the back half of the year with AIPAC opening up, and more and more cross border more urban, do you think revenue or I guess bookings will be driven more by volume? Or by ADRs? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, so why don't I take the first question about higher interest rates or recessions impact on supply and Dave to take the second question. Jed, no way to know for sure, on your question, but I'm pretty sure I've a sense of it. Airbnb, we launched on August 11, 2008. So you'll remember what the world was like in August 2008. And we really got going January, February, March of 2009, in the depths of the Great Recession. And the reason that Airbnb initially grew was that people were having trouble paying their rent, having trouble keeping their homes, and people turn to Airbnb to list their homes. And what we generally see is in recessions, people change their behavior. And they change their behavior based on kind of price considerations. And so will generally expect in a recession, if that were to happen, is that probably more people would turn to hosting. That would be number one. So that we would expect, and number two, travelers would probably become more budget conscious. And that would probably have a benefit to Airbnb as well. Now, the downside, of course, the recession is often times fewer people travel. But again, I think we're a pretty resistant business, whether it's economy's good or bad, we're pretty adaptable model. So that's what I would expect in the supply side, that's the more difficult to the economy is, the more people are going to need supplemental income. And a lot, a handful of them will turn to hosting. Dave, I'll hand it over to you.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, and just to double click on that, I think in a recessionary environment, if people are more constrained on the dollars they have to spend to travel, they often will come back to Airbnb because we're a better value in that travel. And going back to the earlier point, we have all types of price points, budget to deluxe, and consumers can figure out what meets their best budget needs. And so I think it actually, we are a better option than many other alternatives in a recessionary environment. And then, in terms of the back half of the year expectations, revenue will be driven more by volume than ADRs. We give our outlook on ADRs for Q2 of being flat year-over-year, they may moderate a little bit in the back half depending on mix. But I think that the biggest driver of revenue, maybe outperforming current expectations would be a further strengthening of the European business or acceleration of that maybe normalization of cancellation rates across the globe could also be a tailwind. APAC coming back more strongly more quickly will certainly help the results. But I don't think it'd be the major driver this year. North American and European travel is still just such a large percentage of our business at the moment. APAC will be super important over the long term, but less of an immediate driver here in 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, Brian want to applaud you, by the way for your efforts with the Ukraine, you came up with a creative and direct way for people to help out. So I applaud you for that. And then I also want to give you some comfort in terms of your thoughts on innovation and age. I think most studies show that peak innovation occurs when people reach 50. So if you can just make it through the next 10 years, you'll be good. And then finally, just because you touched most of the questions I've thought about were already been asked, but let's get back to experiences. So it sounded like maybe you're, I know you got the core business and that's what you're really focused on. But it sounds like you may start leaning in a little bit more to experiences so just flesh that out a little bit and I know it's relatively small versus the core opportunity now but, at some point I assume you're going to lean more aggressively into experiences. And I assume that there'll be host demand to do that. So because there's probably a lot of win-win all around that. So just talk about the timing of when you think you may want to lean more aggressively into experiences. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thanks, Mark. It's great to hear from you again. First of all, yes, I'm 40. I hope I got a good 10 years in me and I think I'm a pretty late bloomer, so maybe give even more than 10 years. And so what I want to do at that time, well, one of the things I want to do is experiences. I think that experiences is a massive, massive opportunity. When we started Airbnb, air homes took off. And I remember saying at the time, Mark, well, we've monetized people's biggest asset already, which is their home, what do we do next, we go to the next largest asset. And it actually turns out your home is not your largest asset from a latency standpoint, I think it's your time for most people, your time ultimately can generate more revenue for the average person than their property can. And so that's a bit of an insight of where experiences came. It also came from the fact that a lot of people book Airbnb not just to save money, but to have a local travel experience. And I think experiences are a great way to do that. And so I was expecting 2020 to be the breakout year for experiences, we prepared for that. And of course, the opposite happened, the pandemic occurred, and we put the product on hold. In the last two years, when people aren't really comfortable leaving their house they have to mask on, it's not really been the right conditions to double down on experiences. But now that the light is at the end of the tunnel of the pandemic, we think people's first trips won't be to meet strangers and go on experiences, we think the first trips we want to have are to reunite with family, unite with friends get a big home together. And so we think that this summer, though people will book experiences, I think the summer still a little more about homes, just because people are getting comfortable getting out of their house. That being said, I think this summer, you're going to start to see a ramp up of experiences, I think next year and beyond it\u2019s going to be a massive opportunity and I\u2019m incredibly excited about it and one of the reasons I am so excited about it is that our guest actually, from a customer satisfaction standpoint, like experience more than homes, they actually leave a significantly higher five star rating as a percentage of their ratings for experiences at home. The people like home, the retention is really good. So we think this is just scratching the surface. And so to answer your question definitively, we are going to be ramping up, we're going to be getting more aggressive experiences, we will be a slower on ramp in this year, but by next year, we're going to be going full throttle. And I'm really excited about this opportunity. And it's a little hard, I don't want to make too many predictions about how big it will become. But my general sense is it's kind of probably bigger than most of us imagined, just because I think people are looking for interesting things to do with people. People are lonely, they want to meet one another, they want to do activities, they can only go to so many restaurants, they can only watch so many shows on Netflix, and many physical communities are being digitized. And so people ultimately want to have real experience in the real world. I think travel is a great way to do that. And the final thing I'd say Mark, is the increasingly people aren't just booking homes in Paris, you go to Paris, you can see the Eiffel Tower, you can go to Loire. But if you go to a small town in France, what do you do other than go to a restaurant, experience is a great way to do something interesting in nearly every community in the world, especially ones that don't have the Eiffel Tower. So that's -- those are just some of the reasons why I am incredibly bullish about this product. But it's going to take some time to really wrap up.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America,\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. Well, lot of my question has been answered. But on the urban supply side, I imagine you had some churn on health issues and other factors. What are you seeing in urban markets? And could you see a big uptick there as demand comes back? How are you thinking about that? And then maybe one follow up.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Dave, do you want to take this one?\nDave Stephenson: Sure. I think one of the key things remember about our supply is that the vast majority of our hosts are individual hosts. And they don't get rid of their home. And they're using their own home or maybe a second home to host. And so even in the midst of a pandemic, or other kind of recessionary environment they are not getting rid of their own home or their second home, which means that they're ready for hosts, and there'll be there when the demand is coming back. And that's what we're seeing now with our urban demand. So the urban demand is starting to come back. It's now back towards night 2019 levels, and our hosts are ready for them and our growth in hosts in the urban markets has also increased. So we're seeing an increase in our listings for both our high density and urban markets overall. And that's what we kind of continue to see as the demand comes back, the supply is there to meet it.\nJustin Post: Right and then follow up on ADRs, I think you're saying around flat year-over-year, can you just talk about the normal seasonality for ADRs? Why -- is it mix that they caused them to down? And how does it -- how do you think about the back half seasonality on ADRs?\nDave Stephenson: Yes, I think if you could, again, we have been up 5%, year-over-year in Q1, it is going to be flat relative on year-over-year basis in Q2, you can kind of see a little bit of a decrease of seasonality for Q3, Q, you can maybe look at some of the seasonality back to \u201819, which will show you that Q3 and Q4 have moderately lower ADR is not substantially, I think you could use that as a little bit of a guide. And then just know that the mix change is being offset a lot by strong price appreciation that is continuing to prop up the ADR overall. So I think that is a bit of the unknown for exactly where ADR is going to land in the back half of the year, what I can see is very clearly what's going to happen in Q2, which will be flat year-over-year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rohan Joshi with Citi.\nRohan Joshi: Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask a little bit more about cross border, just given the rebound that we saw this quarter and rebounds and seeing just can you talk about the dynamics maybe Brian on whether there's cross borders, mostly call it North America users going overseas? Are we seeing more EMEA users coming to US or any sort of insights around there? And then Dave, on just overall EBITDA, understood, more leverage and margin expansion in the first half. But it's really impressive to see the continued call it leverage across most of your line items. Can you just remind us ops and support and gross margin, what's driving that? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, hey, Rohan, I can just start the cross border is I would say North America, Europe, Australia, Latin America, pretty much everywhere, but Asia, and it's really going in all directions. So people are coming into North America, people in North America are leaving. They're absolutely going to Europe, there's a lot of travel within Europe. And we're now also seeing Europeans come to the United States and go kind of in other locations as well. So the great thing is the network effect is kind of moving in multiple directions. Whereas, say, last year, it was much more domestic and kind of really limited, the corridors are really starting to open. So Dave, I'll let you take the rest of the answer.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, on the EBITDA, I'm really pleased and proud of the work that we've done to improve our overall profitability, we made some really difficult choices in the midst of the pandemic, to reduce our overall workforce and focus on the core of our business. We think that actually, that focus is enabling us to deliver even more like, I think we've actually delivered more innovation and productivity as a company by being very deliberate focusing in a more narrow area versus trying to do everything all at once. And that's been really effective with this. We actually have 16% fewer people at the end of Q1 \u201822, than we did at the end of Q1 2020, before we had our layoffs, and yet, we think we're being more productive than ever before. And then we're getting nice. So on top of that fixed cost leverage, yes, we're getting nice improvement in our variable costs, and our options support, it was 15% of revenue here in the first quarter, and seeing nice improvement versus our ops and support in a prior quarters, right. Option support will include, largely our community support operations, and our trust and safety activities. Those are the elements that are within ops and support, we're going to continue to invest in those areas, because we think those are differentiators for us and they doing those really well supports our individual host community. But we're making nice strides and improvement in leverage, so that we gain continued profitability. And one of the things we noted in the letter is that we're expecting for the full year, a modest expansion in our overall EBITDA margin rate. So that's nice to see versus 2021. And I'm really excited that in 2022, we'll have our first full year of net income profitability. So just not a full net income basis to be profitable this year feels excellent.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, two, if I could. High level demand across the -- accommodation industry has proved incredibly sticky to the front half of this recovery and your comments suggest even into the back end. To what do you kind of owe this stickiness and consumer patterns in terms of the way that they travel even as things open up and hotels, perhaps gain a bit of share? And then maybe a bit on cost as well, wage inflation and its inability to kind of find talent has been cropping up across a lot of the names that we cover. You guys haven't necessarily commented too much here. But how if at all are you seeing wage inflation potentially play from the model as we move through 2022? Thanks so much.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Dave, do you want to take it?\nDave Stephenson: Sure.\nBrian Chesky: Sorry. Can I actually can I ask a clarifying, I don't quite understand the first question. Can you ask it again?\nLee Horowitz: Yes, in terms of you --\nBrian Chesky: The way that question -- yes, can you clarify the first question? About first question consumer demand --\nBrian Chesky: The industry. Yes, for alternative accommodations and proven incredibly sticky. Despite reopening more host are coming online, those sorts of things, I guess, to what do you owe this kind of stickiness in consumer travel patterns?\nBrian Chesky: Oh, why is it sticky? Are you -- so sorry, I want to make sure I understand. Are you saying why? It like it was obvious why people were booking homes last year because people weren't traveling for business. They weren't going to urban markets. They weren't crossing borders. They were staying nearby. So you're asking why \u2013\nLee Horowitz: They were \u2013\nBrian Chesky: Trying to reopen -- why they're still sticky. Okay, got it. Yes. Okay, I got it. Thank you. And then let me do that. And then Dave, you can take the second question. So I mean I think it's important to just note Lee that, like we were growing really fast before the pandemic. And the reason we are growing fast is number one, I think a lot of people want to have a local experience they travel number two, they want to save money when they travel. Number three, Airbnb allows them to travel with groups, and increasingly people are traveling in groups. Number four, Airbnb allows them to travel and stay in nearly every community in the world, hotels on unlimited markets around the world. And number five, the longer you're away from home, the more you want to be in a home and length of stay is going up. So I think all those reasons explain the stickiness. Maybe said another way, there's another way of saying rural demand increased during the pandemic, and people are still traveling to rural areas. People are still traveling domestically, which was a very popular demand use case during the pandemic, people don't have to go back to the office five days a week. So people are still booking weekly stays and monthly stays. So again, domestic, non-urban, in longer stays, were three use cases that weren't really our original bread and butter, our original bread and butter was urban cross border short term. But these three trends are sustaining, they're still sustaining. And the reason why is I think the genie is out of the bottle, people have permanent flexibility. And people now realize there's a lot of great places to go beyond the top 100 tourist destinations. That being said, what we're seeing is a recovery of cross border in urban, it's actually both above 2019 levels. So in short, the old ways, the bread and butter of Airbnb, cross border, urban are back in the new use cases or the use cases that were accelerated at pandemic are here to stay. And the combination of those two things is why I think this business is so sticky, maybe a more fundamental way of saying it is people love the experience they have. And so when people love them, they tend to do more of it. Dave, I'll hand over to you.\nDave Stephenson: Yes, in terms of wage inflation, this we did $1.5 billion of revenue in Q1 with just 6,200 people. And we don't need as I said, we actually have 16% fewer people than we did in Q1 of 2020. We don't need to add incremental people to have this business grow dramatically, we are significantly larger today as a business with significantly fewer people. So really, wage inflation is not a really major driver of costs. We are investing in our employees in order to enable them to live anywhere, move anywhere within the country. If they move someplace else, we're not going to alter their pay for being in a different part of the country. And we're going to support them work 90 days in other countries around the world. So we think that kind of investment will benefit us by having lower attrition, and being able to attract the best talent in the world. So we think that's going to be a great investment for the future, to have the best talent to unlock all the innovation that Brian has talked about on the call today. That concludes the Q&A session. I would like to pass the conference back to Brian Chesky for additional remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished this quarter. We hit new records with nights and experiences booked and GBV. We had our first positive Q1 adjusted EBITDA and our highest free cash flow ever $1.2 billion of cash flow. But we're just getting started because we are going to be accelerating our pace of innovation. And I'm really excited to announce the biggest change to Airbnb in a decade. It's going to be next Wednesday, May 11 at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, you can watch a special event right from our homepage. Until then, thank you. I'll see you soon.\nOperator: That concludes the Airbnb Q1 2022 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dave Stephenson",
            "content": "Brian, I think you've covered it incredibly well. I mean, we're very proud of the approach to marketing this, the full funnel approach is working probably well for us. And as you said, we are actually increasing our marketing dollars. We're just keeping the marketing expenses as a percent of revenue relatively consistent to the level we had in 2021, and we think it's being really effective for us. Yes, just double click on a couple areas. I mean, one is we just have more supply than we've ever had in our history. And as Brian kind of mentioned on the call, the fact that we grow more supply in the areas that we have the greatest demand, like non-urban active listings grew 21% in North America, and 15% globally, it's the area where it's kind of self-healing, where we have the demand is where we end up having this supply. And this redistribution is also incredibly important. Because we have listings in all types of markets. We're not globally constrained at any given night, which is different than if you only had supply in one type of market. And then when demand spikes in that particular more narrow market type, like vacation rentals, you don't have anywhere else to distribute demand. But because we're all around the world, in every kind of community, we end up with the benefit of being able to redistribute demand to other places. So I think that's been incredibly strong for us. Regarding the capital allocation, yes, we have $9.3 billion that take as a CFO and the continued pandemic, having a strong balance sheet continues to allow us to sleep well at night. We have noted previously that we're going to use about $1 billion of our cash to pay for employee tax obligations as they exercise their shares. And so that will be a use of cash this year. And beyond that we're continue to be in growth mode, we will continue to have a balance sheet that enables us to be ready to invest when and where we find that it's appropriate. It does enable us to do M&A in the future, if desired. Although M&A is not our primary driver of growth, we still plan to grow organically as our primary means. But we'll continue to evaluate our balance sheet use and make sure that we are deploying capital appropriately. I'd say that with the 30% in the summer periods, we're seeing consistently that strong or stronger on a relative basis in Q4. I think that's the fact that people are willing to plan out into the fourth quarter that far, and higher rates than they've done in the past, it just shows the resilience that people have for traveling. So now the Q4 demand is as strong relative to the Q3 demand. We're stronger. Right on ADR, yes, what was shown in the past is that ADRs are up substantially from where they were back in 2019. So they were up 37% year over three years. And what we saw throughout the time in 2021, was that by Q4, about half of that ADR increase was driven by just mix. So regional mix like North America and Europe and the type of home so nonurban whole home and so mix was driving about half of the price appreciation. And then the other half was driven by price appreciation itself. So about half and half on the drivers are ADR. Here in Q1, price appreciation has become a larger percentage overall of the driver of ADR and mix has been a little bit less than half so it shifted even a little bit more. So what we're going to see and we've shown this in the outlook is that Q2 of this year ADRs will be relatively flat with Q2 of the prior year. And so they'll give you a sense that ADR will remain elevated, both due to mix and due to price appreciation. We think that they will likely moderate throughout the back half of the year as mix continues to adjust more towards cities more cross border which have lower average daily rates. But price appreciation has remained to be high and stickier. And so I think the level of decrease in ADR I think will be maybe lower than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And then, I think, give me more on your question around new product introductions that we'll be talking about next week. I\u2019ll give those details -- Yes, I mean, our outlook for Q2 clearly includes a lot of the results from the investments we've made to date, and we're very bullish on these continued improvements to continue to drive the strong results that you've seen. So we're not giving kind of guidance out beyond Q2 at this time. Yes, I mean we're just not seeing price appreciation impact our business negatively. We had our strongest quarter ever, we have even stronger demand for Q3 and Q4 than we've ever had. And I think Brian hits right in the head because we have every type of home and every type of community, everything from budget, shared homes to luxury homes, people can make a choice about what kind of property fits their particular budget and their needs. And so I think it's that strength of diversity of product that will continue to support our business going forward. And then I think you also hit on it, which is this mix shift to urban markets, which has traditionally been our strength at Airbnb, when you compare it to others who don't have the same amount of supply and capabilities build in those cities. It's going to give us kind of a further tailwind. And really what we're seeing right now is continued strength of the domestic business that was up 65% versus 2019. Strength in our non-urban business is up 80% versus Q1 2019. And that remains incredibly strong. And now we're seeing the mix shift towards urban markets back towards 2019. And across border back to 2019. And so I think that tailwind is going to continue to help our business going forward. Yes, and just to double click on that, I think in a recessionary environment, if people are more constrained on the dollars they have to spend to travel, they often will come back to Airbnb because we're a better value in that travel. And going back to the earlier point, we have all types of price points, budget to deluxe, and consumers can figure out what meets their best budget needs. And so I think it actually, we are a better option than many other alternatives in a recessionary environment. And then, in terms of the back half of the year expectations, revenue will be driven more by volume than ADRs. We give our outlook on ADRs for Q2 of being flat year-over-year, they may moderate a little bit in the back half depending on mix. But I think that the biggest driver of revenue, maybe outperforming current expectations would be a further strengthening of the European business or acceleration of that maybe normalization of cancellation rates across the globe could also be a tailwind. APAC coming back more strongly more quickly will certainly help the results. But I don't think it'd be the major driver this year. North American and European travel is still just such a large percentage of our business at the moment. APAC will be super important over the long term, but less of an immediate driver here in 2022. Sure. I think one of the key things remember about our supply is that the vast majority of our hosts are individual hosts. And they don't get rid of their home. And they're using their own home or maybe a second home to host. And so even in the midst of a pandemic, or other kind of recessionary environment they are not getting rid of their own home or their second home, which means that they're ready for hosts, and there'll be there when the demand is coming back. And that's what we're seeing now with our urban demand. So the urban demand is starting to come back. It's now back towards night 2019 levels, and our hosts are ready for them and our growth in hosts in the urban markets has also increased. So we're seeing an increase in our listings for both our high density and urban markets overall. And that's what we kind of continue to see as the demand comes back, the supply is there to meet it. Yes, I think if you could, again, we have been up 5%, year-over-year in Q1, it is going to be flat relative on year-over-year basis in Q2, you can kind of see a little bit of a decrease of seasonality for Q3, Q, you can maybe look at some of the seasonality back to \u201819, which will show you that Q3 and Q4 have moderately lower ADR is not substantially, I think you could use that as a little bit of a guide. And then just know that the mix change is being offset a lot by strong price appreciation that is continuing to prop up the ADR overall. So I think that is a bit of the unknown for exactly where ADR is going to land in the back half of the year, what I can see is very clearly what's going to happen in Q2, which will be flat year-over-year. Yes, on the EBITDA, I'm really pleased and proud of the work that we've done to improve our overall profitability, we made some really difficult choices in the midst of the pandemic, to reduce our overall workforce and focus on the core of our business. We think that actually, that focus is enabling us to deliver even more like, I think we've actually delivered more innovation and productivity as a company by being very deliberate focusing in a more narrow area versus trying to do everything all at once.

Option support will include, largely our community support operations, and our trust and safety activities.

But we're making nice strides and improvement in leverage, so that we gain continued profitability. And one of the things we noted in the letter is that we're expecting for the full year, a modest expansion in our overall EBITDA margin rate. So that's nice to see versus 2021. And I'm really excited that in 2022, we'll have our first full year of net income profitability. So just not a full net income basis to be profitable this year feels excellent. Sure. Yes, in terms of wage inflation, this we did $1.5 billion of revenue in Q1 with just 6,200 people. And we don't need as I said, we actually have 16% fewer people than we did in Q1 of 2020.

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right, thank you very much, Ellie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share our Q1 results with you. Now, despite the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and macroeconomic headwinds, Q1 was another incredible quarter. We exceeded 100 million Nights and Experiences Booked for the first time ever. GBV was $17 billion, which was 73% above Q1 2019. Revenue was $1.5 billion, exceeding Q1, 2019 by 80%. Net loss was $19 million. Now this is a significant improvement in the same periods from 2018 and 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $229 million. Now, this is our first positive adjusted EBITDA Q1, and this represented adjusted EBITDA margin of a positive 15%. Now this is compared to a negative 7% a year ago, and a negative 30% in Q1 2019. And finally, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. This was also an all-time high. And what these results show is that two years into the pandemic, Airbnb is stronger than ever before. Now, why is this? Well, millions of people are now more flexible about where they live and they work. And as a result, they're spreading out to thousands of towns and cities. And they're staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time. That's through our adaptability innovation, we've been able to quickly respond to this changing world of travel. And these incredible results were driven by a number of positive business trends. First, guests are booking more than ever before. In Q1 gross nights booked grew 32% compared to Q1 2019. And this is despite the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and macroeconomic headwinds. People are also more confident booking travel further in advance. And we're seeing strong demand for summer bookings and beyond. Second, guests are returning to cities and they\u2019re crossing borders. So our guests continue to travel domestically and continue to go to rural destinations at Airbnb. We are also seeing guests return to cities and cross borders at or even above pre-pandemic rates. Third, guest are also staying longer, even living on Airbnb. Now, while short-term stays rebounded strongly in Q1 2022, stays of a month or longer continue to be our fastest-growing category by tripling compared to 2019. In nearly half of our nights booked in Q1 were for stays of week or longer in one in five nights booked were for stays of a month or longer. So the world is clearly becoming more flexible about where people can work. And getting ahead of this trend, last week, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere. And we've designed a way for them to live and work around the world, while collaborating in a highly collaborative way and experiencing the in-person connection that makes Airbnb special. Now fourth, our innovations are inspiring guests to discover thousands of new places. In 2021, we delivered more than 150 upgrades across every aspect of our service. And among these upgrades was the innovative I\u2019m Flexible feature. Now I\u2019m Flexible feature has now been used more than 2 billion times, 2 billion. And guests who use I\u2019m flexible are more likely to book home in less popular locations. This is really important, because this allows us to point demand to where we have supply, and it helps distribute guests more widely in communities all around the world. But we're not stopping there. On May 11, next Wednesday, we will be announcing the Airbnb 2022 summer release. This is a new Airbnb for a new world of travel. With a completely new way to search, guests will be able to discover millions of unique homes in Airbnb they never thought to search for. And when they book, guests will have the confidence knowing that Airbnb has their back each step of the way. And so you can watch this announcement right on our homepage next Wednesday at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, next Wednesday, right on our homepage. I hope you can tune in because I'm really excited about what we have to share. And then finally, our community - our host community continues to expand. We see destinations the strongest demand showing this most supply growth with non-urban active listings actually growing 15% globally. And we're also showing an increase in total urban supply as demand returns to cities. And we believe that the upgrades we announced last year, including our new host onboarding flow and AirCover, are supporting this growth and enabling success for a new host. So to recap, we had our best Q1 ever. Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV were a highest ever. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA were records for Q1 and we generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. With these results, Airbnb is stronger than ever before. Now, before I go to question, I just want to talk for a minute about our efforts in Ukraine. Because over the past few months, millions of lives have been devastated by the war. And when the crisis broke out, we knew that our platform can help refugees fleeing the crisis. And within four days of the invasion, Ukraine, we announced that airbnb.org would provide free housing for up to 100,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine, and over 30,000 hosts have already signed up to open their homes to refugees for free or for a discount. But then, something even more remarkable happened. People started booking homes for hosts in Ukraine. Hosts, they never intend to stay with just to provide relief aid. And soon, more than 170,000 people joined in, and they booked approximately 600,000 nights booked in Ukraine. And because we waived our fees, $20 million went directly to host in Ukraine. And I think this speaks to the power of our community. And they are a reminder that in the world of darkness and a world of destruction, kindness still exist. And so I'm really proud of our business results this quarter. I'm also proud of how helpful we've been able to be to thousands of people in need. And with all that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions. Yes, excellent. Thanks, Colin. So why don't I answer these at a high level? And Dave, feel free to jump in with some more specifics. So let's start with the question of Colin, some of the broader use cases you talked about. And let's back up. So when we started Airbnb, it was really just a way for people to book a home for just a few days at a time. But even before the pandemic, actually long-term stays, stays of a month or longer were our fastest-growing category or segment of trip by trip length, some of those are already growing very quickly before the pandemic. And I think what the pandemic did, is I think it accelerated the adoption of longer-term stays in Airbnb by hard to say how many, but certainly by years, and I think it's important to understand why this is happening. Right now, what's happened is that for millions of people, they don't need to go back to an office five days a week. And the vast majority of companies are not requiring employees to come back to an office, many have moved to a hybrid or entirely remote model. And I think that what we're going to see going forward, is you're going to see more and more flexibility. Because I think companies ultimately want to attract the very best people, and the best people are going to be everywhere. And so long as we believe that people don't need to go back to an office five days a week, millions of people, then we believe in a world of more flexibility. So long as we believe in a world where people will continue to dial in and zoom, we will again believe in a world of more flexibility. And so what we are going to continue to see we think, over the coming years is continued and sustained growth for stays of longer than a month and stays of longer than a week. I don't think this is a temporary phenomenon. I think that the genie is out of the bottle and flexibility is here to stay. And I think flexibility after compensation will probably be the most important benefit that an employer can offer. And just to give you a small anecdote. Last week, last Thursday, we announced that Airbnb employees can live and work anywhere in the world. The response internally was great, but even more impressive was the response externally. Because a, our career page was visited 800,000 times after that announcement. And so I think that just speaks to the durability of this use case. And I think that it's going to continue. Now with regards to advertising, I think it's just important that I share a little bit of a recap of how we think about marketing and Dave, feel free to talk a little more detail. So we have, Colin, a little bit obviously different approach to marketing and advertising than our peers. We take a full funnel approach to marketing that combines PR, brand marketing and performance marketing. We're not really focused on buying customers. We're focused primarily in investing in our brand and educating the world about what makes Airbnb unique. So we think of marketing primarily as education. And I think this explains why 90% of our traffic or more is direct or unpaid. Airbnb is a noun and verb used all over the world, and it was really not advertising, but PR and word-of-mouth that built our brand. And just to give you an example, and - since the pandemic started, there have been more than 1 million articles written about Airbnb, 55% of articles that used to have the word travel in it, also have the word Airbnb in it. So it's pretty, so advertising is really a form of supplemental education for us. It's not the core driver of growth. We think the core driver of growth, Airbnb, is innovation. It's about building a product that people love. And the role of marketing isn't to buy customers. The role of marketing for us is to educate people about our new features and our new offerings. Dave, do you want to - I don\u2019t know if you want to go into a little more detail about advertising? Great, Bernie. So why don't I do this? Let me just talk at a high level about the first question. And then Dave, why don't you take both questions at a more specific level. So let me just say at a high level around supply and demand, number one, I think we're going to have plenty of supply this summer for the demand. We're expecting a lot of demand for the summer. But we are not supply constrained any night of the year, not even close to the global level. The challenge of most travel companies is that a lot of people try to go to the same place, the same city on the same day. And cities, essentially, like travel OTAs typically get sold out. So like a lot of people try to go to New York City on New Year's Eve, and there's only so many places to stay in New York, and so you're going to get sold out. Now, here is Airbnb. We're in 100,000, towns and cities all over the world. And we see a couple phenomenon, I think it's important to point out. The first thing we see is the fastest-growing supply markets are actually our fastest-growing demand markets. So as a market experiences more demand, more supply gets unlocked. And I think the reason why is primarily because the vast majority of host of Airbnb are individuals. The vast majority of new host get a booking within three days. And when a regular person gets a booking, and the booking might be $300, $400 or $500, they tend to tell their friends about it. And so as more people get booked, they create more word-of-mouth, and this unlocks more supply. So we have a global network, where demand in a sense, stimulates more supply. Additionally, the I'm Flexible feature is critical, because it allows us to point demand to where we have supply. So if somebody types in Paris on June 4 to 5, we are limited to the properties in Paris on those dates. But if somebody says, we\u2019re flexible, we can point them to other dates in Paris that are a little lower season, or other towns around Paris to have available supply. So I think these are really important. But Dave, I don't know if you want to go into a little more specifics about either utilization and also kind of the capital allocation theory. Great. Yes, so let me take that. So thanks, Mario. So basically, we learned some really important lessons during the pandemic. I started this company with my two friends when I was 26. I just turned 26 to start this company, and we had this enormous amount of success. And one of the things that happens when you're a first time entrepreneur, an enormous amount of success as you do something well, and you think you can kind of do everything well. And we pursue it a lot of things before the pandemic. And I remember growing up, my teacher said, you can do everything you want your life not at the same time, though. And I think that when the pandemic happened, there was a silver lining to our, to the crisis for us, which is we got really focused, we took all of our best people, we pause a lot of new initiatives. And we put our very best people on the most important problems, the company, which was stimulating core business. But I think what we saw is not only did that happen, but the total addressable market for short term stays is bigger than we ever imagined. And we are also able to extend it to long term stays. Our general approach now, going forward, is to be incredibly focused, we're going to absolutely be pursuing new opportunities. But we want to focus on the most perishable opportunities right now. And right now, the most perishable opportunity is this. Last year, we had what was probably the travel rebound in century, certainly I'd never seen the travel rebound, like last year since I started Airbnb. And I think this year is going to be even bigger than last year, because last year, it was a little bit tempered by the Delta and other strains. And I think what you're going to see this year is a true pickup of demand and cross border travel. So we're focused on this year is the perishable opportunity of trying to capture as much market share as possible, and get as many people who haven't traveled a couple years to try Airbnb, because for many people, Airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel. It's the default. But that being said, we are absolutely looking at new opportunities and new services, nothing we pause from the pandemic that is out of -- is off the table to resume. And Airbnb experiences, for example, is a big area of investment in the coming years. And so we're starting to ramp up that product this year, I think more even more next year, you're going to see some major new offerings around Airbnb experiences and set a few demand. And I think that some of our best ideas are ahead of us, I'm 40. And I don't want to feel like the best ideas we had were in my 20s, or 30s. So I think that there's some really big opportunities going forward. But the name of the game is focused, just a few things at a time, the most perishable opportunities, get as much scale as possible, get that scale into an ecosystem, and then you can do a variety of line extensions for guest and for hosts. Yes, David, I\u2019ll let you take that. Yes. These are great questions, Brian, good to talk to you again. So yes, let me go. Let me start with guests. And let me then go to host. So you're right. I think that I don't mean just preface by saying that last year, we launched I\u2019m Flexible. The reason we launched it, as we saw more people were flexible. And the challenge is this, for 25 years, travel search has basically been the same. There's a search box, in the search box to ask you, where are you going, and it presumed that where you're going, in fact, you have to come to these websites for intent, and then ask you, when are you going, and so most OTAs aren't really in the business inspiration, they're in business of converting traffic into bookings. And this is good. But we always thought this, the holy grail of online travel was to inspire people about where to go. Now the results have been flexible has exceeded our expectations, it's been used 2 billion times. And for a travel product to be used 2 billion times and people on use travel product typically a couple times a year is pretty unusual. So what are we seeing the results, I think the primary thing we're seeing with I'm Flexible, is we're seeing a very strong amount of engagement. With I\u2019m flexible, people see a lot more properties and a lot more markets. We're seeing people booked properties outside of a lot of the popular tourist destinations. And we're seeing an ability to redistribute travel demand beyond the top popular hotspots like Rome, Paris, Las Vegas, New York, and Los Angeles. So that's really the most important thing that I'm Flexible can do. I'm Flexible, can be in the inspiration game and point the mandatory half supply. And so our measures of success are how often do people come back to the website? How many properties do they wish list? How frequently they came to the product on the inspiration side and on the demand side? How well re-pointing demand to where we have available supply, rather than just kind of being at the mercy of where they think they want to go, when they want to when they come to Airbnb. And so think that what are seeing in the Q1 results is that clearly the product is working because I think that I\u2019m Flexible as a feature has helped drive fair amount of that growth. Now with regard to the host price, you aright, it\u2019s very important that we continue innovate on the host side. Last year, we made a number of improvements to the host side of our product. Number one, our general principle is the easier your make something the more people do it. That\u2019s a really basic principle of the internet. If you make something easy, you reduce friction, more people do it. In hosting, the easier we make it the more people become host. So what we did last year as we reduced the number of steps to being a host to ten easy steps. We added a new product call ask a super host I think 170,000 prospective host have used the product. So where they have a question they can ask on our very best host. And then probably most importantly, Brian, importantly Brian, last year we launched air cover for host. Air cover provides a $1 million protection against property damage, a $1 million personal liability coverage and it\u2019s free, we did not charge anything incremental to our transaction free. And we're the only company and travel to offers this for free all these feature sets to our host. Now going forward this year, we have a number of new innovations that I'm really excited about. I'm not going to go into all the details, I'd like to kind of save it until we announce it. But I'll say at a high level, we are looking at features that bring more people into hosting ecosystem. So we want to provide even more ways to make it easier for hosts to list, we want to provide more support for them to make it easier to host. And we want to provide even more kind of control so people can decide, like who sees their property, when it's available, things like that. So we have some really exciting announcements. On May 11, you'll hear some interesting features that are going to be launching. And then we're also going to have a product released later in the year in November, as well. So we'll have a couple of big updates on those two fronts. But again, it's all about making hosting easier, and making it even more appealing for people who aren't host to become hosts. And if we can do that and make hosting mainstream that will fulfill our growth for years to come. Yes, thank you very much, Stephen. Now, yes. So let's start with rising demand for long term stays, what has been the reception of hosts? This is actually one of the most interesting points, I would say, which is, I think, when we really started looking at this category, my assumption was, it would be a different type of host, right? Some hosts wanted to list their place for short term basis. And other different hosts wanted to list their properties for a long term basis. And this is what you say, see on Craigslist, right? There's a short term stay category, and there's apartment categories, and they're not the same people. On Airbnb is totally different. The vast majority of hosts on Airbnb, who initially list their homes for a short term basis, have now included a monthly stay discount. And that's critical. So we have a large percent of people that have a monthly stay discount, or are available to host on a long term basis. So I think that's the most important thing I would say, which is that they absolutely are interested in it. Now, why are hosts interested in this? Well, there's a number of reasons. One is seasonality. Some people live in highly seasonal areas, where on high season, they want to rent by the night because they have a really great yield. But during low season, they have low occupancy. So they'll move to over a month. In some markets in urban markets. There are some restrictions on the number of nights, you can rent on a short term basis below 30 days. But they don't have restrictions on 30 plus days. So for the most part, what hosts see long term stays as is a way to increase their annual occupancy? And they generally want to go nightly, to get as many bookings as possible but during low season where there's limits to go to monthly, and they're really the same host. Now there are some hosts that only do short term, there are some hosts that only do long term, but what we see as generally open mindedness for most hosts to offer both. And the great thing about our product is you hardly had to do anything different to offer long term stays, having long term discounts is key. There's some new amenities, having verified Wi-Fi is important. And if you're going to live someplace, there's a number of like tactical things. But I think generally speaking, the product as it exists work for short term or long term stays, the vast majority hosts are open to it. So the answer is they're very receptive. Now, I think your second question was, what were the biggest corridors in Asia? Well, yes, so let's start. Asia is a highly cross border market. Let's kind of break it out Asia Pacific, I\u2019ll start actually with Australia, which is, of course, part of Asia Pacific. Australia is a primarily outbound market, and it's very much a cross border international market because obviously Australia is very much in a center quarter of globe. And so we're seeing a real rapid recovery in our Australian demand business. Japan has historically been an inbound business, and a lot of our demand in Japan has come from other countries. That is starting to see some uptick. But that's going to take a little bit of time. China is primarily an outbound business, people go to China, but primarily, they travel in deep China, and they go to other communities, especially around Asia. And what we see in Southeast Asia primarily is these are absolutely inbound and outbound markets, they're very much cross border. So I guess the high level is the vast majority markets in Asia Pacific are cross border, a lot of that travel is intra-Asia travel. There's a fair amount of travel though, where it's inside and outside of Asia. And I'm very, very optimistic about the ability of our Asia business to more than fully recover. Because what we've seen is the longer people can travel, the more pent-up demand there is. I don't think travel ever is going to go out of style, people are going to continue to travel. And so I think that we're very, very optimistic that Asia is going to follow the recovery curves of Europe, North America and Latin America, just on a little different timescale. And sorry, just to give you one step, just to give you a couple of stats, on the first question, 87% of all available listings on Airbnb accept long term stays. 52% of hosts offer a monthly discount. And these discounts are 85% of our long term stays. Yes, maybe why don't we do this day? Why don't I answer a high level of the second question, because I just wanted to share a point about our urban business? And then maybe you can go into the details about both inflation impact on consumer behavior and kind of how we're comparing to our peers in urban markets. James, the thing I would just say about our business is, I think that our business is uniquely resilient in a uniquely adaptable model. And the reason our model is adaptable is because we are not just the US business. We are not just the European business. We are a global business and we are strong in Europe, North America, Asia, Latin America, Africa, we're global. We're in 220 countries regions, one of those global companies in the world. We're not just a vacation rental business. We're vacation rental markets. But our bread and butter is urban, cross border was really how we got our start. So we're very much an urban, a rural vacation and an off the grid, we even have homes totally off the grid. We have homes that are 20, 30 bucks a night and 10s of 1000s of dollars a night. So we're really at all price points. We have catered to families and individuals. So we have nearly every type of home at every price point, and every type of space and nearly every type of community around the world. And so I think that we've been able to be uniquely resilient. And the other thing I want to say about our urban market business, is we're seeing record long term stays. I'm doing this call, for example, from New York City, Airbnb, where I have for a month. And we're seeing in New York City, for example, a huge uptick in long term stays, because a lot of people have to come here, working remotely for months at a time. So that's just a little bit of how we think about it. Dave, I'll hand it over to you and go to a little bit more detail. Yes, so why don't I take the first question about higher interest rates or recessions impact on supply and Dave to take the second question. Jed, no way to know for sure, on your question, but I'm pretty sure I've a sense of it. Airbnb, we launched on August 11, 2008. So you'll remember what the world was like in August 2008. And we really got going January, February, March of 2009, in the depths of the Great Recession. And the reason that Airbnb initially grew was that people were having trouble paying their rent, having trouble keeping their homes, and people turn to Airbnb to list their homes. And what we generally see is in recessions, people change their behavior. And they change their behavior based on kind of price considerations. And so will generally expect in a recession, if that were to happen, is that probably more people would turn to hosting. That would be number one. So that we would expect, and number two, travelers would probably become more budget conscious. And that would probably have a benefit to Airbnb as well. Now, the downside, of course, the recession is often times fewer people travel. But again, I think we're a pretty resistant business, whether it's economy's good or bad, we're pretty adaptable model. So that's what I would expect in the supply side, that's the more difficult to the economy is, the more people are going to need supplemental income. And a lot, a handful of them will turn to hosting. Dave, I'll hand it over to you. All right. Well, thanks, Mark. It's great to hear from you again. First of all, yes, I'm 40. I hope I got a good 10 years in me and I think I'm a pretty late bloomer, so maybe give even more than 10 years. And so what I want to do at that time, well, one of the things I want to do is experiences. I think that experiences is a massive, massive opportunity. When we started Airbnb, air homes took off. And I remember saying at the time, Mark, well, we've monetized people's biggest asset already, which is their home, what do we do next, we go to the next largest asset. And it actually turns out your home is not your largest asset from a latency standpoint, I think it's your time for most people, your time ultimately can generate more revenue for the average person than their property can. And so that's a bit of an insight of where experiences came. It also came from the fact that a lot of people book Airbnb not just to save money, but to have a local travel experience. And I think experiences are a great way to do that. And so I was expecting 2020 to be the breakout year for experiences, we prepared for that. And of course, the opposite happened, the pandemic occurred, and we put the product on hold. In the last two years, when people aren't really comfortable leaving their house they have to mask on, it's not really been the right conditions to double down on experiences. But now that the light is at the end of the tunnel of the pandemic, we think people's first trips won't be to meet strangers and go on experiences, we think the first trips we want to have are to reunite with family, unite with friends get a big home together. And so we think that this summer, though people will book experiences, I think the summer still a little more about homes, just because people are getting comfortable getting out of their house. That being said, I think this summer, you're going to start to see a ramp up of experiences, I think next year and beyond it\u2019s going to be a massive opportunity and I\u2019m incredibly excited about it and one of the reasons I am so excited about it is that our guest actually, from a customer satisfaction standpoint, like experience more than homes, they actually leave a significantly higher five star rating as a percentage of their ratings for experiences at home. The people like home, the retention is really good. So we think this is just scratching the surface. And so to answer your question definitively, we are going to be ramping up, we're going to be getting more aggressive experiences, we will be a slower on ramp in this year, but by next year, we're going to be going full throttle. And I'm really excited about this opportunity. And it's a little hard, I don't want to make too many predictions about how big it will become. But my general sense is it's kind of probably bigger than most of us imagined, just because I think people are looking for interesting things to do with people. People are lonely, they want to meet one another, they want to do activities, they can only go to so many restaurants, they can only watch so many shows on Netflix, and many physical communities are being digitized. And so people ultimately want to have real experience in the real world. I think travel is a great way to do that. And the final thing I'd say Mark, is the increasingly people aren't just booking homes in Paris, you go to Paris, you can see the Eiffel Tower, you can go to Loire. But if you go to a small town in France, what do you do other than go to a restaurant, experience is a great way to do something interesting in nearly every community in the world, especially ones that don't have the Eiffel Tower. So that's -- those are just some of the reasons why I am incredibly bullish about this product. But it's going to take some time to really wrap up. Yes, Dave, do you want to take this one? Yes, hey, Rohan, I can just start the cross border is I would say North America, Europe, Australia, Latin America, pretty much everywhere, but Asia, and it's really going in all directions. So people are coming into North America, people in North America are leaving. They're absolutely going to Europe, there's a lot of travel within Europe. And we're now also seeing Europeans come to the United States and go kind of in other locations as well. So the great thing is the network effect is kind of moving in multiple directions. Whereas, say, last year, it was much more domestic and kind of really limited, the corridors are really starting to open. So Dave, I'll let you take the rest of the answer. All right. Dave, do you want to take it? Sorry. Can I actually can I ask a clarifying, I don't quite understand the first question. Can you ask it again? The way that question -- yes, can you clarify the first question? About first question consumer demand -- The industry. Yes, for alternative accommodations and proven incredibly sticky. Despite reopening more host are coming online, those sorts of things, I guess, to what do you owe this kind of stickiness in consumer travel patterns? Oh, why is it sticky? Are you -- so sorry, I want to make sure I understand. Are you saying why? It like it was obvious why people were booking homes last year because people weren't traveling for business. They weren't going to urban markets. They weren't crossing borders. They were staying nearby. So you're asking why \u2013 Trying to reopen -- why they're still sticky. Okay, got it. Yes. Okay, I got it. Thank you. And then let me do that. And then Dave, you can take the second question. So I mean I think it's important to just note Lee that, like we were growing really fast before the pandemic. And the reason we are growing fast is number one, I think a lot of people want to have a local experience they travel number two, they want to save money when they travel. Number three, Airbnb allows them to travel with groups, and increasingly people are traveling in groups. Number four, Airbnb allows them to travel and stay in nearly every community in the world, hotels on unlimited markets around the world. And number five, the longer you're away from home, the more you want to be in a home and length of stay is going up. So I think all those reasons explain the stickiness. Maybe said another way, there's another way of saying rural demand increased during the pandemic, and people are still traveling to rural areas. People are still traveling domestically, which was a very popular demand use case during the pandemic, people don't have to go back to the office five days a week. So people are still booking weekly stays and monthly stays. So again, domestic, non-urban, in longer stays, were three use cases that weren't really our original bread and butter, our original bread and butter was urban cross border short term. But these three trends are sustaining, they're still sustaining. And the reason why is I think the genie is out of the bottle, people have permanent flexibility. And people now realize there's a lot of great places to go beyond the top 100 tourist destinations. That being said, what we're seeing is a recovery of cross border in urban, it's actually both above 2019 levels. So in short, the old ways, the bread and butter of Airbnb, cross border, urban are back in the new use cases or the use cases that were accelerated at pandemic are here to stay. And the combination of those two things is why I think this business is so sticky, maybe a more fundamental way of saying it is people love the experience they have. And so when people love them, they tend to do more of it. Dave, I'll hand over to you. All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished this quarter. We hit new records with nights and experiences booked and GBV. We had our first positive Q1 adjusted EBITDA and our highest free cash flow ever $1.2 billion of cash flow. But we're just getting started because we are going to be accelerating our pace of innovation. And I'm really excited to announce the biggest change to Airbnb in a decade. It's going to be next Wednesday, May 11 at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, you can watch a special event right from our homepage. Until then, thank you. I'll see you soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of 2023. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAngela Yang: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's fourth quarter of 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our fourth quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am excited to share our results with you. We wrapped 2023 with another strong quarter. We had 99 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q4, marking our highest fourth quarter ever. Revenue of $2.2 billion grew 70% year-over-year. Net loss was $249 million. But when excluding nonrecurring tax items, adjusted net income was $489 million, representing an adjusted net income margin of 22%. For the full year, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion, our highest ever. Because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we repurchased $2.25 billion of our shares during 2023. And I'm excited to announce that today, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $6 billion of our Class A common stock. Our strong results in 2023 were driven by our focus on 3 strategic priorities, making hosting mainstream, perfecting our first service and expanding beyond the core. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We've been focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling in Airbnb. Our results show that our approach is working. In Q4, our host community grew to 5 million hosts around the globe. Active listings exceeded $7.7 million by the end of 2023, increasing 18% year-over-year. And we also saw sustained double-digit supply growth across all regions. All in all, in 2023, host earned more than $57 billion. This year, we are going to continue to raise awareness from hosting and improve the overall host experience. Second, we're perfecting our core service. Over the past 3 years, we've launched more than 430 new features and upgrades to our core service. We've made significant improvements to make Airbnb a more affordable and reliable option, and we are already seeing a positive impact. For example, post cancellations have decreased by 36% in Q4 of 2023, and this is compared to the same period a year ago. And now two thirds of our host offer a weekly or monthly discount. We will never stop perfecting our core service. In the year ahead, we'll remain focused on improving the quality and reliability of stays. Finally, we are expanding beyond the core. Airbnb is at an inflection point. We spent the last 3 years perfecting our core service, and we are now ready to embark on our next chapter. We're focused on unlocking more growth opportunities by investing in underpenetrated international markets, and we're seeing some great results. Following the success that we've seen in recent quarters in Germany, Brazil and Korea, we're now rolling out our playbook in other countries, including Switzerland, Belgium and Netherlands. But this is only one piece of a much bigger strategy because we've always believed that Airbnb was destined to offer more than just a place to stay. And now is the time for us to expand beyond our core business and reinvent Airbnb. And there are a few reasons why. I mean, first, we want people to love our core service before offering them something new. And with hundreds of improvements we made over the past 3 years, the Airbnb service is now better than it's ever been. Second, we've been able to attract some of the best talent in the world, and we now have the capabilities to do so much more. And third, there is a new platform shift with AI, and it will allow us to do things we never could have imagined. While we've been using AI across our service for years, we believe we can become a leader in developing some of the most innovative and personalized AI interfaces in the world. In November, we accelerated our efforts with the acquisition of GamePlanner.AI, a stealth AI company led by the Co-Founder and original developer of Siri. With these critical pieces in place, we're now ready to expand beyond our core business. Now this will be a multiyear journey, and we will share more with you towards the end of this year. Now looking back on Q4, we also saw a number of very positive business highlights. First, we surpassed 5 million hosts in the platform and saw meaningful supply growth across all regions. We added nearly 1.2 million listings in 2023, ending the year with over 7.7 million active listings. Q4 supply growth grew 18% year-over-year. Now this is a real highlight. And we saw the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. So obviously, there's a real strong network effect happening here. We also continue to see relatively similar supply growth among individual and professional hosts with the majority of these listings exclusive to Airbnb. Now second, we continue to see strong demand on Airbnb. Now this is especially true amongst first-time bookers, which is particularly encouraging. Nights and Experiences Booked grew 12% compared to a year ago and following some volatile in October, Nights Booked actually accelerated throughout the remainder of the quarter, and Q4 also marked the highest quarterly growth rate of the year for first-time bookers. And additionally, we also gained momentum in app downloads and app bookings. 55% of gross Nights Booked were on our app. This is up from 50% a year ago. And finally, we're driving affordability for guests. Throughout 2023, we introduced several features to make Airbnb every more affordable from new pricing tools for hosts to increased pricing transparency for guests. Since launching these features, we've seen 1.4 million hosts use similar listings, which lets host compare to price or listing to others in the area. Nearly 300,000 listings have removed or lowered their cleaning fee. And by year-end, nearly 40% of our active listings didn't charge a cleaning fee at all. So our work around affordability is paying off. In December, the average nightly price of a 1-bedroom listing on Airbnb was $114 [ph] a night. This is down 2% from the same period last year, while hotel prices rose 7% to $149 over the same period. Now before I turn to Q&A, I want to share the latest on two executive updates we announced at the end of last year. To start, Dave Stephenson is now Airbnb's first Chief Business Officer. Over the past 5 years, Dave has done an incredible job as CFO, and our business is stronger than ever. One of the qualities that is so remarkable about Dave is that he's not just a world-class finance leader. He's also a world class operator. And whenever I need someone to quickly drive a complicated series of operations together to clear outcome that doesn't compromise our values, I turn to Dave. As we expand beyond our core, it will be paramount to have an executive dedicated to our long-term growth plans, and there is nobody better than Dave to do this. Dave will continue to drive growth across existing and new businesses, and this includes driving international expansion, growing global host supply and leading all business and corporate development activities at Airbnb. Now as Dave takes on this position, I am thrilled that Ellie Mertz will be our CFO. You see Ellie has been my right hand for 11 years, and many of you already know here and are well aware of impressive track record at Airbnb. She led our IPO during one of the most pivotal moments in our company's history. And for the past several years, Ellie has overseen Strategic Finance and Analysis, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. And under her leadership, our company grew from adolescent to adulthood with revenue growing over 100x. I am thrilled that she's stepping into this role. Dave has already started as Chief Business Officer; and Ellie will officially transition to CFO on March 1. So next call, you will hear from Ellie. Before we go to questions, I'd just love to hand over to David to share a few thoughts. Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Thanks, Brian. I'm really excited about my new role as Chief Business Officer. In this role, I'm focused on driving Airbnb's growth by concentrating in three specific areas. First, continuing to grow our high-quality supply of stays and experiences around the world; second, leading our global expansion efforts in underpenetrated countries; and third, developing and launching new businesses as we expand beyond the core. As Brian has said, this is a transformational year for Airbnb. I look forward to Ellie becoming our CFO next month. I couldn't think of a better person to lead us into the next phase of growth. And so with that, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. Your line is open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question, Dave. Congrats on the role and Ellie to you as well. Brian, I wanted to ask a little bit more on just expanding beyond the core. I think you said now is the time to do it and stay tuned towards the end of the year. But then you also talked about being a leader in personalized AI. Can you just give us a little more insight on how you're thinking about AI given the acquisition of GamePlanner? And then as we think about these newer underpenetrated markets, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, talk to us about just lessons learned from, call it, Germany, Korea, Brazil that you can apply to these newer markets? Thank you.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, absolutely, Ron. Thanks for asking the question. So let me start with AI. So I think to talk about AI, it would be good to zoom out, just lay out the landscape. One way to think about AI is let's use a real-world metaphor. I mentioned we're building a city. And in that city, we have infrastructure like roads and bridges. And then on top of those roads to bridges, we have applications like cars. So Airbnb is not an infrastructure company. Infrastructure would be a large language model or obviously, GPUs. So we're not going to be investing in infrastructure. So we're not going to be building a large language model. We'll be relying on, obviously, open AI. Google makes a great model, meta great models. So those are really infrastructure. They're really developing infrastructure. But where we can excel is on the application layer. And I believe that we can build one of the leading and most innovative AI interfaces ever created. And maybe one way to make this real is if you were to open, say, ChatGPT or Google, though the models are very powerful, the interface is really not an AI interface. It's the same interface as the 2000s in the sense or 2010s. It's a typical classical web interface. So we feel like the models in a sense, are probably underutilized. Here's another way of saying it. Take your phone and look all the icons on your phone. Most of those apps have not fundamentally changed since the advent of generative AI. So what I think AI represents is the ultimate platform shift. We had the Internet. We had mobile, Airbnb really rose during the rise of mobile. And the thing about a platform shift, as you know, there is also a shift in power. It's a shift to behavior. And so I think this is a zero, zero ballgame, where Airbnb, we have a platform that was built for one vertical, short-term space. And I think with AI, generative AI and developing a leading AI interface to provide experience that's so much more personalized than anything you've ever seen before. Imagine an app that you feel like knows you. It's like the ultimate concierge, an interface that is adaptive and evolving and changing in real time, unlike no interface you've ever seen before. That would allow us to go from a single vertical company to a cross-vertical company because one of the things that we've noticed is the largest tech companies aren't a single vertical. And we studied Amazon in the late '90s, early 2000s when they went from books to everything, or Apple when they launched the App Store. And these really large technology companies are horizontal platforms. And I think with AI and the work we're doing around AI interfaces, I think that's what you should expect us. We're not going to talk specifically on this call about the specific products and services we're going to be offering, but you will see some very big announcements later this year. And as you know, we did an acquisition of GamePlanner.AI. It was from the creator Siri. And that was just accelerating the efforts we are already endeavoring on.\nOperator: Your next question...\nRon Josey: And then...\nDavid Stephenson: Sorry...\nRon Josey: My question was...\nBrian Chesky: Yeah, more on the underpenetrated markets. So is one of the few things. First, we just need to make sure that we have great supply and great supply in specific nights. So even the subtleties of local holidays and ensuring that we're there, that we have it at all price points. Different countries have different expectations on what the supply growth looks like. And then just make sure we have the right product. Things like we've done include installment payments in Brazil and Latin America, Naver Login in Korea. Just making sure that we're showing up locally in the ways that they're expecting. And then the third is just to make sure we have a full funnel marketing approach. In some of these countries, we're now big enough where we can have a small team do a very targeted social marketing, PR, communications, use influencers, search engine marketing, but build that on top of brand marketing to have that all work together in one full funnel approach. Approximately 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid because the majority of Airbnb stays are unique to us. And that continues to drive the flywheel. But having this full funnel approach is very effective when we implement it on the ground in these countries.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I was curious how the building blocks of sort of the way you're thinking about the macro environment and the idiosyncratic growth the company sort of is looking at for Q1, driven by elements of both supply and demand? And what do you see as sort of the exit dynamics from 2023? Thanks so much.\nBrian Chesky: So again, what we saw exiting 2023 was interesting, right? When we were on this call a quarter ago, we've seen some softness in demand in October. And then what we - and so we guided to that kind of expectation. And then what we saw is accelerating demand in November and December. And then as we come into - from that strength, 17% kind of revenue growth and 12% nights growth in the fourth quarter, we're seeing really stable demand coming at the start of the year. You have to actually rewind the tapes and remind yourself that we were just exiting kind of Omicron and there's a lot of pent up demand in January of last year, which makes for some harder comps in Q1, but against those harder comps, we continue to see strong demand for travel. I think that we continue to see a very robust demand for people staying on Airbnbs versus just necessarily kind of buying other things. So the experiences over things continues to be a big trend. And we're excited to see the growth that we're continuing to see in our established businesses in North America and Europe and even greater growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. So as we do things, as I said on the last question about doubling down and making sure that we invest in these expansion countries where we're underpenetrated, I think that's going to continue to drive growth for us for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson from KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJustin Patterson: Hi. Thank you very much. There's been a lot of investor interest around the cross-currency fee. How should we think about that phasing in over the course of the year and the potential financial impact from that? And then further, could you talk about just why you viewed now is the right time to pull that lever? So maybe this is a sign that you'll take pricing actions where there's a value disconnect more regularly than in the past? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. To be clear, when we announced this recently, we updated our terms of service. And what it did is it gives us the ability to implement across currency fee. So we needed to update the terms of service just to allow us to do it. Now the fee only applies when the currency of the guest uses to pay differs from the currency that the host set for their listening. So we don't anticipate this fee to affect the majority of our guests because the cross currency transactions are only approximately 20% of our gross booking value. It's different than our cross-border, which is closer to 40%. And we anticipate the majority of the fee changes to be closer to 1%. So we're going to test and evaluate and just see what the results are, and that testing will begin in April. Why now? There's just a point where we understand that the size and complexity of our business ensures that we should be making sure we're providing great value to our guests and our host. We do things like last year, we had a change to our long-term stay fees for beyond 3 months. That was an opportunity where we saw that maybe the fees were too high relative to the benefit we're giving. I think there's just a fundamental principle where we want to make sure that we're giving more value to our guests and our hosts than we take in our take rate over time, and we're going to continue to be more nuanced in how we make those choices going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. One big picture and one sort of accounting. So big picture one, you guys have made a lot of interesting changes to the U.S. around I'm flexible [ph] and new tools for host, et cetera. Brian, can you just sort of talk to us about areas of progress you've made on improving conversion or getting host to lower prices in the U.S.? And sort of what are the existing hurdles you have to overcome to kind of get power host and host to kind of lower prices more in the U.S.? And the second one, on Dave or Ellie. There's a lot of moving pieces around this 1Q guide. If we're sort of thinking through gross bookings versus revenue, and we're getting to room night growth in sort of the mid to high to single digits, is that right? Or are there sort of other moving pieces that we're missing around the room night growth calculation? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Why don't I start, Brian? So you could think of probably like 3 really big buckets of work that are going to drive conversion of Airbnb. One is our work on affordability. The next is really product optimization. And the third is really quality and reliability. So let me talk about all 3, and I'll start with affordability. A couple of years ago, we noticed that there was quite a lot of, call it, a feedback we're getting from our guests that Airbnb was getting more expensive. And so last year, we really hunkered down and rolled out a suite of tools for guests and host to make Airbnb more affordable. Starting with total price display, where you now can turn on a toggle and see the total price upfront, including taxes and cleaning fees and services. Now this tool is really important because now we are pushing more demand to listings at better prices. We've also seen some really positive knock-on effects. For example, 300,000 listings have now reduced or eliminated their cleaning fee and 40% of listing go [ph] we don't even have a cleaning fee. The next thing we did is we encourage more hosting to provide discounts for weekly or monthly stays. As you know, 19% of our month - of our nights are monthly stays and more than 40% are weekly. Well, now two out of three hosts have a monthly or a weekly discount. So this has been a huge, huge improvement. And we also launched a product called Compare listings. One of the things we noticed is that hosts are more likely to have a competitive price if they see what other similar listings are charging in their neighborhood and then they can see whether they're getting booked or not. Well, since we rolled out that tool, 1.4 million hosts have turned the tool on, and this means they'll provide more competitive listing. The result of which, Brian, is that our prices year-over-year for one bedroom apartment globally are down 2% where hotels are up 7%. That's a 9% swing. The next is product optimization. Here's a simple way to think about it. We did $9.9 billion of revenue last year. So let's round that to $10 billion for really simple numbers. All we have to do is increase our nights booked by 100 basis points, and that's $100 million of revenue. And if we can increase $100 million of revenue, it'd be $100 million of very like high-margin revenue because we're converting presumably traffic we already have on the website. And so there's a number of things we're doing on product compensation to increase conversion rate. One of the big things, as you noticed, is I'm flexible, here's a simple way to think about it. We are never close to sold out in Airbnb. If we can just point demand where we have supply by getting people to be more flexible off their dates or a little more flexible off their radius or the location, that'd be massive. We also made some optimization to get more people to download our app. And now we are very typically a top 50 application in the United States and now 55% of our bookings are now on a native application. So those are some of things that non-profit [ph] product limitation. The last thing I'll talk about is reliability. We launched Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites, the reason we launched this is for every person who stays in a hotel, 9 people stay in an Airbnb - sorry, for every person who stays in Airbnb, 9 people stay in a hotel. What if we could get just one of those people who stays in a hotel to stay in an Airbnb? We would quite literally double the size of our business. So when you ask people book hotels, why they don't book Airbnbs, there's two reasons. One, well, it's habitual. They've always booked hotels. And the other is they are comforted by the reliability, the consistency of the hotel experience. And we asked, what if we had a product that was as consistent as a hotel from a quality standpoint, but had all the unique advantage of the Airbnb? It was more affordable, it was more unique with more character, and it was better equipped. And that's exactly what Guest Favorites are. They're 2 million of the best listings on Airbnb based on rating, review and reliability data on 500 million trips in Airbnb. Since we launched that product in November, we are seeing a shift in bookings towards Guest Favorites. That's of course good because number one, they get fewer customer service contacts, so customer service costs go down, they have this higher five star rating trips, so we have better repeat bookings. And we think this will attract people to Airbnb that never considered us before. So those are just some of the things we're doing. The last thing I'll say before I hand it over to Dave, is that, that's just what we did last year. We had 200 - about 200 upgrades last year, 430 in the last 3 years, but we are just getting started, and we're going to have significantly larger upgrades this year. Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: In terms of the Q1 guide on room nights growth, again, I think you have to remember that we have a hard comp versus Q1 of '23, where there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of the holidays and we saw much stronger growth in early in the year, especially in January. I think the other thing that's unusual about Q1 this year is Easter moved from Q2 to Q1. So this actually helps our revenue by 100 to 200 basis points in Q1, but actually is a drag on nights because we actually get fewer nights booked in the period as people are actually doing the traveling on holiday. So it will shift some nights from Q1 to Q2. So revenue is a little bit helped Q2 to Q1 and bookings nights booked are slightly hurt Q1 to Q2 and then don't forget the hard comp. So this is why we have the language of moderating from 12% growth in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks so much for taking the question, Ellie, can you just help us understand the commentary on EBITDA a little bit better for '24 or the incremental investments that could drag on the margins. Is that primarily about expanding beyond the core and tied to some of the new initiatives that Brian talked about that we'll learn about later this year? Or is that more around marketing or just something around kind of the existing business? Thanks.\nEllie Mertz: Thanks, Doug. I was actually going to start next quarter, but thanks for pointing it to me. So what you saw in the guidance language that we provided is that we are basically giving ourselves a floor in terms of the 4 year [ph] EBITDA margin guidance. As we said, we will hold or provide a minimum of 35%, which is slightly down from what we delivered in 2023. The intent here is really to ensure that we have flexibility over the course of the year to continue to invest in a variety of growth opportunities as they appear. So what might those be? So first, we have a pretty robust budget in terms of our international expansion, but there's certainly opportunities at the margin to continue to invest in newer markets. Second, there's always opportunities in terms of looking at our high ROI marketing channels and adding marginally at the top. Third, what we note, given the ambitions around our product development road map is that obviously often constrained by our resources there. And so we may look to add incremental product resources to increase the throughput of our overall product team. And then finally, obviously, we haven't said much with regard to what the platform extensions will look like in the back of the year, but we also want to give ourselves flexibility there to ensure that we're able to share something broadly and meaningful by the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. Just want to ask about room nights. We all know there's a tough comp in Q1, but - and that was partially due to the reopening. But we're kind of over COVID now. And just kind of thinking about where you are in the room night cycle going forward? And what are the key drivers for nights? Is it growing supply and just getting that conversion level better. The big picture just saying, it looks like a tough comp in Q1, but how do you think about the rest of the year and where nights can grow over the medium term? Thank you.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Again, we are starting to see overall kind of demand normalize. I think you also look at our nights growth and the nights on Airbnb and to continue to see that we take share of overall accommodations globally versus kind of traditional accommodations and are either equaling or exceeding versus our key competition. So I think if you just look at room nights growth, we continue to see strength relative to traditional hospitality and our competition. And you're exactly right. The key focus is on supply. There's been a lot of critique around whether or not we have sufficient supply growth. I hope that we continue to show that strength with the 7.7 million active listings, they're growing 18% year-over-year. We saw incredible strength throughout the year, 5 million hosts. The vast majority of this listings being unique to Airbnb. And I think that, that uniqueness also gives us a lot of strength on, as you say, conversion and a lot of things that Brian talked about, in terms of perfecting price, making it easier to shop and find the right home for each guest is incredibly important. So perfecting the core service is there. And then the last piece, which we've also talked about is just finding the areas where we are underpenetrated relative to where the opportunity is. And I think that's the vast majority of countries around the world. And when we make sure to apply a product view, a marketing view, as supply view in a targeted way in each country, we're unlocking incremental growth. And that's what we've seen why Brazil has nearly doubled since 2019. So yes, it's supply, it's product, it's full funnel marketing, and it's doubling down in underpenetrated countries.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks so much. I had a follow up on the margin question. Could you give any more color on your kind of initial thinking for the year on growing headcount and also how you're thinking about the marketing plan to support the growth initiatives that you talked about?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. In terms of headcount, we grew headcount last year about 1%. We're planning to grow at maybe slightly more than that. It could be kind of mid single digits, low to mid single-digit percent. As kind of Ellie mentioned, I think we will see depending on what our product development needs are, but it's not going to be above overall kind of revenue growth. And then in terms of marketing, margin, we're going to keep marketing costs as a percentage of revenue largely the same as what it was in 2023. In some ways, we probably could see additional leverage on marketing, but what we've seen is such great success with our brand marketing efforts in our core markets. We're actually expanding to 20 countries around the world. So that's already included in this. And then we'll see as there are other investments to support the newer business areas. But to the extent that there may be any incremental marketing, it's not going to be a materially larger percentage of revenue than it was last year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: Hi. Can you maybe spend some time talking through sort of the competitive dynamics and your expectations for the competitive set in the U.S. in 2024, particularly as some of your larger competitors look to lean into share gains. Are any of these investments aimed at holding share or any of this type of investments sort of aimed at defending share against a more competitive environment? Thanks so much.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, we're going to continue to do what we're doing well, which is have unique supply that is outgrowing any of our competitors. And I think that by having that, we were able to drive kind of incremental nights and take share from both traditional hospitality and our competitors. I know competitors are trying to come in to North America and take - try to take additional share. It's not what we're seeing. We're not seeing success there. We're seeing that a lot of the competition is focused on professional host supply, which is undifferentiated and often cross listed. And I think the differentiated supply that we were able to bring on has been a material kind of net benefit to us. So that's where the strength we're seeing.\nBrian Chesky: And I'll just add that, we have a lot of competition for people choosing places to stay. Our main competition are hotels, first of all. And we're so much smaller than hotels. For everyone who stays at Airbnb, nine people stay in a hotel. So I think the bigger opportunities for us to take market share, because again, all you need is one of them to come to Airbnb and we've now doubled the size of our business. I think we are only scratching the surface. We grew in every region. We maintained or grew share in every region. As Dave said, we have - we are the brand in this category, a noun and a verb used all over the world. We are the only ones with a custom built platform. And we're going to continue to strengthen our advantages, including like Guest Favorites, the only one to offer that. The only one to offer custom built tools on the host side. So the best game we can play is to continue to focus on executing ruthlessly. And if we continue to do that, we're going to continue to take share.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple - just one. Can you talk about how we think - we should think about demand and supply starting to converge? I know you've had great supply growth up 18%. Should we start to see room nights catch up to that demand? And then can you just give us an update on the how for the U.S. short-term rental market, how you're thinking about that going into this year after what was the softness in a lot of those core vacation rental destinations last year? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So why don't I just start, Jed, I'm talking about supply growth, and I'll let Dave answer the rest. I believe in the long run that supply growth is a long-term indication of growth in Airbnb. And it's been healthy since we started the company, but you'll know that during the pandemic, one of the biggest questions I got asked when supply growth stops is how we're going to restart supply growth. The great thing about our supply growth is that most of it comes organic to us. In fact, 36% of our new hosts are prior guests. That's the highest that number it's ever been. And the reason people host is because their friends typically tell them about it. The last year - actually, the year before, we actually began and we really put the throttle on it last year, a new strategic priority to mainstream hosting. And we did a few things. We really focused on making hosting easy to get started and increasing awareness. Now one of the reasons that we're so excited about the growth being 18%, and we hope it grows even faster is, as you know, the more supply you have, the more pricing pressure you relieve on the inventory. So when you're supply constrained, what you typically see is prices go up and prices go up, nice growth is typically diminished. So we believe that, again, the total addressable market for Airbnb space is every single person with very few exceptions who stay in a hotel. If we can get the right supply at the right price, then we believe we can capture that demand and build a company significantly larger. Additionally, by having a surplus of supply, we think that that will allow us to have even tighter quality control. So to answer your question, we do think that the healthy supply growth of 18% could be a great leading indicator down the road of where demand could be, and we'd love your supply to grow even faster.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I think what's also interesting is, if you actually back up and look out over multiple years, you go back 4 years or so and look at the total amount of supply growth versus the total amount of nights growth, it's actually fairly consistent. So there are times that supply leads demand and times that demand leads supply. But I think as Brian mentioned, over time, those things equalize out and the greater supply definitely helps our overall performance. I'd say in terms of U.S. very specifically, a couple of things. We're just - we're seeing overall very stable growth in the U.S. We're seeing strong inbound cross-border growth in nights. And I think unlike others that we're seeing in the U.S., we've seen very healthy growth in the non-urban markets, right? Urban markets have been traditionally our areas of strength, not only grew substantially kind of during COVID and coming out of COVID, we've continued to hold really great share and growth in the non-urban areas, and now urban is coming back stronger, and that has been our additional area of strength. Maybe a last area is our long-term stays. So 19% of our stays were 28 days or longer in the last quarter. So it was even up a little bit from 18% prior to that. I think there's been a lot of critique of, well, long-term stays, that's a post-COVID benefit that's going to go away. Well, it's still materially bigger than it was back in 2019 when it was closer to 13%, 14% of our nights growth. So we're seeing really great strength there. So that's what we're seeing in North America.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Shubsda from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nNick Jones: Hi. This is Nick Jones on. You talk a lot about focus on international expansion and then kind of underpenetrated in many of these markets, you're rolling this playbook out, I think it was Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands. Is this kind of the cadence we should expect the playbook to kind of continue to expand into additional countries, it's kind of 3 or 4 at a time? And I guess how are you balancing rolling this playbook out to more countries - to more countries with kind of these new initiatives that we're looking forward to hearing from later in 2024?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I think that's what you'll continue to see is that we're being very judicious about putting small teams on the ground in each of these locales, making sure that we have the full funnel marketing approach working well, establishing what product adjustments might be unique to a specific location that's helpful. And then we're going to - we're working down our list. What's the largest opportunity, what do we have the capabilities for and how do we kind of do it. None of these are perishable things. We're just kind of working our way down kind of a prioritized list of our capabilities. And then this sets us up well as we expand beyond on the core to make sure that we have strong, established base of business to kind of build from.\nDavid Stephenson: And I'll just add that, I think that there's some massive opportunities in front of us, especially with Asia. We really did focus on Korea, but I think the point that should be made is if you look at our penetration, and say, U.S., Australia, Canada, France and to maybe a lesser extent, United Kingdom, they're significantly higher than other parts of the world. In fact, in the United States is more than an order magnitude higher penetration than Asia. There is no reason why we cannot get to today's U.S. penetration and the equivalent penetration in most of the major tourism markets around the world. And we think we're only scratching the service in our more mature market - more mature markets. So again, we are going to continue to add these countries one by one. But the other thing is we're just getting started in Korea. We're just getting started in Germany. We're just getting started in Brazil. Brazil is now double the size it was pre-pandemic, but it's going to double again. And so we're going to continue. We have multiple phases of this playbook and the first phase is playing out in Korea, Japan and Brazil. But we're going to go on to the next phase as we continue to add more countries.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My question is about booking window. I think in 1Q last year, booking window was extended as consumer tried to lock in high prices for accommodation. And just curious what you are seeing this quarter so far. Are you seeing any differences booking window by region also? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yeah, booking window has been relatively stable. We've kind of come back to a little bit more normal booking windows over time. So there's actually not a lot to say on it. It's pretty consistent now globally as things are returning to a more normal state.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan from Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking questions. Brian, just on cross vertical when you're talking about the new product initiatives, were you meaning more of like a full OTA and thinking about cross vertical within travel? Or was this more thinking about Amazon AWS, you know, moving beyond retail to all industries? And then bringing in more first time bookers to the platform, any specific drivers there? Is that just international or anything else we should be aware of? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yeah. Hey, Bernie, I think that Airbnb can go far beyond travel in the coming years, but I think we're going to start with our core. So I think what we're going to do is start with travel and then down the road we can move beyond travel. So you should start by seeing us do the things that are the most logical extensions of what we already provide, and then we will move further and further out from our core as the things we launch are successful. And then what was the second part of the question?\nDavid Stephenson: So it's about first time bookers and what we're seeing the growth of first time bookers. I'll start, Brian. You can round it out if I miss anything. But a key part is the reliability. Making sure that they feel like we have - that the services can be reliable. So things like air cover has been an area that we've been promoting to get people comfortable on booking Airbnb. Doing things like reducing cancellations has been great. The work that we've done to make sure that prices are moderating and then just general awareness, making sure that they're aware of it, which is the full funnel marketing approach we do to a lot of these international countries. We're seeing strong strength in mobile downloads, as we highlight at the top of the call, and just overall strong organic trends across the business.\nBrian Chesky: Yeah, I mean, I'll just highlight a few things in addition to what Dave said. First of all, our traffic and our top of funnel results are really good. And one of the reasons why is, we've, number one, we're having a really successful advertising campaign. As you know, we have a very different approach to marketing than our competitors. We're not really typically trying to buy customers through foreign [ph] marketing. We generally, as Dave mentioned, have a full funnel approach and we think of advertising more as education than sales. And one of the things we noticed was that we want to educate people about how there are some trips that are really just always better in Airbnb. If you're staying with - if you're traveling your family, if you're traveling your groups, be able to share a house and have your own bedroom and save money, rather than getting separate hotel rooms or crammed in one hotel room, makes complete logical sense. And so we have this campaign running, it's called Get an Airbnb, it's the most successful digital advertising campaign we've ever done, and it's now running on television. We also are tapping into the biggest moments of pop culture. Last year, for example, the Barbie movie came out, and we partnered with Mattel to turn a mansion and Malibu into Malibu Barbie DreamHouse. That became a phenomenon on social media, and it got more press, more articles than our IPO. In fact, three times as many articles were written about the Barbie Malibu DreamHouse as Airbnb's IPO, just to give you a sense. So we have a lot of traffic coming to Airbnb. We're going to continue to hopefully stay relevant within culture. And if we can then convert that traffic, as Dave said, through product optimization, reliability efforts, improve customer service, then I think there's a lot of opportunities. And again, we have an entire road map where you can imagine hundreds of basis points of conversion of a nice growth increase through some of these efforts. So we've got a pretty big arsenal of levers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Cantone from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJohn Cantone: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking across your regions, EMEA is where you've sort of seen the biggest moderation, incremental Nights and Experiences this year. I know there's some big travel markets where you're still underpenetrated like Germany and now Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. Maybe you could talk to why consumer adoption has lagged in some European markets versus others? And any key areas of investments you still need to make to help drive adoption rates higher in that market? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. We continue to see strength in our growth in our more established markets, North America and Europe. But we're actually seeing still stronger growth relatively in Latin America and Asia. And so any kind of moderation is still just coming off of high overall growth. I mean I'd say APAC we're really encouraged to see China outbound, gathering kind of additional momentum that we expect by the end of the year, China outbound travel should be above 2019 levels. So I'd say that we continue to see great strength and this international expansion playbook that we have, I think it's going to continue to be a tailwind for growth, especially in Latin America and Asia for the rest of this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nKen Gawrelski: Thank you very much. And I'm sure you'll tell us more later this year, but could you talk about how you think about either the build by our partner strategy with respect to expanding beyond the core?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, absolutely. So I think one of the great things about Airbnb is that most of our innovation in most of our business is developed organically. And that just becomes from our DNA. Like Airbnb was started by three product and then just product, people and engineers, two designers an engineer. And we created Joni [ph] and I created this company from nothing with really no capital whatsoever to speak of. So I think build and the organic growth is in our DNA, and it's always going to be our predisposition. That being said, with the scale that we have, the scale we have, having nearly 2 billion guest arrivals and more than $70 billion GBV, that is a huge asset to be able to partner. And a number of brands have reached out to us telling us they want to partner Airbnb not just because of the traffic we have, but also because of the strength of our brand. So we think that there's a myriad of opportunities of partnerships. Now on in the buy [ph] we're going to be -- we're going to have a very high bar for ROI for acquisitions. We've done a number of acquisitions in the past. Some have been very successful. And with our free cash flow, we have generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow. We absolutely have the cash and obviously, the currency of our stock to make acquisitions, but we're going to be very, very thoughtful and there's always going to be build, then partner then buy probably in that order of prioritization.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Let me try two questions. There's some discussion in your shareholder letter about take rates. Just take rates have been relatively consistent in the last couple of years. Is there any reason to think that, that pattern won't change going forward or will change going forward? Is there a reason why take rates would actually go up? And then secondly, Brian, you talked about the ability to really expand in Asia. And I don't know - and I understand the momentum that you've got in Korea. Asia, it seems like it's generally been a tough market for a lot of Internet companies that tried to expand there, and there's - China seems to be relatively off-limit. So just talk through a little bit more about why you see grounds for optimism in that region. And I know there's a lot more to Asia than just China, but I wanted to ask that question. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Mark, yes, why don't I - when we do, I'll do Asia and then Dave will take, take rate. So I mean no doubt that Internet companies have struggled in Asia. I think in particular, they struggled in China, and we do not have an inbound business, the domestic business in China any longer. Although obviously, there's a lot of stories of companies doing well in other countries in Asia. So let me just talk about why I think Airbnb is unique. The reason why, as you know, is that we're a global travel network. And so 44% of our nights booked were cross-border. And if you're in Japan and you want to stay in Germany and you don't want to stay in a hotel, then where are you going to go? You're going to want to go to a global platform, probably not a Japanese platform. And the reason is you're going to Germany from Japan, and you're not going to use a Japanese platform because the Japanese platform would have to get German homes on that platform, and that is probably not going to happen. And so we think this is a global market. There's a global network, not a regional network. And one of the things we've noticed is that Airbnb seems to work about as well in every single country that we've entered. Now there's a big question about Latin America, for example. We were massively underpenetrated. And there was a question, well, this is an emerging market, will Latin America work well? And then, of course, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru have grown very, very quickly. And we - and also I just say the success of Korea has been phenomenal. And the other thing is that the population in Asia is generally younger than the population in Europe and North America. And the other thing we know is that young people tend to gravitate more to Airbnb than older cohorts. So I just think the amount of people that are mobile applications that are young, where Airbnb [ph] they're not predisposed to book a hotel, the strength of network effects and the fact that there's going to be really strong cross-border travel in Airbnb is a cross-border network are all the reasons why I think Asia will be no different than any other region in Airbnb. It might just take a little bit more time. Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: And then, Mark, in terms of take rates, no, there should be consistent. There's no real reason why they should be going up on kind of a time-adjusted basis. We have not materially changed our pricing as a percentage of GBV when you adjust for the timing. So we are testing a cross-currency themes, as we mentioned earlier in the call, but you shouldn't count that as a major expansion of fees this year. In Q1, the implied take rate revenue over gross booking value is going to be higher, but that again, that's largely due to timing, right, a little more revenue coming in Q1 largely due to the Easter timing. So now longer term, I am excited about the opportunity for revenue driving with our experiences and services and that ability to drive incremental revenue and incremental margin. So over a longer period of time, I think our margin expansion will absolutely come from hosting guest services and experiences. But here in the short term, there's no real change on time-adjusted basis towards these.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Brignall from Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\nAlex Brignall: Good evening. Thank you very much for taking the question. First one would just be on the Q1 guide. Just trying to understand what you're implying on the take rate expansion because there's obviously one comment which is Easter timing, which is 1% to 2% of revenue, but it seems like the comment of notably higher take rates would be more than just 1% to 2% extra on the revenue. So if you could just piece that out and then obviously, it feeds back into the room nights. And the second one, just in terms of a little bit more detail on the cross currency. It sounds like what you're saying is that it now is another lever that you have, which is fantastic, but it's something that you're going to test with. Is there an amount of friction that you expect when you add it, do people have the chance to not pay the fee, where will it be displayed to consumers? And your last comment, Dave, on the take rate not expanding, but presumably, that means that in terms of its contribution to take rate, it's going to be relatively immaterial? Thank you so much.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. So the two areas. The reason why we say the particular expansion in Q1 is because there's a double hit. You have the increased revenue in Q1 due to the timing and you have decreased gross booking value that shifts from Q1 to Q2. So both increased revenue and decreased gross booking values in the period by some amount, say, 100 to 200 basis points, and then you get that greater expansion of fees, revenue over gross booking values. So that's why we give the guidance that way. Yes, in terms of cross country - cross currency, we're going to be tough here. We'll be launching in April. We need to understand what the impact is to demand overall. I mean, if you step back to it, it's actually a unique capability that the vast majority of other platforms either don't have or they charge a substantial premium for. So we've been largely giving away this benefit for no incremental costs, and we were just monitoring and have the capability of adjusting that fee if we so choose, and we will - but we'll be mindful about it to make sure that we're thoughtful in terms of the impact on overall demand.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Chesky for some closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Just to recap, revenue was another incredibly strong quarter. Revenue was $2.2 billion, 70% higher. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA were both to Q4 records and our trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.8 billion. And this, of course, represents a free cash flow margin at 39%. I'm really proud of what we've been able to accomplish this past year, and there's more to come. 2024 marks the beginning of a new chapter for Airbnb, and I look forward to sharing more throughout the year. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.+",

            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. I'm really excited about my new role as Chief Business Officer. In this role, I'm focused on driving Airbnb's growth by concentrating in three specific areas. First, continuing to grow our high-quality supply of stays and experiences around the world; second, leading our global expansion efforts in underpenetrated countries; and third, developing and launching new businesses as we expand beyond the core. As Brian has said, this is a transformational year for Airbnb. I look forward to Ellie becoming our CFO next month. I couldn't think of a better person to lead us into the next phase of growth. And so with that, let's open up the call for Q&A. Yes, absolutely, Ron. Thanks for asking the question. So let me start with AI. So I think to talk about AI, it would be good to zoom out, just lay out the landscape. One way to think about AI is let's use a real-world metaphor. I mentioned we're building a city. And in that city, we have infrastructure like roads and bridges. And then on top of those roads to bridges, we have applications like cars. So Airbnb is not an infrastructure company. Infrastructure would be a large language model or obviously, GPUs. So we're not going to be investing in infrastructure. So we're not going to be building a large language model. We'll be relying on, obviously, open AI. Google makes a great model, meta great models. So those are really infrastructure. They're really developing infrastructure. But where we can excel is on the application layer. And I believe that we can build one of the leading and most innovative AI interfaces ever created. And maybe one way to make this real is if you were to open, say, ChatGPT or Google, though the models are very powerful, the interface is really not an AI interface. It's the same interface as the 2000s in the sense or 2010s. It's a typical classical web interface. So we feel like the models in a sense, are probably underutilized. Here's another way of saying it. Take your phone and look all the icons on your phone. Most of those apps have not fundamentally changed since the advent of generative AI. So what I think AI represents is the ultimate platform shift. We had the Internet. We had mobile, Airbnb really rose during the rise of mobile. And the thing about a platform shift, as you know, there is also a shift in power. It's a shift to behavior. And so I think this is a zero, zero ballgame, where Airbnb, we have a platform that was built for one vertical, short-term space. And I think with AI, generative AI and developing a leading AI interface to provide experience that's so much more personalized than anything you've ever seen before. Imagine an app that you feel like knows you. It's like the ultimate concierge, an interface that is adaptive and evolving and changing in real time, unlike no interface you've ever seen before. That would allow us to go from a single vertical company to a cross-vertical company because one of the things that we've noticed is the largest tech companies aren't a single vertical. And we studied Amazon in the late '90s, early 2000s when they went from books to everything, or Apple when they launched the App Store. And these really large technology companies are horizontal platforms. And I think with AI and the work we're doing around AI interfaces, I think that's what you should expect us. We're not going to talk specifically on this call about the specific products and services we're going to be offering, but you will see some very big announcements later this year. And as you know, we did an acquisition of GamePlanner.AI. It was from the creator Siri. And that was just accelerating the efforts we are already endeavoring on. Sorry... In terms of the Q1 guide on room nights growth, again, I think you have to remember that we have a hard comp versus Q1 of '23, where there was a lot of pent-up demand coming out of the holidays and we saw much stronger growth in early in the year, especially in January. I think the other thing that's unusual about Q1 this year is Easter moved from Q2 to Q1. So this actually helps our revenue by 100 to 200 basis points in Q1, but actually is a drag on nights because we actually get fewer nights booked in the period as people are actually doing the traveling on holiday. So it will shift some nights from Q1 to Q2. So revenue is a little bit helped Q2 to Q1 and bookings nights booked are slightly hurt Q1 to Q2 and then don't forget the hard comp. So this is why we have the language of moderating from 12% growth in Q4. Yes. Again, we are starting to see overall kind of demand normalize. I think you also look at our nights growth and the nights on Airbnb and to continue to see that we take share of overall accommodations globally versus kind of traditional accommodations and are either equaling or exceeding versus our key competition. So I think if you just look at room nights growth, we continue to see strength relative to traditional hospitality and our competition. And you're exactly right. The key focus is on supply. There's been a lot of critique around whether or not we have sufficient supply growth. I hope that we continue to show that strength with the 7.7 million active listings, they're growing 18% year-over-year. We saw incredible strength throughout the year, 5 million hosts. The vast majority of this listings being unique to Airbnb. And I think that, that uniqueness also gives us a lot of strength on, as you say, conversion and a lot of things that Brian talked about, in terms of perfecting price, making it easier to shop and find the right home for each guest is incredibly important. So perfecting the core service is there. And then the last piece, which we've also talked about is just finding the areas where we are underpenetrated relative to where the opportunity is. And I think that's the vast majority of countries around the world. And when we make sure to apply a product view, a marketing view, as supply view in a targeted way in each country, we're unlocking incremental growth. And that's what we've seen why Brazil has nearly doubled since 2019. So yes, it's supply, it's product, it's full funnel marketing, and it's doubling down in underpenetrated countries. Yes, we're going to continue to do what we're doing well, which is have unique supply that is outgrowing any of our competitors. And I think that by having that, we were able to drive kind of incremental nights and take share from both traditional hospitality and our competitors. I know competitors are trying to come in to North America and take - try to take additional share. It's not what we're seeing. We're not seeing success there. We're seeing that a lot of the competition is focused on professional host supply, which is undifferentiated and often cross listed. And I think the differentiated supply that we were able to bring on has been a material kind of net benefit to us. So that's where the strength we're seeing. Yes. I think what's also interesting is, if you actually back up and look out over multiple years, you go back 4 years or so and look at the total amount of supply growth versus the total amount of nights growth, it's actually fairly consistent. So there are times that supply leads demand and times that demand leads supply. But I think as Brian mentioned, over time, those things equalize out and the greater supply definitely helps our overall performance. I'd say in terms of U.S. very specifically, a couple of things. We're just - we're seeing overall very stable growth in the U.S. We're seeing strong inbound cross-border growth in nights. And I think unlike others that we're seeing in the U.S., we've seen very healthy growth in the non-urban markets, right? Urban markets have been traditionally our areas of strength, not only grew substantially kind of during COVID and coming out of COVID, we've continued to hold really great share and growth in the non-urban areas, and now urban is coming back stronger, and that has been our additional area of strength. Maybe a last area is our long-term stays. So 19% of our stays were 28 days or longer in the last quarter. So it was even up a little bit from 18% prior to that. I think there's been a lot of critique of, well, long-term stays, that's a post-COVID benefit that's going to go away. Well, it's still materially bigger than it was back in 2019 when it was closer to 13%, 14% of our nights growth. So we're seeing really great strength there. So that's what we're seeing in North America. And I'll just add that, I think that there's some massive opportunities in front of us, especially with Asia. We really did focus on Korea, but I think the point that should be made is if you look at our penetration, and say, U.S., Australia, Canada, France and to maybe a lesser extent, United Kingdom, they're significantly higher than other parts of the world. In fact, in the United States is more than an order magnitude higher penetration than Asia. There is no reason why we cannot get to today's U.S. penetration and the equivalent penetration in most of the major tourism markets around the world. And we think we're only scratching the service in our more mature market - more mature markets. So again, we are going to continue to add these countries one by one. But the other thing is we're just getting started in Korea. We're just getting started in Germany. We're just getting started in Brazil. Brazil is now double the size it was pre-pandemic, but it's going to double again. And so we're going to continue. We have multiple phases of this playbook and the first phase is playing out in Korea, Japan and Brazil. But we're going to go on to the next phase as we continue to add more countries. So it's about first time bookers and what we're seeing the growth of first time bookers. I'll start, Brian. You can round it out if I miss anything. But a key part is the reliability. Making sure that they feel like we have - that the services can be reliable. So things like air cover has been an area that we've been promoting to get people comfortable on booking Airbnb. Doing things like reducing cancellations has been great. The work that we've done to make sure that prices are moderating and then just general awareness, making sure that they're aware of it, which is the full funnel marketing approach we do to a lot of these international countries. We're seeing strong strength in mobile downloads, as we highlight at the top of the call, and just overall strong organic trends across the business. And then, Mark, in terms of take rates, no, there should be consistent. There's no real reason why they should be going up on kind of a time-adjusted basis. We have not materially changed our pricing as a percentage of GBV when you adjust for the timing. So we are testing a cross-currency themes, as we mentioned earlier in the call, but you shouldn't count that as a major expansion of fees this year. In Q1, the implied take rate revenue over gross booking value is going to be higher, but that again, that's largely due to timing, right, a little more revenue coming in Q1 largely due to the Easter timing. So now longer term, I am excited about the opportunity for revenue driving with our experiences and services and that ability to drive incremental revenue and incremental margin. So over a longer period of time, I think our margin expansion will absolutely come from hosting guest services and experiences. But here in the short term, there's no real change on time-adjusted basis towards these. Yes. So the two areas. The reason why we say the particular expansion in Q1 is because there's a double hit. You have the increased revenue in Q1 due to the timing and you have decreased gross booking value that shifts from Q1 to Q2. So both increased revenue and decreased gross booking values in the period by some amount, say, 100 to 200 basis points, and then you get that greater expansion of fees, revenue over gross booking values. So that's why we give the guidance that way. Yes, in terms of cross country - cross currency, we're going to be tough here. We'll be launching in April. We need to understand what the impact is to demand overall. I mean, if you step back to it, it's actually a unique capability that the vast majority of other platforms either don't have or they charge a substantial premium for. So we've been largely giving away this benefit for no incremental costs, and we were just monitoring and have the capability of adjusting that fee if we so choose, and we will - but we'll be mindful about it to make sure that we're thoughtful in terms of the impact on overall demand."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am excited to share our results with you. We wrapped 2023 with another strong quarter. We had 99 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q4, marking our highest fourth quarter ever. Revenue of $2.2 billion grew 70% year-over-year. Net loss was $249 million. But when excluding nonrecurring tax items, adjusted net income was $489 million, representing an adjusted net income margin of 22%. For the full year, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion, our highest ever. Because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we repurchased $2.25 billion of our shares during 2023. And I'm excited to announce that today, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $6 billion of our Class A common stock. Our strong results in 2023 were driven by our focus on 3 strategic priorities, making hosting mainstream, perfecting our first service and expanding beyond the core. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We've been focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling in Airbnb. Our results show that our approach is working. In Q4, our host community grew to 5 million hosts around the globe. Active listings exceeded $7.7 million by the end of 2023, increasing 18% year-over-year. And we also saw sustained double-digit supply growth across all regions. All in all, in 2023, host earned more than $57 billion. This year, we are going to continue to raise awareness from hosting and improve the overall host experience. Second, we're perfecting our core service. Over the past 3 years, we've launched more than 430 new features and upgrades to our core service. We've made significant improvements to make Airbnb a more affordable and reliable option, and we are already seeing a positive impact. For example, post cancellations have decreased by 36% in Q4 of 2023, and this is compared to the same period a year ago. And now two thirds of our host offer a weekly or monthly discount. We will never stop perfecting our core service. In the year ahead, we'll remain focused on improving the quality and reliability of stays. Finally, we are expanding beyond the core. Airbnb is at an inflection point. We spent the last 3 years perfecting our core service, and we are now ready to embark on our next chapter. We're focused on unlocking more growth opportunities by investing in underpenetrated international markets, and we're seeing some great results. Following the success that we've seen in recent quarters in Germany, Brazil and Korea, we're now rolling out our playbook in other countries, including Switzerland, Belgium and Netherlands. But this is only one piece of a much bigger strategy because we've always believed that Airbnb was destined to offer more than just a place to stay. And now is the time for us to expand beyond our core business and reinvent Airbnb. And there are a few reasons why. I mean, first, we want people to love our core service before offering them something new. And with hundreds of improvements we made over the past 3 years, the Airbnb service is now better than it's ever been. Second, we've been able to attract some of the best talent in the world, and we now have the capabilities to do so much more. And third, there is a new platform shift with AI, and it will allow us to do things we never could have imagined. While we've been using AI across our service for years, we believe we can become a leader in developing some of the most innovative and personalized AI interfaces in the world. In November, we accelerated our efforts with the acquisition of GamePlanner.AI, a stealth AI company led by the Co-Founder and original developer of Siri. With these critical pieces in place, we're now ready to expand beyond our core business. Now this will be a multiyear journey, and we will share more with you towards the end of this year. Now looking back on Q4, we also saw a number of very positive business highlights. First, we surpassed 5 million hosts in the platform and saw meaningful supply growth across all regions. We added nearly 1.2 million listings in 2023, ending the year with over 7.7 million active listings. Q4 supply growth grew 18% year-over-year. Now this is a real highlight. And we saw the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. So obviously, there's a real strong network effect happening here. We also continue to see relatively similar supply growth among individual and professional hosts with the majority of these listings exclusive to Airbnb. Now second, we continue to see strong demand on Airbnb. Now this is especially true amongst first-time bookers, which is particularly encouraging. Nights and Experiences Booked grew 12% compared to a year ago and following some volatile in October, Nights Booked actually accelerated throughout the remainder of the quarter, and Q4 also marked the highest quarterly growth rate of the year for first-time bookers. And additionally, we also gained momentum in app downloads and app bookings. 55% of gross Nights Booked were on our app. This is up from 50% a year ago. And finally, we're driving affordability for guests. Throughout 2023, we introduced several features to make Airbnb every more affordable from new pricing tools for hosts to increased pricing transparency for guests. Since launching these features, we've seen 1.4 million hosts use similar listings, which lets host compare to price or listing to others in the area. Nearly 300,000 listings have removed or lowered their cleaning fee. And by year-end, nearly 40% of our active listings didn't charge a cleaning fee at all. So our work around affordability is paying off. In December, the average nightly price of a 1-bedroom listing on Airbnb was $114 [ph] a night. This is down 2% from the same period last year, while hotel prices rose 7% to $149 over the same period. Now before I turn to Q&A, I want to share the latest on two executive updates we announced at the end of last year. To start, Dave Stephenson is now Airbnb's first Chief Business Officer. Over the past 5 years, Dave has done an incredible job as CFO, and our business is stronger than ever. One of the qualities that is so remarkable about Dave is that he's not just a world-class finance leader. He's also a world class operator. And whenever I need someone to quickly drive a complicated series of operations together to clear outcome that doesn't compromise our values, I turn to Dave. As we expand beyond our core, it will be paramount to have an executive dedicated to our long-term growth plans, and there is nobody better than Dave to do this. Dave will continue to drive growth across existing and new businesses, and this includes driving international expansion, growing global host supply and leading all business and corporate development activities at Airbnb. Now as Dave takes on this position, I am thrilled that Ellie Mertz will be our CFO. You see Ellie has been my right hand for 11 years, and many of you already know here and are well aware of impressive track record at Airbnb. She led our IPO during one of the most pivotal moments in our company's history. And for the past several years, Ellie has overseen Strategic Finance and Analysis, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. And under her leadership, our company grew from adolescent to adulthood with revenue growing over 100x. I am thrilled that she's stepping into this role. Dave has already started as Chief Business Officer; and Ellie will officially transition to CFO on March 1. So next call, you will hear from Ellie. Before we go to questions, I'd just love to hand over to David to share a few thoughts. Dave? Yeah, more on the underpenetrated markets. So is one of the few things. First, we just need to make sure that we have great supply and great supply in specific nights. So even the subtleties of local holidays and ensuring that we're there, that we have it at all price points. Different countries have different expectations on what the supply growth looks like. And then just make sure we have the right product. Things like we've done include installment payments in Brazil and Latin America, Naver Login in Korea. Just making sure that we're showing up locally in the ways that they're expecting. And then the third is just to make sure we have a full funnel marketing approach. In some of these countries, we're now big enough where we can have a small team do a very targeted social marketing, PR, communications, use influencers, search engine marketing, but build that on top of brand marketing to have that all work together in one full funnel approach. Approximately 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid because the majority of Airbnb stays are unique to us. And that continues to drive the flywheel. But having this full funnel approach is very effective when we implement it on the ground in these countries. So again, what we saw exiting 2023 was interesting, right? When we were on this call a quarter ago, we've seen some softness in demand in October. And then what we - and so we guided to that kind of expectation. And then what we saw is accelerating demand in November and December. And then as we come into - from that strength, 17% kind of revenue growth and 12% nights growth in the fourth quarter, we're seeing really stable demand coming at the start of the year. You have to actually rewind the tapes and remind yourself that we were just exiting kind of Omicron and there's a lot of pent up demand in January of last year, which makes for some harder comps in Q1, but against those harder comps, we continue to see strong demand for travel. I think that we continue to see a very robust demand for people staying on Airbnbs versus just necessarily kind of buying other things. So the experiences over things continues to be a big trend. And we're excited to see the growth that we're continuing to see in our established businesses in North America and Europe and even greater growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. So as we do things, as I said on the last question about doubling down and making sure that we invest in these expansion countries where we're underpenetrated, I think that's going to continue to drive growth for us for the rest of the year. Yes. To be clear, when we announced this recently, we updated our terms of service. And what it did is it gives us the ability to implement across currency fee. So we needed to update the terms of service just to allow us to do it. Now the fee only applies when the currency of the guest uses to pay differs from the currency that the host set for their listening. So we don't anticipate this fee to affect the majority of our guests because the cross currency transactions are only approximately 20% of our gross booking value. It's different than our cross-border, which is closer to 40%. And we anticipate the majority of the fee changes to be closer to 1%. So we're going to test and evaluate and just see what the results are, and that testing will begin in April. Why now? There's just a point where we understand that the size and complexity of our business ensures that we should be making sure we're providing great value to our guests and our host. We do things like last year, we had a change to our long-term stay fees for beyond 3 months. That was an opportunity where we saw that maybe the fees were too high relative to the benefit we're giving. I think there's just a fundamental principle where we want to make sure that we're giving more value to our guests and our hosts than we take in our take rate over time, and we're going to continue to be more nuanced in how we make those choices going forward. Yes. Why don't I start, Brian? So you could think of probably like 3 really big buckets of work that are going to drive conversion of Airbnb. One is our work on affordability. The next is really product optimization. And the third is really quality and reliability. So let me talk about all 3, and I'll start with affordability. A couple of years ago, we noticed that there was quite a lot of, call it, a feedback we're getting from our guests that Airbnb was getting more expensive. And so last year, we really hunkered down and rolled out a suite of tools for guests and host to make Airbnb more affordable. Starting with total price display, where you now can turn on a toggle and see the total price upfront, including taxes and cleaning fees and services. Now this tool is really important because now we are pushing more demand to listings at better prices. We've also seen some really positive knock-on effects. For example, 300,000 listings have now reduced or eliminated their cleaning fee and 40% of listing go [ph] we don't even have a cleaning fee. The next thing we did is we encourage more hosting to provide discounts for weekly or monthly stays. As you know, 19% of our month - of our nights are monthly stays and more than 40% are weekly. Well, now two out of three hosts have a monthly or a weekly discount. So this has been a huge, huge improvement. And we also launched a product called Compare listings. One of the things we noticed is that hosts are more likely to have a competitive price if they see what other similar listings are charging in their neighborhood and then they can see whether they're getting booked or not. Well, since we rolled out that tool, 1.4 million hosts have turned the tool on, and this means they'll provide more competitive listing. The result of which, Brian, is that our prices year-over-year for one bedroom apartment globally are down 2% where hotels are up 7%. That's a 9% swing. The next is product optimization. Here's a simple way to think about it. We did $9.9 billion of revenue last year. So let's round that to $10 billion for really simple numbers. All we have to do is increase our nights booked by 100 basis points, and that's $100 million of revenue. And if we can increase $100 million of revenue, it'd be $100 million of very like high-margin revenue because we're converting presumably traffic we already have on the website. And so there's a number of things we're doing on product compensation to increase conversion rate. One of the big things, as you noticed, is I'm flexible, here's a simple way to think about it. We are never close to sold out in Airbnb. If we can just point demand where we have supply by getting people to be more flexible off their dates or a little more flexible off their radius or the location, that'd be massive. We also made some optimization to get more people to download our app. And now we are very typically a top 50 application in the United States and now 55% of our bookings are now on a native application. So those are some of things that non-profit [ph] product limitation. The last thing I'll talk about is reliability. We launched Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites, the reason we launched this is for every person who stays in a hotel, 9 people stay in an Airbnb - sorry, for every person who stays in Airbnb, 9 people stay in a hotel. What if we could get just one of those people who stays in a hotel to stay in an Airbnb? We would quite literally double the size of our business. So when you ask people book hotels, why they don't book Airbnbs, there's two reasons. One, well, it's habitual. They've always booked hotels. And the other is they are comforted by the reliability, the consistency of the hotel experience. And we asked, what if we had a product that was as consistent as a hotel from a quality standpoint, but had all the unique advantage of the Airbnb? It was more affordable, it was more unique with more character, and it was better equipped. And that's exactly what Guest Favorites are. They're 2 million of the best listings on Airbnb based on rating, review and reliability data on 500 million trips in Airbnb. Since we launched that product in November, we are seeing a shift in bookings towards Guest Favorites. That's of course good because number one, they get fewer customer service contacts, so customer service costs go down, they have this higher five star rating trips, so we have better repeat bookings. And we think this will attract people to Airbnb that never considered us before. So those are just some of the things we're doing. The last thing I'll say before I hand it over to Dave, is that, that's just what we did last year. We had 200 - about 200 upgrades last year, 430 in the last 3 years, but we are just getting started, and we're going to have significantly larger upgrades this year. Dave? Yes. In terms of headcount, we grew headcount last year about 1%. We're planning to grow at maybe slightly more than that. It could be kind of mid single digits, low to mid single-digit percent. As kind of Ellie mentioned, I think we will see depending on what our product development needs are, but it's not going to be above overall kind of revenue growth. And then in terms of marketing, margin, we're going to keep marketing costs as a percentage of revenue largely the same as what it was in 2023. In some ways, we probably could see additional leverage on marketing, but what we've seen is such great success with our brand marketing efforts in our core markets. We're actually expanding to 20 countries around the world. So that's already included in this. And then we'll see as there are other investments to support the newer business areas. But to the extent that there may be any incremental marketing, it's not going to be a materially larger percentage of revenue than it was last year. And I'll just add that, we have a lot of competition for people choosing places to stay. Our main competition are hotels, first of all. And we're so much smaller than hotels. For everyone who stays at Airbnb, nine people stay in a hotel. So I think the bigger opportunities for us to take market share, because again, all you need is one of them to come to Airbnb and we've now doubled the size of our business. I think we are only scratching the surface. We grew in every region. We maintained or grew share in every region. As Dave said, we have - we are the brand in this category, a noun and a verb used all over the world. We are the only ones with a custom built platform. And we're going to continue to strengthen our advantages, including like Guest Favorites, the only one to offer that. The only one to offer custom built tools on the host side. So the best game we can play is to continue to focus on executing ruthlessly. And if we continue to do that, we're going to continue to take share. Yes. So why don't I just start, Jed, I'm talking about supply growth, and I'll let Dave answer the rest. I believe in the long run that supply growth is a long-term indication of growth in Airbnb. And it's been healthy since we started the company, but you'll know that during the pandemic, one of the biggest questions I got asked when supply growth stops is how we're going to restart supply growth. The great thing about our supply growth is that most of it comes organic to us. In fact, 36% of our new hosts are prior guests. That's the highest that number it's ever been. And the reason people host is because their friends typically tell them about it. The last year - actually, the year before, we actually began and we really put the throttle on it last year, a new strategic priority to mainstream hosting. And we did a few things. We really focused on making hosting easy to get started and increasing awareness. Now one of the reasons that we're so excited about the growth being 18%, and we hope it grows even faster is, as you know, the more supply you have, the more pricing pressure you relieve on the inventory. So when you're supply constrained, what you typically see is prices go up and prices go up, nice growth is typically diminished. So we believe that, again, the total addressable market for Airbnb space is every single person with very few exceptions who stay in a hotel. If we can get the right supply at the right price, then we believe we can capture that demand and build a company significantly larger. Additionally, by having a surplus of supply, we think that that will allow us to have even tighter quality control. So to answer your question, we do think that the healthy supply growth of 18% could be a great leading indicator down the road of where demand could be, and we'd love your supply to grow even faster. Yes. I think that's what you'll continue to see is that we're being very judicious about putting small teams on the ground in each of these locales, making sure that we have the full funnel marketing approach working well, establishing what product adjustments might be unique to a specific location that's helpful. And then we're going to - we're working down our list. What's the largest opportunity, what do we have the capabilities for and how do we kind of do it. None of these are perishable things. We're just kind of working our way down kind of a prioritized list of our capabilities. And then this sets us up well as we expand beyond on the core to make sure that we have strong, established base of business to kind of build from. Yeah, booking window has been relatively stable. We've kind of come back to a little bit more normal booking windows over time. So there's actually not a lot to say on it. It's pretty consistent now globally as things are returning to a more normal state. Yeah. Hey, Bernie, I think that Airbnb can go far beyond travel in the coming years, but I think we're going to start with our core. So I think what we're going to do is start with travel and then down the road we can move beyond travel. So you should start by seeing us do the things that are the most logical extensions of what we already provide, and then we will move further and further out from our core as the things we launch are successful. And then what was the second part of the question? Yeah, I mean, I'll just highlight a few things in addition to what Dave said. First of all, our traffic and our top of funnel results are really good. And one of the reasons why is, we've, number one, we're having a really successful advertising campaign. As you know, we have a very different approach to marketing than our competitors. We're not really typically trying to buy customers through foreign [ph] marketing. We generally, as Dave mentioned, have a full funnel approach and we think of advertising more as education than sales. And one of the things we noticed was that we want to educate people about how there are some trips that are really just always better in Airbnb. If you're staying with - if you're traveling your family, if you're traveling your groups, be able to share a house and have your own bedroom and save money, rather than getting separate hotel rooms or crammed in one hotel room, makes complete logical sense. And so we have this campaign running, it's called Get an Airbnb, it's the most successful digital advertising campaign we've ever done, and it's now running on television. We also are tapping into the biggest moments of pop culture. Last year, for example, the Barbie movie came out, and we partnered with Mattel to turn a mansion and Malibu into Malibu Barbie DreamHouse. That became a phenomenon on social media, and it got more press, more articles than our IPO. In fact, three times as many articles were written about the Barbie Malibu DreamHouse as Airbnb's IPO, just to give you a sense. So we have a lot of traffic coming to Airbnb. We're going to continue to hopefully stay relevant within culture. And if we can then convert that traffic, as Dave said, through product optimization, reliability efforts, improve customer service, then I think there's a lot of opportunities. And again, we have an entire road map where you can imagine hundreds of basis points of conversion of a nice growth increase through some of these efforts. So we've got a pretty big arsenal of levers. Yes. We continue to see strength in our growth in our more established markets, North America and Europe. But we're actually seeing still stronger growth relatively in Latin America and Asia. And so any kind of moderation is still just coming off of high overall growth. I mean I'd say APAC we're really encouraged to see China outbound, gathering kind of additional momentum that we expect by the end of the year, China outbound travel should be above 2019 levels. So I'd say that we continue to see great strength and this international expansion playbook that we have, I think it's going to continue to be a tailwind for growth, especially in Latin America and Asia for the rest of this year. Yes, absolutely. So I think one of the great things about Airbnb is that most of our innovation in most of our business is developed organically. And that just becomes from our DNA. Like Airbnb was started by three product and then just product, people and engineers, two designers an engineer. And we created Joni [ph] and I created this company from nothing with really no capital whatsoever to speak of. So I think build and the organic growth is in our DNA, and it's always going to be our predisposition. That being said, with the scale that we have, the scale we have, having nearly 2 billion guest arrivals and more than $70 billion GBV, that is a huge asset to be able to partner. And a number of brands have reached out to us telling us they want to partner Airbnb not just because of the traffic we have, but also because of the strength of our brand. So we think that there's a myriad of opportunities of partnerships. Now on in the buy [ph] we're going to be -- we're going to have a very high bar for ROI for acquisitions. We've done a number of acquisitions in the past. Some have been very successful. And with our free cash flow, we have generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow. We absolutely have the cash and obviously, the currency of our stock to make acquisitions, but we're going to be very, very thoughtful and there's always going to be build, then partner then buy probably in that order of prioritization. Mark, yes, why don't I - when we do, I'll do Asia and then Dave will take, take rate. So I mean no doubt that Internet companies have struggled in Asia. I think in particular, they struggled in China, and we do not have an inbound business, the domestic business in China any longer. Although obviously, there's a lot of stories of companies doing well in other countries in Asia. So let me just talk about why I think Airbnb is unique. The reason why, as you know, is that we're a global travel network. And so 44% of our nights booked were cross-border. And if you're in Japan and you want to stay in Germany and you don't want to stay in a hotel, then where are you going to go? You're going to want to go to a global platform, probably not a Japanese platform. And the reason is you're going to Germany from Japan, and you're not going to use a Japanese platform because the Japanese platform would have to get German homes on that platform, and that is probably not going to happen. And so we think this is a global market. There's a global network, not a regional network. And one of the things we've noticed is that Airbnb seems to work about as well in every single country that we've entered. Now there's a big question about Latin America, for example. We were massively underpenetrated. And there was a question, well, this is an emerging market, will Latin America work well? And then, of course, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru have grown very, very quickly. And we - and also I just say the success of Korea has been phenomenal. And the other thing is that the population in Asia is generally younger than the population in Europe and North America. And the other thing we know is that young people tend to gravitate more to Airbnb than older cohorts. So I just think the amount of people that are mobile applications that are young, where Airbnb [ph] they're not predisposed to book a hotel, the strength of network effects and the fact that there's going to be really strong cross-border travel in Airbnb is a cross-border network are all the reasons why I think Asia will be no different than any other region in Airbnb. It might just take a little bit more time. Dave? All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Just to recap, revenue was another incredibly strong quarter. Revenue was $2.2 billion, 70% higher. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA were both to Q4 records and our trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.8 billion. And this, of course, represents a free cash flow margin at 39%. I'm really proud of what we've been able to accomplish this past year, and there's more to come. 2024 marks the beginning of a new chapter for Airbnb, and I look forward to sharing more throughout the year. Thank you all very much."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Elli Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Airbnb's third quarter of 2023 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I'd like to pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you, Eli and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share results with you. Q3 was another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had over 113 million Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue of $3.4 billion grew 18% year-over-year. Net income was $4.4 billion. Now this includes a onetime income tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance of $2.8 billion. But even excluding this tax benefit, adjusted net income was $1.6 billion, our highest ever and represented an adjusted net income margin of 47%. And free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $4.2 billion which is also our highest ever. And because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we repurchased over $500 million of our stock. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, we have added nearly 1 million active listings this year. Our supply grew 19% in Q3 compared to a year ago. We once again saw double-digit supply growth across all regions with the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. Urban and nonurban supply increased at nearly the same rate and we saw relatively similar supply growth among individual professional hosts with the majority of new listings exclusive to Airbnb. Second, Q3 was a record travel season on Airbnb. Nights and Experiences Booked grew 14% in Q3 compared to a year ago. We saw an acceleration of nights growth across all geographies and we are particularly encouraged by the growth of first-time bookers during Q3 and we saw more nights than ever booked in the Airbnb app with 53% of gross nights booked in the app compared to 48% in the same period last year. And finally, international expansion markets are gaining momentum. Cross-border nights book increased 17% in Q3 compared to a year ago. In Asia Pacific, our business has fully recovered to pre-pandemic level. And we're seeing significant growth in Asia Pacific markets such as Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia, all experiencing year-over-year nights growth above 30% on an origin basis. Now we've been able to achieve these results by continually making progress on our 3 strategic priorities. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We've been focused on making hosting as popular as traveling and our Q3 results show that our approach is working. We ended the quarter with the highest number of active listing and we saw strong active listings growth across all regions of the market types. And hosts are benefiting. During Q3 alone, Airbnb host earned more than $19 billion. We'll continue growing supply by raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started and improving the overall experience for a host. Second, we're reflecting our core service. We've collected millions of pieces of feedback on how to improve Airbnb. And 2 years ago, we started doing twice a year of product releases to address this feedback. And since then, we've launched more than 350 new features and upgrades across our entire service. And in the past year alone, this has included things such as improved customer service, total price display and new tools to help host set more competitive prices. These upgrades are paying off for both guests and host. For example, we redesigned our tool and we made it easier for hosts to add discounts and promotions. And now almost 2/3 the host offer weekly or monthly discount. We also added a new feature called similar listings that let hosts see listing prices in the area, so they know what to charge. And since we launched the similar-listings tool, nearly 1 million hosts have used this feature. In mid-September, we shared progress we've made to help lower cleaning fees, reduce prices and improved search and reliability. We have even more improvements coming as part of our November 8 winter release next Wednesday where we'll introduce dozens of new features aimed at making Airbnb more reliable. And finally, our third strategic priority is expand Airbnb beyond their core. Now we made significant progress in the past few years in building a strong and profitable business. And in addition to laying the foundation for new services and offerings, we've been focused on international expansion. We are investing in underpenetrated international markets and we're seeing great results. Following the success, we've seen in recent quarters in Germany and Brazil, Korea has now become one of our fastest growing countries compared to 2019 with gross nights booked 54% higher than they were in Q3 2019 on origin basis. As international travel continues to recover, we're building greater momentum for Airbnb in underpenetrated markets. So those are results for Q3. With that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: And I have 2 questions. You talked about some of these improvements you've seen in markets like Germany, Brazil and Korea. Could you just spend a little bit more time on that opportunity going forward? And is it the expectation now that Germany and Brazil are already optimized, you just keep optimizing other ones? Or is this take a while to add to monetize those? And then secondly, in terms of future services that you could offer to sellers, any update on when we could see those particularly things like sponsored listings for sellers for host, I mean.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Mark, this is Brian. I'll take it. Let's first talk about international expansion. So it's a great question. And as everyone on this recall is probably aware, Airbnb is in 220 countries in the region. So on the one hand, we're one of the most global like companies in all of travel. We're a truly global travel network. At the same time, Mark, what we've seen is that our penetration in the United States is significantly higher than our penetration in many other countries. And we think there's a huge amount of growth if we could just get Airbnb to even a fraction of the percentage of penetration that we have in the United States. So last year, we decided to roll out this updated playbook. We rolled it out in Germany and Brazil. It's kind of a four-pronged approach and involve some product optimization, PR, local marketing and just general optimizations on the ground in these regions. And what we've seen is Brazil is now double the size as it was pre-pandemic. We rolled that same playbook out to Korea. It's now 54% higher than it was before. But what I would say is we've just scratched the surface of what we can do in Germany, Brazil and Korea. I think those markets are on a good trajectory. They could be significantly larger and we're now looking at Japan and India, China, around Asia Pacific. We have some optimizations in Southeast Asia, continual growth in Mexico. There's a number of other countries in addition to a number of areas in Europe where we think we can see a lot more growth. So I think the next 24 months, we're going to see a major acceleration in our penetration in a lot of these markets. There's about a dozen, dozen half markets around the world, as you know, have large tourism opportunities and we're really focused on that. And that's going to be one of our biggest near-term expansion opportunities. With regards to future services to sellers, we don't have anything to announce right now. But what we've been doing is we've been building the foundation of our systems so that we can have these new tools and services, including sponsor listings. And we also -- recently, we've been rolling out a pilot for co-hosting. Co-hosting is a service where we match host that don't have homes but they have extra time with homeowners to have space but they don't have time to host. And we've been doing these pilots in France. We've rolled that out in parts of the United States and this is turning into a popular service that we think can unlock a lot more supply. So we're going to -- over the next couple of years, I think you're going to see a number of new services roll out for host.\nOperator: We'll go next to Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: I just have one. Brian, in a number of interviews in the quarter, you talked about potential for product road map over the longer term, different products that could probably expand elements of the platform, car rentals, maybe even long-term apartment rentals. How do you think about product evolution that's being offered to the consumers on the platform and thinking about investing behind those initiatives?\nBrian Chesky: Eric, I mean, just to step back, the last few years, I think we've really, really benefited by being focused. When the pandemic occurred, we felt like we had to hunker down, get really lean, get really focused and we went from basically a breakeven company to now a company doing obviously cash flow margins of around 44% of revenue. So we've really benefited from this focus and really benefited from focusing on our core business. To your point, Eric, I think we are now getting ready to re-expand Airbnb beyond its core. It was always our attention to do much more than just short-term housing for travelers. We're always intended to do more of that. So we're working on making Airbnb more of an extensible platform. And I think, ultimately, there are actually quite literally dozens of services, guests and hosts that we could build on top of the Airbnb system. I think a lot of it comes down to making the platform extensible so we can offer these services. I think at the end of the day, we're really thinking about are a couple of big ideas. First, I think that we are thinking about generative AI as an opportunity to reimagine much of our product category and product catalog. So if you think about how you can sell a lot of different types of products and new offerings, generative AI could be really, really powerful. It can match you in a way you've never seen before. So imagine Airbnb being almost like the ultimate travel agent as an app. We think this can unlock opportunities that we've never seen. Additionally to that, there's a lot of opportunities on both the guests side and the host side. And so we're going to be thinking through a lot of this. So you'll see hopefully some updates in the coming years.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. First one, maybe on the guide a little bit. I know there's a lot of moving pieces between the revenue comments and the ADR comments and the take rate. Just sort of wanted to confirm, are you guys sort of looking to guide room night growth in sort of the high single, low double-digit range in 4Q? Is that the right way we should be thinking about with take rate and things? And then the second one, Brian, I know you, you have a lot of innovation, you have 350 features and upgrades, etcetera. Can you just sort of give us 1 or 2 of them that you think could be most impactful to accelerate that room night growth as we go into '24 and '25?\nBrian Chesky: And Brian, sorry, are you referring to things we've already shipped or things that we're working on that we haven't shipped?\nBrian Nowak: Well, either way you want to go. Yes, if you have one that already shipped that would be great. If you have other ones you want to tell us about next week, that would be good too.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So yes, so let me -- why don't I answer the innovation and Dave, you can talk about the guide for going forward? So maybe let me talk about some things that we've already done. I can give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about next week and beyond. So we did over 50 upgrades last May. It was based on the idea that millions of customers have given us feedback, actually both guests and hosts on how to improve Airbnb and we've listened. And if I were to just call out 3 things, Brian, I would just call out 3 things would be total price display, pricing tools for host and monthly stays. So let me just go through 3 and what happened. On total price display, we rolled out total price display before taxes. This is based on popular demand. We are now the only travel app of our kind that actually does this. Since we rolled this out, 260,000 listings have removed or reduced their cleaning fees. We now have 3 million listings that do not have a cleaning fee. So we think this is working. We also think people are now being steered towards better total value on a total price, inclusive of overall cost basis. The second are pricing tools. Since we rolled out new pricing tools, about half of new listings are now offering a monthly discount. And we also have this new tool called similar listings, where you can see where other people are charging around you. And this we find has been the best way to make sure our host have competitive prices. Because host are usually surprised to discover the listings that get most bookings around them offer a better value. And it's always really hard to know what your home is worth and what you charge. And so the best thing you can do is give people transparent data. Well, 1 million people have used these tools and probably the thing I'd point to is, while this time year-over-year in September data, hotel prices are up 10%. Airbnb prices globally are only up 1%. So we are definitely moving in the right direction. Now in North America, on a mix shift in FX neutral basis, our price is actually down 3% in North America, while hotels are up towards double digits, I think. So the last thing I'd say is monthly stays. We obviously announced a bunch of updates on monthly stays, including you can pay by bank, we lowered fees after 3 months, we have the whole new really cool interface and stays for 3 months or longer are now growing nearly 20% year-over-year. So those are just 3 things we've seen. I think what we've learned is like as we listen to customers, we adapt quickly, we can drive incremental growth. As far as what's next, obviously, we don't talk about too much before it will release. I will say though, next Wednesday, we are focused on some pretty big opportunities around reliability. So this is the last thing I'll say about this. If you think about how big Airbnb is, for every person who stays in Airbnb, approximately 9 people every night stay in a hotel or about 9 bookings. The hotels are about to order magnitude bigger. And when you ask people, why do you book a hotel and not Airbnb, the number one reason they come up with is usually reliability that they know what they're going to get before they book. It kind of speaks to the strength and weakness of Airbnb that on the one hand, it's one of a kind, other hand, that one-of-a-kindness offers valuability that not every person wants. And so next week, we're going to have some new offerings that I think will make a pretty big in this. So that's what I can say. I think I'm pretty optimistic about what you'll see next week. And of course, we're already working on stuff for next May and next October releases as well. So hopefully, stay tuned.\nDavid Stephenson: And then in terms of the guidance, Brian, for the fourth quarter, we have our revenue guidance between $2.13 billion and $2.17 billion. So that's revenue growth between 12% and 14%. And remember that in Q3, our revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange is about 14%. So -- and we're not anticipating the same level of FX impact on the fourth quarter. So broadly, our revenue growth is relatively comparable between Q4 and Q3. In terms of the nights guide, we're just seeing some variability in our nights demand here early in the quarter and so we're just being cautious with that guide. And so we're not being specific on it but anticipate nights to be a few points below -- nights growth to be a few points below Q3.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Can you maybe help us think about how you guys are tracking towards expectations on occupancy or utilization moving forward? As you guys extend beyond the core into newer markets, do those markets come with occupancy or utilization headwinds that we should be thinking about? And holistically, how you guys think about how occupancy or utilization may track next year? And then, maybe just one high level one. Sticking beyond the current cycle, we've seen a lot of other remote travel models, sort of hit this low teens to high single-digit growth rate and decelerate from there or not be able to reaccelerate their business as a meaningful like. Can you maybe take a step back and help us better understand how you think that maybe Airbnb may be a little bit different than prior ratios that we've seen and could perhaps sustain sort of that double-digit revenue cadence over a longer period of time than what we're used to in the market.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Yes, you start with occupancy and I'll take the second question.\nDavid Stephenson: In terms of occupancy, we've actually seen it be pretty stable in terms of kind of on a global basis. I mean, if you actually step back, you got to remember that the vast majority of our hosts on Airbnb are individual houses. They're not looking to drive 100% occupancy of all their listings. And what they want to do is earn enough money to usually hit some certain amount of financial goals. So as we continue to grow our inventory, we're continuing to see strong occupancy levels overall. Clearly, we grew our inventory at 19% which is ahead of kind of revenue growth in the current period. But if you actually step back and look over like a 4-year period, go back all the way to 2019, the growth in our overall listings have actually been relatively similar to our overall growth in night. So that occupancy over an extended time period tends to be fairly stable while in any short-term time period, it can have a little bit more volatility. But overall, again, we don't focus on occupancy as a primary driver, we monitor it on local by local because what really matters is that we have great available listings in a specific market on a specific date.\nBrian Chesky: Lee, I'll take your second question. Yes, I think that -- as I said before, I think we're only scratching the surface to how this company becomes. And I absolutely think that we can get to really solid double-digit revenue growth for many, many years to come. And there's 3 things that I'd point out. The first is our core business. I think our core business could be significantly larger than it is today, even if we didn't do anything new. And the reason I believe this is the following: I believe that almost every single person who stays in a hotel could stay in Airbnb is, number one, they knew about all the benefits of Airbnb and number two, we made sure that our service was sufficiently reliable to be an alternative. So let me start with those 2. We've done recently a new marketing campaign that's called \"Airbnb it\". And it basically contrast the benefits of the Airbnb versus the hotel. And based on our research, one of the things we've noticed is that a lot of people stay in hotels don't understand some of the unique benefits of staying in Airbnb and why it is better for certain types of trips. And one type of trip that Airbnb is almost always better is when you're traveling with 3 or more people. If you're traveling with a family or traveling with a group, why do you want to stay in different rooms versus -- different room separated. We're having to stay at the same time. And then the only place you can meet in these crowded lobbies when you can get a whole home all to yourself. So this is -- we've been running these digital campaigns. It's the highest performing digital campaign we've ever done. And this is going to be the basis for a new -- major new marketing campaign next year. Additional to that, as I mentioned before, if we just keep focusing on reliability, making sure that when you book, you know what you're going to get and this is ever a problem, you have an excellent customer service that is nearly as good as a front desk or as good as a front desk then I think there could be in the years to come a tipping point where many people could choose Airbnb. So that's just our core business. Next is international. Even though we're in 220 countries in the region, there's only a couple of countries where we even have penetration at rivals of United States. And those countries are Canada, Australia and France. After that, U.K. a little bit, it really starts to tip down. And so we have like massive, massive opportunity and just by bringing Airbnb's playbook to these other countries. Obviously, Germany but not just Germany, like actually the entirety of Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and even Italy and Spain, basically every country but France and U.K., there are at a step change lower penetration. Latin America is a completely new market for us, emerging. Asia Pacific, I would argue it's a completely new market. We can be adding huge amounts of growth just by our expansion playbook. And then finally, yes, I mean I would say just on new products and services, though we're not disclosing anything that we're doing new right now, here's what I'd say. I think the biggest strength I have as a CEO is not driving profitability even though we've done a really good job. I think it is literally inventing new products and services. That's why we've hired so many great technologists, designers and I think this is going to be a sweet spot for us. We're obviously not going to talk about new things before we ship them but twice a year, every May and every November -- October, November, we're going to be hopefully, putting out going forward new ideas that I hope really increase the addressable market for Airbnb. And I think that we can do much more than just short-term housing. But again, I think short-term housing is still a huge opportunity for us.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: First, you caught up the greater volatility in early 4Q. Just curious if you have any view of whether that's more macro driven or geopolitical and then curious if you have a sense of kind of visibility and any kind of bookings into 2024 and perhaps maybe how that visibility compares now versus a year ago?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. It's hard to completely pin down the root cause of any kind of softness or volatility. I think it is just broadly, what we're seeing is a little bit of softness in our overall kind of demand relative to Q3, we call out kind of the macroeconomic and geopolitical just because that is what's, I think, driving any volatility that's out there. It's early. I think I am clearly confident about our revenue growth for Q4 being 12% to 14% growth. And the fact that, that remains stable with Q3, I think is really promising. Our early visibility into 2024 is -- again, it's too early to tell. I think I'm feeling great about our overall playbook and plans, as kind of Brian has mentioned. I think I am most excited about the additional efforts we're making to get greater penetration in our international markets. And overall, I'm seeing solid demand for Airbnbs, like people are still prioritizing travel over buying things so I'm very bullish in the long term.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jed Kelly at Oppenheimer & Company.\nJed Kelly: Okay, great. Can you just give us further update on the regulations you talked about in the shareholder letter. And then Google announced a new update to their vacation rentals where they're essentially letting property managers show their price. So can you talk about how you're seeing some of the changes Google is making.\nBrian Chesky: Jed, I'll take regulation. So yes, I would generally say, over the last decade, we've been really, really encouraged by the general trajectory of regulation. Here are a couple of stats. Currently today, 80% of our top 200 markets already have regulations on the books and these regulations, though they vary, generally have found workable solutions for home sharing for us to continue to grow and thrive. And I'd point out like the country of France has passed national legislation that is very, very favorable and workable. We've had cities near us like Seattle or San Diego that have passed really favorable legislation. I will probably contrast that to New York City which has completely gone a different direction. And unfortunately, I thought when we started Airbnb, we can develop model legislation in New York that we can make in New York, we can make it anywhere and that other cities have adopted legislation that New York has adopted. It turns out that's actually not the case. In fact, New York has gone a different direction and I think it's going to turn into a cautionary tale because what we're already seeing hotel price in New York are now up 8% year-over-year. A one-bedroom or a studio in New York seems to be about $500. A lot of people can't even afford to go there anymore. We are seeing work bookings in Jersey City and the perimeters around New York City. And I do anticipate more and more activity will probably go underground which is probably not the intention of the people to even pass a lot. So generally speaking, we're seeing the trend line to be generally really, really constructive. We built the city portal with the one-stop shop for cities to be able to self-serve, to be ale get data and monitor the type of activity happening in their city. We have 400 cities on the city portal. And generally, what we're seeing is that a lot of cities in pandemic or post-pandemic era have reached out to us wanting to make sure that they are able to benefit from economic dollars going to the city and we paid $9 billion in hotel tax. So generally, it's gone fairly well. It is going to be notable that if you just read the news, you're always going to seem to be reading about these cities, something happen in New York because we're in a 100,000 cities and nearly all regulations happen at the municipal level. So it's kind of a long slide to be able to work with these cities because there's so many of them and there's not a lot of standardization but generally speaking, now listed in New York, we are seeing a lot of positive developments. And then, on the Google question.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I can take this. I mean we're not going to respond directly to any kind of specific thing that Google is doing. I think if you do step back though and remember that the vast majority of host on Airbnb or individual host, approximately 90% of them, that the majority of those listings are unique to Airbnb and you can only get them here. I think that, that is one of the larger kind of defensible moats that we have which is if you want to have an amazing stay, if you want to have the unique listings, you come directly to us and we're really not seeing the impact of the competition taking additional share from us. In fact, we continue to take or increase our relative share of listings in the market, continually. And this is why we're continuing to grow at faster than the overall kind of travel market. So I don't have much more to say beyond that.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Maybe the only other thing I'd say -- maybe the only other thing Jed, I'd say is we're just seeing a lot of strength in mobile bookings. You can think of mobile bookings essentially like direct. It's not people not going to Google. 53% of our gross nights booked in the last quarter were on native mobile apps, essentially iOS and Android. And that is up from a year earlier which was less than 50%. And again, I'll just say 90% of our traffic is direct or unpaid. So we think that the strength of our brand, the strength of our app, the strength of people coming direct to Airbnb is key. And the reason it's direct is because they're inventory is unique. It's not commodities. The majority of hosts don't list anywhere else and we build customer tools for them. So that's our general theory, to build unique inventories that allow people to come direct to Airbnb. And I don't see that changing.\nOperator: We'll move next to Nick Jones at JMP Securities.\nNick Jones: Great. Brian, you talked about Airbnb's pricing, maybe not increasing or it's down while hotels are up. I mean, how do you feel about the average prices on Airbnb today? Is there still room to kind of -- if you get those lower? And I guess as you talk about some of the marketing and advertising campaigns, do you think kind of travelers or consumers view Airbnb as a premium offering, a discount offering, is the reliability kind of the trade-off. I guess can you kind of maybe paint the picture a little bit more as to kind of what you feel consumers' hesitation is to maybe book an Airbnb and how much pricing plays a role in that?\nBrian Chesky: Nick, let me start with pricing and then I'll talk about the general offering. When we started Airbnb, our original tagline was a cheap affordable alternative to a hotel. And the primary reason people chose Airbnb the early days was price. Now once they used it, we used to say money as the hook but the experience is the reason you keep coming back. Because it also turns out when you stay in Airbnbs, you're often typically in a real neighborhood, not a hotel district. You have this really cool space. You can make a meal, you have a lot more of a much more quick home. Sometimes there's a local connection to the community, that's what you're looking for. But affordability has always been one of the most important benefits that we have in Airbnb. And I do feel like we still have opportunity for our prices to be even more competitive. There's a really interesting thing we discovered. Within reason, generally, when host lower the prices, they tend to make more money. And this is typically not true of hotels, right? Because if you're running at 80% occupancy and you lower your prices per night, you typically don't have a lot more room to make up the lower prices with higher occupancy and you'll typically lose money. But many of our hosts run at low enough occupancy and they always have that if they lower the price just a bit, they can sell more nights. And so we think there's a win-win where if we continue to encourage host to offer more competitive pricing, it's a win for guests but it's also a win for many of the host. And I would also just point out that in addition to pricing tools, you need to have ample supply. Supply, I just want to highlight again, is growing 19% year-over-year. This was a huge question by the way 18 months ago. Could Airbnb re-accelerate to nearly 20% supply growth and we are approaching 20% supply growth. I think that is really, really key. So to answer your question, we've made huge progress in last year but prices are up quite significantly from pre-pandemic for Airbnb and hotels. We're both up a lot. And my hope is whether or not prices come down on Airbnb further in the next year or 2, my hope is while hotels will almost undoubtedly keep increasing year-over-year, our prices will continue to be a little bit more -- they'll be more moderated. And that goes to the next question. We actually think there's a very high correlation of relationship between ADR and night growth and the higher the ADR, typically the lower the nights growth and the lower the ADR, typically the higher the nights growth. So there's a trade-off there. And so we think that as we continue to be more affordable, we'll continue to stimulate more demand. Now the interesting thing about Airbnb is that we're not really one type of offering, right? Southwest is a budget brand. Louis Vuitton is a luxury brand. Apple is kind of like a luxury brand for like a lot of different people but they do have like premium prices. Airbnb's offering really is one of the most unique and resilient models. I mean we are one of the most popular brands for people under 30 in travel, probably the most popular band for people under 30. We're also very much a family travel brand because homes accommodate families much better than typically hotels. We're not just an urban brand. We're a rural brand and vocational brand. We're not just a North American brand. We're a global brand. So one of the things we highlighted in the public is that we literally have something for everyone. But as we continue to get more affordable, I think that's going to continue to drive a lot more growth for us.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Ron Josey at Citi.\nRon Josey: Great. Brian, I wanted to ask a little bit about your comments on first-time bookers. I'm just trying to understand a little bit more on the drivers that are attracting these new bookers. Are they doing this directly through the brand, Airbnb, through the app and just trying to understand a little bit more as you're expanding the pie and getting more supply and how users are coming to the site, point number one. And second question, just on probably with Experiences, there's any update there?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. I mean, David can feel free to jump in on this. But at the highest level, we generally are seeing that the vast majority of first-time bookers still come direct to Airbnb. So I'll just kind of step back. The number one way reason people come to Airbnb is because a friend or a family member told them about Airbnb. And so we primarily grow through word of mouth. After that, then we have a lot of earned media. We have some 500,000 to 600,000 press articles a year. I mean the share of voice of Airbnb compared to most travel companies is overwhelming. We have a greater share of voice than almost all the other major travel brands combined. We also have a huge amount of presence in social media. You might have heard a few months ago about the Barbie house rented in Airbnb or the Shrek House, so we get a lot of earned media. And then beyond that, we do these pretty big brand campaign. And the vast majority of our marketing spend that we do spend on advertising is not performance marketing, it's brand marketing. It's really marketing education around our unique product offering. So we do performance marketing but we think unlike other travel companies, it's not necessarily a way to buy customers. It's literally more like a laser that we use to hone in on balancing supply/demand and we really can use it to optimize certain markets. So a lot of it remains direct. And again, 90% of our traffic is direct or unpaid. I think that's been pretty consistent. On Experiences, again, I don't have anything new to share now. I'll just say the following. We are actively working on updates to this product. As much as people love homes, I think 84% of people who book Airbnb leave a review, give a 5 star. We even have a higher customer satisfaction experience with 94% of people leave 5-star reviews. So we haven't updated this product yet because we just had our hands full really trying to focusing the most perishable opportunities which was recovering from the pandemic, improving our core service and addressing the needs of customers. But we should have some updates coming in the coming -- obviously, coming next year and beyond on this product. And you'll see we're continually investing in this product.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman at TD Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Could you touch on your vision for building more of a travel community on Airbnb and maybe the time line you expect for rolling out some of the new community features that you've talked about a little bit.\nBrian Chesky: Kevin, yes, I think -- let me just explain what I even mean by a travel community. I think one of the biggest visions that we have as a company isn't just to be a marketplace to become but to build literally quite literally a global travel community where you can get homes and experiences and a variety of other services, all in one place. So we can provide a lot of offerings for guests and hosts. And that we can use an emerging technologies like generative AI, like take the Where the Airbnb app can be like the ultimate travel agent. So to do this, there's a number of things that we've been investing in. The first thing is identity and account structure. So on most travel companies, you can book as a guest and they don't even have account information. And you can sign up with an account but you can also check out as a guest and they don't have the same robust account information that we do. On Airbnb 100% of the bookers and 100% of the host have to have a verified ID on -- associated to their account. They have robust profiles. About 70% of people on the guest and host side leave reviews to the other people. So this really does demonstrate how Airbnb is a little bit of a different community. We think that if we continue to invest in the profile and we can continue to invest in our system of trust, then as we learn more about guest and host, we can then match them for more types of offerings on Airbnb. And so this is, I think, really what we're starting to see. And the reason that AI is so powerful is I'll just cover 2 opportunities. Number one, I think that AI is going to affect -- this is an obvious statement, I think, digital business is more than brick-and-mortar businesses. So Airbnb and OTAs are probably going to benefit more quickly from AI than, say, a hotel will just because Airbnb and OTAs are more digital. And so the transformation will happen at the digital surface sooner. One of the areas that we're specifically going to benefit is customer service. Right now, customer service in Airbnb is really, really hard, especially compared to hotels. The problem is, imagine you have a Japanese host booking with -- hosting a German guest and there's a problem and you have these 2 people speaking different languages calling customer service, there's a myriad of issues, there's no front desk, we can't go on-premise. We don't understand the inventory and we need to try to adjudicate an issue based on 70 different policies that can be up to 100 pages long. AI can literally start to solve these problems where agents can supervise a model that can -- in second, come up with a better resolution and provide front desk level support in nearly every community in the world. But probably more importantly, Kevin, is what we can do by reimagining the search experience. Travel search has not really changed much in 25 years since really Expedia, Hotels.com, it's pretty much the same as it's been. And Airbnb, we fit that paradigm. There's a search box, you enter a date location, you refine your results and you book something. And it really hasn't changed much for a couple of decades. I think now with AI, there can be entirely different booking models. And I think this is like a Cambrian moment for like the Internet or mobile for travel where suddenly an app could actually learn more about you. They could ask you questions and they could offer you a significantly greater personalized service. Before the Internet, there were travel agents and they actually used to learn about you. And then travel got unbundled, it became self-service and it became all about price. But we do think that there's a way that travel could change and AI could lead the way with that. So these are some of the things we're thinking about and I think it's really, really exciting. And we're just at the beginning of this.\nOperator: We'll move next to Justin Post at Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Supply is up 19%. How do you think about that as a leading indicator for room night growth? And how do you maybe accelerate night growth to capture that? And then the second question is on ADRs. Is that supply coming in higher or lower, similar ADRs? And I don't know, Dave, if you can give us any thoughts on positive and negative drivers for ADRs next year.\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. Yes, I'll start with ADR and I'll go back to growth. I mean on the ADR side, it varies a little bit by market. We have seen, depending on the market, the ADRs of new listings coming in a little bit higher than they were in the average current ones. But what actually ends up happening is people are booking lower ADR places. And so that's kind of the offset. It depends on what's available and versus what's booked. And it does vary a little bit by region between North America and Europe on what the prices are. In North America, we're seeing more of the prices come down. And I think that's been a good indicator of strength for us going forward. And in Europe, the ADRs have been a little bit more elevated and we're hoping that with some more of the work that we've done to improve post tools and give greater visibility to host on how they're pricing, we'll continue to be able to kind of moderate ADRs in Europe going forward, too. So that's on the leading indicator. I do think that the strength of 19% listings growth is a great leading indicator of what we're capable of growing over time. As I said earlier, the overall growth of Airbnb since 2019, nights growth has been actually relatively in line with the total growth of supply. And I'm really bullish that we can get more supply coming on which will have more quality supply coming in which will also can drive down actually the prices because the more supply that comes on board, maybe back to your first question, the more likelihood that we can actually bring prices down in the market or at least moderate them so they don't grow as fast as competing supply. So, I'm really bullish on our overall growth. It's been great to see the strength of our listings growth this year.\nBrian Chesky: And maybe, Justin, I'll just say that like this is my intuition having done this for almost 16 years of my life. I think that supply is even more important than it seems on the surface. Ultimately, when you're tiny and no one ever hears about you, one of the big levers is awareness. But once you're a brand like Airbnb that's known as really [indiscernible] used all over the world, so supply growth becomes a very important like long-term leading indicator. And so long as we make sure we have healthy supply growth and then we continue to improve reliability and promote Airbnb globally around the world, then that is a very, very healthy long-term indicator. And we love for that number to be a bit higher.\nOperator: We'll go next to James Lee at Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great. Two questions here, Dave. I remember at the beginning of the year when you were guiding ADR down about mid-single digits. You were talking about leverage and like variable expenses like payment and cloud. I was just wondering where you are in that process, how much up to unlock going forward? And secondarily, on sales and marketing, it looks like supply is creating demand right now. Is it fair to assume we're shifting more demand-side advertising going forward? And can you talk about the implications there?\nDavid Stephenson: I'll start with sales and marketing. We're not actually shifting more to demand-side marketing. I think what we're seeing is exactly the success that Brian talked about earlier on the call. We -- the vast majority of our traffic is direct or unpaid. The first reason why people come to Airbnb is they're referred to us by family and friends. They come directly to us. The brand marketing certainly kind of helps talk about all the features and benefits of Airbnb and we use our search engine marketing as kind of a laser to focus on areas where maybe we have less demand than we have supply or in specific countries where we want to focus and kind of grow the overall kind of pie for us. So it is not the primary driver of it but this overall strategy of leading with brands and then following with surgical on our search engine marketing continues to work really well for us. And then in terms of the ADR, I think that the unlock of the variable expense improvements we've been making has just continued to enable us to drive profitable growth, right? We have -- our fixed cost growth discipline has been excellent, probably grow our fixed -- headcount this year, approximately 4%. So we're growing our head count and fixed expenses less than revenue. We continue to make great strides of improvement in our operations and support and Brian talked about a lot of the opportunities we have going forward in customer service. And then we're continuing to make good strides in cost of payments, our infrastructure costs, etcetera. That's not our primary driver. Like our primary focus is still on growth. Growth of the business, making hosting mainstream, perfecting the core service and expanding down the core and the fact that I can do all those things and do it while still doing it profitably and actually expanding our overall margins this year, it is something that I'm just very proud of.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Lloyd Walmsley at UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: My question, you guys have been talking a lot about innovating on the search experience, like working on GenAI, the community side, things like co-hosting. Do you see a path where some of these features over the longer term like community in search drive enough differentiation that you could bring on more traditional supply, things like boutique hotels in such a way that you kind of expand your addressable market and revenue per user while still sort of preserving enough that's unique about Airbnb? Is that sort of makes sense? Or is that just too far out there?\nBrian Chesky: No, Lloyd, that absolutely makes sense. And I think that's inevitability. Just to back up for a second, we are very much supportive having hotel inventory on Airbnb. And we acquired HotelTonight before the pandemic because we believe so much in it. Over the last few years, we had to make some decisions, especially when our business initially contracted and we made some decisions. We said, well, we have to really just get focused on our core. And our core were individual people renting homes, sharing homes. That is the most differentiated thing. It's inventory you can't find anywhere else. It's a thing that is most defensible, is the thing that attracts all the direct traffic. That being said, I mean, let's just take New York, for example. We still have a lot of traffic of people searching for New York and we now have a lot less inventory we used to have so there's a real opportunity for us to supplement what used to be homes with boutique hotels. They're already on hotel tonight and others and we can certainly put those in New York. And I generally think for sure, as Airbnb becomes a little more of a so-called like AI travel agent which is what I think all travel apps will trend towards to some extent. I think there's opportunity for us to do things in a differentiated way even with slightly less differentiated inventory. I think our bread and butter for combinations are always going to be home. I think that's where our heart and soul is. I also think that's where the biggest growth opportunity is but you should not think of our total supply -- addressable market of supply as only homes. We've had hotels. We've just been prioritizing homes because we wanted to be really focused.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Kenneth Gawrelski at Wells Fargo.\nKenneth Gawrelski: Appreciate it. Two questions, if I may. First, I want to go back to supply. I know you've talked a lot about it. The room nights up 19% with double-digit growth in all territories. Yet every week, we read about new STR regulations. At least in North America, could you help us reconcile this kind of this contrast for the financial market? Like what are we missing as investors here -- where is that supply growth really happening, especially in the kind of Western markets? And then my second question to be a bit more specific, I know you called out the volatility in room nights and on the demand side in 4Q. Are there any specific regions that you would call out? Or is it more broad-based? And just on the timing standpoint, did this start in October? Or did you see some of the volatility start in 3Q?\nBrian Chesky: Maybe I'll -- go for it, Dave.\nDavid Stephenson: Well, I'll just start with the volatility in room nights. There's not a specific region where we're seeing it. I think maybe the biggest thing we've seen is that it's more broad-based on a global basis right now which is why we've kind of called out the macroeconomic and potential geopolitical issues as a potential driver to it. We saw maybe some of it just late September and it's kind of been early October. And again, it's just a little too early to tell how much volatility we see going into the rest of the quarter. That's why we continue to highlight the revenue growth that we're still expecting this year between 12% and 14% and our growth overall. And then on the regulation side, I mean, I think it's a lot of what Brian said earlier that 80% of our top 200 markets already have regulation. I think the headlines, they tend to make good headlines when people are highlighting kind of issues with short-term regulation. But in many ways, outside of New York City, I've never been -- felt better about our overall regulatory landscape on a global basis. We have really good partnerships with many cities around the world and things like our City Portal and other things has made us continue to collaborate extremely well with the vast majority of cities. So, I think those are outliers. But Brian?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Yes. And I'd just say, like, again, we're in like 100,000 cities around the world and for every headline you read, there's cities that actually have very workable solutions. There's not a lot of activity. We're actually seeing growth in supply across all types of markets, not just big cities where you see in headlines. And I think vacation rental destinations -- in fact, there's a U.S. Census report that we looked at. I think said that 2/3 of markets where Airbnb exist, there aren't even hotel. So if you just think about that way, there's a lot of markets where there aren't even hotels, especially in the vacation rental in the nonurban areas. So the way I'd reconcile it is just to say that like while you read headlines about a few cities, they actually represent a very small percentage of the overall market concentration that we have.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Conor Cunningham at Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: Just on the 2/3 of the hosts that are using the pricing tool today, as you add new supply, you mentioned that ADRs of new supply is at a higher rate but are those people more likely to use the discounting tools that you've kind of mentioned after they've listed before? And then maybe on the implications for take rate when you move into international markets, you're tracking towards -- over 50% of your rooms are going to be there. Is take rate can eventually just kind of bleed lower as that expands? Just curious on your thinking about that overall.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I can take the first one, Conor. On tools, generally, new host adopt new tools at a higher rate than existing host. And the reason why is like when you sign up, like we have this really great onboarding and you're immediately presented with all the tools. Now we do have a percentage of our host, maybe like, call it, 1 million hosts that are highly, highly engaged and they're going to be really engaged on a lot of these tools. But every new host, as far as they're concerned, every tool is like -- is exactly how you're supposed to use Airbnb, whereas an older host, there's an adoption where you have to get them on to the new tools and they're used to hosting a certain way. So we're generally seeing that new host would probably adopt new tools at a faster rate than existing host. That being said, the ADR-related new host might also be related to the mix shift. We're getting a lot of inventory in nonurban areas. They're larger homes. So there's a lot of different reasons I can explain that. Dave, I can hand over to you.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. And can you read the second question again, it was take-rate on international host?\nConor Cunningham: Yes. Just as you expand internationally, is there going to be a natural reduction in take rate overall as that kind of tracks over 50% of your overall rooms at some point?\nDavid Stephenson: No. I mean, actually, I think over time, the way we think about our take rate is that it's been very stable. We've actually made no underlying kind of recent changes to our absolute take rate. And what we want to be able to do is as we add more services and capabilities, that would be the way to further kind of monetize Airbnb. So what have we done things like adding guest travel insurance has been a nice add for kind of incremental monetization. It's small but it's growing nicely. And then as Brian said, there as we kind of expand beyond core and add more services for host and guests, that will be the way to kind of increase it.\nBrian Chesky: And you could -- theoretically, you could argue the inverse which is to say that as the expanded new markets, they might be more interested in new services that we can offer because hosting is newer to them. So as we expand in new markets and as we expand to new host services, we want to make sure that new host and new markets are percent of those opportunities.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Brian Chesky for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining today. Just to recap, revenue was $3.4 billion, 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q3 records. And as well -- I just want to -- the last thing I want to highlight is our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $4.2 billion. And this represents a free cash flow margin of 44%. And so I just want to call out the real incredible hard work that the team has done over the last 3 years. We've been really, really disciplined to try to make this business a cash-generating machine and to be really focused. And I think the team has made some great progress. Next week, we're going to take a leap forward in making Airbnb more reliable with some big updates as part of our 2023 winter release. So I hope you can tune in. It's next Wednesday, November 8, to learn more and I'll see you there.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "And then in terms of the guidance, Brian, for the fourth quarter, we have our revenue guidance between $2.13 billion and $2.17 billion. So that's revenue growth between 12% and 14%. And remember that in Q3, our revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange is about 14%. So -- and we're not anticipating the same level of FX impact on the fourth quarter. So broadly, our revenue growth is relatively comparable between Q4 and Q3. In terms of the nights guide, we're just seeing some variability in our nights demand here early in the quarter and so we're just being cautious with that guide. And so we're not being specific on it but anticipate nights to be a few points below -- nights growth to be a few points below Q3. In terms of occupancy, we've actually seen it be pretty stable in terms of kind of on a global basis. I mean, if you actually step back, you got to remember that the vast majority of our hosts on Airbnb are individual houses. They're not looking to drive 100% occupancy of all their listings. And what they want to do is earn enough money to usually hit some certain amount of financial goals. So as we continue to grow our inventory, we're continuing to see strong occupancy levels overall. Clearly, we grew our inventory at 19% which is ahead of kind of revenue growth in the current period. But if you actually step back and look over like a 4-year period, go back all the way to 2019, the growth in our overall listings have actually been relatively similar to our overall growth in night. So that occupancy over an extended time period tends to be fairly stable while in any short-term time period, it can have a little bit more volatility. But overall, again, we don't focus on occupancy as a primary driver, we monitor it on local by local because what really matters is that we have great available listings in a specific market on a specific date. Yes. It's hard to completely pin down the root cause of any kind of softness or volatility. I think it is just broadly, what we're seeing is a little bit of softness in our overall kind of demand relative to Q3, we call out kind of the macroeconomic and geopolitical just because that is what's, I think, driving any volatility that's out there. It's early. I think I am clearly confident about our revenue growth for Q4 being 12% to 14% growth. And the fact that, that remains stable with Q3, I think is really promising. Our early visibility into 2024 is -- again, it's too early to tell. I think I'm feeling great about our overall playbook and plans, as kind of Brian has mentioned. I think I am most excited about the additional efforts we're making to get greater penetration in our international markets. And overall, I'm seeing solid demand for Airbnbs, like people are still prioritizing travel over buying things so I'm very bullish in the long term. Yes, I can take this. I mean we're not going to respond directly to any kind of specific thing that Google is doing. I think if you do step back though and remember that the vast majority of host on Airbnb or individual host, approximately 90% of them, that the majority of those listings are unique to Airbnb and you can only get them here. I think that, that is one of the larger kind of defensible moats that we have which is if you want to have an amazing stay, if you want to have the unique listings, you come directly to us and we're really not seeing the impact of the competition taking additional share from us. In fact, we continue to take or increase our relative share of listings in the market, continually. And this is why we're continuing to grow at faster than the overall kind of travel market. So I don't have much more to say beyond that. Sure. Yes, I'll start with ADR and I'll go back to growth. I mean on the ADR side, it varies a little bit by market. We have seen, depending on the market, the ADRs of new listings coming in a little bit higher than they were in the average current ones. But what actually ends up happening is people are booking lower ADR places. And so that's kind of the offset. It depends on what's available and versus what's booked. And it does vary a little bit by region between North America and Europe on what the prices are. In North America, we're seeing more of the prices come down. And I think that's been a good indicator of strength for us going forward. And in Europe, the ADRs have been a little bit more elevated and we're hoping that with some more of the work that we've done to improve post tools and give greater visibility to host on how they're pricing, we'll continue to be able to kind of moderate ADRs in Europe going forward, too. So that's on the leading indicator. I do think that the strength of 19% listings growth is a great leading indicator of what we're capable of growing over time. As I said earlier, the overall growth of Airbnb since 2019, nights growth has been actually relatively in line with the total growth of supply. And I'm really bullish that we can get more supply coming on which will have more quality supply coming in which will also can drive down actually the prices because the more supply that comes on board, maybe back to your first question, the more likelihood that we can actually bring prices down in the market or at least moderate them so they don't grow as fast as competing supply. So, I'm really bullish on our overall growth. It's been great to see the strength of our listings growth this year. I'll start with sales and marketing. We're not actually shifting more to demand-side marketing. I think what we're seeing is exactly the success that Brian talked about earlier on the call. We -- the vast majority of our traffic is direct or unpaid. The first reason why people come to Airbnb is they're referred to us by family and friends. They come directly to us. The brand marketing certainly kind of helps talk about all the features and benefits of Airbnb and we use our search engine marketing as kind of a laser to focus on areas where maybe we have less demand than we have supply or in specific countries where we want to focus and kind of grow the overall kind of pie for us. So it is not the primary driver of it but this overall strategy of leading with brands and then following with surgical on our search engine marketing continues to work really well for us. And then in terms of the ADR, I think that the unlock of the variable expense improvements we've been making has just continued to enable us to drive profitable growth, right? We have -- our fixed cost growth discipline has been excellent, probably grow our fixed -- headcount this year, approximately 4%. So we're growing our head count and fixed expenses less than revenue. We continue to make great strides of improvement in our operations and support and Brian talked about a lot of the opportunities we have going forward in customer service. And then we're continuing to make good strides in cost of payments, our infrastructure costs, etcetera. That's not our primary driver. Like our primary focus is still on growth. Growth of the business, making hosting mainstream, perfecting the core service and expanding down the core and the fact that I can do all those things and do it while still doing it profitably and actually expanding our overall margins this year, it is something that I'm just very proud of. Well, I'll just start with the volatility in room nights. There's not a specific region where we're seeing it. I think maybe the biggest thing we've seen is that it's more broad-based on a global basis right now which is why we've kind of called out the macroeconomic and potential geopolitical issues as a potential driver to it. We saw maybe some of it just late September and it's kind of been early October. And again, it's just a little too early to tell how much volatility we see going into the rest of the quarter. That's why we continue to highlight the revenue growth that we're still expecting this year between 12% and 14% and our growth overall. And then on the regulation side, I mean, I think it's a lot of what Brian said earlier that 80% of our top 200 markets already have regulation. I think the headlines, they tend to make good headlines when people are highlighting kind of issues with short-term regulation. But in many ways, outside of New York City, I've never been -- felt better about our overall regulatory landscape on a global basis. We have really good partnerships with many cities around the world and things like our City Portal and other things has made us continue to collaborate extremely well with the vast majority of cities. So, I think those are outliers. But Brian? Yes. And can you read the second question again, it was take-rate on international host? No. I mean, actually, I think over time, the way we think about our take rate is that it's been very stable. We've actually made no underlying kind of recent changes to our absolute take rate. And what we want to be able to do is as we add more services and capabilities, that would be the way to further kind of monetize Airbnb. So what have we done things like adding guest travel insurance has been a nice add for kind of incremental monetization. It's small but it's growing nicely. And then as Brian said, there as we kind of expand beyond core and add more services for host and guests, that will be the way to kind of increase it."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you, Eli and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share results with you. Q3 was another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had over 113 million Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue of $3.4 billion grew 18% year-over-year. Net income was $4.4 billion. Now this includes a onetime income tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance of $2.8 billion. But even excluding this tax benefit, adjusted net income was $1.6 billion, our highest ever and represented an adjusted net income margin of 47%. And free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $4.2 billion which is also our highest ever. And because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we repurchased over $500 million of our stock. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, we have added nearly 1 million active listings this year. Our supply grew 19% in Q3 compared to a year ago. We once again saw double-digit supply growth across all regions with the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. Urban and nonurban supply increased at nearly the same rate and we saw relatively similar supply growth among individual professional hosts with the majority of new listings exclusive to Airbnb. Second, Q3 was a record travel season on Airbnb. Nights and Experiences Booked grew 14% in Q3 compared to a year ago. We saw an acceleration of nights growth across all geographies and we are particularly encouraged by the growth of first-time bookers during Q3 and we saw more nights than ever booked in the Airbnb app with 53% of gross nights booked in the app compared to 48% in the same period last year. And finally, international expansion markets are gaining momentum. Cross-border nights book increased 17% in Q3 compared to a year ago. In Asia Pacific, our business has fully recovered to pre-pandemic level. And we're seeing significant growth in Asia Pacific markets such as Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia, all experiencing year-over-year nights growth above 30% on an origin basis. Now we've been able to achieve these results by continually making progress on our 3 strategic priorities. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We've been focused on making hosting as popular as traveling and our Q3 results show that our approach is working. We ended the quarter with the highest number of active listing and we saw strong active listings growth across all regions of the market types. And hosts are benefiting. During Q3 alone, Airbnb host earned more than $19 billion. We'll continue growing supply by raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started and improving the overall experience for a host. Second, we're reflecting our core service. We've collected millions of pieces of feedback on how to improve Airbnb. And 2 years ago, we started doing twice a year of product releases to address this feedback. And since then, we've launched more than 350 new features and upgrades across our entire service. And in the past year alone, this has included things such as improved customer service, total price display and new tools to help host set more competitive prices. These upgrades are paying off for both guests and host. For example, we redesigned our tool and we made it easier for hosts to add discounts and promotions. And now almost 2/3 the host offer weekly or monthly discount. We also added a new feature called similar listings that let hosts see listing prices in the area, so they know what to charge. And since we launched the similar-listings tool, nearly 1 million hosts have used this feature. In mid-September, we shared progress we've made to help lower cleaning fees, reduce prices and improved search and reliability. We have even more improvements coming as part of our November 8 winter release next Wednesday where we'll introduce dozens of new features aimed at making Airbnb more reliable. And finally, our third strategic priority is expand Airbnb beyond their core. Now we made significant progress in the past few years in building a strong and profitable business. And in addition to laying the foundation for new services and offerings, we've been focused on international expansion. We are investing in underpenetrated international markets and we're seeing great results. Following the success, we've seen in recent quarters in Germany and Brazil, Korea has now become one of our fastest growing countries compared to 2019 with gross nights booked 54% higher than they were in Q3 2019 on origin basis. As international travel continues to recover, we're building greater momentum for Airbnb in underpenetrated markets. So those are results for Q3. With that, Dave and I look forward to answering your questions. Yes. Mark, this is Brian. I'll take it. Let's first talk about international expansion. So it's a great question. And as everyone on this recall is probably aware, Airbnb is in 220 countries in the region. So on the one hand, we're one of the most global like companies in all of travel. We're a truly global travel network. At the same time, Mark, what we've seen is that our penetration in the United States is significantly higher than our penetration in many other countries. And we think there's a huge amount of growth if we could just get Airbnb to even a fraction of the percentage of penetration that we have in the United States. So last year, we decided to roll out this updated playbook. We rolled it out in Germany and Brazil. It's kind of a four-pronged approach and involve some product optimization, PR, local marketing and just general optimizations on the ground in these regions. And what we've seen is Brazil is now double the size as it was pre-pandemic. We rolled that same playbook out to Korea. It's now 54% higher than it was before. But what I would say is we've just scratched the surface of what we can do in Germany, Brazil and Korea. I think those markets are on a good trajectory. They could be significantly larger and we're now looking at Japan and India, China, around Asia Pacific. We have some optimizations in Southeast Asia, continual growth in Mexico. There's a number of other countries in addition to a number of areas in Europe where we think we can see a lot more growth. So I think the next 24 months, we're going to see a major acceleration in our penetration in a lot of these markets. There's about a dozen, dozen half markets around the world, as you know, have large tourism opportunities and we're really focused on that. And that's going to be one of our biggest near-term expansion opportunities. With regards to future services to sellers, we don't have anything to announce right now. But what we've been doing is we've been building the foundation of our systems so that we can have these new tools and services, including sponsor listings. And we also -- recently, we've been rolling out a pilot for co-hosting. Co-hosting is a service where we match host that don't have homes but they have extra time with homeowners to have space but they don't have time to host. And we've been doing these pilots in France. We've rolled that out in parts of the United States and this is turning into a popular service that we think can unlock a lot more supply. So we're going to -- over the next couple of years, I think you're going to see a number of new services roll out for host. Eric, I mean, just to step back, the last few years, I think we've really, really benefited by being focused. When the pandemic occurred, we felt like we had to hunker down, get really lean, get really focused and we went from basically a breakeven company to now a company doing obviously cash flow margins of around 44% of revenue. So we've really benefited from this focus and really benefited from focusing on our core business. To your point, Eric, I think we are now getting ready to re-expand Airbnb beyond its core. It was always our attention to do much more than just short-term housing for travelers. We're always intended to do more of that. So we're working on making Airbnb more of an extensible platform. And I think, ultimately, there are actually quite literally dozens of services, guests and hosts that we could build on top of the Airbnb system. I think a lot of it comes down to making the platform extensible so we can offer these services. I think at the end of the day, we're really thinking about are a couple of big ideas. First, I think that we are thinking about generative AI as an opportunity to reimagine much of our product category and product catalog. So if you think about how you can sell a lot of different types of products and new offerings, generative AI could be really, really powerful. It can match you in a way you've never seen before. So imagine Airbnb being almost like the ultimate travel agent as an app. We think this can unlock opportunities that we've never seen. Additionally to that, there's a lot of opportunities on both the guests side and the host side. And so we're going to be thinking through a lot of this. So you'll see hopefully some updates in the coming years. And Brian, sorry, are you referring to things we've already shipped or things that we're working on that we haven't shipped? Yes. So yes, so let me -- why don't I answer the innovation and Dave, you can talk about the guide for going forward? So maybe let me talk about some things that we've already done. I can give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about next week and beyond. So we did over 50 upgrades last May. It was based on the idea that millions of customers have given us feedback, actually both guests and hosts on how to improve Airbnb and we've listened. And if I were to just call out 3 things, Brian, I would just call out 3 things would be total price display, pricing tools for host and monthly stays. So let me just go through 3 and what happened. On total price display, we rolled out total price display before taxes. This is based on popular demand. We are now the only travel app of our kind that actually does this. Since we rolled this out, 260,000 listings have removed or reduced their cleaning fees. We now have 3 million listings that do not have a cleaning fee. So we think this is working. We also think people are now being steered towards better total value on a total price, inclusive of overall cost basis. The second are pricing tools. Since we rolled out new pricing tools, about half of new listings are now offering a monthly discount. And we also have this new tool called similar listings, where you can see where other people are charging around you. And this we find has been the best way to make sure our host have competitive prices. Because host are usually surprised to discover the listings that get most bookings around them offer a better value. And it's always really hard to know what your home is worth and what you charge. And so the best thing you can do is give people transparent data. Well, 1 million people have used these tools and probably the thing I'd point to is, while this time year-over-year in September data, hotel prices are up 10%. Airbnb prices globally are only up 1%. So we are definitely moving in the right direction. Now in North America, on a mix shift in FX neutral basis, our price is actually down 3% in North America, while hotels are up towards double digits, I think. So the last thing I'd say is monthly stays. We obviously announced a bunch of updates on monthly stays, including you can pay by bank, we lowered fees after 3 months, we have the whole new really cool interface and stays for 3 months or longer are now growing nearly 20% year-over-year. So those are just 3 things we've seen. I think what we've learned is like as we listen to customers, we adapt quickly, we can drive incremental growth. As far as what's next, obviously, we don't talk about too much before it will release. I will say though, next Wednesday, we are focused on some pretty big opportunities around reliability. So this is the last thing I'll say about this. If you think about how big Airbnb is, for every person who stays in Airbnb, approximately 9 people every night stay in a hotel or about 9 bookings. The hotels are about to order magnitude bigger. And when you ask people, why do you book a hotel and not Airbnb, the number one reason they come up with is usually reliability that they know what they're going to get before they book. It kind of speaks to the strength and weakness of Airbnb that on the one hand, it's one of a kind, other hand, that one-of-a-kindness offers valuability that not every person wants. And so next week, we're going to have some new offerings that I think will make a pretty big in this. So that's what I can say. I think I'm pretty optimistic about what you'll see next week. And of course, we're already working on stuff for next May and next October releases as well. So hopefully, stay tuned. Yes. Yes, you start with occupancy and I'll take the second question. Lee, I'll take your second question. Yes, I think that -- as I said before, I think we're only scratching the surface to how this company becomes. And I absolutely think that we can get to really solid double-digit revenue growth for many, many years to come. And there's 3 things that I'd point out. The first is our core business. I think our core business could be significantly larger than it is today, even if we didn't do anything new. And the reason I believe this is the following: I believe that almost every single person who stays in a hotel could stay in Airbnb is, number one, they knew about all the benefits of Airbnb and number two, we made sure that our service was sufficiently reliable to be an alternative. So let me start with those 2. We've done recently a new marketing campaign that's called \"Airbnb it\". And it basically contrast the benefits of the Airbnb versus the hotel. And based on our research, one of the things we've noticed is that a lot of people stay in hotels don't understand some of the unique benefits of staying in Airbnb and why it is better for certain types of trips. And one type of trip that Airbnb is almost always better is when you're traveling with 3 or more people. If you're traveling with a family or traveling with a group, why do you want to stay in different rooms versus -- different room separated. We're having to stay at the same time. And then the only place you can meet in these crowded lobbies when you can get a whole home all to yourself. So this is -- we've been running these digital campaigns. It's the highest performing digital campaign we've ever done. And this is going to be the basis for a new -- major new marketing campaign next year. Additional to that, as I mentioned before, if we just keep focusing on reliability, making sure that when you book, you know what you're going to get and this is ever a problem, you have an excellent customer service that is nearly as good as a front desk or as good as a front desk then I think there could be in the years to come a tipping point where many people could choose Airbnb. So that's just our core business. Next is international. Even though we're in 220 countries in the region, there's only a couple of countries where we even have penetration at rivals of United States. And those countries are Canada, Australia and France. After that, U.K. a little bit, it really starts to tip down. And so we have like massive, massive opportunity and just by bringing Airbnb's playbook to these other countries. Obviously, Germany but not just Germany, like actually the entirety of Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and even Italy and Spain, basically every country but France and U.K., there are at a step change lower penetration. Latin America is a completely new market for us, emerging. Asia Pacific, I would argue it's a completely new market. We can be adding huge amounts of growth just by our expansion playbook. And then finally, yes, I mean I would say just on new products and services, though we're not disclosing anything that we're doing new right now, here's what I'd say. I think the biggest strength I have as a CEO is not driving profitability even though we've done a really good job. I think it is literally inventing new products and services. That's why we've hired so many great technologists, designers and I think this is going to be a sweet spot for us. We're obviously not going to talk about new things before we ship them but twice a year, every May and every November -- October, November, we're going to be hopefully, putting out going forward new ideas that I hope really increase the addressable market for Airbnb. And I think that we can do much more than just short-term housing. But again, I think short-term housing is still a huge opportunity for us. Jed, I'll take regulation. So yes, I would generally say, over the last decade, we've been really, really encouraged by the general trajectory of regulation. Here are a couple of stats. Currently today, 80% of our top 200 markets already have regulations on the books and these regulations, though they vary, generally have found workable solutions for home sharing for us to continue to grow and thrive. And I'd point out like the country of France has passed national legislation that is very, very favorable and workable. We've had cities near us like Seattle or San Diego that have passed really favorable legislation. I will probably contrast that to New York City which has completely gone a different direction. And unfortunately, I thought when we started Airbnb, we can develop model legislation in New York that we can make in New York, we can make it anywhere and that other cities have adopted legislation that New York has adopted. It turns out that's actually not the case. In fact, New York has gone a different direction and I think it's going to turn into a cautionary tale because what we're already seeing hotel price in New York are now up 8% year-over-year. A one-bedroom or a studio in New York seems to be about $500. A lot of people can't even afford to go there anymore. We are seeing work bookings in Jersey City and the perimeters around New York City. And I do anticipate more and more activity will probably go underground which is probably not the intention of the people to even pass a lot. So generally speaking, we're seeing the trend line to be generally really, really constructive. We built the city portal with the one-stop shop for cities to be able to self-serve, to be ale get data and monitor the type of activity happening in their city. We have 400 cities on the city portal. And generally, what we're seeing is that a lot of cities in pandemic or post-pandemic era have reached out to us wanting to make sure that they are able to benefit from economic dollars going to the city and we paid $9 billion in hotel tax. So generally, it's gone fairly well. It is going to be notable that if you just read the news, you're always going to seem to be reading about these cities, something happen in New York because we're in a 100,000 cities and nearly all regulations happen at the municipal level. So it's kind of a long slide to be able to work with these cities because there's so many of them and there's not a lot of standardization but generally speaking, now listed in New York, we are seeing a lot of positive developments. And then, on the Google question. Yes. Maybe the only other thing I'd say -- maybe the only other thing Jed, I'd say is we're just seeing a lot of strength in mobile bookings. You can think of mobile bookings essentially like direct. It's not people not going to Google. 53% of our gross nights booked in the last quarter were on native mobile apps, essentially iOS and Android. And that is up from a year earlier which was less than 50%. And again, I'll just say 90% of our traffic is direct or unpaid. So we think that the strength of our brand, the strength of our app, the strength of people coming direct to Airbnb is key. And the reason it's direct is because they're inventory is unique. It's not commodities. The majority of hosts don't list anywhere else and we build customer tools for them. So that's our general theory, to build unique inventories that allow people to come direct to Airbnb. And I don't see that changing. Nick, let me start with pricing and then I'll talk about the general offering. When we started Airbnb, our original tagline was a cheap affordable alternative to a hotel. And the primary reason people chose Airbnb the early days was price. Now once they used it, we used to say money as the hook but the experience is the reason you keep coming back. Because it also turns out when you stay in Airbnbs, you're often typically in a real neighborhood, not a hotel district. You have this really cool space. You can make a meal, you have a lot more of a much more quick home. Sometimes there's a local connection to the community, that's what you're looking for. But affordability has always been one of the most important benefits that we have in Airbnb. And I do feel like we still have opportunity for our prices to be even more competitive. There's a really interesting thing we discovered. Within reason, generally, when host lower the prices, they tend to make more money. And this is typically not true of hotels, right? Because if you're running at 80% occupancy and you lower your prices per night, you typically don't have a lot more room to make up the lower prices with higher occupancy and you'll typically lose money. But many of our hosts run at low enough occupancy and they always have that if they lower the price just a bit, they can sell more nights. And so we think there's a win-win where if we continue to encourage host to offer more competitive pricing, it's a win for guests but it's also a win for many of the host. And I would also just point out that in addition to pricing tools, you need to have ample supply. Supply, I just want to highlight again, is growing 19% year-over-year. This was a huge question by the way 18 months ago. Could Airbnb re-accelerate to nearly 20% supply growth and we are approaching 20% supply growth. I think that is really, really key. So to answer your question, we've made huge progress in last year but prices are up quite significantly from pre-pandemic for Airbnb and hotels. We're both up a lot. And my hope is whether or not prices come down on Airbnb further in the next year or 2, my hope is while hotels will almost undoubtedly keep increasing year-over-year, our prices will continue to be a little bit more -- they'll be more moderated. And that goes to the next question. We actually think there's a very high correlation of relationship between ADR and night growth and the higher the ADR, typically the lower the nights growth and the lower the ADR, typically the higher the nights growth. So there's a trade-off there. And so we think that as we continue to be more affordable, we'll continue to stimulate more demand. Now the interesting thing about Airbnb is that we're not really one type of offering, right? Southwest is a budget brand. Louis Vuitton is a luxury brand. Apple is kind of like a luxury brand for like a lot of different people but they do have like premium prices. Airbnb's offering really is one of the most unique and resilient models. I mean we are one of the most popular brands for people under 30 in travel, probably the most popular band for people under 30. We're also very much a family travel brand because homes accommodate families much better than typically hotels. We're not just an urban brand. We're a rural brand and vocational brand. We're not just a North American brand. We're a global brand. So one of the things we highlighted in the public is that we literally have something for everyone. But as we continue to get more affordable, I think that's going to continue to drive a lot more growth for us. Yes. I mean, David can feel free to jump in on this. But at the highest level, we generally are seeing that the vast majority of first-time bookers still come direct to Airbnb. So I'll just kind of step back. The number one way reason people come to Airbnb is because a friend or a family member told them about Airbnb. And so we primarily grow through word of mouth. After that, then we have a lot of earned media. We have some 500,000 to 600,000 press articles a year. I mean the share of voice of Airbnb compared to most travel companies is overwhelming. We have a greater share of voice than almost all the other major travel brands combined. We also have a huge amount of presence in social media. You might have heard a few months ago about the Barbie house rented in Airbnb or the Shrek House, so we get a lot of earned media. And then beyond that, we do these pretty big brand campaign. And the vast majority of our marketing spend that we do spend on advertising is not performance marketing, it's brand marketing. It's really marketing education around our unique product offering. So we do performance marketing but we think unlike other travel companies, it's not necessarily a way to buy customers. It's literally more like a laser that we use to hone in on balancing supply/demand and we really can use it to optimize certain markets. So a lot of it remains direct. And again, 90% of our traffic is direct or unpaid. I think that's been pretty consistent. On Experiences, again, I don't have anything new to share now. I'll just say the following. We are actively working on updates to this product. As much as people love homes, I think 84% of people who book Airbnb leave a review, give a 5 star. We even have a higher customer satisfaction experience with 94% of people leave 5-star reviews. So we haven't updated this product yet because we just had our hands full really trying to focusing the most perishable opportunities which was recovering from the pandemic, improving our core service and addressing the needs of customers. But we should have some updates coming in the coming -- obviously, coming next year and beyond on this product. And you'll see we're continually investing in this product. Kevin, yes, I think -- let me just explain what I even mean by a travel community. I think one of the biggest visions that we have as a company isn't just to be a marketplace to become but to build literally quite literally a global travel community where you can get homes and experiences and a variety of other services, all in one place. So we can provide a lot of offerings for guests and hosts. And that we can use an emerging technologies like generative AI, like take the Where the Airbnb app can be like the ultimate travel agent. So to do this, there's a number of things that we've been investing in. The first thing is identity and account structure. So on most travel companies, you can book as a guest and they don't even have account information. And you can sign up with an account but you can also check out as a guest and they don't have the same robust account information that we do. On Airbnb 100% of the bookers and 100% of the host have to have a verified ID on -- associated to their account. They have robust profiles. About 70% of people on the guest and host side leave reviews to the other people. So this really does demonstrate how Airbnb is a little bit of a different community. We think that if we continue to invest in the profile and we can continue to invest in our system of trust, then as we learn more about guest and host, we can then match them for more types of offerings on Airbnb. And so this is, I think, really what we're starting to see. And the reason that AI is so powerful is I'll just cover 2 opportunities. Number one, I think that AI is going to affect -- this is an obvious statement, I think, digital business is more than brick-and-mortar businesses. So Airbnb and OTAs are probably going to benefit more quickly from AI than, say, a hotel will just because Airbnb and OTAs are more digital. And so the transformation will happen at the digital surface sooner. One of the areas that we're specifically going to benefit is customer service. Right now, customer service in Airbnb is really, really hard, especially compared to hotels. The problem is, imagine you have a Japanese host booking with -- hosting a German guest and there's a problem and you have these 2 people speaking different languages calling customer service, there's a myriad of issues, there's no front desk, we can't go on-premise. We don't understand the inventory and we need to try to adjudicate an issue based on 70 different policies that can be up to 100 pages long. AI can literally start to solve these problems where agents can supervise a model that can -- in second, come up with a better resolution and provide front desk level support in nearly every community in the world. But probably more importantly, Kevin, is what we can do by reimagining the search experience. Travel search has not really changed much in 25 years since really Expedia, Hotels.com, it's pretty much the same as it's been. And Airbnb, we fit that paradigm. There's a search box, you enter a date location, you refine your results and you book something. And it really hasn't changed much for a couple of decades. I think now with AI, there can be entirely different booking models. And I think this is like a Cambrian moment for like the Internet or mobile for travel where suddenly an app could actually learn more about you. They could ask you questions and they could offer you a significantly greater personalized service. Before the Internet, there were travel agents and they actually used to learn about you. And then travel got unbundled, it became self-service and it became all about price. But we do think that there's a way that travel could change and AI could lead the way with that. So these are some of the things we're thinking about and I think it's really, really exciting. And we're just at the beginning of this. And maybe, Justin, I'll just say that like this is my intuition having done this for almost 16 years of my life. I think that supply is even more important than it seems on the surface. Ultimately, when you're tiny and no one ever hears about you, one of the big levers is awareness. But once you're a brand like Airbnb that's known as really [indiscernible] used all over the world, so supply growth becomes a very important like long-term leading indicator. And so long as we make sure we have healthy supply growth and then we continue to improve reliability and promote Airbnb globally around the world, then that is a very, very healthy long-term indicator. And we love for that number to be a bit higher. No, Lloyd, that absolutely makes sense. And I think that's inevitability. Just to back up for a second, we are very much supportive having hotel inventory on Airbnb. And we acquired HotelTonight before the pandemic because we believe so much in it. Over the last few years, we had to make some decisions, especially when our business initially contracted and we made some decisions. We said, well, we have to really just get focused on our core. And our core were individual people renting homes, sharing homes. That is the most differentiated thing. It's inventory you can't find anywhere else. It's a thing that is most defensible, is the thing that attracts all the direct traffic. That being said, I mean, let's just take New York, for example. We still have a lot of traffic of people searching for New York and we now have a lot less inventory we used to have so there's a real opportunity for us to supplement what used to be homes with boutique hotels. They're already on hotel tonight and others and we can certainly put those in New York. And I generally think for sure, as Airbnb becomes a little more of a so-called like AI travel agent which is what I think all travel apps will trend towards to some extent. I think there's opportunity for us to do things in a differentiated way even with slightly less differentiated inventory. I think our bread and butter for combinations are always going to be home. I think that's where our heart and soul is. I also think that's where the biggest growth opportunity is but you should not think of our total supply -- addressable market of supply as only homes. We've had hotels. We've just been prioritizing homes because we wanted to be really focused. Maybe I'll -- go for it, Dave. Yes. Yes. And I'd just say, like, again, we're in like 100,000 cities around the world and for every headline you read, there's cities that actually have very workable solutions. There's not a lot of activity. We're actually seeing growth in supply across all types of markets, not just big cities where you see in headlines. And I think vacation rental destinations -- in fact, there's a U.S. Census report that we looked at. I think said that 2/3 of markets where Airbnb exist, there aren't even hotel. So if you just think about that way, there's a lot of markets where there aren't even hotels, especially in the vacation rental in the nonurban areas. So the way I'd reconcile it is just to say that like while you read headlines about a few cities, they actually represent a very small percentage of the overall market concentration that we have. Yes, I can take the first one, Conor. On tools, generally, new host adopt new tools at a higher rate than existing host. And the reason why is like when you sign up, like we have this really great onboarding and you're immediately presented with all the tools. Now we do have a percentage of our host, maybe like, call it, 1 million hosts that are highly, highly engaged and they're going to be really engaged on a lot of these tools. But every new host, as far as they're concerned, every tool is like -- is exactly how you're supposed to use Airbnb, whereas an older host, there's an adoption where you have to get them on to the new tools and they're used to hosting a certain way. So we're generally seeing that new host would probably adopt new tools at a faster rate than existing host. That being said, the ADR-related new host might also be related to the mix shift. We're getting a lot of inventory in nonurban areas. They're larger homes. So there's a lot of different reasons I can explain that. Dave, I can hand over to you. And you could -- theoretically, you could argue the inverse which is to say that as the expanded new markets, they might be more interested in new services that we can offer because hosting is newer to them. So as we expand in new markets and as we expand to new host services, we want to make sure that new host and new markets are percent of those opportunities. All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining today. Just to recap, revenue was $3.4 billion, 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q3 records. And as well -- I just want to -- the last thing I want to highlight is our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $4.2 billion. And this represents a free cash flow margin of 44%. And so I just want to call out the real incredible hard work that the team has done over the last 3 years. We've been really, really disciplined to try to make this business a cash-generating machine and to be really focused. And I think the team has made some great progress. Next week, we're going to take a leap forward in making Airbnb more reliable with some big updates as part of our 2023 winter release. So I hope you can tune in. It's next Wednesday, November 8, to learn more and I'll see you there."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's earnings conference call for the Second Quarter of 2023. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's Second Quarter of 2023 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson.  Earlier today, we issued a Shareholder Letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks, and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-looking Statements in our Shareholder Letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Shareholder Letter posted to our IR website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Thank you Ellie. And Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining today. I'm excited to share our results with you. Q2 was another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had over 115 million nights and experiences booked. Revenue of $2.5 billion grew 18% year-over-year. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 19% year-over-year. Net income was $650 million, representing a net income margin of 26%, our highest second quarter ever. And free cash flow for the quarter was $900 million, up 13% year-over-year. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $3.9 billion. And this represented a trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of 43%. And because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we were able to repurchase $2.5 billion of our stock in the last 12 months, which is more than offset the impact of shared dilution. Now, during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand in Airbnb remained strong. Nights and experiences booked increased 11% in Q2 compared to a year ago. Active bookers grew in every region, and we had more first-time bookers compared to a year ago. In fact, we've now had more than 1.5 billion guest arrivals since starting Airbnb. Second, guests are traveling farther. Cross-border nights booked increased 16% in Q2 compared to a year ago. And we are especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific, where inbound international travel increased 80% compared to this time last year. And we also saw cross-border nights booked to North America increase 20% year-over-year. And finally, the third trend we're seeing is that guests are staying longer on Airbnb. Millions of people remain flexible about where they live and work, and we see this reflected in our bookings. In Q2, long-term stays remain 18% of total nights booked. And throughout the quarter, we saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth in bookings for month these days. Now, while the ability to travel and work remotely has been an important part of long-term stay growth, people are also extending their typical weekend stays by an extra night or two. In fact, in the past six quarters, long stays, long weekend stays have been the fastest growing trip type on Airbnb. I think this is just evidence of the incremental flexibility people have post-pandemic. Now, given that we're halfway through 2023, I just want to provide a very quick update on the progress we made across our three strategic priorities. First, we are focused on making hosting mainstream. With supply growth stagnated at the beginning of COVID, we developed a new strategy to recruit more hosts. Since then, we've been focused on raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started, and improving our tools for hosts. And our strategy is working.  In Q2, supply growth is 19% year-over-year, and this is actually up from 18% in Q1. In fact, in every quarter since we've gone public, we've seen an acceleration in total active listings growth. And we're continuing to see strong supply growth across all regions, all market types, and all price points. In fact, we added a record number of new listings in Q2, and we ended the quarter with more than 7 million total active listings. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every detail. Millions of people have given us feedback on how to improve Airbnb. We've listened. On May 3rd, we introduced over 50 new features and upgrades as part of our 2023 summer release. Now many of these new features and upgrades were aimed at addressing affordability, starting with new pricing tools for hosts. Hosts told us that our pricing tools are difficult to use. So we redesigned our tools, and we made it easier for hosts to add discounts and promotions. They also told us that they had trouble setting competitive prices. So we added a new feature called similar listings to help them see listings in their area so they know what to charge. Now we received very positive feedback from our hosts, and the changes are already having an impact. Hosts have started lowering their prices, and and with more of them offering weekly and monthly discounts. And as more hosts adopt these tools, we believe we'll be able to drive greater affordability and value for guests. We also rolled out more affordable monthly stays. Guests are staying longer in Airbnb. So we took steps to make longer stays more affordable. We significantly reduced fees for stays longer than three months. We started offering U.S. guests the option to save money by paying with their bank account, and we made it easier for hosts to offer monthly discounts. And as a result, the percentage of our new active listings to offer monthly discount jumped from 22% to 50%. Now we took another step to address affordability with the launch of Airbnb rooms. Airbnb rooms takes us back to our founding ethos of sharing, and it's one of the most affordable ways to travel. Airbnb rooms have an average price of only $67 per night, significantly lower than the average hotel room. Given the increased price sensitivity for many guests, especially the next generation of travelers, this is going to remain an important category for Airbnb. And finally, our third strategic priority is to expand beyond the core. We spent the past few years perfecting our core service. We've rolled out hundreds of new features and upgrades. And today, our core is stronger and more profitable than ever, but we're not stopping there because we have some big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. And we're building the foundational capability for these new product and services that we plan to launch in the years to come. Now, before I turn to Q&A, I want to tell you about a recent campaign that highlights what makes Airbnb unique. Airbnb is known for one of a kind listings. As I'm sure you know, the Barbie movie just came out in theaters. And in celebration of the premiere, we partnered with Warner Brothers and Mattel to transform a home into the Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse. And we launched it as part of our Only on Airbnb campaign. Only on Airbnb caps in the global pop culture moments, inspiring guests with some of the most iconic homes in the world. The Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse has been a sensation, and it is now Airbnb's most popular listing ever. We saw 13,000 press hits and more than 250 million social media impressions since it was announced. And to give you a sense of how much that is, that is twice, more than twice as many press hits as were generated from our IPO. Only on Airbnb campaigns are an effective way to introduce Airbnb and our unique inventory to new guests, and they'll be an important part of our playbook going forward. So those are the results that we have to share for Q2. And with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your question. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question from Mario Lu at Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking question. So the first one is on the third quarter ADR guide. You said it's upward pressure in the quarter. Can you help explain what you mean by the listing type mix shift that's kind of listing up ADRs?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, the listing type mix shift is just simply the mix of types of listings, either geographic type of size of home location, that's right in the mix. And so ADRs coming up due to that. And it's also being coming up in the third quarter driven by foreign exchange.\nMario Lu: Okay, got it. And then in terms of your section on the operational take rate, you guys mentioned that you're offering a lower take rate, especially for stays after the third month. Does that mean, over time, should we expect this number to come down? Or are there kind of offsets that you're going to provide to keep the operational take rate flat? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, that's Mario. I can answer that. We always want to make sure that we're providing the very best value for our guests. We identified this is a huge opportunity where we could drive incremental conversion by taking take rates down after the third month. And we saw some really great results. That being said, I do not expect our take rates to change materially. There may be some segments or trip types or geographies where we would want to take it down, but that could be offset by other areas that could come up. And so generally, I would expect it to be pretty stable. And the way that we're going to see margin expansion is by launching incremental services for guests and hosts over the coming years.\nMario Lu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Jed Kelly at Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the listing pipe, are you still adding more of that like vacation rental single unit inventory versus some of like call it the smaller units and urban vacation and urban areas? And then can you just give us an update on how we should think about your marketing into the back half? Thank you. \nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey, Jed, I can start and I'll hand over to Dave. So our supply, I mean, let me just back up, our supply has actually been really, really strong. You might remember that being a COVID, we were, we flagged this as something we need to work on. That's why we created an initiative called mainstreaming hosting. And the results have been very successful. In fact, supply growth is growing 19% year-over-year. And in fact, urban is actually growing faster in vacation. Urban is growing 20% whereas vacation is growing 19%. So that is pretty stable. And as far as the number of individual hosts versus what we describe as professional hosts, around 90% of our hosts remain individuals. I'll hand over to Dave.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, on the marketing back half, I mean, our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect to remain relatively flat year-over-year on a total year basis from 2023 over 2022. We did pull forward more marketing to the first half of the year relative to the second half this year. We've been really pleased with the results. So I mean, remember that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid. I think that's an important differentiator versus others. And then when we do things like the Barbie dream house and other big, events like that, we're able to kind of drive more awareness about Airbnb about the uniqueness of our offerings. And this is a powerful strategy for our marketing.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, maybe I'll just add one thing about marketing is just, it's a full funnel approach. And last year we got 600,000 articles written about us. So people talk a lot about Airbnb. And now I think what you're also seeing is social media, whether it's the only on program Barbie or just generally every means social media is just a topic of conversation. I think that is just a testament to when you invest in a brand, when your brand's a noun and a verb, and you have something unique, you get a lot of those benefits. And I think it's going to be consistent and we'll have pretty consistent marketing expenses to send a revenue over time because of the strength of the brand.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth at JP Morgan. \nDouglas Anmuth: Hey, this is [indiscernible].. Thanks for taking the question, but I have two. So first one through this affordability. Are you actually seeing that consumers are coming to your platform seeing that the prices are high and walking away and do you feel like that's an opportunity that you guys aren't capturing? Or is it just the case that people are okay with higher prices on the platform right now? And the second thing on the other side for the full year, where does it see the outside to raise your point?\nBrian Chesky: I don't, we're not able to hear the second question. I don't think. Can you say one more time? \nDouglas Anmuth: Yes, sorry, on your full year guidance for adjusted EBITDA where did you see upside to give you the confidence to raise it?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, so I'll take the first question and I'll hand over to Dave. On affordability, our prices have, have obviously risen since pre-pandemic and the growth has been incredible in the business is nearly about twice the size that was pre-pandemic. That being said, in the long run, Airbnb started as an affordable alternative to hotels. And I think that we always have to remember that for every dollar people spend on Airbnb, they spend as much as many as $10 in the world on hotels. So we're still a very small player in a very large market. And I think that one of our big opportunities is to make sure we continue to be affordable. Last year, we got a lot of feedback from the community that Airbnb wasn't as affordable as it used to be. So we made a bunch of changes. We highlighted some of these in my opening remarks. What we've seen though, since then, I'll answer your question. People, the book prices on Airbnb, on average, are lower than the listed prices. So we do see people gravitating towards more affordable stays listed in Airbnb. It's partly why we launched a feature called similar listings, which help us see the listings that we're getting booked. And what hosts I think discovered was the most popular listings that made the most money offered many times the very best value. And so this was, in a sense, a win-win for guests in the house by really trying to build better tools. I also just want to point out one thing, which is our prices are essentially flat year by year. I think they're about 1% up year-over-year, but in North America, our prices are now down 1%. Now, when you take out mixed shifts, because people are booking larger homes, our prices in North America are actually down 4%. And if you compare it to hotels, depending upon which data you take, hotels are up some between 4% or as much as 10%. And it seems like hotels are suggesting, based on some of the public remarks, that they aren't going to come down. In fact, those prices might come up. So to answer your question, I think people come to Airbnb for one of the kindspaces at great value. And if we can keep prices very affordable, and then also focus on reliability, I think there's going to be a lot of demand to come.\nDavid Stephenson: And then in terms of profitability, I'm just really proud of our continued progress of increasing our overall margins over time. We made some hard choices in the midst of COVID to reduce our fixed costs, get back to the core, and focus on our overall profitability. The major shifts of things like our marketing expenses that we just talked about, where 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid, it gives us a lot of leverage for improving our overall profitability. And we're going to continue to do that this year. We continue to make great improvements in our overall variable costs, things like operations and support costs, or community support, infrastructure costs, etc. And then we've just been doing an excellent job of being very judicious with our fixed cost growth. So we've moderated our headcount growth overall. We're growing modestly, and we're investing behind the things that matter most for our guest center hosts. And I think that focus is actually enabling us to deliver even more innovations, as Brian talked about on the call, like, and we've had over 500 improvements to Airbnb in the last several years. And so we're going to continue to manage our fixed costs closely, focusing on the things that matter. So for the back half of the year, we feel confident we're going to be able to exceed our EBITDA margins over the prior year.\nBrian Chesky: And I think I'll just add that, I think that we found that as we get more efficient, we actually grow faster. So I think being incredibly disciplined, incredibly focused, incredibly lean has actually been great for growth.\nDouglas Anmuth: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephen Ju at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So Brian, the shareholder letter is teasing us a little bit with the commentary about Expand Beyond the Core, but there really isn't much there beyond the statement itself. So in addition to experiences, and please share any updates in terms of what you may be doing there, but what could be some of these new directions you might be thinking about that might be products and services for either the host or the consumer. Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Hey, Steven, thanks for the question. It's one of my favorite questions. What are we going to do next? Let me just start and back up. I just want to recap today how I think about this whole space. Before we talk about Expand Beyond the Core, I just want to say one thing about the Core, which is that the hotel industry is more than about 10 times the size of Airbnb. And I think that almost anyone that stays in a hotel could consider staying in an Airbnb. I mean, the spaces are one of a kind. They're often better value, but we need to make sure that we continue to drive value. And I think the next big focus for Airbnb is reliability. We can make Airbnb even nearly as reliable in many markets and hotels. I think you're going to open up a whole new generation of travelers to Airbnb. So I think there's a lot more runway just in the core business. I think we're only scratching the surface, and that's partly why we are so focused on perfecting our core. Now, beyond that, let's talk about what's next, starting from the most nearest adjacencies out international. One of the things we've seen is that Airbnb has a lot of, we've got a lot of scale in the United States, and we've got a lot of scale in top markets in Europe, but actually, Airbnb is under-penetrated in most countries around the world. Just to give you an example, a couple years ago, a few years ago, we were concerned about the lack of penetration we had in Germany. We were also pretty nascent in Brazil. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Brazil is more than double the size, and Germany is more than 60% larger. And Germany is on track now to be one of the largest countries in the world on Airbnb. So we're going to take that playbook, and we're going to bring it to Asia, and we're starting with Japan and Korea. But Asia Pacific is a frontier. It's a huge opportunity for growth. I think that is just one of many markets, including Latin America. And the other thing I should point out within Europe is, beyond UK, beyond France, beyond some of the really top markets, there's a lot of countries in Europe where we're not actually that penetrated. So there's a lot of international expansion. Next would be longer stays. Before the pandemic, only 13% of our business was for monthly stays. Now it's 18%, and it's stable, and we don't think it's going down. In fact, I think this is a huge opportunity. I think all you have to believe is Zoom is here to stay to believe flexibility is here to stay. If you believe that, you're going to see a lot more people either living nominally or some people traveling for the summer, going away for the winter, or extend to weekends, which is a whole new category between travel and housing. So I think that is probably one of the most underrated markets in Airbnb. You have experiences. I thought experiences were going to have a breakout before the pandemic, and instead we had to put them on hold. But the thing we've learned is that people love experiences. 95% of reviews that are left for experiences end in a five-star review. And for our core business homes, it's 84%. So that means that people on a statistical basis like experience even more than homes. And so we think that product is being \u2013 is ready to scale. And so I've been spending a lot of time. I think you're going to see some growth in the years to come. And I'll just add a couple more things. And let me preface this by saying I don't usually like to foreshadow new things before we launch them. I got to get you to tune into our releases, which we do every May and November. But there's a lot of service opportunities on guests and hosts. I think that, whether it's Eats, Amazon, or Etsy, or Alibaba, they've shown there's an entire suite of services that you can offer for hosts. I know I get a lot of questions about paid placement, which is absolutely on the table. But there's many other services as well for hosts. And then in guest services, think about all the services you could get in a hotel or at a resort. And then think of all the services that a hotel couldn't maybe afford to offer because they're at sub-scale. But Airbnb, in many markets, we've got a lot of critical scale. So these are just some of the \u2013 I would just even call it near-term opportunities. But we do have some pretty big ideas. I think AI is basically like a once-in-a-generation platform shift, probably bigger than the shift to mobile, probably more akin to something like the Internet as far as what it can do for new businesses and new business opportunities. And I think that it is a huge opportunity for us to really be in the leading edge of innovation. So that's what we're doing. I'm very, very excited about it. And I will just say that we made a lot of progress the last three years, building a strong business, being profitable. But my strength as CEO is really about expanding beyond the core. So this is where I think we're going to be entering our sweet spot in the coming years to come.\nStephen Ju: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll move next to Bernard McTernan at Needham & Company.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thank you for taking questions. Maybe just start just \u2013 if you could just discuss the booking trends throughout the quarter where April is up 10%, going to June plus 15%, anything that you saw that was driving that better performance throughout the quarter. And then on pricing, you mentioned the new pricing tools focused on affordability. Are we seeing the full impact of that in 3Q, or how should we expect that to trend throughout the coming quarters?\nBrian Chesky: Let me start with the booking trends. What we saw was \u2013 what we shared in the letter, which is that the global booking trends increased from 10% growth year-over-year in April to 15% in June. And if you remember what we saw on Q2 was a hard comparison year-over-year, specifically driven by Europe, where there were delayed bookings in 2022 that compressed more bookings into Q2. That pressure moderated through the quarter, which is the primary reason why we're seeing that acceleration. And interestingly, we actually saw acceleration in total [growth on both book] from Q1 to Q2 in North America. And so I think that was telling about just the strength and resiliency of the North American consumer. And we're continuing to see that strength lead into Q3, which is why we're forecasting further acceleration of Knight's growth from Q2 into Q3. We're seeing great growth in Asia Pacific, as we called out in the letter, over 80 percent growth in APAC. And I'm really pleased with our growth in Latin America. It's twice the size that it was pre-COVID, and it's growing really nicely. And then in terms of the pricing tools, I think that we have seen a number of positive impacts from our pricing tools. As we talked about earlier, in North America, ADR actually being down 1 percent year-over-year when excluding the impact of mixed, it's actually down 4%. I don't think we've seen the full impact of all of those. I think we're going to continue to improve and make the pricing tools better for our hosts. And then to make it more transparent for what the prices are that they should charge so that they know what a competitive rate is. And I think we'll continue to make sure that we're providing great value, because while our prices are either moderating or even coming down, that's in the face of other competing platforms actually increasing rates. And so I think the value gap continues to grow, which just shows the benefit of booking on Airbnb expanding.\nBernard McTernan: Great. Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jacob [indiscernible] at TD Cowen. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Jacob in for Kevin. Thanks for taking my question. We've been getting a lot of questions from investors on potential initiatives that Airbnb could do moving forward to increase take grade, which could maybe include letting advertisers bid on a platform. I was wondering if you could write any details there. Also, you discussed a bit in this call that you had already rolled out expansion tools in Germany and Brazil. I was wondering if you could comment on any of the results that you're seeing so far. Thanks.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I'll start. So with regards to increasing take rate, one of the things I've learned, actually Dave was somebody who told me this, it's something from Jeff Bezos at Amazon. He said that one of the things you have to do as a business leader is you have to be focused, and you have to focus on the most perishable opportunities first. And so I think that the most perishable initial opportunity Airbnb was to get focused and disciplined and really rationalize our cost base. And then when we saw a travel recovery, it was about getting market share. And I think that's still where we're focused on. So, advertising on the platform is a common request. Certainly, it's a common thing I get asked on earnings calls. It is absolutely on the table. I think we could do a very good job at it. It is not one of the most perishable opportunities. It's just why we haven't prioritized it. We're really prioritizing getting Airbnb to as much scale as possible and continue to grow. So, but it is absolutely on the table. And just to dive in this a little bit deeper, there is such an opportunity for us to build differentiated tools, services, and offerings for hosts. You think about it, over the last few years, we made, as Dave referenced, almost over 500 upgrades in innovation. Probably around half of those happened for hosts, literally hundreds of improvements. And most of these we don't charge for. They have nothing to do with our take rate. Our take rate was what it was even before all these, like air cover, which is top to bottom protection with $3 million of damage protection. That is free to our hosts and our competitors don't offer it. I do think though, while we always want to make sure we're providing more value for hosts for whatever we're charging, there's a lot of opportunities. Obviously an advertising platform is one, matching people with homes that need, that don't have time to host with hosts who can host but don't have a home, really matching that marketplace. But I think a lot more, a lot more business that we call them co-hosts, so creating a co-host marketplace is really interesting. And there's a plethora of other services on the host side. And again, there's also a plethora of services on the guest side as well. So those, for things that make the experience better, I would say would be more perishable. With regards to Germany and Brazil, I can have Dave just talk about it in a second. But before I do, I'll just say that, we are, I think the most international travel company in the world, we are not concentrating Europe. We're not concentrating North America. We're truly everywhere. We're in almost every country and region in the world. It's truly a global travel network. And I think we have a really good playbook for how to expand into these markets. And I think Germany and Brazil was a really interesting playbook where we didn't just focus on brand, but we also focus on PR, social media. We leverage like local celebrities that often will do promotions with Airbnb.  And so there's a, and this is, in addition to localizing our product and really making sure we have a key product and we have good supply in the corridors that these people will travel to. I think Germany and Brazil are good stories. Germany is more than 60% larger than it was before the pandemic. I believe Brazil is like 110% larger. I don't know if Dave, you want to go into anything else?\nBrian Chesky: I think you hit it. Well, I'll just reinforce a couple of things. I mean, step one in 80s markets is make sure that we well localized the product. Usually the product can be very consistent globally, but often payment methods are areas where we need to make sure that we're being very localized. And then this full funnel approach is key. Making sure that we have all of the elements, social, NPR, celebrity and brand and search engine marketing. We often start in some of these markets with just the search engine marketing, but that's too narrow and we need the full funnel to see the effect. And I think when we have that full funnel approach, you get the results that we're seeing in Brazil and Germany. That's why we're expanding that on to Asia for both like Japan and South Korea. And then I'll even go back to the potential initiatives for loan because I think it's important to double click on the fact that you have to remember that the majority of our hosts are individual hosts and the things that we need to build are for those individuals So for example, adding advertising, we have to be mindful that we don't just add something like that that can disproportionately benefit professional hosts over individuals and take the balance of the marketplace out of balance. And I think it's really important to do that because that's what's unique and different about Airbnb. We're not built on the backs of professional hosts. We're glad they're there. We're glad they're part of the ecosystem, but it's even more important that we support our individual host community.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question out. Dave, just to go back to earlier question on ADRs being up in 3Q, I get geographic size location, it's better, but could you just give us a little more detail about that so we can understand sort of is that geographic comp structure? What are the sizes you're talking about? We're just trying to understand how to think about the drivers of the ADR growth in the third quarter and the durability of that growth into next year. \nDavid Stephenson: Yes, I think what we're seeing in the near term for Q3 is what we've included here. We're anticipating it to be up year-over-year driven by foreign exchange and the mix shift of larger homes and geographic mix. I think over time, because we're seeing things like Latin America growing nicely, Asia growing nicely and more of cross-border travel, you could see some moderation of our ADRs over time, but again, we're talking moderation, we're talking a percentage point in our here or there. We have better visibility into Q3 right now, which thinks it's going to be up year over year, longer term, it could be flat-ish to maybe moderately down over time, but at the same time, we keep predicting that ADRs are going to decrease and each quarter, it's been amazingly resilient throughout the last few number of quarters, so I don't have much more to say beyond that.\nOperator: We'll go to our next question from James Lee at Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Two here, one on ADR, you guys talk about, obviously, North America decreased by one percent. I was wondering if you can maybe unpack between life alike and maybe next shift, so we can better understand the dynamic. And also secondly, maybe can you talk about the price elasticity as you're allowing hosts to use the tools to adjust the pricing? What do you see from consumer out there, travelers out there, in terms of reacting to those price changes? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Sure, we absolutely measure the price elasticity of our pricing and we see a good benefit from lower pricing driving increased nights overall. I think, obviously, affordability is super important in people's minds all around the world. We definitely see it specifically in North America where while calendar prices have increased, that is the average price available on Airbnb have gone up, the booking prices of what people are actually booking are declining. So that just shows you the desire for people to have great value. In North America specifically, what we saw was it was down 1% year-of-year, but like for like, so that means the same property on average, excluding mix of size, location, and type was actually down 4%. So on a like for like basis our ADRs in North America is actually down 4%. And that's very different than what we're seeing the hotel industry kind of touting increases of six to 10% or more. So that's where the gap in value continues to widen. \nJames Lee: Okay, I have one more question here, Dave. A lot of investors are asking about maybe student loan forgiveness, expiration. I was wondering how you think about this issue, anything that's contemplating into your guidance for FY23. Thanks.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I don't have a specific point of view on the student loan forgiveness and impact on guidance. I think what we're seeing is that in the face -- people keep waiting for the economic shoe to drop and get concerned about whether or not people are willing to travel and whether the economy is going to have a drag on our overall results. And it's just not what we're seeing. We're seeing a strong resilience in travel that people are prioritizing, travel over other things. And all the work that we're doing to make sure that we're providing great value and even either moderating or having prices come down just gives us greater value relative to alternatives, which I think is the tailwind on why we're continuing to, by all of our estimates, gain share of total accommodation nights, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. \nJames Lee: Okay, great, thank you. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Gawrelski at Wells Fargo Securities. \nKen Gawrelski: Hi, thank you. I want to come back to the ADR issue. And Brian, if you could talk about-it was very helpful detail on the 4% kind of like for like in North America, but how do I square Dave's comments that you see overall ADRs kind of flattish over the medium term with your comments that you want to continue to drive affordability? I know you've introduced some tools and you're seeing some impact there. And maybe the follow-up to that is, how will you know when the marketplace is in balance and where you've kind of reached equilibrium and the ADRs in the right place? Thank you. \nBrian Chesky: Again, yes, I'll start. So I think affordability and our prices have to be taken into account relative to the rest of the market. Obviously inflation is up, most everything in the world is more expensive today than it was a year ago. And I presume that will be the case next year this time. We know, for example, that while our price in North America like for like or down 4% hotels are at least 4% higher in some estimates are they might even be approaching double digits higher. And based on recent comments I've been hearing, I think they expect for prices to continue to go up. So if we live in a world where Airbnb prices do not go up and the even remain flat or stable and hotels continue to rise, then Airbnb continues to become more affordable relative to hotels, which are still much larger audience than Airbnb. But that brings up a different question, which is, how do you balance the right prices for guest and host? It's good to the marketplace. And so we have hosts, these aren't just suppliers we have no relationship with. So our goal is not to drive down prices as low as possible. The prices have to find a balance between the very best affordability for guests while still making sure a host can make any meaningful income and it's still really valuable income for them to earn. Now, one of the things we've seen is there's a lot of sensitivities you can look at that we can show hosts that when you lower your prices to a point, you actually will get more business because most hosts have very low occupancy. They're not like hotels. A hotel is usually booked like 20, 25 nights a month. Maybe some hotels are booked 30 days a month. Most hosts are not booked most nights. And so the big deal is that they lower the price just a little bit. They will add more bookings, more nights and they'll end up making more money. There's a point where they lower it so much though that it's no longer worth their while. And that is the secret sauce for us to be able to perfectly balance supply and demand to make sure that both sides it's working for them. And I think that equilibrium, that balance between guests and hosts, that kind of is one of our secret sauces. \nJames Lee: Thank you. \nOperator: And next we'll move to Tom Champion at Piper Sandler. \nTom Champion: Hi, good afternoon. Looks like you've built some tools to stimulate or offer long-term stays. And I'm just curious what you think that will ultimately do to the rate, which is kind of hovered around the 18% rate for room nights to the last couple quarters now. Where do you see that going over time? And then Dave, I guess a question for you. Another very strong quarter for EBITDA margins. What do you see the long-term margin potential of the business over time? Just curious if you've updated that. Thank you. \nBrian Chesky: Hey Tom, I'll take the first one. So long-term stays are 18% of our nights book. Long-term stays obviously defined by a month or longer. And as I mentioned before, they were around 13% before the pandemic. Now, it's very hard to predict exactly how it will change in the next one, two, three, four quarters from now. So I'm not going to make a prediction about where 18% might be in Q4 or next Q1. But what I can say with a fair amount of confidence is I think in the next decade, it's going to be a lot higher than 18%. I think the overall wins are towards longer and longer stays. And the reason why is because more than ever in any time in human history, you've got hundreds of millions of people and one day, perhaps more than a billion people that have a job via laptop that has some incremental flexibility that did not exist 10 or 20 years ago. Think about the number of people that are young that don't have a family and can actually work from a laptop and move around. Then you have people of families that have kids in school that can't do that, but their kids aren't in school in the summer. So you're going to see more and more people still go away from the summer. Many people are thinking about going away for the winter. People are moving away from headquarters, but they might come back, give a work for extended periods. So I think this basic thing we think is going to happen is there's going to be a lot more flexibility in the future. And I think there's going to be a category that is not travel and it's not classic housing, housing as in one year leases or real estate. There's going to be a category in between. And it doesn't even really have a name, but our stays of 30 days are longer. I mean, that is around 100 million nights booked a year. So that is actually a major new category of business that didn't really exist in a meaningful way when we started Airbnb. And if anyone in the world wants to book a stay of a month or longer, and they're going to book site on scene, so they're going to book a place they can't visit and do a tour ahead of time, I think Airbnb is going to be the leading place to do. And there really isn't another global player that you can do with this. So ultimately, I can't predict the short term, but the long term, we're very bullish. And we actually have a lot more features and upgrades in this area of monthly stays that I think will increase adoption. And also to be able to get people that only want to host on a monthly basis to come on Airbnb, that would actually unlock lots of new listings. Dave, I'll hand over to you. \nDavid Stephenson: Yes, thanks for the question, EBITDA margins I am really proud of our progress towards it. We've made some substantial progress based on things like the change in our marketing approach, improvements in variable costs or fixed cost leverage. Also remember that the higher average daily rates have helped our overall margins and kind of accelerated overall profitability. That said, we are in growth mode. I'm really not focused on optimizing margins. I'm proud of the fact that we can grow well and drive great profitable growth, but we are focused on growth. I think the extent that we'll expand our margins over time, I think the biggest opportunity to be with some of the services that Brian mentioned earlier in the call, as we add guests to our host services, I think that will increase the lovers of revenue that we can gain and much of that revenue will flow through to kind of higher overall profitability. But all that said, I don't have a new long-term target. I'm just proud of the fact that we've been able to deliver the profitability we have as quickly as we have.\nTom Champion : Thank you both. \nBrian Chesky: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Mark Mahaney at Evercore ISI. \nMark Mahaney: Okay, I wanted to ask Dave, I wanted to ask a financial question on the impact of AI and Gen AI. And I want to ask it this way, which is, as you think about the P&L impact of these investments over time and applications, do you think it's more likely to lead to improved monetization or improved cost efficiencies? And I'm sure you're going to answer it's both, but if you would lean more on one way or the other, which one would it be? Thanks a lot. \nDavid Stephenson: Thanks Mark. Yes, absolutely, it is both. I think it's timing. I think in the near term, I mean, remember that we actually use a fair amount of AI right now on the product. Like we do it for our party prevention technology, a lot of our matching technologies, while the underlying technologies we have, actually AI driven, it's not so much Gen AI, which is such a huge kind of future opportunity. I think we'll see more leverage in our fixed cost space. So needing fewer people to do more work overall. And so I think that that's going to help both on our fixed costs and some more variable costs. So you'll see us be able to automate more customer service contacts over time. So in the near term, I think you'll see, this is one of the things that we're going to be able to benefit from on our fixed and variable cost leverage. And then over more time, and I think it would be great to have Brian chime in on our future approach with Gen AI, would be how do we even make the service better for our guests and our hosts? I think there's a huge unlock there, but it may take a little more time. \nBrian Chesky: Yes, I'll just share a few things. I mean, I think, obviously as Dave said, probably efficiency in the short term, growth in the long term. Before I talk about the long term, let me just double click on one part of the near term that Dave referred to, which is customer service. So customer service, the strength of Airbnb is that we're one of a kind. We have seven million active listings, more than seven million listings, and everyone is unique, and that is really special. But the problem with Airbnb is it's one of a kind, and sometimes you don't know what you're going to get. And so I think that if we can continue to increase reliability, and then if there's something that goes unexpected, if customer service can quickly fix or mediate the issue, then I think there will be a tipping point where many people that don't consider Airbnb and they only stand hotels would consider Airbnb. And to give you a little more color about this customer service before I go to the future, there are so many more types of issues that could arise staying in Airbnb than a hotel. First of all, when you call a hotel, they're usually one property and they're aware of every room. We're nearly every country in the world. Often guest host will call us, and they will even potentially speak a different language than the person on the other side, the host, the guest and host. There are nearly 70 different policies that you could be adjudicating. Many of these are 100 pages long. So imagine a customer service agent trying to quickly deal with an issue with somebody from two people from two different countries in a neighborhood that the agent may never even have heard of. What AI can do, and we're using a pilot to GPT-4, is AI can read all their policies. No human can ever quickly read all those policies. It can read the case history of both guests and hosts. It could summarize the case issue, and it can even recommend what the ruling should be based on our policies, and it can then write a macro that the customer service agent can basically adopt and amend. If we get all this right, it's going to do things. And in your term, it's going to actually make customer service a lot more effective, because agents will actually be able to handle a lot more tickets than many tickets. You'll never even have to talk to an agent, but also the service to be more reliable, which will unlock more growth. Now, this of course leads to the bigger question. What can we do with AI? And I just wanted to offer a minute or two of thoughts, and I've shared this last earnings, but it's worth repeating. If you were to go to ChatGPT right now, and you ask it a question, and I were to go to chat GPT and ask it a question, we're going to get mostly the same answer. And the reason why is it doesn't know who you are, and it doesn't know who I am, so it does really go with like a mutable truth, like how far's the Earth, the  Moon, or something like that. There's no conditional answers to that. But it turns out in life, there's a whole bunch of questions. And travel is one of these areas where the answer isn't right for everyone. Where should I travel? Where should I stay? Who should I go with? What should I bring? Everyone of these questions depends on who you are. And so we're not going to be building like large research labs to develop these large language models. Those are like infrastructure projects, building bridges, but we're going to build the applications on top of the bridges, like the car. And I think Airbnb is best in class at designing interfaces. I think you've seen that over the last few years. And we can design, I think, a breakthrough interface for AI. I do not think that the AI interface is Chat. Chat, I do not think is the right interface, because you want to interface that's multimodal. It's text, it's image, and it's video. And you can, it's much faster than typing to be able to see what you want. So we think there's a whole new interface. And also, I think it's really important that we provide a lot of personalization, that we learn more about you, that you're not just a unanimous customer. And that's partly why we're investing more and more on account profiles, personalization, really understanding the guests. We want to know more about every guest in Airbnb than any travel company knows about their customer in the world. And if we do that, we can provide much more personalized service and that our app can almost be like an AI concierge that can match you to local experiences, local homes, local places all over the world. And I think the last thing I'll just say about AI is I think the companies that will best succeed in AI, well, think of it this way. Which company's best adopted a mobile? Which company's best adopted the internet? It was the companies that were most innovative, the most product-led. And I think we are very much a product-led, design-led, technology-led company. And we always want to be on the frontier of new tech. So we're working on that. And I think you'll see some exciting things in the years to come. \nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Brian. Thank you, David. \nOperator: And that does conclude the question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian Chesky for closing remarks. \nBrian Chesky: All right, everyone. Well, thank you for joining us today. I just want to recap. Revenue was $2.5 billion, that's 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q2 records. And our trailing 12-month pre-cash flow was $3.9 billion. Now, this represents a free cash flow margin of 43%. We've made a tremendous amount of progress in the first half of the year, but in many ways we're just getting started. In November, we will share a new set of features and upgrades as part of our 2023 winter release. I'm proud to be accomplishing you too. And I look forward to sharing more with you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "Yes, on the marketing back half, I mean, our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue we expect to remain relatively flat year-over-year on a total year basis from 2023 over 2022. We did pull forward more marketing to the first half of the year relative to the second half this year. We've been really pleased with the results. So I mean, remember that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid. I think that's an important differentiator versus others. And then when we do things like the Barbie dream house and other big, events like that, we're able to kind of drive more awareness about Airbnb about the uniqueness of our offerings. And this is a powerful strategy for our marketing. And then in terms of profitability, I'm just really proud of our continued progress of increasing our overall margins over time. We made some hard choices in the midst of COVID to reduce our fixed costs, get back to the core, and focus on our overall profitability. The major shifts of things like our marketing expenses that we just talked about, where 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid, it gives us a lot of leverage for improving our overall profitability. And we're going to continue to do that this year. We continue to make great improvements in our overall variable costs, things like operations and support costs, or community support, infrastructure costs, etc. And then we've just been doing an excellent job of being very judicious with our fixed cost growth. So we've moderated our headcount growth overall. We're growing modestly, and we're investing behind the things that matter most for our guest center hosts. And I think that focus is actually enabling us to deliver even more innovations, as Brian talked about on the call, like, and we've had over 500 improvements to Airbnb in the last several years. And so we're going to continue to manage our fixed costs closely, focusing on the things that matter. So for the back half of the year, we feel confident we're going to be able to exceed our EBITDA margins over the prior year. Yes, I'll start. So with regards to increasing take rate, one of the things I've learned, actually Dave was somebody who told me this, it's something from Jeff Bezos at Amazon. He said that one of the things you have to do as a business leader is you have to be focused, and you have to focus on the most perishable opportunities first. And so I think that the most perishable initial opportunity Airbnb was to get focused and disciplined and really rationalize our cost base. And then when we saw a travel recovery, it was about getting market share. And I think that's still where we're focused on. So, advertising on the platform is a common request. Certainly, it's a common thing I get asked on earnings calls. It is absolutely on the table. I think we could do a very good job at it. It is not one of the most perishable opportunities. It's just why we haven't prioritized it. We're really prioritizing getting Airbnb to as much scale as possible and continue to grow. So, but it is absolutely on the table. And just to dive in this a little bit deeper, there is such an opportunity for us to build differentiated tools, services, and offerings for hosts. You think about it, over the last few years, we made, as Dave referenced, almost over 500 upgrades in innovation. Probably around half of those happened for hosts, literally hundreds of improvements. And most of these we don't charge for. They have nothing to do with our take rate. Our take rate was what it was even before all these, like air cover, which is top to bottom protection with $3 million of damage protection. That is free to our hosts and our competitors don't offer it. I do think though, while we always want to make sure we're providing more value for hosts for whatever we're charging, there's a lot of opportunities. Obviously an advertising platform is one, matching people with homes that need, that don't have time to host with hosts who can host but don't have a home, really matching that marketplace. But I think a lot more, a lot more business that we call them co-hosts, so creating a co-host marketplace is really interesting. And there's a plethora of other services on the host side. And again, there's also a plethora of services on the guest side as well. So those, for things that make the experience better, I would say would be more perishable. With regards to Germany and Brazil, I can have Dave just talk about it in a second. But before I do, I'll just say that, we are, I think the most international travel company in the world, we are not concentrating Europe. We're not concentrating North America. We're truly everywhere. We're in almost every country and region in the world. It's truly a global travel network. And I think we have a really good playbook for how to expand into these markets. And I think Germany and Brazil was a really interesting playbook where we didn't just focus on brand, but we also focus on PR, social media. We leverage like local celebrities that often will do promotions with Airbnb.  And so there's a, and this is, in addition to localizing our product and really making sure we have a key product and we have good supply in the corridors that these people will travel to. I think Germany and Brazil are good stories. Germany is more than 60% larger than it was before the pandemic. I believe Brazil is like 110% larger. I don't know if Dave, you want to go into anything else? Yes, I think what we're seeing in the near term for Q3 is what we've included here. We're anticipating it to be up year-over-year driven by foreign exchange and the mix shift of larger homes and geographic mix. I think over time, because we're seeing things like Latin America growing nicely, Asia growing nicely and more of cross-border travel, you could see some moderation of our ADRs over time, but again, we're talking moderation, we're talking a percentage point in our here or there. We have better visibility into Q3 right now, which thinks it's going to be up year over year, longer term, it could be flat-ish to maybe moderately down over time, but at the same time, we keep predicting that ADRs are going to decrease and each quarter, it's been amazingly resilient throughout the last few number of quarters, so I don't have much more to say beyond that. Yes. I don't have a specific point of view on the student loan forgiveness and impact on guidance. I think what we're seeing is that in the face -- people keep waiting for the economic shoe to drop and get concerned about whether or not people are willing to travel and whether the economy is going to have a drag on our overall results. And it's just not what we're seeing. We're seeing a strong resilience in travel that people are prioritizing, travel over other things. And all the work that we're doing to make sure that we're providing great value and even either moderating or having prices come down just gives us greater value relative to alternatives, which I think is the tailwind on why we're continuing to, by all of our estimates, gain share of total accommodation nights, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Yes, thanks for the question, EBITDA margins I am really proud of our progress towards it. We've made some substantial progress based on things like the change in our marketing approach, improvements in variable costs or fixed cost leverage. Also remember that the higher average daily rates have helped our overall margins and kind of accelerated overall profitability. That said, we are in growth mode. I'm really not focused on optimizing margins. I'm proud of the fact that we can grow well and drive great profitable growth, but we are focused on growth. I think the extent that we'll expand our margins over time, I think the biggest opportunity to be with some of the services that Brian mentioned earlier in the call, as we add guests to our host services, I think that will increase the lovers of revenue that we can gain and much of that revenue will flow through to kind of higher overall profitability. But all that said, I don't have a new long-term target. I'm just proud of the fact that we've been able to deliver the profitability we have as quickly as we have. Thanks Mark. Yes, absolutely, it is both. I think it's timing. I think in the near term, I mean, remember that we actually use a fair amount of AI right now on the product. Like we do it for our party prevention technology, a lot of our matching technologies, while the underlying technologies we have, actually AI driven, it's not so much Gen AI, which is such a huge kind of future opportunity. I think we'll see more leverage in our fixed cost space. So needing fewer people to do more work overall. And so I think that that's going to help both on our fixed costs and some more variable costs. So you'll see us be able to automate more customer service contacts over time. So in the near term, I think you'll see, this is one of the things that we're going to be able to benefit from on our fixed and variable cost leverage. And then over more time, and I think it would be great to have Brian chime in on our future approach with Gen AI, would be how do we even make the service better for our guests and our hosts? I think there's a huge unlock there, but it may take a little more time."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Thank you Ellie. And Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining today. I'm excited to share our results with you. Q2 was another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had over 115 million nights and experiences booked. Revenue of $2.5 billion grew 18% year-over-year. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 19% year-over-year. Net income was $650 million, representing a net income margin of 26%, our highest second quarter ever. And free cash flow for the quarter was $900 million, up 13% year-over-year. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $3.9 billion. And this represented a trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of 43%. And because of our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we were able to repurchase $2.5 billion of our stock in the last 12 months, which is more than offset the impact of shared dilution. Now, during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand in Airbnb remained strong. Nights and experiences booked increased 11% in Q2 compared to a year ago. Active bookers grew in every region, and we had more first-time bookers compared to a year ago. In fact, we've now had more than 1.5 billion guest arrivals since starting Airbnb. Second, guests are traveling farther. Cross-border nights booked increased 16% in Q2 compared to a year ago. And we are especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific, where inbound international travel increased 80% compared to this time last year. And we also saw cross-border nights booked to North America increase 20% year-over-year. And finally, the third trend we're seeing is that guests are staying longer on Airbnb. Millions of people remain flexible about where they live and work, and we see this reflected in our bookings. In Q2, long-term stays remain 18% of total nights booked. And throughout the quarter, we saw an acceleration in year-over-year growth in bookings for month these days. Now, while the ability to travel and work remotely has been an important part of long-term stay growth, people are also extending their typical weekend stays by an extra night or two. In fact, in the past six quarters, long stays, long weekend stays have been the fastest growing trip type on Airbnb. I think this is just evidence of the incremental flexibility people have post-pandemic. Now, given that we're halfway through 2023, I just want to provide a very quick update on the progress we made across our three strategic priorities. First, we are focused on making hosting mainstream. With supply growth stagnated at the beginning of COVID, we developed a new strategy to recruit more hosts. Since then, we've been focused on raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started, and improving our tools for hosts. And our strategy is working.  In Q2, supply growth is 19% year-over-year, and this is actually up from 18% in Q1. In fact, in every quarter since we've gone public, we've seen an acceleration in total active listings growth. And we're continuing to see strong supply growth across all regions, all market types, and all price points. In fact, we added a record number of new listings in Q2, and we ended the quarter with more than 7 million total active listings. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every detail. Millions of people have given us feedback on how to improve Airbnb. We've listened. On May 3rd, we introduced over 50 new features and upgrades as part of our 2023 summer release. Now many of these new features and upgrades were aimed at addressing affordability, starting with new pricing tools for hosts. Hosts told us that our pricing tools are difficult to use. So we redesigned our tools, and we made it easier for hosts to add discounts and promotions. They also told us that they had trouble setting competitive prices. So we added a new feature called similar listings to help them see listings in their area so they know what to charge. Now we received very positive feedback from our hosts, and the changes are already having an impact. Hosts have started lowering their prices, and and with more of them offering weekly and monthly discounts. And as more hosts adopt these tools, we believe we'll be able to drive greater affordability and value for guests. We also rolled out more affordable monthly stays. Guests are staying longer in Airbnb. So we took steps to make longer stays more affordable. We significantly reduced fees for stays longer than three months. We started offering U.S. guests the option to save money by paying with their bank account, and we made it easier for hosts to offer monthly discounts. And as a result, the percentage of our new active listings to offer monthly discount jumped from 22% to 50%. Now we took another step to address affordability with the launch of Airbnb rooms. Airbnb rooms takes us back to our founding ethos of sharing, and it's one of the most affordable ways to travel. Airbnb rooms have an average price of only $67 per night, significantly lower than the average hotel room. Given the increased price sensitivity for many guests, especially the next generation of travelers, this is going to remain an important category for Airbnb. And finally, our third strategic priority is to expand beyond the core. We spent the past few years perfecting our core service. We've rolled out hundreds of new features and upgrades. And today, our core is stronger and more profitable than ever, but we're not stopping there because we have some big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. And we're building the foundational capability for these new product and services that we plan to launch in the years to come. Now, before I turn to Q&A, I want to tell you about a recent campaign that highlights what makes Airbnb unique. Airbnb is known for one of a kind listings. As I'm sure you know, the Barbie movie just came out in theaters. And in celebration of the premiere, we partnered with Warner Brothers and Mattel to transform a home into the Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse. And we launched it as part of our Only on Airbnb campaign. Only on Airbnb caps in the global pop culture moments, inspiring guests with some of the most iconic homes in the world. The Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse has been a sensation, and it is now Airbnb's most popular listing ever. We saw 13,000 press hits and more than 250 million social media impressions since it was announced. And to give you a sense of how much that is, that is twice, more than twice as many press hits as were generated from our IPO. Only on Airbnb campaigns are an effective way to introduce Airbnb and our unique inventory to new guests, and they'll be an important part of our playbook going forward. So those are the results that we have to share for Q2. And with that, Dave and I look forward to answering your question. Yes, the listing type mix shift is just simply the mix of types of listings, either geographic type of size of home location, that's right in the mix. And so ADRs coming up due to that. And it's also being coming up in the third quarter driven by foreign exchange. Yes, that's Mario. I can answer that. We always want to make sure that we're providing the very best value for our guests. We identified this is a huge opportunity where we could drive incremental conversion by taking take rates down after the third month. And we saw some really great results. That being said, I do not expect our take rates to change materially. There may be some segments or trip types or geographies where we would want to take it down, but that could be offset by other areas that could come up. And so generally, I would expect it to be pretty stable. And the way that we're going to see margin expansion is by launching incremental services for guests and hosts over the coming years. Yes. Hey, Jed, I can start and I'll hand over to Dave. So our supply, I mean, let me just back up, our supply has actually been really, really strong. You might remember that being a COVID, we were, we flagged this as something we need to work on. That's why we created an initiative called mainstreaming hosting. And the results have been very successful. In fact, supply growth is growing 19% year-over-year. And in fact, urban is actually growing faster in vacation. Urban is growing 20% whereas vacation is growing 19%. So that is pretty stable. And as far as the number of individual hosts versus what we describe as professional hosts, around 90% of our hosts remain individuals. I'll hand over to Dave. Yes, maybe I'll just add one thing about marketing is just, it's a full funnel approach. And last year we got 600,000 articles written about us. So people talk a lot about Airbnb. And now I think what you're also seeing is social media, whether it's the only on program Barbie or just generally every means social media is just a topic of conversation. I think that is just a testament to when you invest in a brand, when your brand's a noun and a verb, and you have something unique, you get a lot of those benefits. And I think it's going to be consistent and we'll have pretty consistent marketing expenses to send a revenue over time because of the strength of the brand. I don't, we're not able to hear the second question. I don't think. Can you say one more time? Yes, so I'll take the first question and I'll hand over to Dave. On affordability, our prices have, have obviously risen since pre-pandemic and the growth has been incredible in the business is nearly about twice the size that was pre-pandemic. That being said, in the long run, Airbnb started as an affordable alternative to hotels. And I think that we always have to remember that for every dollar people spend on Airbnb, they spend as much as many as $10 in the world on hotels. So we're still a very small player in a very large market. And I think that one of our big opportunities is to make sure we continue to be affordable. Last year, we got a lot of feedback from the community that Airbnb wasn't as affordable as it used to be. So we made a bunch of changes. We highlighted some of these in my opening remarks. What we've seen though, since then, I'll answer your question. People, the book prices on Airbnb, on average, are lower than the listed prices. So we do see people gravitating towards more affordable stays listed in Airbnb. It's partly why we launched a feature called similar listings, which help us see the listings that we're getting booked. And what hosts I think discovered was the most popular listings that made the most money offered many times the very best value. And so this was, in a sense, a win-win for guests in the house by really trying to build better tools. I also just want to point out one thing, which is our prices are essentially flat year by year. I think they're about 1% up year-over-year, but in North America, our prices are now down 1%. Now, when you take out mixed shifts, because people are booking larger homes, our prices in North America are actually down 4%. And if you compare it to hotels, depending upon which data you take, hotels are up some between 4% or as much as 10%. And it seems like hotels are suggesting, based on some of the public remarks, that they aren't going to come down. In fact, those prices might come up. So to answer your question, I think people come to Airbnb for one of the kindspaces at great value. And if we can keep prices very affordable, and then also focus on reliability, I think there's going to be a lot of demand to come. And I think I'll just add that, I think that we found that as we get more efficient, we actually grow faster. So I think being incredibly disciplined, incredibly focused, incredibly lean has actually been great for growth. Hey, Steven, thanks for the question. It's one of my favorite questions. What are we going to do next? Let me just start and back up. I just want to recap today how I think about this whole space. Before we talk about Expand Beyond the Core, I just want to say one thing about the Core, which is that the hotel industry is more than about 10 times the size of Airbnb. And I think that almost anyone that stays in a hotel could consider staying in an Airbnb. I mean, the spaces are one of a kind. They're often better value, but we need to make sure that we continue to drive value. And I think the next big focus for Airbnb is reliability. We can make Airbnb even nearly as reliable in many markets and hotels. I think you're going to open up a whole new generation of travelers to Airbnb. So I think there's a lot more runway just in the core business. I think we're only scratching the surface, and that's partly why we are so focused on perfecting our core. Now, beyond that, let's talk about what's next, starting from the most nearest adjacencies out international. One of the things we've seen is that Airbnb has a lot of, we've got a lot of scale in the United States, and we've got a lot of scale in top markets in Europe, but actually, Airbnb is under-penetrated in most countries around the world. Just to give you an example, a couple years ago, a few years ago, we were concerned about the lack of penetration we had in Germany. We were also pretty nascent in Brazil. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Brazil is more than double the size, and Germany is more than 60% larger. And Germany is on track now to be one of the largest countries in the world on Airbnb. So we're going to take that playbook, and we're going to bring it to Asia, and we're starting with Japan and Korea. But Asia Pacific is a frontier. It's a huge opportunity for growth. I think that is just one of many markets, including Latin America. And the other thing I should point out within Europe is, beyond UK, beyond France, beyond some of the really top markets, there's a lot of countries in Europe where we're not actually that penetrated. So there's a lot of international expansion. Next would be longer stays. Before the pandemic, only 13% of our business was for monthly stays. Now it's 18%, and it's stable, and we don't think it's going down. In fact, I think this is a huge opportunity. I think all you have to believe is Zoom is here to stay to believe flexibility is here to stay. If you believe that, you're going to see a lot more people either living nominally or some people traveling for the summer, going away for the winter, or extend to weekends, which is a whole new category between travel and housing. So I think that is probably one of the most underrated markets in Airbnb. You have experiences. I thought experiences were going to have a breakout before the pandemic, and instead we had to put them on hold. But the thing we've learned is that people love experiences. 95% of reviews that are left for experiences end in a five-star review. And for our core business homes, it's 84%. So that means that people on a statistical basis like experience even more than homes. And so we think that product is being \u2013 is ready to scale. And so I've been spending a lot of time. I think you're going to see some growth in the years to come. And I'll just add a couple more things. And let me preface this by saying I don't usually like to foreshadow new things before we launch them. I got to get you to tune into our releases, which we do every May and November. But there's a lot of service opportunities on guests and hosts. I think that, whether it's Eats, Amazon, or Etsy, or Alibaba, they've shown there's an entire suite of services that you can offer for hosts. I know I get a lot of questions about paid placement, which is absolutely on the table. But there's many other services as well for hosts. And then in guest services, think about all the services you could get in a hotel or at a resort. And then think of all the services that a hotel couldn't maybe afford to offer because they're at sub-scale. But Airbnb, in many markets, we've got a lot of critical scale. So these are just some of the \u2013 I would just even call it near-term opportunities. But we do have some pretty big ideas. I think AI is basically like a once-in-a-generation platform shift, probably bigger than the shift to mobile, probably more akin to something like the Internet as far as what it can do for new businesses and new business opportunities. And I think that it is a huge opportunity for us to really be in the leading edge of innovation. So that's what we're doing. I'm very, very excited about it. And I will just say that we made a lot of progress the last three years, building a strong business, being profitable. But my strength as CEO is really about expanding beyond the core. So this is where I think we're going to be entering our sweet spot in the coming years to come. Let me start with the booking trends. What we saw was \u2013 what we shared in the letter, which is that the global booking trends increased from 10% growth year-over-year in April to 15% in June. And if you remember what we saw on Q2 was a hard comparison year-over-year, specifically driven by Europe, where there were delayed bookings in 2022 that compressed more bookings into Q2. That pressure moderated through the quarter, which is the primary reason why we're seeing that acceleration. And interestingly, we actually saw acceleration in total [growth on both book] from Q1 to Q2 in North America. And so I think that was telling about just the strength and resiliency of the North American consumer. And we're continuing to see that strength lead into Q3, which is why we're forecasting further acceleration of Knight's growth from Q2 into Q3. We're seeing great growth in Asia Pacific, as we called out in the letter, over 80 percent growth in APAC. And I'm really pleased with our growth in Latin America. It's twice the size that it was pre-COVID, and it's growing really nicely. And then in terms of the pricing tools, I think that we have seen a number of positive impacts from our pricing tools. As we talked about earlier, in North America, ADR actually being down 1 percent year-over-year when excluding the impact of mixed, it's actually down 4%. I don't think we've seen the full impact of all of those. I think we're going to continue to improve and make the pricing tools better for our hosts. And then to make it more transparent for what the prices are that they should charge so that they know what a competitive rate is. And I think we'll continue to make sure that we're providing great value, because while our prices are either moderating or even coming down, that's in the face of other competing platforms actually increasing rates. And so I think the value gap continues to grow, which just shows the benefit of booking on Airbnb expanding. I think you hit it. Well, I'll just reinforce a couple of things. I mean, step one in 80s markets is make sure that we well localized the product. Usually the product can be very consistent globally, but often payment methods are areas where we need to make sure that we're being very localized. And then this full funnel approach is key. Making sure that we have all of the elements, social, NPR, celebrity and brand and search engine marketing. We often start in some of these markets with just the search engine marketing, but that's too narrow and we need the full funnel to see the effect. And I think when we have that full funnel approach, you get the results that we're seeing in Brazil and Germany. That's why we're expanding that on to Asia for both like Japan and South Korea. And then I'll even go back to the potential initiatives for loan because I think it's important to double click on the fact that you have to remember that the majority of our hosts are individual hosts and the things that we need to build are for those individuals So for example, adding advertising, we have to be mindful that we don't just add something like that that can disproportionately benefit professional hosts over individuals and take the balance of the marketplace out of balance. And I think it's really important to do that because that's what's unique and different about Airbnb. We're not built on the backs of professional hosts. We're glad they're there. We're glad they're part of the ecosystem, but it's even more important that we support our individual host community. Sure, we absolutely measure the price elasticity of our pricing and we see a good benefit from lower pricing driving increased nights overall. I think, obviously, affordability is super important in people's minds all around the world. We definitely see it specifically in North America where while calendar prices have increased, that is the average price available on Airbnb have gone up, the booking prices of what people are actually booking are declining. So that just shows you the desire for people to have great value. In North America specifically, what we saw was it was down 1% year-of-year, but like for like, so that means the same property on average, excluding mix of size, location, and type was actually down 4%. So on a like for like basis our ADRs in North America is actually down 4%. And that's very different than what we're seeing the hotel industry kind of touting increases of six to 10% or more. So that's where the gap in value continues to widen. Again, yes, I'll start. So I think affordability and our prices have to be taken into account relative to the rest of the market. Obviously inflation is up, most everything in the world is more expensive today than it was a year ago. And I presume that will be the case next year this time. We know, for example, that while our price in North America like for like or down 4% hotels are at least 4% higher in some estimates are they might even be approaching double digits higher. And based on recent comments I've been hearing, I think they expect for prices to continue to go up. So if we live in a world where Airbnb prices do not go up and the even remain flat or stable and hotels continue to rise, then Airbnb continues to become more affordable relative to hotels, which are still much larger audience than Airbnb. But that brings up a different question, which is, how do you balance the right prices for guest and host? It's good to the marketplace. And so we have hosts, these aren't just suppliers we have no relationship with. So our goal is not to drive down prices as low as possible. The prices have to find a balance between the very best affordability for guests while still making sure a host can make any meaningful income and it's still really valuable income for them to earn. Now, one of the things we've seen is there's a lot of sensitivities you can look at that we can show hosts that when you lower your prices to a point, you actually will get more business because most hosts have very low occupancy. They're not like hotels. A hotel is usually booked like 20, 25 nights a month. Maybe some hotels are booked 30 days a month. Most hosts are not booked most nights. And so the big deal is that they lower the price just a little bit. They will add more bookings, more nights and they'll end up making more money. There's a point where they lower it so much though that it's no longer worth their while. And that is the secret sauce for us to be able to perfectly balance supply and demand to make sure that both sides it's working for them. And I think that equilibrium, that balance between guests and hosts, that kind of is one of our secret sauces. Hey Tom, I'll take the first one. So long-term stays are 18% of our nights book. Long-term stays obviously defined by a month or longer. And as I mentioned before, they were around 13% before the pandemic. Now, it's very hard to predict exactly how it will change in the next one, two, three, four quarters from now. So I'm not going to make a prediction about where 18% might be in Q4 or next Q1. But what I can say with a fair amount of confidence is I think in the next decade, it's going to be a lot higher than 18%. I think the overall wins are towards longer and longer stays. And the reason why is because more than ever in any time in human history, you've got hundreds of millions of people and one day, perhaps more than a billion people that have a job via laptop that has some incremental flexibility that did not exist 10 or 20 years ago. Think about the number of people that are young that don't have a family and can actually work from a laptop and move around. Then you have people of families that have kids in school that can't do that, but their kids aren't in school in the summer. So you're going to see more and more people still go away from the summer. Many people are thinking about going away for the winter. People are moving away from headquarters, but they might come back, give a work for extended periods. So I think this basic thing we think is going to happen is there's going to be a lot more flexibility in the future. And I think there's going to be a category that is not travel and it's not classic housing, housing as in one year leases or real estate. There's going to be a category in between. And it doesn't even really have a name, but our stays of 30 days are longer. I mean, that is around 100 million nights booked a year. So that is actually a major new category of business that didn't really exist in a meaningful way when we started Airbnb. And if anyone in the world wants to book a stay of a month or longer, and they're going to book site on scene, so they're going to book a place they can't visit and do a tour ahead of time, I think Airbnb is going to be the leading place to do. And there really isn't another global player that you can do with this. So ultimately, I can't predict the short term, but the long term, we're very bullish. And we actually have a lot more features and upgrades in this area of monthly stays that I think will increase adoption. And also to be able to get people that only want to host on a monthly basis to come on Airbnb, that would actually unlock lots of new listings. Dave, I'll hand over to you. Thank you. Yes, I'll just share a few things. I mean, I think, obviously as Dave said, probably efficiency in the short term, growth in the long term. Before I talk about the long term, let me just double click on one part of the near term that Dave referred to, which is customer service. So customer service, the strength of Airbnb is that we're one of a kind. We have seven million active listings, more than seven million listings, and everyone is unique, and that is really special. But the problem with Airbnb is it's one of a kind, and sometimes you don't know what you're going to get. And so I think that if we can continue to increase reliability, and then if there's something that goes unexpected, if customer service can quickly fix or mediate the issue, then I think there will be a tipping point where many people that don't consider Airbnb and they only stand hotels would consider Airbnb. And to give you a little more color about this customer service before I go to the future, there are so many more types of issues that could arise staying in Airbnb than a hotel. First of all, when you call a hotel, they're usually one property and they're aware of every room. We're nearly every country in the world. Often guest host will call us, and they will even potentially speak a different language than the person on the other side, the host, the guest and host. There are nearly 70 different policies that you could be adjudicating. Many of these are 100 pages long. So imagine a customer service agent trying to quickly deal with an issue with somebody from two people from two different countries in a neighborhood that the agent may never even have heard of. What AI can do, and we're using a pilot to GPT-4, is AI can read all their policies. No human can ever quickly read all those policies. It can read the case history of both guests and hosts. It could summarize the case issue, and it can even recommend what the ruling should be based on our policies, and it can then write a macro that the customer service agent can basically adopt and amend. If we get all this right, it's going to do things. And in your term, it's going to actually make customer service a lot more effective, because agents will actually be able to handle a lot more tickets than many tickets. You'll never even have to talk to an agent, but also the service to be more reliable, which will unlock more growth. Now, this of course leads to the bigger question. What can we do with AI? And I just wanted to offer a minute or two of thoughts, and I've shared this last earnings, but it's worth repeating. If you were to go to ChatGPT right now, and you ask it a question, and I were to go to chat GPT and ask it a question, we're going to get mostly the same answer. And the reason why is it doesn't know who you are, and it doesn't know who I am, so it does really go with like a mutable truth, like how far's the Earth, the  Moon, or something like that. There's no conditional answers to that. But it turns out in life, there's a whole bunch of questions. And travel is one of these areas where the answer isn't right for everyone. Where should I travel? Where should I stay? Who should I go with? What should I bring? Everyone of these questions depends on who you are. And so we're not going to be building like large research labs to develop these large language models. Those are like infrastructure projects, building bridges, but we're going to build the applications on top of the bridges, like the car. And I think Airbnb is best in class at designing interfaces. I think you've seen that over the last few years. And we can design, I think, a breakthrough interface for AI. I do not think that the AI interface is Chat. Chat, I do not think is the right interface, because you want to interface that's multimodal. It's text, it's image, and it's video. And you can, it's much faster than typing to be able to see what you want. So we think there's a whole new interface. And also, I think it's really important that we provide a lot of personalization, that we learn more about you, that you're not just a unanimous customer. And that's partly why we're investing more and more on account profiles, personalization, really understanding the guests. We want to know more about every guest in Airbnb than any travel company knows about their customer in the world. And if we do that, we can provide much more personalized service and that our app can almost be like an AI concierge that can match you to local experiences, local homes, local places all over the world. And I think the last thing I'll just say about AI is I think the companies that will best succeed in AI, well, think of it this way. Which company's best adopted a mobile? Which company's best adopted the internet? It was the companies that were most innovative, the most product-led. And I think we are very much a product-led, design-led, technology-led company. And we always want to be on the frontier of new tech. So we're working on that. And I think you'll see some exciting things in the years to come. All right, everyone. Well, thank you for joining us today. I just want to recap. Revenue was $2.5 billion, that's 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q2 records. And our trailing 12-month pre-cash flow was $3.9 billion. Now, this represents a free cash flow margin of 43%. We've made a tremendous amount of progress in the first half of the year, but in many ways we're just getting started. In November, we will share a new set of features and upgrades as part of our 2023 winter release. I'm proud to be accomplishing you too. And I look forward to sharing more with you next quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Airbnb's earnings conference call for the First Quarter of 2023. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance. Please go ahead.\nEllie Mertz: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's First Quarter of 2023 Earnings Call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb's Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson.  Earlier today, we issued a Shareholder Letter with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter of 2023. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks, and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-looking Statements in our Shareholder Letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Shareholder Letter posted to our IR website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share our Q1 results with you now. We had a strong start to 2023. We had over 120 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q1. This was a record high [Technical Difficulty] change. Our revenue increased 24% year-over-year. Net income was $117 million, making this our most profitable Q1 on a GAAP basis. And free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion. This represented a trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of 44%. Because of our strong balance sheet, we were able to repurchase $2 billion of our stock in the last 9 months. And today, we're pleased to announce that our Board just approved a new repurchase authorization for up to $2.5 billion of our Class A common stock. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of really positive business trends. First, more guests are traveling on Airbnb than ever before. Knights and Experiences Booked increased 19% in Q1 compared to a year ago, and we've seen our highest number of active bookers ever despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties. During the quarter, we also saw guests booking trips further in advance, supporting a strong backlog for Q2. Second, more guests are traveling overseas and returning to cities. Cross-border gross nights booked increased 36% in Q1 compared to last year. Now we were especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific as nights booked in Q1 increased more than 40% year-over-year. And we saw international travel from other regions to Asia Pacific increased 160% during the quarter compared to this time last year. Additionally, cross-border nights booked to North America increased once again, with 34% of year-over-year growth in Q1 relative to 31% last quarter. And we've also seen high-density urban nights booked increased 20% year-over-year. Third, guests are continuing to use Airbnb for longer stays. In Q1, long-term stays were 18% of total gross nights booked. And over the past 3 years, we've seen new use cases emerge as guests across all regions and age groups use Airbnb for long-term stays. And finally, supply growth continued to accelerate. In Q1, we grew supply 18% year-over-year, and this is up from 16% in Q4. We saw double-digit supply growth around the world with the fastest growth in North America and Latin America. Urban and nonurban supply growth, in fact, both grew 18%. Now looking ahead, we remain focused on our 3 strategic priorities. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We want hosting to be as popular as traveling on Airbnb. And to do this, we're raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started and providing even better tools for our hosts. And our approach is working. In fact, in every quarter since we went public, we have seen acceleration in the year-over-year growth of our total active listings. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every single detail. Last week, we introduced over 50 new features and upgrades as part of our 2023 Summer Release. Everything we launched was based on direct feedback from our guests and hosts. This included pricing tools, transparent checkout instructions, faster customer service and more. And we also responded to input on rising prices, with the rollout of Airbnb Rooms, an all-new take on the original Airbnb. Now I'm going to share a little bit more about what will be launched in a moment. And finally, we're expanding beyond our core. We have some big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. We're building the foundation for new products and services that we plan to launch in 2024 and beyond. At the same time, Airbnb is still underpenetrated in many markets around the world. So we're increasing our focus on these less mature markets, and we are already seeing positive results. So let me just give you 2 examples. In Germany and Brazil, we rolled out our expansion playbook for accelerated growth. And as a result, we are now 2 -- they are now 2 of our fastest-growing markets. And this playbook has, in fact, worked so well. So we are now expanding it to other markets around the world.  Now before we go to questions, I want to talk a little bit about our 2023 Summer Release. Last week, we introduced the most extensive set of improvements ever to Airbnb, and it was all based on feedback from our community. We took a design-driven approach to perfecting our core service. We created a blueprint of the entire experience: every screen, every policy and every interaction with customer service. We then analyzed millions of calls and thousands of social media posts. And we hosted listening sessions with guests and hosts all over the world. And we mapped all this feedback against our blueprint and we prioritized the most common issues. And on May 3, we introduced Airbnb Rooms and unveiled over 50 new features and upgrades for guests and hosts. So let me share a few highlights with you. First is total price display. Guests told us, our prices aren't transparent enough. With total price display, guests can now view the total price with fees before taxes across the entire app. Second, new pricing tools for hosts. We heard from hosts that it's hard to use our pricing tools, and it's difficult to know what the charge. So to help our hosts set more competitive prices, they can now see other Airbnbs are priced in their area. And this includes listings that are both in high demand and getting booked as well as listings that are not. And finally, we also made it simpler to add discounts and promotions for hosts. And third is more affordable stays. Longer stays on Airbnb can be expensive, so we're doing a few things about it. We're reducing our fees after 3 months. U.S. guests can now save money by paying with their bank account, and hosts can easily set monthly discounts and offer more flexible cancellations. Finally, we also introduced Airbnb Rooms, an all-new take on the original Airbnb Private Room. Airbnb Rooms gets us back to the idea that started it all, back to our founding ethos of sharing. And they're also one of the most affordable ways of travel, with an average price of only $67 a night. In fact, over 80% of Airbnb Rooms are under $100 a night. And in the current macroeconomic environment, people want to travel affordably. But guests have told us that they want to know more about who they're staying with before they book. So that's why every Airbnb Room comes with a host passport, which helps guests get to know their host before they book. In response to last week and our 2023 Summer Release has exceeded our expectations. Press coverage was overwhelmingly positive, and we got over 3,000 articles. This is the most press we've ever had from the launch. On social media, our Tweets got 19 million impressions. It really went far and wide on social. But the most important thing we heard is that our guests and our hosts feel like we're listening to their top concerns. If we're not done listening, it will never stop improving Airbnb. So with that, I look forward, Dave and I, to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: I want to come back to the Summer Release from a couple of days ago and come back to the concept of room. Can you help us better understand what you think that will do in terms of generating supply growth and coupled with it generating demand and new traveler growth to the platform as you look out over the next 12, 18 months?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I'm here. How are you doing? Yes. So I'm very excited about Airbnb Rooms, because Airbnb Rooms is one of the most affordable ways to travel on Airbnb. We've been doing a lot of listening to guests on Airbnb. And one of the things they told us is, especially in this economic environment, they are looking for affordable ways to travel on Airbnb. And the average price of Airbnb Rooms is $67 a night. So it's an incredible value. And what we wanted to do is offer a product that we thought could capture this affordability segment that we think more and more people are going to be interested in, in this economy and also launch a product that will be very relevant to the next generation of travelers. Essentially, I wanted to launch a product that the 26-year-old me would have wanted. And we looked at our private rooms product, and we already had 1 million listings all over the world, but there was a bit of an obstacle. During the pandemic, people weren't comfortable staying with one another. And to get people more comfortable, we realized that we needed to help people understand the host they're staying with before they book. And so that's why we launched the Airbnb Host Passport. I think this is going to help a lot of people that are looking to save money and are interested in the local travel experience, be encouraged to stay in Airbnb Rooms. We also added new privacy features to understand if there's a lock in the bedroom door, if the bathroom is private. And we think all these different features are going to definitely help Airbnb Rooms. The final thing I'm going to say, Eric, is that we have a major brand campaign coming this summer, where we are going to be promoting Airbnb Rooms. If we are successful, I think this is going to bring in a whole new cohort of younger travelers, people that maybe weren't inclined to travel may now be able to travel and hopefully should list the overall marketplace for Airbnb.\nOperator: Next, we'll move to Justin Patterson at KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: So if I can, first, to follow up on Eric's question around the Summer Release. Brian, you recently made some comments about AI being a meaningful opportunity for Airbnb going forward. Could you talk about how that just reshapes or helps you reimagine the travel experience going forward and some of the initiatives you might lean into around AI? And then Dave, I appreciate you only give guidepost on the full year versus explicit guidance. Given the room night comp and expense shift in Q2 as well as the dynamic around new pricing tools in the Summer Release, could you help us understand a little bit more some of the assumptions that go into the second half and about flattish year-over-year margin?\nBrian Chesky: Great. Well, why don't I start, Justin, with AI. This is certainly the biggest revolution and test since I came to Silicon Valley. It's certainly as big of a platform shift as the Internet, and many people think it might be even bigger. And I'll give you kind of a bit of an overview of how we think about AI. So all of this is going to be built on the base model. The base models, the large language models, think of those as GPT-4. Google has a couple of base models, Microsoft reaches Entropic. These are like major infrastructure investments. Some of these models might cost tens of billions of dollars towards the compute power. And so think of that as essentially like building a highway. It's a major infrastructure project. And we're not going to do that. We're not an infrastructure company. But we're going to build the cars on the highway. In other words, we're going to design the interface and the tuning of the model on top of AI, on top of the base model. So on top of the base model is the tuning of the model. And the tuning of the model is going to be based on the customer data you have. And I'll just paint a picture for you. If you were to ask a question to ChatGPT, and if I were to ask a question to ChatGPT, we're both going to get pretty much the same answer. And the reason both of us are going to get pretty close the same answer is because ChatGPT doesn't know that it's between you and I, doesn't know anything about us. Now this is totally fine for many questions, like how far is it from this destination to that destination. But it turns out that a lot of questions in travel aren't really search questions. They're matching questions. Another is, they're questions that the answer depends on who you are and what your preferences are. So for example, I think that going forward, Airbnb is going to be pretty different. Instead of asking you questions like where are you going and when are you going, I want us to build a robust profile about you, learn more about you and ask you 2 bigger and more fundamental questions: who are you? And what do you want? And ultimately, what I think Airbnb is building is not just a service or a product. But what we are in the largest sense is a global travel community. And the role of Airbnb and that travel community is to be the ultimate host. Think of us with AI as building the ultimate AI concierge that could understand you. And we could build these world-class interfaces, tune our model. Unlike most other travel companies, we know a lot more about our guests and hosts. This is partly why we're investing in the Host Passport. We want to continue to learn more about people. And then our job is to match you to accommodations, other travel services and eventually things beyond travel. So that's the big vision of where we're going to go. I think it's an incredibly expanding opportunity. I'll just end by giving you some tactical things we're going to be doing in the next 12 months. Number one is customer service. This is going to be one of the biggest benefits to Airbnb. One of the strengths of Airbnb is that Airbnb's offering is one of a kind. The problem with Airbnb is our service is also one of a kind. And so therefore, historically less consistent than a hotel. I think AI can level the playing field from a service perspective relative to hotels because hotels have front desk, Airbnb doesn't. But we have literally millions of people staying on Airbnb every night. And imagine they call customer service. We have agents that have to adjudicate between 70 different user policies. Some of these are as many as 100 pages long. What AI is going to do is be able to give us better service, cheaper and faster by augmenting the agents. And I think this is going to be something that is a huge transformation. It's a bit all hands on deck, and used to be improvement later this year into next year. That's number one. Number two, we are now building AI into our product. And let me just give you an example. A few months ago, OpenAI launched plug-ins. And in fact, we were actually supposed to be one of the launch partners for the plug-ins on OpenAI ChatGPT. But I told Sam, we were literally one of the first to work with him that before right before our launch, I decided to pull the plug on it. And the reason why is I decided that the interface of pure tech space with widgets at the bottom was probably not the right interface for travel. Ultimately, I think the right interface for travel is multimodal. It's rich media. It's photo. It's video. It's much more immersive. And GPT-4 is available in our app. So we're going to be building GPT-4 into our interface. And I think that's the real opportunity for us. So you should see some big changes next year with AI built into our app. The final thing I'll say is developer productivity and productivity of our workforce generally. I think our employees could easily be, especially our developers, 30% more productive in the short to medium term, and this will allow significantly greater throughput through tools like GitHub's Copilot. So all of this is to say, I'm really excited on the short term and the long term. And the last thing I'll just say is I think the companies that will most benefit from the shift of AI are going to be the companies that have the most innovative cultures. That's kind of what happened in the '90s with the Internet. And if the last couple of years is any indication, having launched over 340 features of innovations, I think we're definitely going to be right at the forefront of this revolution.\nDavid Stephenson: And in terms of profitability, we're just really proud of the progress that we've made in our operating efficiency, right? We made some very difficult choices in the midst of COVID to rationalize and streamline the company, get focused, get back to our roots. And we made substantial progress in our profitability ever since, where we've done it. We obviously reduced our headcount by 25%. We've only grown it moderately since. We've made substantial changes in our marketing efficiency, continue to make good improvements in our operating costs, anything from community support to cost of payments to infrastructure costs. Basically, we become a better, more rigorous operating company overall. And that kind of progress has been great for us going forward because even as our businesses rebounded, we have stuck to our core strong kind of operating mode. And so even this year, as we anticipate moderation in ADRs, the improvements that we're going to continue to make in community support, infrastructure, cost of payments and our fixed cost leverage will be enough to offset any of the pressures that we're seeing in average daily rates.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions. Across the online travel space, there's this dynamic of marketing costs being much more front-end loaded this year. Dave, any commentary on -- from your perspective, why that is? And then secondly, could you just double-click a little bit, Brian, on the Brazil and Germany examples that you talked about? If there's anything specific that you could say that you did that caused those to kind of accelerate up to become 2 of your fastest-growing markets so that we can think about how replicable those efforts would be in other markets, that would be really helpful.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, sure. Dave, why don't you take the first one?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. Great. Thanks, Mark. In terms of the front-loading of marketing costs this year, it's just we're learning to operate better. I mean we had seen such great success in our brand marketing campaigns, strong return on investments in that last year. And what we learned is that we just felt like we needed to do that earlier in the year, get out even more ahead of our peak travel summer season with our brand marketing. The earlier we get that message out in the year, the better we can kind of reap that investment for the full year. So this is purely about moving up the spend on kind of brand marketing earlier. And to a lesser extent, but it is an element of it as well, is investing in some of these new geographies where we haven't historically had brand marketing, and so actually expanding that market into more countries. So our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain largely the same in 2023 as it was in 2022. It's just that we're front-loading more the marketing to get the message out earlier.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And Mark, I'll just share a little bit about Brazil and Germany. So Airbnb is one of the most international companies in the world. We're in 220 countries and regions. And many years ago, we developed a playbook to expand internationally outside the United States. And that playbook included PR, included having some people on the ground, although generally, in many these markets only need that. It included a brand marketing campaign and made sure that our product was adequately localized. And it's just a really full funnel approach. And now we've added social media and influencers as well. So recently, over the course of the pandemic, we were not as focused on international expansion. And that's because we're mainly focused on recovery and some of the new travel segments like longer-term stay. Over the last 3 years, obviously, as you know, we've gotten really, really focused, back to basics and our company is significantly more profitable. Now we've done over $3.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. So we feel like now is a really good time to focus on international expansion. So we started with Germany and Brazil. And again, it was full funnel. It involved a lot of PRs. It involve brand marketing, bringing our marketing ad campaigns to pricing in the United States to these markets, localizing our product and working with local influencers. So it's a pretty full funnel approach. The results have been incredibly positive. These are now 2 of our fastest-growing markets. So we're now looking at bringing this playbook to other markets around the world. And I'll give you a couple of examples. Number one is Asia Pacific. We think there's a huge opportunity in Asia. We're massively underpenetrated. This is going to be probably the fastest-growing market internationally over the next 5 years. And the problem with Asia historically over the last few years is Asia market, as you know, is a very much cross-border market. And with the borders being historically kind of locked down and there hasn't been as much travel, the recovery in Asia has been delayed. Now people are starting to travel, and Asia disproportionately has a lot of young travelers. And Airbnb, as you know, is very popular among the young travelers. So we think Japan, Korea, China, India and Southeast Asia are going to be huge opportunities for growth. Next is Europe. We're very big in France. We're very big in the U.K. We're now seeing great growth in Germany. But there's a lot of markets in Europe. We haven't ever really run robust brand marketing campaigns. Now we're getting more aggressive in Italy. We're getting more aggressive in Spain, and we're now looking at other markets in Northern Europe. And I think there's actually a lot of greenfield in Europe because we've really only focused on a few of the really big markets. And when we see we focus the big markets like France and U.K., we are now really strong. And I think we can have similar penetration in other countries in Europe. And then finally is Latin America. We're seeing a lot of growth in Brazil, and we're now going to bring it to some other really large markets, like Colombia and some other markets within Latin America. So I think international is going to be a pretty big boom to growth over the next 2, 3 years. The one thing I've learned about Airbnb is no matter how different every country is, the playbook doesn't have to vary that much. It works quite well in every market. And especially, it works with Airbnb because it's very much a cross-border network effect business.\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, the playbook -- so I just don't want to leave the question without just reinforcing how well the playbook is working for us and that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid, and that's been the case since COVID and continues to be the case. So this investment is working very well for us.\nOperator: We'll move next to Richard Clarke at Sanford Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Two, if I may. I guess the full year results, you mentioned how you control supply against the demand. I guess at this point, you're talking about supply growing at about 18%, but you're pointing to Q2 demand growing maybe more like 10% to 12%. Which one of those numbers is the right way to think about growth going forward? Should we be extrapolating the 18% or the 10% to 12%? And then just very quickly, you obviously shifted to showing the hold prices. Any impact you've seen from that? Is that impacting conversions? Is that impacting supply? What's been the impact of that change?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Richard, why don't I start at a high level? I think our long-term growth is going to only be as strong as our supply. If we were to back out, what happened in 2020, 2021, as that demand grew faster than supply. And initially, this was a great thing. But the problem is when demand grows faster than supply and there's supply constraints, prices generally go up. And as prices have risen, while that's been good for the bottom line, affordability in this economy is a major issue. And so one of the most important things we can do to make Airbnb affordable is to make sure we have enough supply in the platform. And so a year ago, we identified supply growth as a major strategic initiative that we really needed to accelerate, and we created an initiative called Mainstreaming Hosting. The idea is we wanted hosting to be as mainstream as traveling. And we did a number of things. We said, in order to mainstream hosting, we need to make it safe, easy and cool. So we launched AirCover, which is top to bottom protection. No one else offers it. They're going to be set up, and we did some marketing campaigns for the first time in many years. We've since seen, as you know, 900,000 incremental listings. It's now accelerating every single quarter since the IPO. And I think what's going to happen is all the supply coming out of the market will keep prices from going up. My hope is that while the hotel CEOs have said, they expect demand to drive prices up this summer, we want to actually have prices moderate. We think that's going to bring in a whole new generation of travelers to Airbnb. So ultimately, I think that like -- that's a very, very important consideration of the marketplace. The more affordable we are -- just like Amazon, the more affordable we are with a wider selection, the more people will come to Airbnb. So that's the high level. Now with regard to total price, this is primarily a U.S. issue. But in the U.S., as you know, there was a bit of an issue where some hosts had higher cleaning fees. And we heard a lot from guests. And I think what the total price display is going to do, it's going to push demand to listings that are -- have an overall better value of a total price. And when people turn on the price toggle, we see that people are booking listings with lower cleaning fees or no cleaning fees. And I think this is going to have a really good practice in the marketplace of driving the demand to the best value listings, rewarding those hosts and making sure every single host remains competitive. So it's just beginning. We set a pilot in December. It's now available to everyone, so we'll have to see how this plays out in the coming months. But what my expectation is based on our release last week, we launched a lot of features around affordability. We have many more -- much more affordable monthly stay products. Hosts now have monthly stay discounts, weekly stay discounts. We allow hosts to set more competitive prices. We're going to continue to add supply. And hopefully, this is going to continue to address the number one request of travelers, which is affordable offer since.\nDavid Stephenson: Let me add two more points. The implementation of the oil price has gone really well. And what we're seeing is actually a neutral impact on our overall business. So the , which we've implemented, has worked quite well. The people that care the most about seeing it all in pricing, they can make the selection. And those who want to see it like other marketplaces don't even make that selection. And then the other -- back to the growth rates, 10% to 12% nights growth is not our long-term ambition. You do have to remember that in Q2, we have a significant hard comparison versus the Omicron, COVID variant that came out last year. Remember that people delayed their travel in Q1 and compressed a large amount of travel into the second quarter, which makes for a hard comparison of nice growth here in the second quarter.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one, Brian, just to go back to your last answer about how affordability is an issue in the economy. On the Airbnb platform, have you seen any signs of trade down or shorter stays or price changes or lower traffic conversion sort of impacts of that more price-sensitive user on the platform yet? That's the first one. Then the second one, Dave, actually, to go back to your last answer as well. I think in the past, you've spoken about how there's a lot of moving pieces around the shape of the year, but 2022 was a reasonable way to think about the shape of the room nights or bookings for the year. How should we think about that now that sort of thinking through the comp structure and how the 2Q, 3Q comps are quite similar?\nBrian Chesky: David, do you want to take the second, and I'll get on with the first?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I mean, it has been hard to kind of perfectly predict the exact shape of demand. And obviously, Omicron has impacted the shape on nights demand probably more than the impact of revenue. We continue to see as the revenue guide that we have here is revenue growth between kind of 12% and 16% in the second quarter. And I think that some of the pressures that we're seeing there on overall revenue growth has, frankly, just been some of the elevated ADR rates that we're seeing, just higher overall kind of pricing, especially in North America. But some of the tailwinds that we're seeing for future growth in the back half of the year or a lot of the areas that Brian spoke about, things like continued acceleration in Latin America, acceleration in Asia Pacific and more cross-border travel. So I think some of those things are the benefits we're seeing in the back half of the year. Q2 is turning out to be a little bit tougher comp given Omicron last year, but we're seeing overall stable demand for the back half. We highlighted in the letter that we have 25% more bookings on the books at this time this year for the back half of the year than we did this time last year. So it just gives us confidence in people's willingness and interest in travel for the back half.\nBrian Chesky: And I can just take the first question, which is what we're seeing, Brian, is that people are most price sensitive, at least currently in North America, especially United States. And in the United States, the lowest price listings have the highest occupancy. So yes, people do want low price listings. And we expect that as Airbnb rates continue to normalize, and hopefully, our rates do not increase as fast to hotels over the next couple of years that we're going to see continued increase in occupancy for more listings in Airbnb and also is partly why we're so bullish about the prospect for Airbnb Rooms, not just to bring people to Airbnb that want affordable options, but really new travelers that have never really traveled very much before, especially Gen Z.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Ron Josey at Citi.\nRonald Josey: Brian, you talked about expanding the core. And I wanted to ask a little bit more about new ideas for products or the vision for the Airbnb economy overall. I think we've mentioned in the past the marketplace for local host services and other sponsored listings and other ideas. So any insights on sort of how you think about expanding the core and the vision for the Airbnb economy? And then just a quick follow-up, too, on just the experiences rebuild, that recent calls on experience, just talk to us a little bit more about how you feel that product is progressing?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Ron, I mean, great, great questions. Just to kind of step back, before the pandemic, we were really already focused on expanding beyond the core. In fact, we had 10 different divisions at Airbnb. We added a Home division. We had an Experience division. We had a Transportation division. We had a Magazine division. So we had a lot of efforts. And then obviously, the pandemic occurred, and we had to get focused back to basics. And what we wanted to do over the last few years is before we work on new things, we wanted to perfect our core service. One of the great source of inspiration I had was Apple. And I remember in the mid-2000s, it was 2006, and Apple had not yet launched the iPhone, but how many of us wanted Apple to come out with a phone? And the answer is a lot of people. And the reason people wanted Apple to expand their phone is because they love their iPod. But how many of us wanted gateway to come out with a phone? And the answer is probably not many, because we didn't love our gateway computer. And so I think that one of the things I've told our team is we have numerous expansion opportunities, but we need permission to expand beyond our core. We need people to first love our core service. So that's why over the last 3 years, we've been focused on really perfecting our core service. That being said, our core service is stronger than ever. It's more profitable than ever. And I think we're now ready to expand beyond the core. So as we speak, we are working actively on new products and services. These new products and services are going to be shipping. Beginning next year, you're going to see a number of things ship next May as part of the 2024 Summer Release. And we're going to see even more things shift later in the year and the years to come. Now obviously, there's a lot of opportunities. There's guest services, there's host services. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail. You obviously will have to tune in to talk. But I think it is important to note that I think that the biggest idea Airbnb has are in front of us. I don't want to think that the biggest idea I ever had when I was 26 working [indiscernible] my 2 cofounders. I think that there's so much more Airbnb can offer. And part of it is just making sure we continue to learn more, build robust profile, build an extensible platform model, continue to increase trust in the platform. And then what we can do is go into adjacencies within our core, but then including that, expand beyond the core. So I think you're going to see a lot of new opportunities. With regards to Experiences, I remain bullish about the product. I think there is a massive opportunity for someone to build a huge product around Experiences. Whether it's us and whether we're able to execute that product, we still have to prove that. One of my great investors -- one of our early investors is Marc Andreessen. He said there's no bad ideas, just ideas that are too early. And a lot of life is timing and experiences. I think when we launched in 2016, it launched right like leading into the pandemic. It was probably early. I think the timing is probably now better. But we did as we decided, let's take a pause on new submissions. Let's retool the product and hopefully put out something that is even more relevant to this next generation that are looking for things to do. So I remain really bullish on all of this.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mario Lu at Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great. The first one is on ADRs. It came better than expected in the first quarter. You guys mentioned, India saw 8% growth. Anything to point out to within that region for its strength? And then is the full year growth still expected to be down mid-single digits?\nBrian Chesky: Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. On ADRs, it's been interesting how persistently higher average daily rates have remained, and that has been consistent kind of across the globe. I think even more particularly, the ADR rates that we saw in North America have been persistently high. So these are a lot of the reasons why we've been launching so many of the tools and capabilities that Brian has talked about on the call that -- and making sure that we're finding good affordability for our guests for things like Airbnb Rooms and getting tools for a host of even kind of price better. So I don't have anything more to say on that, except that we think that the ADRs, as we continue to see growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia, should moderate a bit here in the second quarter. And we want to continue to make sure we're giving great value to our guests. In terms of full year expectations, the year-over-year growth in ADR should be, I think, still probably down in that kind of mid-single-digit range. There's really no change in our expectations on ADR growth.\nMario Lu: Got it. And then the second question is on competition. One of your competitors is launching a loyalty program in July in the U.S. Just curious if you think that is a potential threat to the business since you don't have one? And any data points you can share with regards to what percentage of things are exclusive to your platform?\nBrian Chesky: I always believe that the best loyalty program is people loving your products. And if they love your products, they come back. And I think that's the reason why nearly 90% of our traffic is direct to organic, and we have really strong rebooker rate. So I mean we haven't needed to have a loyalty program to have really good loyalty on Airbnb because people really love the experience. And ultimately, I think it's just a matter of continuing to innovate. Ultimately, we're in the inspiration business. People want to have good trips, and the best trip wins. And whatever company is most focused on listing the customer feedback, innovating as quickly as possible and taking giant leaps and experiences, I think it's going to be the most successful. So we're really bullish about this. Now that being said, for years, we've looked at a loyalty program. And I don't think a classic point program, which is essentially a subsidy to buy loyalty is the right approach for us. But we do think there's really compelling, interesting ways to reward our very best guests and something we've been actively thinking about.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nick Jones of JMP Securities.\nNicholas Jones: So you're adding a lot of great solutions for hosts and guests and the outlook comments in the release, sounds like this is contributing a little bit to some of the ADR pressure. So how do you balance the efforts to continue to increase supply, making it easier for supply to join while redistributing demand to available supply? Is there a risk of incremental ADR compression as a result of some of these efforts?\nBrian Chesky: Nick, I can start. So I mean, I think part of our secret sauce is our ability to really try to elegantly balance supply and demand. One of the great things we've seen is the marketplace has a natural equilibrium that it finds in itself. For example, the fastest-growing markets of supply are also turned out to be the fastest-growing market for demand. So if demand creates supply, what ends up happening is a lot of these individual hosts get booked. They start making a bunch of money, obviously. The vast majority of them get booked within days of listing. And what ends up happening is they tend to open up more nights. They tell their friends about it and then supply increases. But we've also found a number of tactics. In fact, performance marketing is a very important way that we balance supply and demand. Other companies tend to use it as an arbitrage business to buy a lot of customers. We have never thought of it that way. We think of supply performance marketing really as a laser, to laser in on balancing supply and demand in markets all over the world. And frankly, the more supply we add, the more we think we're going to have really great value listings that will ultimately attract more demand. So I think we're able to balance this out throughout the coming year.\nOperator: Mr. Kelly with Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Just going back to the comment in the Shareholder Letter of your current backlog of nights being approximately 25% stronger than it was a year ago, can you just reconcile that with the 2Q guide? And how should we expect normal seasonality trends going forward? And then my second question, Brian, is you've done a great job with apartments and rooms growing supply in the U.S. Can you take that apartments' initiative and implement it in Europe and other regions of the world?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes, on the 25%, I mean, I think what it's doing is just demonstrating the strength in demand. I think what -- if you go back to the beginning of Q1, people booked much earlier here in 2023 than they have historically. So we had longer overall booking rates for the back half of the year. So we're seeing that strength. And so to the extent that, that demand just shifts earlier in the year, that's why the growth rate in backlog. And so it will be higher than what we are projecting for nights in any kind of given period. In terms of normalcy, I think as -- it's the specific percentage of backlog isn't a direct translation to kind of nights booked, but what we are seeing is strong demand across the globe and very stable demand in North America.\nBrian Chesky: And Jed, just to clarify question. When you say apartments, are you referring to the Airbnb-friendly apartment?\nJed Kelly: Yes.\nBrian Chesky: With landlords and they'll take offers?\nJed Kelly: Yes. Yes, can you do that?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Yes. 100%, yes. We believe that this can be expanded all over the world. We wanted to use United States as a proof of concept. Obviously, that was we thought the first place to start. We started with about 175 buildings. We now have, I think, over 250 buildings. We have Greystar and some of the biggest real estate developers in America on the platform. And that's been our proof of concept. But assuming this works, and all indications are it is going to work. If response has actually exceeded our expectation, at least from landlords, then yes, we'd love to bring this to Europe, Latin America and Asia.\nOperator: We'll move next to Justin Post at Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. A couple of questions. I guess the first thing about competition. As you move into Europe, you might see a big competitor in booking. Can you talk about your model where you charge both the host and the guest versus there's more heavily weighted to the host? Do you think that works well in Europe? And how do you think about the differences there? And then maybe for Dave, on the marketing spend, it definitely seems like the timing is different. How do you think about marketing ROIs this year versus prior years? How should we think about that?\nBrian Chesky: Dave, do you want to take the second question first?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. No, the marketing ROIs, I mean, again, I'm very pleased with our overall marketing strategy. I'm happy that our 90% of our traffic remains direct-run paid and that does great returns. And the brand marketing returns on -- that we've seen have been quite strong, which is why we're expanding into some of the markets. Also, the return on our search engine marketing has been quite good, and we're maintaining high ROIs there and making sure that where we have opportunities to drive incremental profit, we do so. So I feel really good about the investment we're making. I like the improved timing that we have here in 2023. And I like the overall approach to this full funnel marketing that Brian is talking about. We add amplify our brand and search engine marketing with things like social and PR, and we have that full funnel approach that works really well and that's kind of success we're seeing in Brazil and in Germany.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. And maybe, Justin, before I answer about our model in Europe, I just want to also add something. So with most travel companies, their strategy is like basically paid marketing, right, performance marketing and brand marketing. I think a callout I just want to make is PR social media is a huge benefit to Airbnb. Historically, we have the largest share of voice in travel. Last week, we got 3,000 articles. I mean that was like more than 1/3 of the amount of press we got for IPO. So we think that there's a lot of opportunity for Airbnb to continue to be front and center in people's minds, in PR and social media and even in pop culture on TV shows, movies, songs, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the name of the game is both paid media and then earned media. And earned media is a really important part of the international story and international expansion because earned media really creates trust more than paid media. Now with regards to Europe, the one thing I just want to point out is we actually have both models. We have a model where we have a guest fee and host fee. We also have a model where we have a host-only fee. And host can choose, and we have this kind of choice for hosts, especially for larger property managers. Ultimately, especially with our total price display, I don't think it's a major issue for guests. I think ultimately, they're going to be looking at the total price. And we've not seen a major behavior change. I think, yes, they're most sensitive to total price. They're becoming more savvy. They're getting trained on total price. And that is partly why we moved our product towards an option of showing people total price. As long as we remain competitive, as long as we offer the best product and we offer the overall best value for the total price, I think that's ultimately what guests are going to care about.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Brian, can you talk about eventual rollout plans for pay over time to other parts of the world like Brazil, given the propensity among users there as to use this type of product? And I guess I'll ask the Airbnb Rooms question another way. Between this and pay over time, it seems like you are in a position to expand your audience. So can you talk about how much latent demand you may potentially unlock with what looks like higher service levels to that bargain shopper?\nBrian Chesky: Yes. So I'll talk. One of the things -- I mean, what you'll notice is a lot of our updates last week were based on affordability. So we announced a partnership with Klarna, which is pay over time. we can pay in as many as 4 installments. I also want to add, we also announced a partnership with Stripe, where you can pay by bank account for monthly stay. This is really important because it means you don't have to pay for credit card to pay basically what is essentially rent and then also would increase conversion by lowering costs. So we're really focused. And a lot of what we're focused on is starting these payment services in the United States, kind of similar to Airbnb-friendly apartment. And assuming these partnerships work, no doubt we're going to be spanning these to markets all over the world. And you're correct, a lot of countries, people pay in installments more than even in the United States. So yes, Brazil end markets, emerging markets over the world, I think this will absolutely be a very compelling offering. We just like to get the product right in our more like established markets, like the United States before expanding it globally. But all indications are this is going to be very successful. Now as far as expanding our audience, yes. I mean, ultimately, the biggest market opportunity for any company is always the next generation. I mean the great thing about young people is more of them every year. And if you can continue to be the most relevant brand for a young audience, then you're going to continue to be able to ride that growth. And that's going to definitely be a boom for first-time bookers. And the great thing about young people is 15 years ago, I was 26, and my friends and I didn't have a lot of money. Now many of us have families and we're much older, we have more money. And so what we want to do is capture the next generation of travelers, and then they'll grow with us. And I think that Airbnb Rooms is a Gary entry-level product. It's a great way to introduce people to Airbnb. I noticed, for example, when I used to talk [indiscernible], he said that like diapers was a very important entry product to Amazon for families, right? You buy diapers and then I will see you need other things. This is maybe an extreme example, but I think Airbnb Rooms is a great way for new travelers to come to Airbnb. And if you think about it, between Airbnb Rooms allowing the pricing tool for hosts that price more affordably, total price, which should see the cleaning fees down and other discount products, I think we're going to have really one of the most affordable products in travel, bar none.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Colantuoni at Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: Active listings has expanded more this quarter than the recent quarters. When you look at the profile of these new active listings, overall, how do these listings compare to your existing portfolio? What portion of the hosts are individuals, urban versus suburban versus vacation destinations, et cetera? Then on sales and marketing with front-end loaded spending on brand investments, can you just sort of walk through the shape of marketing throughout the year?\nBrian Chesky: Yes, Dave, why don't you take both, please?\nDavid Stephenson: Sure. I think we talked about the shape of marketing during the year that we are bringing in more front-end loading on our brand marketing spend, especially here into Q1 and Q2. So it's several hundred basis points higher in Q2 than it was in Q2 last year. And then for the full year, total marketing costs will be roughly the same as they were in the prior year. So I don't have much more to say on kind of the shape or marketing beyond that. In terms of active listings, I think this is what's been really continued strength in our business, which is that we are focused on individual hosts. And individual host were 90% of our hosts, that continues to be the case. The new host that we're bringing on because we cater our tools to the needs of those individual hosts, so that's making sure that it's easy to list. And we give them AirCover for hosts. They know that their home is well protected. We give them the great payment capabilities, the customer support that they require. All those things make it easier for individuals. And what's been great to see is that our mix of individual for -- and professional host has remained very stable through that. The other thing that's been interesting about just our listings growth overall is it tends to grow where we have the biggest demand. And so the areas -- as urban come back, our urban growth has been kept in line with that kind of growth. And so as we keep expanding and increasing our business around the world, the listings come right along with it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: I just want to ask about long-term base if it kind of moves down versus recent periods. I know you talked about some of the changes in payments and fees coming up. Are long-term stays slowing more with normalization in the economy or really just more of a mix shift issue towards shorter stays?\nBrian Chesky: Doug, I think it's important to just step back and say that what we saw, even before the pandemic, was that long-term stays were growing, and they have been our fastest-growing segment by trip length. I think what the pandemic did is it probably accelerated some inevitable growth and there's huge opportunity for us. And I also think we're never going back to the way the world was before the pandemic. I do think there is some little bit of a post-pandemic equilibrium that you're starting to see. And we're also seeing a mix shift because cross-border urban nights are now up. That being said, I remain extremely bullish on long-term stays. I think this is going to be one of the big growth opportunities for Airbnb over the next 5 years. And the reason why is because people are permanently more flexible. Even bosses that want people back to the office, I think they're going to see incremental flexibility. More people going away for the summer, more people may be going away for the holidays. And ultimately, with AI, you're going to see an acceleration of people having more distributed and more global workforces. So all you have to do is believe Zoom is here to stay, to believe long-term stays are here to stay and that's what we're betting on. But the biggest feedback we've gotten on our long-term stay product was it was just sometimes a little more expensive to book long-term stay on Airbnb, because the platform was built for short-term stays. So we made over a dozen upgrades to long-term stays and a lot of more based on affordability. So starting with -- we now have a monthly dial for you to really discover monthly stays, which was really cool dial like an quick wheel that allows you to search from 1 month to a year on Airbnb. You can pay by bank account. This saves on credit card processing fees. You can pay over time. We have more flexible cancellation policies. So you now can cancel a long-term stay up to 1 month before check-in. We have new discounting tools for hosts on weekly stays and monthly stays, and we have many other upgrades as well for monthly stays. So I think we're going to see a lot more growth. And one of the big opportunities, I think, that we're going to see is more people starting to come to Airbnb to list exclusively long-term stay. People that have no intention of hosting on a nightly basis will host long term. Another thing we believe is going to happen is we think long-term stays could be a gateway to short-term stays. There might be a host that are uncomfortable hosting on a nightly basis, but they're used to having a tenant and they might go to Airbnb to rent monthly. And over time, we might be able to get them more comfortable on a short-term basis. So we think this is a really big opportunity for us. But I do think there is some normalization in the post-pandemic equilibrium, but I believe this is still a major growth opportunity for years to come.\nOperator: We'll move next to Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Brian, maybe circling back to the competitive environment. It strikes us given some of the numbers coming out of your large OTA competitors, and the industry has grown incrementally more than it has in the last year or so. Can you help us understand from your seat, if you've seen a change in the competitive environment over the last 12 months? And what your expectations are for how competition may evolve over the next couple of years? And then, Dave, can you talk about how you think about balancing margins and investments beyond this year, assuming rates aren't a headwind moving forward, it stresses that international investments are said to grow nicely over the next couple of years? I guess with this in mind, how do you think about how margins can progress in the coming years given your investment priorities?\nBrian Chesky: All right. Yes. Lee, I'll start with the first one, competitive environment. I think it's important to note that Airbnb is more than double the size. And most of the travel industry is only a little bit larger than they were before the pandemic. So there's been a major mix shift share towards Airbnb. I think we're starting to see some of the old ways of traveling recover, specifically urban and cross-border. But ultimately, we're really focused on innovating. We're focused on playing our own game, and I think that we're going to continue to focus on a few areas. We're going to continue the Mainstream Hosting. And we think we're going to be adding more supply of homes than any other company. Next, we're going to be focused on perfecting our core service. I think there's potentially down the road to tipping point, where a whole new cohort of people could be comfortable using Airbnb. The biggest obstacle to Airbnb historically has been reliability and consistency. As I said, the biggest strength we have is we're one of a kind. The biggest weakness we have is it's just hard to be as consistent as a hotel. But again, with AI, being able to supplement and augment customer service and with many of our other initiatives to perfect the core service, I think we can introduce a whole new category of travelers to Airbnb. And this doesn't even include many of the opportunities we have with younger travelers, with new markets and new products and services that are only on Airbnb. I also just generally would just say, one of the big guiding principles I have is to focus on the things only Airbnb can do. And if we focus on the things that only Airbnb can do, then in a sense, you're going to come to Airbnb and we're going to have a lot of demand, a lot of exclusive traffic. And Airbnb Rooms is just one of many examples of something that only Airbnb offers. And so we're going to continue to be competitive, but we're also going to focus on things that only we offer. Dave?\nDavid Stephenson: Yes. I think one of the things I'm really proud of is the ability for us to both grow and grow profitably and have very strong margins. I mean having a 44% kind of free cash flow margin is something I'm definitely very proud of.  I think going forward, just remember that we are still heavily in growth mode, and we're going to continue to invest behind growth for the future. The good news is that as I'm doing this year, we're able to continue to be very rigorous in our investments across our P&L, make improvements in our cost structure, buying fixed cost leverage and do all that while investing for kind of growth for the future. So what I think you should anticipate going forward is that we'll continue to have a profitable business focused on growth. And that over time, we'll continue to have opportunities to expand margins, but that's not my primary focus right now. Our primary focus is in investing for growth. And as you mentioned, one of those areas for opportunities will be to increase our investment in areas where we're significantly underpenetrated and seeing great success. And we highlighted a couple of those areas on the call today.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Chesky for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Just to recap, we had a strong start to 2023. Revenue was $1.8 billion, which is 20% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both records for Q1, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $3.8 billion and that represents a free cash flow margin of 44%. I'm really proud of the progress we made. If you look at over the last 3 years, how much more profitable the company's become, I think a lot of that has been based on our discipline and our execution. And speaking of execution, our product just keeps getting better, and we continue to innovate with more than 50 upgrades and features last week and many more ahead later this year. I'm proud of what we're doing, and I'm really excited for the road ahead. So thank you all, and we'll talk next quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Stephenson",
            "content": "And in terms of profitability, we're just really proud of the progress that we've made in our operating efficiency, right? We made some very difficult choices in the midst of COVID to rationalize and streamline the company, get focused, get back to our roots. And we made substantial progress in our profitability ever since, where we've done it. We obviously reduced our headcount by 25%. We've only grown it moderately since. We've made substantial changes in our marketing efficiency, continue to make good improvements in our operating costs, anything from community support to cost of payments to infrastructure costs. Basically, we become a better, more rigorous operating company overall. And that kind of progress has been great for us going forward because even as our businesses rebounded, we have stuck to our core strong kind of operating mode. And so even this year, as we anticipate moderation in ADRs, the improvements that we're going to continue to make in community support, infrastructure, cost of payments and our fixed cost leverage will be enough to offset any of the pressures that we're seeing in average daily rates. Yes. Great. Thanks, Mark. In terms of the front-loading of marketing costs this year, it's just we're learning to operate better. I mean we had seen such great success in our brand marketing campaigns, strong return on investments in that last year. And what we learned is that we just felt like we needed to do that earlier in the year, get out even more ahead of our peak travel summer season with our brand marketing. The earlier we get that message out in the year, the better we can kind of reap that investment for the full year. So this is purely about moving up the spend on kind of brand marketing earlier. And to a lesser extent, but it is an element of it as well, is investing in some of these new geographies where we haven't historically had brand marketing, and so actually expanding that market into more countries. So our marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain largely the same in 2023 as it was in 2022. It's just that we're front-loading more the marketing to get the message out earlier. Yes, the playbook -- so I just don't want to leave the question without just reinforcing how well the playbook is working for us and that 90% of our traffic remains direct or unpaid, and that's been the case since COVID and continues to be the case. So this investment is working very well for us. Let me add two more points. The implementation of the oil price has gone really well. And what we're seeing is actually a neutral impact on our overall business. So the , which we've implemented, has worked quite well. The people that care the most about seeing it all in pricing, they can make the selection. And those who want to see it like other marketplaces don't even make that selection. And then the other -- back to the growth rates, 10% to 12% nights growth is not our long-term ambition. You do have to remember that in Q2, we have a significant hard comparison versus the Omicron, COVID variant that came out last year. Remember that people delayed their travel in Q1 and compressed a large amount of travel into the second quarter, which makes for a hard comparison of nice growth here in the second quarter. Yes. I mean, it has been hard to kind of perfectly predict the exact shape of demand. And obviously, Omicron has impacted the shape on nights demand probably more than the impact of revenue. We continue to see as the revenue guide that we have here is revenue growth between kind of 12% and 16% in the second quarter. And I think that some of the pressures that we're seeing there on overall revenue growth has, frankly, just been some of the elevated ADR rates that we're seeing, just higher overall kind of pricing, especially in North America. But some of the tailwinds that we're seeing for future growth in the back half of the year or a lot of the areas that Brian spoke about, things like continued acceleration in Latin America, acceleration in Asia Pacific and more cross-border travel. So I think some of those things are the benefits we're seeing in the back half of the year. Q2 is turning out to be a little bit tougher comp given Omicron last year, but we're seeing overall stable demand for the back half. We highlighted in the letter that we have 25% more bookings on the books at this time this year for the back half of the year than we did this time last year. So it just gives us confidence in people's willingness and interest in travel for the back half. Yes. On ADRs, it's been interesting how persistently higher average daily rates have remained, and that has been consistent kind of across the globe. I think even more particularly, the ADR rates that we saw in North America have been persistently high. So these are a lot of the reasons why we've been launching so many of the tools and capabilities that Brian has talked about on the call that -- and making sure that we're finding good affordability for our guests for things like Airbnb Rooms and getting tools for a host of even kind of price better. So I don't have anything more to say on that, except that we think that the ADRs, as we continue to see growth in Europe, Latin America and Asia, should moderate a bit here in the second quarter. And we want to continue to make sure we're giving great value to our guests. In terms of full year expectations, the year-over-year growth in ADR should be, I think, still probably down in that kind of mid-single-digit range. There's really no change in our expectations on ADR growth. Yes, on the 25%, I mean, I think what it's doing is just demonstrating the strength in demand. I think what -- if you go back to the beginning of Q1, people booked much earlier here in 2023 than they have historically. So we had longer overall booking rates for the back half of the year. So we're seeing that strength. And so to the extent that, that demand just shifts earlier in the year, that's why the growth rate in backlog. And so it will be higher than what we are projecting for nights in any kind of given period. In terms of normalcy, I think as -- it's the specific percentage of backlog isn't a direct translation to kind of nights booked, but what we are seeing is strong demand across the globe and very stable demand in North America. Sure. No, the marketing ROIs, I mean, again, I'm very pleased with our overall marketing strategy. I'm happy that our 90% of our traffic remains direct-run paid and that does great returns. And the brand marketing returns on -- that we've seen have been quite strong, which is why we're expanding into some of the markets. Also, the return on our search engine marketing has been quite good, and we're maintaining high ROIs there and making sure that where we have opportunities to drive incremental profit, we do so. So I feel really good about the investment we're making. I like the improved timing that we have here in 2023. And I like the overall approach to this full funnel marketing that Brian is talking about. We add amplify our brand and search engine marketing with things like social and PR, and we have that full funnel approach that works really well and that's kind of success we're seeing in Brazil and in Germany. Sure. I think we talked about the shape of marketing during the year that we are bringing in more front-end loading on our brand marketing spend, especially here into Q1 and Q2. So it's several hundred basis points higher in Q2 than it was in Q2 last year. And then for the full year, total marketing costs will be roughly the same as they were in the prior year. So I don't have much more to say on kind of the shape or marketing beyond that. In terms of active listings, I think this is what's been really continued strength in our business, which is that we are focused on individual hosts. And individual host were 90% of our hosts, that continues to be the case. The new host that we're bringing on because we cater our tools to the needs of those individual hosts, so that's making sure that it's easy to list. And we give them AirCover for hosts. They know that their home is well protected. We give them the great payment capabilities, the customer support that they require. All those things make it easier for individuals. And what's been great to see is that our mix of individual for -- and professional host has remained very stable through that. The other thing that's been interesting about just our listings growth overall is it tends to grow where we have the biggest demand. And so the areas -- as urban come back, our urban growth has been kept in line with that kind of growth. And so as we keep expanding and increasing our business around the world, the listings come right along with it. Yes. I think one of the things I'm really proud of is the ability for us to both grow and grow profitably and have very strong margins. I mean having a 44% kind of free cash flow margin is something I'm definitely very proud of.  I think going forward, just remember that we are still heavily in growth mode, and we're going to continue to invest behind growth for the future. The good news is that as I'm doing this year, we're able to continue to be very rigorous in our investments across our P&L, make improvements in our cost structure, buying fixed cost leverage and do all that while investing for kind of growth for the future. So what I think you should anticipate going forward is that we'll continue to have a profitable business focused on growth. And that over time, we'll continue to have opportunities to expand margins, but that's not my primary focus right now. Our primary focus is in investing for growth. And as you mentioned, one of those areas for opportunities will be to increase our investment in areas where we're significantly underpenetrated and seeing great success. And we highlighted a couple of those areas on the call today."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'm excited to share our Q1 results with you now. We had a strong start to 2023. We had over 120 million Nights and Experiences Booked in Q1. This was a record high [Technical Difficulty] change. Our revenue increased 24% year-over-year. Net income was $117 million, making this our most profitable Q1 on a GAAP basis. And free cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, our free cash flow was $3.8 billion. This represented a trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of 44%. Because of our strong balance sheet, we were able to repurchase $2 billion of our stock in the last 9 months. And today, we're pleased to announce that our Board just approved a new repurchase authorization for up to $2.5 billion of our Class A common stock. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of really positive business trends. First, more guests are traveling on Airbnb than ever before. Knights and Experiences Booked increased 19% in Q1 compared to a year ago, and we've seen our highest number of active bookers ever despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties. During the quarter, we also saw guests booking trips further in advance, supporting a strong backlog for Q2. Second, more guests are traveling overseas and returning to cities. Cross-border gross nights booked increased 36% in Q1 compared to last year. Now we were especially encouraged by the continued recovery of Asia Pacific as nights booked in Q1 increased more than 40% year-over-year. And we saw international travel from other regions to Asia Pacific increased 160% during the quarter compared to this time last year. Additionally, cross-border nights booked to North America increased once again, with 34% of year-over-year growth in Q1 relative to 31% last quarter. And we've also seen high-density urban nights booked increased 20% year-over-year. Third, guests are continuing to use Airbnb for longer stays. In Q1, long-term stays were 18% of total gross nights booked. And over the past 3 years, we've seen new use cases emerge as guests across all regions and age groups use Airbnb for long-term stays. And finally, supply growth continued to accelerate. In Q1, we grew supply 18% year-over-year, and this is up from 16% in Q4. We saw double-digit supply growth around the world with the fastest growth in North America and Latin America. Urban and nonurban supply growth, in fact, both grew 18%. Now looking ahead, we remain focused on our 3 strategic priorities. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We want hosting to be as popular as traveling on Airbnb. And to do this, we're raising awareness around hosting, making it easier to get started and providing even better tools for our hosts. And our approach is working. In fact, in every quarter since we went public, we have seen acceleration in the year-over-year growth of our total active listings. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We want people to love our service, and that means obsessing over every single detail. Last week, we introduced over 50 new features and upgrades as part of our 2023 Summer Release. Everything we launched was based on direct feedback from our guests and hosts. This included pricing tools, transparent checkout instructions, faster customer service and more. And we also responded to input on rising prices, with the rollout of Airbnb Rooms, an all-new take on the original Airbnb. Now I'm going to share a little bit more about what will be launched in a moment. And finally, we're expanding beyond our core. We have some big ideas for where to take Airbnb next. We're building the foundation for new products and services that we plan to launch in 2024 and beyond. At the same time, Airbnb is still underpenetrated in many markets around the world. So we're increasing our focus on these less mature markets, and we are already seeing positive results. So let me just give you 2 examples. In Germany and Brazil, we rolled out our expansion playbook for accelerated growth. And as a result, we are now 2 -- they are now 2 of our fastest-growing markets. And this playbook has, in fact, worked so well. So we are now expanding it to other markets around the world.  Now before we go to questions, I want to talk a little bit about our 2023 Summer Release. Last week, we introduced the most extensive set of improvements ever to Airbnb, and it was all based on feedback from our community. We took a design-driven approach to perfecting our core service. We created a blueprint of the entire experience: every screen, every policy and every interaction with customer service. We then analyzed millions of calls and thousands of social media posts. And we hosted listening sessions with guests and hosts all over the world. And we mapped all this feedback against our blueprint and we prioritized the most common issues. And on May 3, we introduced Airbnb Rooms and unveiled over 50 new features and upgrades for guests and hosts. So let me share a few highlights with you. First is total price display. Guests told us, our prices aren't transparent enough. With total price display, guests can now view the total price with fees before taxes across the entire app. Second, new pricing tools for hosts. We heard from hosts that it's hard to use our pricing tools, and it's difficult to know what the charge. So to help our hosts set more competitive prices, they can now see other Airbnbs are priced in their area. And this includes listings that are both in high demand and getting booked as well as listings that are not. And finally, we also made it simpler to add discounts and promotions for hosts. And third is more affordable stays. Longer stays on Airbnb can be expensive, so we're doing a few things about it. We're reducing our fees after 3 months. U.S. guests can now save money by paying with their bank account, and hosts can easily set monthly discounts and offer more flexible cancellations. Finally, we also introduced Airbnb Rooms, an all-new take on the original Airbnb Private Room. Airbnb Rooms gets us back to the idea that started it all, back to our founding ethos of sharing. And they're also one of the most affordable ways of travel, with an average price of only $67 a night. In fact, over 80% of Airbnb Rooms are under $100 a night. And in the current macroeconomic environment, people want to travel affordably. But guests have told us that they want to know more about who they're staying with before they book. So that's why every Airbnb Room comes with a host passport, which helps guests get to know their host before they book. In response to last week and our 2023 Summer Release has exceeded our expectations. Press coverage was overwhelmingly positive, and we got over 3,000 articles. This is the most press we've ever had from the launch. On social media, our Tweets got 19 million impressions. It really went far and wide on social. But the most important thing we heard is that our guests and our hosts feel like we're listening to their top concerns. If we're not done listening, it will never stop improving Airbnb. So with that, I look forward, Dave and I, to answering your questions. Yes, I'm here. How are you doing? Yes. So I'm very excited about Airbnb Rooms, because Airbnb Rooms is one of the most affordable ways to travel on Airbnb. We've been doing a lot of listening to guests on Airbnb. And one of the things they told us is, especially in this economic environment, they are looking for affordable ways to travel on Airbnb. And the average price of Airbnb Rooms is $67 a night. So it's an incredible value. And what we wanted to do is offer a product that we thought could capture this affordability segment that we think more and more people are going to be interested in, in this economy and also launch a product that will be very relevant to the next generation of travelers. Essentially, I wanted to launch a product that the 26-year-old me would have wanted. And we looked at our private rooms product, and we already had 1 million listings all over the world, but there was a bit of an obstacle. During the pandemic, people weren't comfortable staying with one another. And to get people more comfortable, we realized that we needed to help people understand the host they're staying with before they book. And so that's why we launched the Airbnb Host Passport. I think this is going to help a lot of people that are looking to save money and are interested in the local travel experience, be encouraged to stay in Airbnb Rooms. We also added new privacy features to understand if there's a lock in the bedroom door, if the bathroom is private. And we think all these different features are going to definitely help Airbnb Rooms. The final thing I'm going to say, Eric, is that we have a major brand campaign coming this summer, where we are going to be promoting Airbnb Rooms. If we are successful, I think this is going to bring in a whole new cohort of younger travelers, people that maybe weren't inclined to travel may now be able to travel and hopefully should list the overall marketplace for Airbnb. Great. Well, why don't I start, Justin, with AI. This is certainly the biggest revolution and test since I came to Silicon Valley. It's certainly as big of a platform shift as the Internet, and many people think it might be even bigger. And I'll give you kind of a bit of an overview of how we think about AI. So all of this is going to be built on the base model. The base models, the large language models, think of those as GPT-4. Google has a couple of base models, Microsoft reaches Entropic. These are like major infrastructure investments. Some of these models might cost tens of billions of dollars towards the compute power. And so think of that as essentially like building a highway. It's a major infrastructure project. And we're not going to do that. We're not an infrastructure company. But we're going to build the cars on the highway. In other words, we're going to design the interface and the tuning of the model on top of AI, on top of the base model. So on top of the base model is the tuning of the model. And the tuning of the model is going to be based on the customer data you have. And I'll just paint a picture for you. If you were to ask a question to ChatGPT, and if I were to ask a question to ChatGPT, we're both going to get pretty much the same answer. And the reason both of us are going to get pretty close the same answer is because ChatGPT doesn't know that it's between you and I, doesn't know anything about us. Now this is totally fine for many questions, like how far is it from this destination to that destination. But it turns out that a lot of questions in travel aren't really search questions. They're matching questions. Another is, they're questions that the answer depends on who you are and what your preferences are. So for example, I think that going forward, Airbnb is going to be pretty different. Instead of asking you questions like where are you going and when are you going, I want us to build a robust profile about you, learn more about you and ask you 2 bigger and more fundamental questions: who are you? And what do you want? And ultimately, what I think Airbnb is building is not just a service or a product. But what we are in the largest sense is a global travel community. And the role of Airbnb and that travel community is to be the ultimate host. Think of us with AI as building the ultimate AI concierge that could understand you. And we could build these world-class interfaces, tune our model. Unlike most other travel companies, we know a lot more about our guests and hosts. This is partly why we're investing in the Host Passport. We want to continue to learn more about people. And then our job is to match you to accommodations, other travel services and eventually things beyond travel. So that's the big vision of where we're going to go. I think it's an incredibly expanding opportunity. I'll just end by giving you some tactical things we're going to be doing in the next 12 months. Number one is customer service. This is going to be one of the biggest benefits to Airbnb. One of the strengths of Airbnb is that Airbnb's offering is one of a kind. The problem with Airbnb is our service is also one of a kind. And so therefore, historically less consistent than a hotel. I think AI can level the playing field from a service perspective relative to hotels because hotels have front desk, Airbnb doesn't. But we have literally millions of people staying on Airbnb every night. And imagine they call customer service. We have agents that have to adjudicate between 70 different user policies. Some of these are as many as 100 pages long. What AI is going to do is be able to give us better service, cheaper and faster by augmenting the agents. And I think this is going to be something that is a huge transformation. It's a bit all hands on deck, and used to be improvement later this year into next year. That's number one. Number two, we are now building AI into our product. And let me just give you an example. A few months ago, OpenAI launched plug-ins. And in fact, we were actually supposed to be one of the launch partners for the plug-ins on OpenAI ChatGPT. But I told Sam, we were literally one of the first to work with him that before right before our launch, I decided to pull the plug on it. And the reason why is I decided that the interface of pure tech space with widgets at the bottom was probably not the right interface for travel. Ultimately, I think the right interface for travel is multimodal. It's rich media. It's photo. It's video. It's much more immersive. And GPT-4 is available in our app. So we're going to be building GPT-4 into our interface. And I think that's the real opportunity for us. So you should see some big changes next year with AI built into our app. The final thing I'll say is developer productivity and productivity of our workforce generally. I think our employees could easily be, especially our developers, 30% more productive in the short to medium term, and this will allow significantly greater throughput through tools like GitHub's Copilot. So all of this is to say, I'm really excited on the short term and the long term. And the last thing I'll just say is I think the companies that will most benefit from the shift of AI are going to be the companies that have the most innovative cultures. That's kind of what happened in the '90s with the Internet. And if the last couple of years is any indication, having launched over 340 features of innovations, I think we're definitely going to be right at the forefront of this revolution. Yes, sure. Dave, why don't you take the first one? Yes. And Mark, I'll just share a little bit about Brazil and Germany. So Airbnb is one of the most international companies in the world. We're in 220 countries and regions. And many years ago, we developed a playbook to expand internationally outside the United States. And that playbook included PR, included having some people on the ground, although generally, in many these markets only need that. It included a brand marketing campaign and made sure that our product was adequately localized. And it's just a really full funnel approach. And now we've added social media and influencers as well. So recently, over the course of the pandemic, we were not as focused on international expansion. And that's because we're mainly focused on recovery and some of the new travel segments like longer-term stay. Over the last 3 years, obviously, as you know, we've gotten really, really focused, back to basics and our company is significantly more profitable. Now we've done over $3.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. So we feel like now is a really good time to focus on international expansion. So we started with Germany and Brazil. And again, it was full funnel. It involved a lot of PRs. It involve brand marketing, bringing our marketing ad campaigns to pricing in the United States to these markets, localizing our product and working with local influencers. So it's a pretty full funnel approach. The results have been incredibly positive. These are now 2 of our fastest-growing markets. So we're now looking at bringing this playbook to other markets around the world. And I'll give you a couple of examples. Number one is Asia Pacific. We think there's a huge opportunity in Asia. We're massively underpenetrated. This is going to be probably the fastest-growing market internationally over the next 5 years. And the problem with Asia historically over the last few years is Asia market, as you know, is a very much cross-border market. And with the borders being historically kind of locked down and there hasn't been as much travel, the recovery in Asia has been delayed. Now people are starting to travel, and Asia disproportionately has a lot of young travelers. And Airbnb, as you know, is very popular among the young travelers. So we think Japan, Korea, China, India and Southeast Asia are going to be huge opportunities for growth. Next is Europe. We're very big in France. We're very big in the U.K. We're now seeing great growth in Germany. But there's a lot of markets in Europe. We haven't ever really run robust brand marketing campaigns. Now we're getting more aggressive in Italy. We're getting more aggressive in Spain, and we're now looking at other markets in Northern Europe. And I think there's actually a lot of greenfield in Europe because we've really only focused on a few of the really big markets. And when we see we focus the big markets like France and U.K., we are now really strong. And I think we can have similar penetration in other countries in Europe. And then finally is Latin America. We're seeing a lot of growth in Brazil, and we're now going to bring it to some other really large markets, like Colombia and some other markets within Latin America. So I think international is going to be a pretty big boom to growth over the next 2, 3 years. The one thing I've learned about Airbnb is no matter how different every country is, the playbook doesn't have to vary that much. It works quite well in every market. And especially, it works with Airbnb because it's very much a cross-border network effect business. Yes. Richard, why don't I start at a high level? I think our long-term growth is going to only be as strong as our supply. If we were to back out, what happened in 2020, 2021, as that demand grew faster than supply. And initially, this was a great thing. But the problem is when demand grows faster than supply and there's supply constraints, prices generally go up. And as prices have risen, while that's been good for the bottom line, affordability in this economy is a major issue. And so one of the most important things we can do to make Airbnb affordable is to make sure we have enough supply in the platform. And so a year ago, we identified supply growth as a major strategic initiative that we really needed to accelerate, and we created an initiative called Mainstreaming Hosting. The idea is we wanted hosting to be as mainstream as traveling. And we did a number of things. We said, in order to mainstream hosting, we need to make it safe, easy and cool. So we launched AirCover, which is top to bottom protection. No one else offers it. They're going to be set up, and we did some marketing campaigns for the first time in many years. We've since seen, as you know, 900,000 incremental listings. It's now accelerating every single quarter since the IPO. And I think what's going to happen is all the supply coming out of the market will keep prices from going up. My hope is that while the hotel CEOs have said, they expect demand to drive prices up this summer, we want to actually have prices moderate. We think that's going to bring in a whole new generation of travelers to Airbnb. So ultimately, I think that like -- that's a very, very important consideration of the marketplace. The more affordable we are -- just like Amazon, the more affordable we are with a wider selection, the more people will come to Airbnb. So that's the high level. Now with regard to total price, this is primarily a U.S. issue. But in the U.S., as you know, there was a bit of an issue where some hosts had higher cleaning fees. And we heard a lot from guests. And I think what the total price display is going to do, it's going to push demand to listings that are -- have an overall better value of a total price. And when people turn on the price toggle, we see that people are booking listings with lower cleaning fees or no cleaning fees. And I think this is going to have a really good practice in the marketplace of driving the demand to the best value listings, rewarding those hosts and making sure every single host remains competitive. So it's just beginning. We set a pilot in December. It's now available to everyone, so we'll have to see how this plays out in the coming months. But what my expectation is based on our release last week, we launched a lot of features around affordability. We have many more -- much more affordable monthly stay products. Hosts now have monthly stay discounts, weekly stay discounts. We allow hosts to set more competitive prices. We're going to continue to add supply. And hopefully, this is going to continue to address the number one request of travelers, which is affordable offer since. David, do you want to take the second, and I'll get on with the first? And I can just take the first question, which is what we're seeing, Brian, is that people are most price sensitive, at least currently in North America, especially United States. And in the United States, the lowest price listings have the highest occupancy. So yes, people do want low price listings. And we expect that as Airbnb rates continue to normalize, and hopefully, our rates do not increase as fast to hotels over the next couple of years that we're going to see continued increase in occupancy for more listings in Airbnb and also is partly why we're so bullish about the prospect for Airbnb Rooms, not just to bring people to Airbnb that want affordable options, but really new travelers that have never really traveled very much before, especially Gen Z. Yes, Ron, I mean, great, great questions. Just to kind of step back, before the pandemic, we were really already focused on expanding beyond the core. In fact, we had 10 different divisions at Airbnb. We added a Home division. We had an Experience division. We had a Transportation division. We had a Magazine division. So we had a lot of efforts. And then obviously, the pandemic occurred, and we had to get focused back to basics. And what we wanted to do over the last few years is before we work on new things, we wanted to perfect our core service. One of the great source of inspiration I had was Apple. And I remember in the mid-2000s, it was 2006, and Apple had not yet launched the iPhone, but how many of us wanted Apple to come out with a phone? And the answer is a lot of people. And the reason people wanted Apple to expand their phone is because they love their iPod. But how many of us wanted gateway to come out with a phone? And the answer is probably not many, because we didn't love our gateway computer. And so I think that one of the things I've told our team is we have numerous expansion opportunities, but we need permission to expand beyond our core. We need people to first love our core service. So that's why over the last 3 years, we've been focused on really perfecting our core service. That being said, our core service is stronger than ever. It's more profitable than ever. And I think we're now ready to expand beyond the core. So as we speak, we are working actively on new products and services. These new products and services are going to be shipping. Beginning next year, you're going to see a number of things ship next May as part of the 2024 Summer Release. And we're going to see even more things shift later in the year and the years to come. Now obviously, there's a lot of opportunities. There's guest services, there's host services. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail. You obviously will have to tune in to talk. But I think it is important to note that I think that the biggest idea Airbnb has are in front of us. I don't want to think that the biggest idea I ever had when I was 26 working [indiscernible] my 2 cofounders. I think that there's so much more Airbnb can offer. And part of it is just making sure we continue to learn more, build robust profile, build an extensible platform model, continue to increase trust in the platform. And then what we can do is go into adjacencies within our core, but then including that, expand beyond the core. So I think you're going to see a lot of new opportunities. With regards to Experiences, I remain bullish about the product. I think there is a massive opportunity for someone to build a huge product around Experiences. Whether it's us and whether we're able to execute that product, we still have to prove that. One of my great investors -- one of our early investors is Marc Andreessen. He said there's no bad ideas, just ideas that are too early. And a lot of life is timing and experiences. I think when we launched in 2016, it launched right like leading into the pandemic. It was probably early. I think the timing is probably now better. But we did as we decided, let's take a pause on new submissions. Let's retool the product and hopefully put out something that is even more relevant to this next generation that are looking for things to do. So I remain really bullish on all of this. Dave? I always believe that the best loyalty program is people loving your products. And if they love your products, they come back. And I think that's the reason why nearly 90% of our traffic is direct to organic, and we have really strong rebooker rate. So I mean we haven't needed to have a loyalty program to have really good loyalty on Airbnb because people really love the experience. And ultimately, I think it's just a matter of continuing to innovate. Ultimately, we're in the inspiration business. People want to have good trips, and the best trip wins. And whatever company is most focused on listing the customer feedback, innovating as quickly as possible and taking giant leaps and experiences, I think it's going to be the most successful. So we're really bullish about this. Now that being said, for years, we've looked at a loyalty program. And I don't think a classic point program, which is essentially a subsidy to buy loyalty is the right approach for us. But we do think there's really compelling, interesting ways to reward our very best guests and something we've been actively thinking about. Nick, I can start. So I mean, I think part of our secret sauce is our ability to really try to elegantly balance supply and demand. One of the great things we've seen is the marketplace has a natural equilibrium that it finds in itself. For example, the fastest-growing markets of supply are also turned out to be the fastest-growing market for demand. So if demand creates supply, what ends up happening is a lot of these individual hosts get booked. They start making a bunch of money, obviously. The vast majority of them get booked within days of listing. And what ends up happening is they tend to open up more nights. They tell their friends about it and then supply increases. But we've also found a number of tactics. In fact, performance marketing is a very important way that we balance supply and demand. Other companies tend to use it as an arbitrage business to buy a lot of customers. We have never thought of it that way. We think of supply performance marketing really as a laser, to laser in on balancing supply and demand in markets all over the world. And frankly, the more supply we add, the more we think we're going to have really great value listings that will ultimately attract more demand. So I think we're able to balance this out throughout the coming year. And Jed, just to clarify question. When you say apartments, are you referring to the Airbnb-friendly apartment? With landlords and they'll take offers? Yes, Yes. 100%, yes. We believe that this can be expanded all over the world. We wanted to use United States as a proof of concept. Obviously, that was we thought the first place to start. We started with about 175 buildings. We now have, I think, over 250 buildings. We have Greystar and some of the biggest real estate developers in America on the platform. And that's been our proof of concept. But assuming this works, and all indications are it is going to work. If response has actually exceeded our expectation, at least from landlords, then yes, we'd love to bring this to Europe, Latin America and Asia. Dave, do you want to take the second question first? Yes. And maybe, Justin, before I answer about our model in Europe, I just want to also add something. So with most travel companies, their strategy is like basically paid marketing, right, performance marketing and brand marketing. I think a callout I just want to make is PR social media is a huge benefit to Airbnb. Historically, we have the largest share of voice in travel. Last week, we got 3,000 articles. I mean that was like more than 1/3 of the amount of press we got for IPO. So we think that there's a lot of opportunity for Airbnb to continue to be front and center in people's minds, in PR and social media and even in pop culture on TV shows, movies, songs, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the name of the game is both paid media and then earned media. And earned media is a really important part of the international story and international expansion because earned media really creates trust more than paid media. Now with regards to Europe, the one thing I just want to point out is we actually have both models. We have a model where we have a guest fee and host fee. We also have a model where we have a host-only fee. And host can choose, and we have this kind of choice for hosts, especially for larger property managers. Ultimately, especially with our total price display, I don't think it's a major issue for guests. I think ultimately, they're going to be looking at the total price. And we've not seen a major behavior change. I think, yes, they're most sensitive to total price. They're becoming more savvy. They're getting trained on total price. And that is partly why we moved our product towards an option of showing people total price. As long as we remain competitive, as long as we offer the best product and we offer the overall best value for the total price, I think that's ultimately what guests are going to care about. Yes. So I'll talk. One of the things -- I mean, what you'll notice is a lot of our updates last week were based on affordability. So we announced a partnership with Klarna, which is pay over time. we can pay in as many as 4 installments. I also want to add, we also announced a partnership with Stripe, where you can pay by bank account for monthly stay. This is really important because it means you don't have to pay for credit card to pay basically what is essentially rent and then also would increase conversion by lowering costs. So we're really focused. And a lot of what we're focused on is starting these payment services in the United States, kind of similar to Airbnb-friendly apartment. And assuming these partnerships work, no doubt we're going to be spanning these to markets all over the world. And you're correct, a lot of countries, people pay in installments more than even in the United States. So yes, Brazil end markets, emerging markets over the world, I think this will absolutely be a very compelling offering. We just like to get the product right in our more like established markets, like the United States before expanding it globally. But all indications are this is going to be very successful. Now as far as expanding our audience, yes. I mean, ultimately, the biggest market opportunity for any company is always the next generation. I mean the great thing about young people is more of them every year. And if you can continue to be the most relevant brand for a young audience, then you're going to continue to be able to ride that growth. And that's going to definitely be a boom for first-time bookers. And the great thing about young people is 15 years ago, I was 26, and my friends and I didn't have a lot of money. Now many of us have families and we're much older, we have more money. And so what we want to do is capture the next generation of travelers, and then they'll grow with us. And I think that Airbnb Rooms is a Gary entry-level product. It's a great way to introduce people to Airbnb. I noticed, for example, when I used to talk [indiscernible], he said that like diapers was a very important entry product to Amazon for families, right? You buy diapers and then I will see you need other things. This is maybe an extreme example, but I think Airbnb Rooms is a great way for new travelers to come to Airbnb. And if you think about it, between Airbnb Rooms allowing the pricing tool for hosts that price more affordably, total price, which should see the cleaning fees down and other discount products, I think we're going to have really one of the most affordable products in travel, bar none. Yes, Dave, why don't you take both, please? Doug, I think it's important to just step back and say that what we saw, even before the pandemic, was that long-term stays were growing, and they have been our fastest-growing segment by trip length. I think what the pandemic did is it probably accelerated some inevitable growth and there's huge opportunity for us. And I also think we're never going back to the way the world was before the pandemic. I do think there is some little bit of a post-pandemic equilibrium that you're starting to see. And we're also seeing a mix shift because cross-border urban nights are now up. That being said, I remain extremely bullish on long-term stays. I think this is going to be one of the big growth opportunities for Airbnb over the next 5 years. And the reason why is because people are permanently more flexible. Even bosses that want people back to the office, I think they're going to see incremental flexibility. More people going away for the summer, more people may be going away for the holidays. And ultimately, with AI, you're going to see an acceleration of people having more distributed and more global workforces. So all you have to do is believe Zoom is here to stay, to believe long-term stays are here to stay and that's what we're betting on. But the biggest feedback we've gotten on our long-term stay product was it was just sometimes a little more expensive to book long-term stay on Airbnb, because the platform was built for short-term stays. So we made over a dozen upgrades to long-term stays and a lot of more based on affordability. So starting with -- we now have a monthly dial for you to really discover monthly stays, which was really cool dial like an quick wheel that allows you to search from 1 month to a year on Airbnb. You can pay by bank account. This saves on credit card processing fees. You can pay over time. We have more flexible cancellation policies. So you now can cancel a long-term stay up to 1 month before check-in. We have new discounting tools for hosts on weekly stays and monthly stays, and we have many other upgrades as well for monthly stays. So I think we're going to see a lot more growth. And one of the big opportunities, I think, that we're going to see is more people starting to come to Airbnb to list exclusively long-term stay. People that have no intention of hosting on a nightly basis will host long term. Another thing we believe is going to happen is we think long-term stays could be a gateway to short-term stays. There might be a host that are uncomfortable hosting on a nightly basis, but they're used to having a tenant and they might go to Airbnb to rent monthly. And over time, we might be able to get them more comfortable on a short-term basis. So we think this is a really big opportunity for us. But I do think there is some normalization in the post-pandemic equilibrium, but I believe this is still a major growth opportunity for years to come. All right. Yes. Lee, I'll start with the first one, competitive environment. I think it's important to note that Airbnb is more than double the size. And most of the travel industry is only a little bit larger than they were before the pandemic. So there's been a major mix shift share towards Airbnb. I think we're starting to see some of the old ways of traveling recover, specifically urban and cross-border. But ultimately, we're really focused on innovating. We're focused on playing our own game, and I think that we're going to continue to focus on a few areas. We're going to continue the Mainstream Hosting. And we think we're going to be adding more supply of homes than any other company. Next, we're going to be focused on perfecting our core service. I think there's potentially down the road to tipping point, where a whole new cohort of people could be comfortable using Airbnb. The biggest obstacle to Airbnb historically has been reliability and consistency. As I said, the biggest strength we have is we're one of a kind. The biggest weakness we have is it's just hard to be as consistent as a hotel. But again, with AI, being able to supplement and augment customer service and with many of our other initiatives to perfect the core service, I think we can introduce a whole new category of travelers to Airbnb. And this doesn't even include many of the opportunities we have with younger travelers, with new markets and new products and services that are only on Airbnb. I also just generally would just say, one of the big guiding principles I have is to focus on the things only Airbnb can do. And if we focus on the things that only Airbnb can do, then in a sense, you're going to come to Airbnb and we're going to have a lot of demand, a lot of exclusive traffic. And Airbnb Rooms is just one of many examples of something that only Airbnb offers. And so we're going to continue to be competitive, but we're also going to focus on things that only we offer. Dave? All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Just to recap, we had a strong start to 2023. Revenue was $1.8 billion, which is 20% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both records for Q1, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $3.8 billion and that represents a free cash flow margin of 44%. I'm really proud of the progress we made. If you look at over the last 3 years, how much more profitable the company's become, I think a lot of that has been based on our discipline and our execution. And speaking of execution, our product just keeps getting better, and we continue to innovate with more than 50 upgrades and features last week and many more ahead later this year. I'm proud of what we're doing, and I'm really excited for the road ahead. So thank you all, and we'll talk next quarter."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand it over to Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAngela Yang: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's third quarter of 2024 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Ellie Mertz. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2024.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining. Airbnb had a strong third quarter. Nice and experiences booked accelerated throughout Q3 and into Q4. Despite a slower start to the quarter due to shorter booking lead times compared to last year bookings grew steadily each month returned to double-digit growth by the end of Q3. We had a $123 million nights and experience booked. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Net income was $1.4 billion, representing net income margin of about 37%. And we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. In fact, our total trailing 12 month free cash flow was $4.1 billion, which allowed us to repurchase $1.1 billion of our shares in the quarter. And as of the end of Q3, we have $4.2 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. Now, during Q3, we continue to make progress across our three strategic initiatives, which are making hosting mainstream, prospecting our core service and expanding beyond the core. Now I am going to share a few highlights about each. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We are focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling on Airbnb. Today, we have over 8 million active listings with growth across all regions and market types. To retain and track new hosts, we prioritize making hosting easier. Last month, as part of our 2024 winter release, we introduced co-host networks, an easy way to find the best local host to manage your Airbnb. Co-hosts are some of our most experienced hosts. They provide personalized support ranges from listing setups, can managing bookings and communicating with guests. Second, we're prospecting our core service. Over the past three years, we've launched more than 535 new features and upgrades to make Airbnb a better service. Our 2024 winner release included over 50 upgrades for guests that make Airbnb a more intuitive and personalized App. This includes features like recommended destinations, suggested search filters and personalized listing highlights. We're also focused on one of the top issues for guests, listing quality. Since last year, we removed over 300,000 listings that failed to meet guest expectations. And we will continue to invest in improving the quality of guest stays. Finally, we're expanding beyond our core. Outside of our core markets, there are many countries and regions that remain underpenetrated and we're focused on these expansion markets as part of a global market strategy and we're seeing great results.. In Q3, the growth rate of nights booked in our expansion markets more than doubled that of our core markets. Now, in addition to driving growth in our expansion markets, we're also preparing for an Airbnb\u2019s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations. And you'll see more about this next year. We also saw a number of positive business highlights in Q3. First, guest demand accelerated throughout the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, after a slower start in July, bookings accelerated each month in Q3. Global lead times also normalized throughout the quarter. Now part of this growth has been driven by our App strategy. Nights booked on our App increased 18% year-over-year in Q3. App bookings now account for 58% of nights booked. Now this is up from 53% in the same period last year. And we also saw continued growth of first-time bookers, with the highest growth among young travelers. This is quite exciting. And I'm really excited to share that we recently surpassed 2 billion guest arrivals on Airbnb. Second, our global market strategy is working. We continue to drive growth by investing in underpenetrated markets. While our timing and investment level will vary by market, our strategy is consistent, to make Airbnb local and relevant in more places around the world. Now in each market, we focus on finding product market fit, increasing brand awareness, and driving traffic. And I want to just use one country as an example, which is Japan. Airbnb is still pretty new in Japan and it's pretty unfamiliar to most Japanese travelers. So to raise awareness, we launched a brand campaign last month is centered on domestic travel. Beyond Japan though, we are all so introducing more local payment options and countries around the world like Vietnam, Denmark and Poland and in fact, by spring of next year, we expect to offer nearly 40 local payment methods around the world. Now finally, supply quality is improving on Airbnb. We are focused on removing low-quality supply, as well as make it easier for guests to find the best places to stay. I shared that we removed over 300,000 listings last year. And we are seeing the - we're already seeing this payoff. Customer service contact rates have decreased, guest MPS has improved, and we're also reducing host cancellations, which are now almost 30% lower than a year ago. And we've made it so much easier for guests to find the best place to stay with Guests Favorites. In fact, since launching Guest Favorites a year ago, last November, over 200 million nights have been booked at Guest Favorite listings. All right, next I want to share briefly some highlights from our 2024, which was last month on October 16th. Starting with the Co-Host network. We know that hosting Airbnb is one of the best ways to make money from our home. But not everyone has the time to host. So that\u2019s why we introduced Co-Host Network, an easy way for people to find the best - to find and hire the best local co-host to manage the Airbnb. Co-host offer personalized support for host needs, everything from setting up your listing, demands your bookings and communicating with guests. These are super experienced hosts with an exceptional track record, 73% are super hosts and 84% manage Guest Favorite. Now, when we announced this on October 16th, we launched the Co-Host Network with 10,000 Co-Hosts across 10 countries. In this three weeks since we launched, we've already received interest from over 20,000 potential new co-hosts. This is huge, this is way bigger than we were expecting. And we are making co-hosting easier, we really believe that co-host network will allow us to lock even more high quality supply. And we also introduced safety updates for guests and make Airbnb a more intuitive and personalized App. And some of the features include a personalized welcome tour of the App for first-time guests, suggested destinations, winning guests pass the search bar will recommend locations on their search and booking history. And for our hosting highlights. So when a guest views, a listing, we will highlight the details that are relevant to their search and there are dozens of these features just like these. This is quite literally the beginning of a more personalized Airbnb. Now turning to Q4, last quarter, we talked about shorter booking lead times, but as I shared nights and experiences booked accelerated throughout the quarter, returning to double-digit growth by the end of Q3. While we know the comps from last year will get harder in the back of the quarter, we are anticipating that nights booked will accelerate in Q4 relative to Q3. So with that Ellie and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nRichard Clarke: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a question on supply. It looks like you stopped sort of giving us the year-on-year supply growth I guess because of the removals. I guess,, any color on what\u2019s happening to maybe gross supply growth. And whether the removals you are doing and additions you are doing and seeing any meaningful shift towards professional hosts as you guys do that process or co-listed supply. And then maybe any color on whether this co-hosting is unlocking supply here. You talked about adding co-hosts, but are you getting additional supply due to the co-hosting initiatives?\nEllie Mertz: Yes, thanks, Richard. Let me talk a little bit about what we've seen on supply. As you probably noted, our initiatives around supply have really morphed over the last 12 months. We can continue to focus on growing our overall supply base. But we incrementally are focused on making sure that we are delivering very high quality levels of supply across the world to our guests. And the two important features that we've done to drive quality are obviously introduction of Guest Favorites a year ago, and then ,second the removals that you called out over the last 12 months. And the interesting thing is, we\u2019ve seen what we hope to have seen from these quality initiatives, in particular, what we see is that, based on encouraging our guests to use Guest Favorites and taking down those listings that we believe do not meet our quality expectations or those of our guests. What we see is that the average rating of our stays goes up. The incident rates go down and customer service contacts go down as well. So, we're seeing the intended impact of those quality efforts, which we believe, one, it improves the guest experience, second, allows for improvements of rebooking rates over time; and third, more broadly increases booking confidence around Airbnb. To the specific questions in terms of what has happened to the supply growth? It continues to be strong and in Q3, we continue to see Supply growth exceed demand by a couple of points. So it continues to be the very healthy, but again the focus more recently has been on incrementally raising the quality bar on Airbnb, not just adding more supply to the platform. Brian, do you want to talk about co-hosting or actually take that as well?\nBrian Chesky : Yeah, I can take. Yeah, I can take that. Richard, it\u2019s a great question. Airbnb, I think we are just scratching the surface of how big this company can become. And the growth rate of demand is going to fall probably in line with the growth rate of supply. And so, one of the questions we had was, well, how do we get millions more listings in Airbnb? And how do we not just get millions of property managed listing? How do we get millions of regular everyday people to put their homes in Airbnb? Well, we are doing obviously a lot of research and we've asked people and we learned two things. The first thing we learned is that, people are very interested in making extra money in the home Ttey already have and make sense, they pay for this asset. That they can make tens of thousand dollars a year. Why wouldn't you want to put on Airbnb? But the second thing we learned was that the number and reason people don't host is because a lot of people say they don't have the time. And so that\u2019s why we ask ourselves, what if we get match people with homes, that don't have time with people have extra time that don't have homes. The Venn diagram would potentially unlock millions more listings and the best part of all was this would be alternative so some of the third-party property management companies if you want to have one of the best host to Airbnb and the average 5 star rating. for co-host in Airbnb is significantly higher than the average rating of a third-party property manager. So that's what we did with the Co-Host Networks. Now we start with 10,000, co-host. We have 20,000 people that apply in the three week expense. And this is going to be something that we're going to be focusing on in the coming years to come. But, to answer your questions very directly, Richard, not only would this unlock more supply, I think in the coming years, this is going to lock millions of listings. I think that they - the vast majority of them are going to be everyday people that are going to list exclusively on Airbnb.\nRichard Clarke: Thanks. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Hey, thanks. Two questions please. You talked about this acceleration or improvement in. room nights as you kind of went through the quarter. Did that come from any particular geographic areas? We'd heard that Europe was one a market that was recovering maybe faster than others. Was that your experience, as well? And then, just back on the co-hosting experience, you had this out in a series of markets for a while. Is it how long do we see materiality come through it? Like have you seen these in relatively small markets where you\u2019ve rolled it out this will become material to the growth rate in those markets already in the 6 to 12 month, period or is this take a just more of like a 12 to 24 month process? Thank you..\nEllie Mertz: Thanks, Mark. Let me first answer your first question with regard to the acceleration of the business. What we shared in the letter was that for your line to where we were back at the time of the last earnings call, we called out that there was a bit of softness globally related to lead times is specifically what we shared with that. We were seeing continued strength of last minute bookings, but relative softness in terms of the longer lead times. And what we saw over the course of the quarter, specific to both the regions that you called out, but globally was that lead times over the course of July, August and September normalized and came back almost in line to where we were in \u201823. I think you saw that most notably in EMEA and I think probably some of the, long lead time softness that we were seeing in EMEA was certainly related to some distraction around the Olympics because we certainly saw the bookibgs pick up after the Olympics pass, but more broadly that acceleration was seen across all four major regions. And then, on the co-hosting, Brian gave you, I think a broad answer in terms of the expectations there. One of the reasons that we had confidence in terms of launching the Co-host Network more broadly is, the pilots that we've had over the last several years, in particular, in France, what we've seen is that, the co-host themselves are very incremental in terms of going out and attracting high quality listings themselves. Obviously, it will take time for us to scale co-hosting to a level that is, meaningful relative to the scale of our current business. But what we've seen from those pilots is extremely encouraging and we'll continue to build out the network from here on.\nOperator: And your next question is going to come from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Excuse me. The first one, I think that the 4Q EBITDA guide sort of implies a margin somewhere in the 20s around 27%, 28%. Is there any sort of timing factors you call out that are sort of driving the margin down at that level? And then, how do we sort of think about philosophically the levels of investment and sort of the philosophy around investment and margins into next year to sort of go off this 27 number in the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nEllie Mertz: Yes. So Brian, talking a little bit about Q4 obviously, the guide does imply a, several points margin compression relative to last Q4. And you should see that most specifically in terms of both the product development line item as well as marketing. In marketing, we continue to invest in our global expansion markets in our comm strategy around icons and then also Performance Marketing where we're seeing really great efficiencies. There's also a little bit of timing difference in terms of spend from Q3 getting into Q4. But in aggregate, the level of incremental marketing spend on a year-over-year basis is relatively modest. So your second question is, how do we think about the level of investment and philosophy around margins in 25? Let me let me give you a little bit of color in terms of our overall approach as we head into to 2025 Obviously, we will give more color in the following earnings call. But let me just talk a little bit about the approach today. So, if you think about how we've been managing our P&L, I think it's important you're certainly well aware of our history. But I think it's important to reflect on how well we've managed the, the overall P&L since we went public. We've been extremely disciplined in terms of delivering over a quarter basis points of EBITDA margin expansion since 2020 going from negative margins in in 2019 and 2020 to over 35% consistent with our outlook this year. And we\u2019ve demonstrated consistently over these last several years that our business model is, extremely strong. It's extremely profitable and obviously has world-class levels of cash flow generation. And over the long term, I think you can expect that there is opportunity for further margin expansion. But when you remind through where we are right now? We've talked a lot about this. We see a huge incredible opportunity to invest in growth, both investing in growth in our core accommodations business, as well as our new offerings. And so, as we head into 2025, we will continue to lean into our growth initiatives around core optimizations, global markets expansions and new products and services, which is then the question is, how exactly will we be managing the P&L? Let's say for the core business, our goal is every year to make the core business better and more efficient, and deliver greater value for our guests and hosts. And the way we do that is to find incremental efficiencies every year across in particular variable costs. And invest some of that into greater service levels on both sides of the marketplace. In addition to that in terms of the growth investments, in \u201825, we will be investing in our existing expansion markets, as well as a handful of incremental expansion markets and we will be launching new products with our upcoming 2025 spring release. The good news about these investments is that, we intend for them to be relatively capitalized, consistent with our core business. but we will be adding members to our teams and spending to our marketing to support these growth levers. We will provide greater detail on the exact level of investment and growth expectations on our next call early next year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, recently you\u2019ve passed the two billion guest milestone and you did that next one billion much faster than your first one billion. As you look at the business today, what do you - what investments you need to make to attract that next billion plus guests to Airbnb when you look at just the types of people taking trips today? What demographics do you under-index on? And how do you think some of these service releases can really bring that next wave of customers? And thank you.\nBrian Chesky : Justin, it\u2019s a great question. Maybe I'll just start by stepping back, it's pretty crazy that Airbnb has been used by two billion guests. Because I remember when we started Airbnb, I remember telling investors one day this company be huge, thousands of people will use it. And I think there's been a common like pattern where we keep saying it's going to be big and it\u2019s even bigger than we imagined. And I think the reason why is, the travel industry, as you know, you guys cover it is it's approximate the size of the oil industry. And people love traveling. And one thing I know about the future is more people travel in the past. And, I think that we'll be creative with the new category. And this is the business that is approaching half a billion nights booked a year. And so the question is, well, how do we get to a billion nights a year? Or how do we get a company to even be an order of magnitude bigger one day? Because I'm 43 years old. I started to from my 26. And I feel like I got a couple decades ahead of me. And so, where do we go from here? I think that if you think about the history of this company I think you could maybe break it up into a few chapters. The first chapter was when we had this idea, Tony and I in 2008 - and we went on it really crazy [Indiscernible] And now it\u2019s Phase one. And then I would say the second chapter which are probably in now exiting was the beginning of the pandemic, we lost 80% of our business and then we had the right size the company, become really profitable, go public, listing the customer feedback and really strengthen the foundation for the next chapter of the company. And that\u2019s kind of the stage we are in. And I think the next chapter of Airbnb is starting next May. Because I think the next chapter is really about taking Airbnb and expanding this beyond our core business. And so, I will outline three areas that are going to allow us to grow and let's start with the shortest horizon to a longest horizon. The shortest horizon is actually just our core business. Again, we do, - we're approaching 500 million room nights booked a year, I think our core business could certainly get to a billion nights a year. I am not going to put a time horizon on it, but the way we are going to do that, is we are going to continue to increase quality. For everyone who stays in Airbnb, nine people staying on a town. So the question is, what if we could just 1 of those other people to stay in Airbnb? That's how you get to a billion. And so, we think quality, mansion quality is a part of it. I think our work on affordability and usability are also going to be really, really critical. So we're going to continue to focus on the core business. The next horizon, our Global Market. A huge percent of our business is still concentrated in five countries,The US, Canada, Australia, France, UK. So those are all our core markets. But there are massive opportunities in emerging markets. There's nine of them that I'm focused on in the Americas, it\u2019s Mexico and Brzil. In Europe, it\u2019s Germany, Italy and Spain. And in Asia, it\u2019s the big four countries, which are Korea. Japan, India and China. I think this is what I've described as a medium-term horizon. And, by the way, just as for a second, if there was one company in the world, that you can bet on to expand internationally, I think it will be a global travel network. So, I think there's a huge amount of opportunity here. And the biggest opportunity by far is expanding beyond our core business. I'm reminded of Amazon, one of the biggest companies in the world. And they started as an online book seller and can you imagine if Amazon was only selling books to the half way they would become? And yet we for the last 17 years for the most part have only sold one thing, which is basically vacation rentals Airbnb homes by the night. And so, I think that we have a huge opportunity to expand beyond our core business of accommodations. Amazon went from books to what they do first after books, they did CDs and DVDs and people used to buy both. And that was a very close adjacency. And eventually, they sold everything and then they even sold things beyond consumers to enterprise. I think Airbnb is going to go on it\u2019s own journey and what I expect is every year now, for the coming years, we will launch 1 to 2 new businesses that will generate $1 billion or more of revenue incrementally a year. I'm not going to be able to share everything we're doing or even most of the things we are doing. We like to reveal them during our release, but one thing that we've previewed to you was we are going to be reimagining Airbnb experiences and those are going to be coming next May, but we have some really core other things that we are working on. And it\u2019s going to basically be starting with the nearest adjacencies around travel and over the next decade, we're going to go far beyond travel.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open,\nJustin Post: Great, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the new markets. If you could give us the expansion markets, maybe some of the biggest ones there? I know Japan is one of them and then, how big they are. So we can think about the growth contribution next year. Thank you..\nEllie Mertz: Yeah, Justin, let me just give you some context in terms of our overall kind of concentration of the business. So, if we think about the core markets and again remember those are US, Canada, Australia, France, and the UK. They currently represent about three quarters of our gross booking value. And then the rest of the world is obviously a quarter. The expansion markets that we're focused on are kind of 15% approximately of the remainder. But in a normalized world should be significantly larger. So if you give, - just to give you a sense in terms of kind of the success that we've had, that encourages us to keep going down this path and adding more expansion markets. I just call out actually Brazil because it was one of our first expansion markets that we began to focus on about two years ago. We introduced localized brand campaigns. We localized the products. We provided incremental payment methods to make it more locally relevant. And if we look at the success of that specific market, would you see - what you would see is that, for Brazil, from a destination nights perspective is actually about three times as large as it was pre-pandemic. And you can see just like paying attention to a particular market deploying, our full funnel marketing strategy, being very thoughtful about product market fit allows us to scale these currently smaller portions of our business to over time a significantly larger proportion. On the other end of the spectrum, I would highlight Japan, which we obviously called out in our shareholder letter, given the recency of our um, of our - the launch of our brand campaign there. That\u2019s obviously a significantly large market. But we are relatively new in the eyes of Japanese travelers. And so if they've opportunity to really introduce ourselves to the local traveler have them under understand the opportunity locally to use Airbnb domestically and begin to scale that business commensurately. And so, when you think about the scale of these markets where we are today, Brian and I characterized this as a medium-term opportunity, because the immediate opportunity is large, but it will take time for us to scale these individual markets such that they have an increasing impact in terms of our consolidated global results given the relative concentration to that.\nOperator: And your next question comes form the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz : Great. Thanks so much. A couple of I could? Maybe you, your online travel peers have given color that's what they think their long-term bookings growth how that looks like. I mean, I guess, given your leverage to alternative accommodations, because the assumption is that you guys should be able to go faster. Can you give any color maybe on sort of what you see is the long-term growth algorithm for your core business? And then, what new verticals may add to that on top of that? And then one follow-up if I could.\nBrian Chesky : Yeah, Lee, maybe Ellie before you answer the question, can I just say one quick thing? Lee, o don\u2019t think we do alternative accommodations. I think alternative accommodations is what our competitors OTAs do? I think alternative accommodations is a bit of a catch all that includes property managed homes, service apartments, boutique hotels. But I've never heard a customer say alternative accommodations. I hear them say Airbnb. I am going to book in Airbnb. I am going to get Airbnb. And I think we are really in a category of our own. So, just you know, I just think we don't refer to it and we don't think of it as alternative accommodations. So Ellie, over to you.\nEllie Mertz: Yes, thanks Lee. So we think about overall growth algorithm and our growth drivers it's exactly as Brian has described earlier in terms of talking about the opportunity. It really starts with focusing on our core offering and optimizing it such that we are effectively limiting the barriers, to trying Airbnb relative to alternatives in particularly hotels. And so that's why we focus so much on things like affordability and reliability, because we know, for many consumers, even though they're aware of Airbnb, there is a gap in terms of their booking confidence around what they are going to get from us. And so, every quarter, we work at reducing that gap of consideration. And when we look at the business from that perspective, there's a huge amount of growth room ahead even in our core markets, because we know so many consumers consider - continue to consider themselves as hotel guests. not necessarily Airbnb guests. And so, a lot of the optimizations and marketing are both raising considerations, as well as helping people frankly get through our platform more easily by making it easier to book, making it more personalized and getting them the right listing. So, we continue to focus on these core optimizations, because we believe it's a considerable future, current I should say and future growth lever that will continue to pay dividends in particular in our core markets but more globally, more generally globally across our platform. The second component is what I just spoke about in terms of responding to Justin. Our business today is over-concentrated in our core markets and is not necessarily reflective of the commensurate business opportunity across the globe. And so, over the couple of years, you should see, assuming that our global market strategy is successful. You should see the contributions to growth of those expansion markets grow every single quarter and I think the results that we've delivered so far this year suggest that that is, that is working. We just need to continue to scale those businesses such as they contribute to global growth more significantly.\nLee Horowitz : Great. And then, to the extent that sort of your improving 4Q outlook the acceleration is really nice, it is an output of some of the investments that you guys are putting into place driving the kind of gains that you want. Does this give you confidence to throw fuel on the fire and invest more aggressively behind those initiatives? And maybe how we should think about the way that that interplay should play through in terms of margin over the longer term?\nEllie Mertz: Well, I think where we've seen success. One of the areas is core optimization and so we have built out the product roadmap around that because where we see success in terms of improvements we're making to the booking flow. We continue to keep a stable set of resources against those challenges. So that every single quarter, the price is getting better and we're delivering more gains from those product improvements.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The question of core initiatives here, can you guys talk about the progress you have made and affordability, and quality that\u2019s driving, maybe some of the increased bookings that we\u2019ve seen in the quarter ? And also, can you give us an update on the outcome from a service transformation, maybe what's working, what's not and what's yet to be improved? And when do you expect to complete the process? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky : Yeah, I got this. Hey James, these are great questions. I'm really excited about it. So, I'll take each, affordability and reliability and customer service. Affordability, it's funny, the first tagline Airbnb ever had was an affordable alternative a hotel. And it was the number one reason that people first tried to use Airbnb. Now I think today that's not the main reason people use Airbnb. I think they use it because they want to travel like a local. They want more space. They want homes in real neighborhood, better equipped, but it's really, really important that we don't ever leave our roots of affordability. And I think in the pandemic, I think there was so much demand, there was constrained supply, prices went up, and I think we addressed it from our affordability risk. So, a couple of years ago, we actually got very, very serious about driving more affordable in Airbnb. And we did a few things. The first thing we did is, we heard a lot of complaints about rising cleaning fees and I set the fees in Airbnb. So we introduced total price display, total price slates exactly what it sounds like you can click it on and see the total price upfront. And, since we\u2019ve done that, more than 300,000 listings have removed or lowered their cleaning fees. But this has been huge. Next, we introduced weekly and monthly discounts. And now more than, - we're introducing more entry points in weekly, monthly discounts.Two-thirds of hosts now offer discounts. In fact, more than half of our hosts offer a monthly discount and now 70% of our nights booked are for monthly stays. We introduced a similar listings tool. So what we noticed was a lot of hosts were overestimating what they could make on a nightly basis, especially new hosts. So we built the tool for you to see other listings in your neighbourhood and 2 million hosts have used this tool. And basically, when most of who use this tool they realize that they need to make sure they are competitive and so it brings the prices in line. Now over the this past release on October 16th, we also added a couple more different features like price tips, hosts can now view suggested prices based on similar listings in that area and search tips. So throughout the guest search, we're going to offer relevant tips to help them find last minute stays. And probably the most important thing you can do to drive affordability is just continue to increase supply. But we know about almost every marketplace is that as supply goes up relative to demand prices come down and so that's a really big effort for us. The results have been the following: In the last two years, while Airbnb prices on a like-for-like basis, if you net out mix shift, has it remains fairly constant hotel prices have gone up considerably. So we believe that we've actually become more competitive from \u2013 cancelling relative hotels last year. That\u2019s affordability. Now reliability. Reliability, as I said is probably the most important thing that we can do to drive more growth in our core business. If we do nearly 100 million nights a year in bookings, the question is, how do we get the next 100 million nights booked. And there is no silver bullet, but the closest thing to a silver bullet is quality and reliability. And there is a lot of things we are doing, quite literally dozens. But I can just pick two. The two things I\u2019d pick are at the top, Guest Favorites, piloting the two million best listings in Airbnb. We also highlight the best 1%, 5% and 10% listings. As Ellie mentioned, we\u2019ve got 200 million nights booked just in Guest Favorites. Now, this is amazing. Why it is great? Because number one, customer service contact, these listings are down , our profitability on a per booking basis goes up, NPS is up, because NPS is up that means that rebooking rates are up. That also means the word of mouth is up, but most importantly, a lot of people that wouldn't have considered staying in Airbnb, now would. I mean, I'm going to go on a NIM and say that while the average Airbnb is not as reliable as a hotel, I believe the average Guest Favorite is. And we have two million to choose from. Two million listings is more inventory than Hilton or Marriott, nearly combined, by the way. So there's a lot of selection here. At the bottom-end, just like any company you need to make sure you reward the top performers and you also deal with the people that aren't performing. We've removed more than 300,000 listings over the last year, the last two years of hosts that weren't meeting our quality standards. So, these are just some of the things we're doing on reliability. The last is customer service. And we are going through a really exciting transformation on customer service. I don\u2019t want to be one of the CEOs just brings up AI every earnings call, because I think you got a happy measure, but we are seeing some really great progress on AI-powered customer service. The way we think about customer service Powered by AI is in three phases. Phase 1 is the phase we're in right now. If you were to most of - first of all most of our customer contacts, we get over 10 million contacts here, most of the contacts that we anticipate getting in the coming years aren't going to be phone calls. They're going to be chatting through the App. I think really personally don't like calling customer service and having to dial, and I want to be able to chat. And chat AI can intercept. And so, we think in the future the vast majority of our chats are going to be intercepted in the end directly by the AI agent. And so there's really three phasing for this. Phase 1 is just answer basic general questions. We're rolling out a pilot that could answer basic general questions. Phase two, is personalization, personalize the questions. Phase three is to take actions. So I\u2019ll give you an example, let me just give you one example. Let's say, I were to contact customer service and I\u2019d say, how do I cancel a reservation. In Phase one, what we are doing now AI agent will answer \u2013 copy even better the average customer service agent how do cancel a reservation. So Phase 2 is how you cancel reservation step-by-step. Phase 2 personalization, they\u2019ll say, hey Brian, I see you have a reservation coming up in Los Angeles next week. Here is how you cancel that reservation. And Phase three is taking actions. It would say hey Brian. I see you have a reservation come to Los Angeles. Would you like me to cancel it for you? Just tell me yes and I\u2019ll do it for you. I can even handle the rebooking. So this is where we think customer service can go enabled by AI, and we've hired some of the best people in the world to work on this and I really excited to tell you more progress about it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug, if you could check to see if your line is on mute. And moving forward to our next question from Kevin Kopelman with TD Securities. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks a lot. A question on the new services that are expected to come out next year. Do we think of those new services as driving some revenue growth right off of that for the second half next year? Or areyou anticipating more gradual rollouts in more of 2026 revenue drivers? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky : Yeah, I can take that and Ellie feel free to add. Kevin, the answer is a little bit of both, I mean, we are, the way like \u2013 let\u2019s just back up? So Uber, let's just take Uber. I admire that company. They've done really well. When they launched Uber Eats, they launched in one market. And they had it city-by-city market and was very, very gradual. We are not going to do that. We're going to be much more aggressive. When we launch the new offerings next year, they are going to be available immediately in more than a 100 cities around the world. So we believe in trying to reach scale a little more quickly just given how big and how mature we are. So, because of that, we do think there will be some incremental revenue next year, that will hit the financials. But I also just want to like step back and just say that what we've learned from Uber Eats, from Amazon category expansion, from Door Dash, from we can go down the list of marketplaces is, when something's built off of small base, you've got to be patient. I think that there's a, multi-billion dollar revenue opportunities, multiple of them that will be introduced next year. But I also would point people to a 5-year Horizon. For a number of these things to really reach scale, not, they won't reach scale in just a year or two. And part of that is it's a network effect business. We want to roll it out carefully. We want to make sure it\u2019s really well done. Ellie, do you want to add anything?\nEllie Mertz : The one thing I would add is, Kevin, we will obviously give you much more detailed color next year on the next earnings call. But what you should anticipate is that, some of the investment behind those new services will front run the revenue. So you'll begin to see those expenses or those investments I should say, at the beginning of the year, whereas the revenue will start to scale once we've released the new offering.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with /Truist. Your line is open.\nPatrick Scholes: Great. Thank you. Good evening. I want to go back to the first question I was asking and ask it maybe a little more direct. Can you provide us in percentage terms what your year-over-year net unit growth was in the quarter? Thank you.\nEllie Mertz : On Supply?\nPatrick Scholes: Yeah. Supply, correct.\nEllie Mertz : Yeah so we had over 10% growth of supply as of the end of Q3, which is down several points based on the removals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask about the Experiences offering. As you get closer to the relaunch next year, how are you thinking about sort of the pace of expansion and scalability? I know, you'd like to keep experiences unique like your accommodations offering. But I'm curious if that means it will take longer to build supply behind it. And maybe, you could also sort of give us a sense for any investments in Tech or marketing that you plan to make around the relaunch of Experiences? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yeah, John, really good question. I think we are able to reach a sweet spot where I think we can - we're going to offer something that's really, really unique and we will scale. Now, I want to just moderate expectations that again, these Journeys are going to be multi-year journeys that I do not think that there's a choice. I don't think we need to make a choice between you mean unique or being at scale. I think - by the way, I think our core business proof that a business that\u2019s approaching a hundred billion dollars in gross sales a year. And it's pretty unique, it's pretty different than a hotel. So, I'm not going to certainly promise that experience we'll get to that size, but we do think we have something that's very unique, very scalable available around the world. As far as the Tech and marketing, the great thing about our business is, are you not anticipate very many businesses in the next five years are going to need significant investments. We are certainly nothing like many other companies where they have a lot of either capital allocation or major technical investments or even major marketing investments. Here's another way of saying it. We've already made most of the technology investments. When you see the last four years, a huge amount of what we've done is rebuilt the company from the ground up, not just to make it stronger to offer homes, to make it an extensive platform. One of those companies that we learnt from again was Amazon. I know, I talk a lot about Apple. A lot of people reference Apple when they talk about them because of their big launches. But Apple, Amazon is a very good reference point. Initially, as you know, they built a bookstore. They were based on like, IBM. They had to rebuild the platform and I\u2019d extract the platform and you might call compromising to build offer many room verticals. And so, we want to take every new platform that works certification and build it for the next decade for like 50 or 100 different categories, just like Amazon. So now, I think with the timeline when we offer them, but we've rebuilt the technology already most of it to be able to do that. Now with marketing, I don\u2019t think we are going to market everything as standalone businesses. We really like the idea of marketing, all of Airbnb. In marketing there's these two choices. Are you a house the brand or a branded house? We're a branded house. We're one App. We are one brand and we want to market everything in one Ad. So that's a little bit more how we're going to approach it. And so I think for those reasons we will, of course, be investing. I want to be clear, we of course be investing, but it's not going to be like many other companies where they have to go deep and sort of right and get the new business off the ground.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Great, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two if I may? Can you talk about in areas such as New York City, where the regulations are becoming increasingly difficult? Can you talk about how we should view those and then potentially leaning more into hotels? And then, as you grow outside some of these non-core markets, is it going to be more brand-driven or will you lean more into Performance Marketing? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Hey Jud. I'll take that. Yes, so let\u2019s talk about New York. Actually, I would like to talk about two cities. I want to talk about a tale of two cities. New York City and Paris. Because both cities need some major decisions on Airbnb recently and I want to distinguish differencing the two. New York City has, might be this before the housing crisis and that\u2019s a very real thing. And so the decided one of the ways they try to feel with that was banning Airbnb. And a year ago, Airbnb was banned and the theory was that if you ban Airbnb, a bunch of homes will come back on the rental market and prices will come down. Well, for the first time we've gotten a year-long longitudinal study of what happened in Airbnb into the city. Rent prices in New York City are not down. In fact, they're up 3.5%. And by the way, hotel prices are now up to 7%. So, a year after banning Airbnb, it's more expensive to live there. And it\u2019s even more expensive to travel there. And I think that New York City is now a cautionary tale of how to deal with Airbnb. Now, the other side is Paris. Paris, France. A couple years ago, we knew the Olympics were coming to Paris, we started working with the City of Paris. And I think that Paris tood a different approach and set us thinking that Airbnb as a problem they started that Airbnb is a solution to their problems which were they weren\u2019t going to have enough housing for the Olympics. And so in the last year, we went from a 100,000 homes in Paris to 150,000 homes in Paris And I'm pleased to announce that 700,000 guests stayed in Paris over the course of the Olympics. 700,000 and that's like 8 or 9 Olympics stadiums worth of guests. Our favourability in Paris has not been higher in years. And cities all over the world are now coming to Airbnb and saying we want to be Paris not New York, can you help us, because there are thousands events going around the world. So I think that\u2019s the most important point I would make that New York and Paris are a tale of two cities and we can be a solution to the problem. We are not the problem. But specific to New York, I\u2019d just say two things. Number 1, I remain optimistic that there will be a task to us to re-enter New York and people be able to stay in homes in Airbnb because there is a constrained number of hotels in New York. And by the way most hotels are only in Manhattan. And they're in Midtown, Manhattan. Do you want to stay in any part of the part of the Manhattan, the Brooklyn, The Bronx and Island Queens you are going to be pretty limited. And to answer the other part of your question, yes We absolutely welcome hotels on Airbnb and we are going to be adding more hotels to Airbnb. Because for Airbnb the win hotels don\u2019t have to lose we own hotels a night and we believe that you should be able to find homes and hotels on Airbnb. So yes, we are focused on hotels in New York City on Airbnb. We are focused on Airbnb\u2019s and stay New Jersey, stay Jersey City, which is actually closer Manhattan, other parts of Manhattan. And I am optimistic that New York there will be a workable solution at some opoint in the future, I don\u2019t know when that will be and they can follow the lead of Paris.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our, next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju : Great. Thanks. So thanks for taking the question. Som Brian, I guess, on the Experiences, again I'm wondering if there's going to be an angle where this could be something that increases the overall engagement or even raises the overall frequency of usage for you, because, maybe I don\u2019t stay in an Airbnb every weekend. But maybe I tried Airbnb Experience every weekend. So I'm just wondering like how the product development path and how utilization will shift as your selection goes? Thanks\nBrian Chesky: 100%, I mean, this is a great point Stephen. Experiences, I absolutely like within, like Airbnb is typically something you book once or twice a year, very, very few people will book Airbnb every month. Unless you are like incredibly prolific traveller and so we struggle from the point, where on the 1 hand, like our average purchase price is over $500, so, like, like the economics are great, on the other hand we have the challenge of low frequency, most people don't travel that frequently. Expansions are going to be, I think, one of many new offerings that you can increase the frequency that can make Airbnb go from an annual App to a monthly usage App or even for some people weekly usage App. And the reason is because Experiences will not be limited just when you travel. Just like they are today. We are designing products, Experiences and new services that will be great when you travel, but you could book them in your own home town like and I think there's a real problem which is what do you what do you want to do on a Saturday? And if you're with your family. Other than the things you already do. If you got a Friday night, what do you do other than going to a restaurant, staying home and watching Netflix I think there is a market for a locals who want to do unique things and I think traveling is how they are going to be expose Experiences, but I do think that some of the people will try them back home. I think the really big opportunity here kind of similar to iPod, when iPod launched you can only use it with a Macintosh. And the really big game for the iPod was once it became Windows compatible. When iTunes be able to Windows all the people that end on the Mac, but iPod end of sales surged. But I do think there is potential place for that down the road experiences. We're gonna position it for most of travelers. But it\u2019\u2019s not going to be exclusive travlers and I do think people are going to come to work frequently.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Brian Chesky.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining today. And just to recap, revenue was $3.7 billion, which is 10% higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion and our trailing 12 months cash flow is $1.1 billion. Now this is representing a free cash flow margin of 38%. Our strong enables to repurchase $1.1 billion of our common stock this quarter and we're continuing to innovate and our product just keeps getting better. I am so proud that we accomplish and I am satisfied with that. Thank you all for joining.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect",

            "name": "Ellie Mertz",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Richard. Let me talk a little bit about what we've seen on supply. As you probably noted, our initiatives around supply have really morphed over the last 12 months. We can continue to focus on growing our overall supply base. But we incrementally are focused on making sure that we are delivering very high quality levels of supply across the world to our guests. And the two important features that we've done to drive quality are obviously introduction of Guest Favorites a year ago, and then ,second the removals that you called out over the last 12 months. And the interesting thing is, we\u2019ve seen what we hope to have seen from these quality initiatives, in particular, what we see is that, based on encouraging our guests to use Guest Favorites and taking down those listings that we believe do not meet our quality expectations or those of our guests. What we see is that the average rating of our stays goes up. The incident rates go down and customer service contacts go down as well. So, we're seeing the intended impact of those quality efforts, which we believe, one, it improves the guest experience, second, allows for improvements of rebooking rates over time; and third, more broadly increases booking confidence around Airbnb. To the specific questions in terms of what has happened to the supply growth? It continues to be strong and in Q3, we continue to see Supply growth exceed demand by a couple of points. So it continues to be the very healthy, but again the focus more recently has been on incrementally raising the quality bar on Airbnb, not just adding more supply to the platform. Brian, do you want to talk about co-hosting or actually take that as well? Thanks, Mark. Let me first answer your first question with regard to the acceleration of the business. What we shared in the letter was that for your line to where we were back at the time of the last earnings call, we called out that there was a bit of softness globally related to lead times is specifically what we shared with that. We were seeing continued strength of last minute bookings, but relative softness in terms of the longer lead times. And what we saw over the course of the quarter, specific to both the regions that you called out, but globally was that lead times over the course of July, August and September normalized and came back almost in line to where we were in \u201823. I think you saw that most notably in EMEA and I think probably some of the, long lead time softness that we were seeing in EMEA was certainly related to some distraction around the Olympics because we certainly saw the bookibgs pick up after the Olympics pass, but more broadly that acceleration was seen across all four major regions. And then, on the co-hosting, Brian gave you, I think a broad answer in terms of the expectations there. One of the reasons that we had confidence in terms of launching the Co-host Network more broadly is, the pilots that we've had over the last several years, in particular, in France, what we've seen is that, the co-host themselves are very incremental in terms of going out and attracting high quality listings themselves. Obviously, it will take time for us to scale co-hosting to a level that is, meaningful relative to the scale of our current business. But what we've seen from those pilots is extremely encouraging and we'll continue to build out the network from here on. Yes. So Brian, talking a little bit about Q4 obviously, the guide does imply a, several points margin compression relative to last Q4. And you should see that most specifically in terms of both the product development line item as well as marketing. In marketing, we continue to invest in our global expansion markets in our comm strategy around icons and then also Performance Marketing where we're seeing really great efficiencies. There's also a little bit of timing difference in terms of spend from Q3 getting into Q4. But in aggregate, the level of incremental marketing spend on a year-over-year basis is relatively modest. So your second question is, how do we think about the level of investment and philosophy around margins in 25? Let me let me give you a little bit of color in terms of our overall approach as we head into to 2025 Obviously, we will give more color in the following earnings call. But let me just talk a little bit about the approach today. So, if you think about how we've been managing our P&L, I think it's important you're certainly well aware of our history. But I think it's important to reflect on how well we've managed the, the overall P&L since we went public. We've been extremely disciplined in terms of delivering over a quarter basis points of EBITDA margin expansion since 2020 going from negative margins in in 2019 and 2020 to over 35% consistent with our outlook this year. And we\u2019ve demonstrated consistently over these last several years that our business model is, extremely strong. It's extremely profitable and obviously has world-class levels of cash flow generation. And over the long term, I think you can expect that there is opportunity for further margin expansion. But when you remind through where we are right now? We've talked a lot about this. We see a huge incredible opportunity to invest in growth, both investing in growth in our core accommodations business, as well as our new offerings. And so, as we head into 2025, we will continue to lean into our growth initiatives around core optimizations, global markets expansions and new products and services, which is then the question is, how exactly will we be managing the P&L? Let's say for the core business, our goal is every year to make the core business better and more efficient, and deliver greater value for our guests and hosts. And the way we do that is to find incremental efficiencies every year across in particular variable costs. And invest some of that into greater service levels on both sides of the marketplace. In addition to that in terms of the growth investments, in \u201825, we will be investing in our existing expansion markets, as well as a handful of incremental expansion markets and we will be launching new products with our upcoming 2025 spring release. The good news about these investments is that, we intend for them to be relatively capitalized, consistent with our core business. but we will be adding members to our teams and spending to our marketing to support these growth levers. We will provide greater detail on the exact level of investment and growth expectations on our next call early next year. Yeah, Justin, let me just give you some context in terms of our overall kind of concentration of the business. So, if we think about the core markets and again remember those are US, Canada, Australia, France, and the UK. They currently represent about three quarters of our gross booking value. And then the rest of the world is obviously a quarter. The expansion markets that we're focused on are kind of 15% approximately of the remainder. But in a normalized world should be significantly larger. So if you give, - just to give you a sense in terms of kind of the success that we've had, that encourages us to keep going down this path and adding more expansion markets. I just call out actually Brazil because it was one of our first expansion markets that we began to focus on about two years ago. We introduced localized brand campaigns. We localized the products. We provided incremental payment methods to make it more locally relevant. And if we look at the success of that specific market, would you see - what you would see is that, for Brazil, from a destination nights perspective is actually about three times as large as it was pre-pandemic. And you can see just like paying attention to a particular market deploying, our full funnel marketing strategy, being very thoughtful about product market fit allows us to scale these currently smaller portions of our business to over time a significantly larger proportion. On the other end of the spectrum, I would highlight Japan, which we obviously called out in our shareholder letter, given the recency of our um, of our - the launch of our brand campaign there. That\u2019s obviously a significantly large market. But we are relatively new in the eyes of Japanese travelers. And so if they've opportunity to really introduce ourselves to the local traveler have them under understand the opportunity locally to use Airbnb domestically and begin to scale that business commensurately. And so, when you think about the scale of these markets where we are today, Brian and I characterized this as a medium-term opportunity, because the immediate opportunity is large, but it will take time for us to scale these individual markets such that they have an increasing impact in terms of our consolidated global results given the relative concentration to that. Yes, thanks Lee. So we think about overall growth algorithm and our growth drivers it's exactly as Brian has described earlier in terms of talking about the opportunity. It really starts with focusing on our core offering and optimizing it such that we are effectively limiting the barriers, to trying Airbnb relative to alternatives in particularly hotels. And so that's why we focus so much on things like affordability and reliability, because we know, for many consumers, even though they're aware of Airbnb, there is a gap in terms of their booking confidence around what they are going to get from us. And so, every quarter, we work at reducing that gap of consideration. And when we look at the business from that perspective, there's a huge amount of growth room ahead even in our core markets, because we know so many consumers consider - continue to consider themselves as hotel guests. not necessarily Airbnb guests. And so, a lot of the optimizations and marketing are both raising considerations, as well as helping people frankly get through our platform more easily by making it easier to book, making it more personalized and getting them the right listing. So, we continue to focus on these core optimizations, because we believe it's a considerable future, current I should say and future growth lever that will continue to pay dividends in particular in our core markets but more globally, more generally globally across our platform. The second component is what I just spoke about in terms of responding to Justin. Our business today is over-concentrated in our core markets and is not necessarily reflective of the commensurate business opportunity across the globe. And so, over the couple of years, you should see, assuming that our global market strategy is successful. You should see the contributions to growth of those expansion markets grow every single quarter and I think the results that we've delivered so far this year suggest that that is, that is working. We just need to continue to scale those businesses such as they contribute to global growth more significantly. Well, I think where we've seen success. One of the areas is core optimization and so we have built out the product roadmap around that because where we see success in terms of improvements we're making to the booking flow. We continue to keep a stable set of resources against those challenges. So that every single quarter, the price is getting better and we're delivering more gains from those product improvements. The one thing I would add is, Kevin, we will obviously give you much more detailed color next year on the next earnings call. But what you should anticipate is that, some of the investment behind those new services will front run the revenue. So you'll begin to see those expenses or those investments I should say, at the beginning of the year, whereas the revenue will start to scale once we've released the new offering. On Supply? Yeah so we had over 10% growth of supply as of the end of Q3, which is down several points based on the removals."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining. Airbnb had a strong third quarter. Nice and experiences booked accelerated throughout Q3 and into Q4. Despite a slower start to the quarter due to shorter booking lead times compared to last year bookings grew steadily each month returned to double-digit growth by the end of Q3. We had a $123 million nights and experience booked. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Net income was $1.4 billion, representing net income margin of about 37%. And we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. In fact, our total trailing 12 month free cash flow was $4.1 billion, which allowed us to repurchase $1.1 billion of our shares in the quarter. And as of the end of Q3, we have $4.2 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. Now, during Q3, we continue to make progress across our three strategic initiatives, which are making hosting mainstream, prospecting our core service and expanding beyond the core. Now I am going to share a few highlights about each. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We are focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling on Airbnb. Today, we have over 8 million active listings with growth across all regions and market types. To retain and track new hosts, we prioritize making hosting easier. Last month, as part of our 2024 winter release, we introduced co-host networks, an easy way to find the best local host to manage your Airbnb. Co-hosts are some of our most experienced hosts. They provide personalized support ranges from listing setups, can managing bookings and communicating with guests. Second, we're prospecting our core service. Over the past three years, we've launched more than 535 new features and upgrades to make Airbnb a better service. Our 2024 winner release included over 50 upgrades for guests that make Airbnb a more intuitive and personalized App. This includes features like recommended destinations, suggested search filters and personalized listing highlights. We're also focused on one of the top issues for guests, listing quality. Since last year, we removed over 300,000 listings that failed to meet guest expectations. And we will continue to invest in improving the quality of guest stays. Finally, we're expanding beyond our core. Outside of our core markets, there are many countries and regions that remain underpenetrated and we're focused on these expansion markets as part of a global market strategy and we're seeing great results.. In Q3, the growth rate of nights booked in our expansion markets more than doubled that of our core markets. Now, in addition to driving growth in our expansion markets, we're also preparing for an Airbnb\u2019s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations. And you'll see more about this next year. We also saw a number of positive business highlights in Q3. First, guest demand accelerated throughout the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, after a slower start in July, bookings accelerated each month in Q3. Global lead times also normalized throughout the quarter. Now part of this growth has been driven by our App strategy. Nights booked on our App increased 18% year-over-year in Q3. App bookings now account for 58% of nights booked. Now this is up from 53% in the same period last year. And we also saw continued growth of first-time bookers, with the highest growth among young travelers. This is quite exciting. And I'm really excited to share that we recently surpassed 2 billion guest arrivals on Airbnb. Second, our global market strategy is working. We continue to drive growth by investing in underpenetrated markets. While our timing and investment level will vary by market, our strategy is consistent, to make Airbnb local and relevant in more places around the world. Now in each market, we focus on finding product market fit, increasing brand awareness, and driving traffic. And I want to just use one country as an example, which is Japan. Airbnb is still pretty new in Japan and it's pretty unfamiliar to most Japanese travelers. So to raise awareness, we launched a brand campaign last month is centered on domestic travel. Beyond Japan though, we are all so introducing more local payment options and countries around the world like Vietnam, Denmark and Poland and in fact, by spring of next year, we expect to offer nearly 40 local payment methods around the world. Now finally, supply quality is improving on Airbnb. We are focused on removing low-quality supply, as well as make it easier for guests to find the best places to stay. I shared that we removed over 300,000 listings last year. And we are seeing the - we're already seeing this payoff. Customer service contact rates have decreased, guest MPS has improved, and we're also reducing host cancellations, which are now almost 30% lower than a year ago. And we've made it so much easier for guests to find the best place to stay with Guests Favorites. In fact, since launching Guest Favorites a year ago, last November, over 200 million nights have been booked at Guest Favorite listings. All right, next I want to share briefly some highlights from our 2024, which was last month on October 16th. Starting with the Co-Host network. We know that hosting Airbnb is one of the best ways to make money from our home. But not everyone has the time to host. So that\u2019s why we introduced Co-Host Network, an easy way for people to find the best - to find and hire the best local co-host to manage the Airbnb. Co-host offer personalized support for host needs, everything from setting up your listing, demands your bookings and communicating with guests. These are super experienced hosts with an exceptional track record, 73% are super hosts and 84% manage Guest Favorite. Now, when we announced this on October 16th, we launched the Co-Host Network with 10,000 Co-Hosts across 10 countries. In this three weeks since we launched, we've already received interest from over 20,000 potential new co-hosts. This is huge, this is way bigger than we were expecting. And we are making co-hosting easier, we really believe that co-host network will allow us to lock even more high quality supply. And we also introduced safety updates for guests and make Airbnb a more intuitive and personalized App. And some of the features include a personalized welcome tour of the App for first-time guests, suggested destinations, winning guests pass the search bar will recommend locations on their search and booking history. And for our hosting highlights. So when a guest views, a listing, we will highlight the details that are relevant to their search and there are dozens of these features just like these. This is quite literally the beginning of a more personalized Airbnb. Now turning to Q4, last quarter, we talked about shorter booking lead times, but as I shared nights and experiences booked accelerated throughout the quarter, returning to double-digit growth by the end of Q3. While we know the comps from last year will get harder in the back of the quarter, we are anticipating that nights booked will accelerate in Q4 relative to Q3. So with that Ellie and I look forward to answering your questions. Yeah, I can take. Yeah, I can take that. Richard, it\u2019s a great question. Airbnb, I think we are just scratching the surface of how big this company can become. And the growth rate of demand is going to fall probably in line with the growth rate of supply. And so, one of the questions we had was, well, how do we get millions more listings in Airbnb? And how do we not just get millions of property managed listing? How do we get millions of regular everyday people to put their homes in Airbnb? Well, we are doing obviously a lot of research and we've asked people and we learned two things. The first thing we learned is that, people are very interested in making extra money in the home Ttey already have and make sense, they pay for this asset. That they can make tens of thousand dollars a year. Why wouldn't you want to put on Airbnb? But the second thing we learned was that the number and reason people don't host is because a lot of people say they don't have the time. And so that\u2019s why we ask ourselves, what if we get match people with homes, that don't have time with people have extra time that don't have homes. The Venn diagram would potentially unlock millions more listings and the best part of all was this would be alternative so some of the third-party property management companies if you want to have one of the best host to Airbnb and the average 5 star rating. for co-host in Airbnb is significantly higher than the average rating of a third-party property manager. So that's what we did with the Co-Host Networks. Now we start with 10,000, co-host. We have 20,000 people that apply in the three week expense. And this is going to be something that we're going to be focusing on in the coming years to come. But, to answer your questions very directly, Richard, not only would this unlock more supply, I think in the coming years, this is going to lock millions of listings. I think that they - the vast majority of them are going to be everyday people that are going to list exclusively on Airbnb. Justin, it\u2019s a great question. Maybe I'll just start by stepping back, it's pretty crazy that Airbnb has been used by two billion guests. Because I remember when we started Airbnb, I remember telling investors one day this company be huge, thousands of people will use it. And I think there's been a common like pattern where we keep saying it's going to be big and it\u2019s even bigger than we imagined. And I think the reason why is, the travel industry, as you know, you guys cover it is it's approximate the size of the oil industry. And people love traveling. And one thing I know about the future is more people travel in the past. And, I think that we'll be creative with the new category. And this is the business that is approaching half a billion nights booked a year. And so the question is, well, how do we get to a billion nights a year? Or how do we get a company to even be an order of magnitude bigger one day? Because I'm 43 years old. I started to from my 26. And I feel like I got a couple decades ahead of me. And so, where do we go from here? I think that if you think about the history of this company I think you could maybe break it up into a few chapters. The first chapter was when we had this idea, Tony and I in 2008 - and we went on it really crazy [Indiscernible] And now it\u2019s Phase one. And then I would say the second chapter which are probably in now exiting was the beginning of the pandemic, we lost 80% of our business and then we had the right size the company, become really profitable, go public, listing the customer feedback and really strengthen the foundation for the next chapter of the company. And that\u2019s kind of the stage we are in. And I think the next chapter of Airbnb is starting next May. Because I think the next chapter is really about taking Airbnb and expanding this beyond our core business. And so, I will outline three areas that are going to allow us to grow and let's start with the shortest horizon to a longest horizon. The shortest horizon is actually just our core business. Again, we do, - we're approaching 500 million room nights booked a year, I think our core business could certainly get to a billion nights a year. I am not going to put a time horizon on it, but the way we are going to do that, is we are going to continue to increase quality. For everyone who stays in Airbnb, nine people staying on a town. So the question is, what if we could just 1 of those other people to stay in Airbnb? That's how you get to a billion. And so, we think quality, mansion quality is a part of it. I think our work on affordability and usability are also going to be really, really critical. So we're going to continue to focus on the core business. The next horizon, our Global Market. A huge percent of our business is still concentrated in five countries,The US, Canada, Australia, France, UK. So those are all our core markets. But there are massive opportunities in emerging markets. There's nine of them that I'm focused on in the Americas, it\u2019s Mexico and Brzil. In Europe, it\u2019s Germany, Italy and Spain. And in Asia, it\u2019s the big four countries, which are Korea. Japan, India and China. I think this is what I've described as a medium-term horizon. And, by the way, just as for a second, if there was one company in the world, that you can bet on to expand internationally, I think it will be a global travel network. So, I think there's a huge amount of opportunity here. And the biggest opportunity by far is expanding beyond our core business. I'm reminded of Amazon, one of the biggest companies in the world. And they started as an online book seller and can you imagine if Amazon was only selling books to the half way they would become? And yet we for the last 17 years for the most part have only sold one thing, which is basically vacation rentals Airbnb homes by the night. And so, I think that we have a huge opportunity to expand beyond our core business of accommodations. Amazon went from books to what they do first after books, they did CDs and DVDs and people used to buy both. And that was a very close adjacency. And eventually, they sold everything and then they even sold things beyond consumers to enterprise. I think Airbnb is going to go on it\u2019s own journey and what I expect is every year now, for the coming years, we will launch 1 to 2 new businesses that will generate $1 billion or more of revenue incrementally a year. I'm not going to be able to share everything we're doing or even most of the things we are doing. We like to reveal them during our release, but one thing that we've previewed to you was we are going to be reimagining Airbnb experiences and those are going to be coming next May, but we have some really core other things that we are working on. And it\u2019s going to basically be starting with the nearest adjacencies around travel and over the next decade, we're going to go far beyond travel. Yeah, Lee, maybe Ellie before you answer the question, can I just say one quick thing? Lee, o don\u2019t think we do alternative accommodations. I think alternative accommodations is what our competitors OTAs do? I think alternative accommodations is a bit of a catch all that includes property managed homes, service apartments, boutique hotels. But I've never heard a customer say alternative accommodations. I hear them say Airbnb. I am going to book in Airbnb. I am going to get Airbnb. And I think we are really in a category of our own. So, just you know, I just think we don't refer to it and we don't think of it as alternative accommodations. So Ellie, over to you. Yeah, I got this. Hey James, these are great questions. I'm really excited about it. So, I'll take each, affordability and reliability and customer service. Affordability, it's funny, the first tagline Airbnb ever had was an affordable alternative a hotel. And it was the number one reason that people first tried to use Airbnb. Now I think today that's not the main reason people use Airbnb. I think they use it because they want to travel like a local. They want more space. They want homes in real neighborhood, better equipped, but it's really, really important that we don't ever leave our roots of affordability. And I think in the pandemic, I think there was so much demand, there was constrained supply, prices went up, and I think we addressed it from our affordability risk. So, a couple of years ago, we actually got very, very serious about driving more affordable in Airbnb. And we did a few things. The first thing we did is, we heard a lot of complaints about rising cleaning fees and I set the fees in Airbnb. So we introduced total price display, total price slates exactly what it sounds like you can click it on and see the total price upfront. And, since we\u2019ve done that, more than 300,000 listings have removed or lowered their cleaning fees. But this has been huge. Next, we introduced weekly and monthly discounts. And now more than, - we're introducing more entry points in weekly, monthly discounts.Two-thirds of hosts now offer discounts. In fact, more than half of our hosts offer a monthly discount and now 70% of our nights booked are for monthly stays. We introduced a similar listings tool. So what we noticed was a lot of hosts were overestimating what they could make on a nightly basis, especially new hosts. So we built the tool for you to see other listings in your neighbourhood and 2 million hosts have used this tool. And basically, when most of who use this tool they realize that they need to make sure they are competitive and so it brings the prices in line. Now over the this past release on October 16th, we also added a couple more different features like price tips, hosts can now view suggested prices based on similar listings in that area and search tips. So throughout the guest search, we're going to offer relevant tips to help them find last minute stays. And probably the most important thing you can do to drive affordability is just continue to increase supply. But we know about almost every marketplace is that as supply goes up relative to demand prices come down and so that's a really big effort for us. The results have been the following: In the last two years, while Airbnb prices on a like-for-like basis, if you net out mix shift, has it remains fairly constant hotel prices have gone up considerably. So we believe that we've actually become more competitive from \u2013 cancelling relative hotels last year. That\u2019s affordability. Now reliability. Reliability, as I said is probably the most important thing that we can do to drive more growth in our core business. If we do nearly 100 million nights a year in bookings, the question is, how do we get the next 100 million nights booked. And there is no silver bullet, but the closest thing to a silver bullet is quality and reliability. And there is a lot of things we are doing, quite literally dozens. But I can just pick two. The two things I\u2019d pick are at the top, Guest Favorites, piloting the two million best listings in Airbnb. We also highlight the best 1%, 5% and 10% listings. As Ellie mentioned, we\u2019ve got 200 million nights booked just in Guest Favorites. Now, this is amazing. Why it is great? Because number one, customer service contact, these listings are down , our profitability on a per booking basis goes up, NPS is up, because NPS is up that means that rebooking rates are up. That also means the word of mouth is up, but most importantly, a lot of people that wouldn't have considered staying in Airbnb, now would. I mean, I'm going to go on a NIM and say that while the average Airbnb is not as reliable as a hotel, I believe the average Guest Favorite is. And we have two million to choose from. Two million listings is more inventory than Hilton or Marriott, nearly combined, by the way. So there's a lot of selection here. At the bottom-end, just like any company you need to make sure you reward the top performers and you also deal with the people that aren't performing. We've removed more than 300,000 listings over the last year, the last two years of hosts that weren't meeting our quality standards. So, these are just some of the things we're doing on reliability. The last is customer service. And we are going through a really exciting transformation on customer service. I don\u2019t want to be one of the CEOs just brings up AI every earnings call, because I think you got a happy measure, but we are seeing some really great progress on AI-powered customer service. The way we think about customer service Powered by AI is in three phases. Phase 1 is the phase we're in right now. If you were to most of - first of all most of our customer contacts, we get over 10 million contacts here, most of the contacts that we anticipate getting in the coming years aren't going to be phone calls. They're going to be chatting through the App. I think really personally don't like calling customer service and having to dial, and I want to be able to chat. And chat AI can intercept. And so, we think in the future the vast majority of our chats are going to be intercepted in the end directly by the AI agent. And so there's really three phasing for this. Phase 1 is just answer basic general questions. We're rolling out a pilot that could answer basic general questions. Phase two, is personalization, personalize the questions. Phase three is to take actions. So I\u2019ll give you an example, let me just give you one example. Let's say, I were to contact customer service and I\u2019d say, how do I cancel a reservation. In Phase one, what we are doing now AI agent will answer \u2013 copy even better the average customer service agent how do cancel a reservation. So Phase 2 is how you cancel reservation step-by-step. Phase 2 personalization, they\u2019ll say, hey Brian, I see you have a reservation coming up in Los Angeles next week. Here is how you cancel that reservation. And Phase three is taking actions. It would say hey Brian. I see you have a reservation come to Los Angeles. Would you like me to cancel it for you? Just tell me yes and I\u2019ll do it for you. I can even handle the rebooking. So this is where we think customer service can go enabled by AI, and we've hired some of the best people in the world to work on this and I really excited to tell you more progress about it. Yeah, I can take that and Ellie feel free to add. Kevin, the answer is a little bit of both, I mean, we are, the way like \u2013 let\u2019s just back up? So Uber, let's just take Uber. I admire that company. They've done really well. When they launched Uber Eats, they launched in one market. And they had it city-by-city market and was very, very gradual. We are not going to do that. We're going to be much more aggressive. When we launch the new offerings next year, they are going to be available immediately in more than a 100 cities around the world. So we believe in trying to reach scale a little more quickly just given how big and how mature we are. So, because of that, we do think there will be some incremental revenue next year, that will hit the financials. But I also just want to like step back and just say that what we've learned from Uber Eats, from Amazon category expansion, from Door Dash, from we can go down the list of marketplaces is, when something's built off of small base, you've got to be patient. I think that there's a, multi-billion dollar revenue opportunities, multiple of them that will be introduced next year. But I also would point people to a 5-year Horizon. For a number of these things to really reach scale, not, they won't reach scale in just a year or two. And part of that is it's a network effect business. We want to roll it out carefully. We want to make sure it\u2019s really well done. Ellie, do you want to add anything? Yeah, John, really good question. I think we are able to reach a sweet spot where I think we can - we're going to offer something that's really, really unique and we will scale. Now, I want to just moderate expectations that again, these Journeys are going to be multi-year journeys that I do not think that there's a choice. I don't think we need to make a choice between you mean unique or being at scale. I think - by the way, I think our core business proof that a business that\u2019s approaching a hundred billion dollars in gross sales a year. And it's pretty unique, it's pretty different than a hotel. So, I'm not going to certainly promise that experience we'll get to that size, but we do think we have something that's very unique, very scalable available around the world. As far as the Tech and marketing, the great thing about our business is, are you not anticipate very many businesses in the next five years are going to need significant investments. We are certainly nothing like many other companies where they have a lot of either capital allocation or major technical investments or even major marketing investments. Here's another way of saying it. We've already made most of the technology investments. When you see the last four years, a huge amount of what we've done is rebuilt the company from the ground up, not just to make it stronger to offer homes, to make it an extensive platform. One of those companies that we learnt from again was Amazon. I know, I talk a lot about Apple. A lot of people reference Apple when they talk about them because of their big launches. But Apple, Amazon is a very good reference point. Initially, as you know, they built a bookstore. They were based on like, IBM. They had to rebuild the platform and I\u2019d extract the platform and you might call compromising to build offer many room verticals. And so, we want to take every new platform that works certification and build it for the next decade for like 50 or 100 different categories, just like Amazon. So now, I think with the timeline when we offer them, but we've rebuilt the technology already most of it to be able to do that. Now with marketing, I don\u2019t think we are going to market everything as standalone businesses. We really like the idea of marketing, all of Airbnb. In marketing there's these two choices. Are you a house the brand or a branded house? We're a branded house. We're one App. We are one brand and we want to market everything in one Ad. So that's a little bit more how we're going to approach it. And so I think for those reasons we will, of course, be investing. I want to be clear, we of course be investing, but it's not going to be like many other companies where they have to go deep and sort of right and get the new business off the ground. Hey Jud. I'll take that. Yes, so let\u2019s talk about New York. Actually, I would like to talk about two cities. I want to talk about a tale of two cities. New York City and Paris. Because both cities need some major decisions on Airbnb recently and I want to distinguish differencing the two. New York City has, might be this before the housing crisis and that\u2019s a very real thing. And so the decided one of the ways they try to feel with that was banning Airbnb. And a year ago, Airbnb was banned and the theory was that if you ban Airbnb, a bunch of homes will come back on the rental market and prices will come down. Well, for the first time we've gotten a year-long longitudinal study of what happened in Airbnb into the city. Rent prices in New York City are not down. In fact, they're up 3.5%. And by the way, hotel prices are now up to 7%. So, a year after banning Airbnb, it's more expensive to live there. And it\u2019s even more expensive to travel there. And I think that New York City is now a cautionary tale of how to deal with Airbnb. Now, the other side is Paris. Paris, France. A couple years ago, we knew the Olympics were coming to Paris, we started working with the City of Paris. And I think that Paris tood a different approach and set us thinking that Airbnb as a problem they started that Airbnb is a solution to their problems which were they weren\u2019t going to have enough housing for the Olympics. And so in the last year, we went from a 100,000 homes in Paris to 150,000 homes in Paris And I'm pleased to announce that 700,000 guests stayed in Paris over the course of the Olympics. 700,000 and that's like 8 or 9 Olympics stadiums worth of guests. Our favourability in Paris has not been higher in years. And cities all over the world are now coming to Airbnb and saying we want to be Paris not New York, can you help us, because there are thousands events going around the world. So I think that\u2019s the most important point I would make that New York and Paris are a tale of two cities and we can be a solution to the problem. We are not the problem. But specific to New York, I\u2019d just say two things. Number 1, I remain optimistic that there will be a task to us to re-enter New York and people be able to stay in homes in Airbnb because there is a constrained number of hotels in New York. And by the way most hotels are only in Manhattan. And they're in Midtown, Manhattan. Do you want to stay in any part of the part of the Manhattan, the Brooklyn, The Bronx and Island Queens you are going to be pretty limited. And to answer the other part of your question, yes We absolutely welcome hotels on Airbnb and we are going to be adding more hotels to Airbnb. Because for Airbnb the win hotels don\u2019t have to lose we own hotels a night and we believe that you should be able to find homes and hotels on Airbnb. So yes, we are focused on hotels in New York City on Airbnb. We are focused on Airbnb\u2019s and stay New Jersey, stay Jersey City, which is actually closer Manhattan, other parts of Manhattan. And I am optimistic that New York there will be a workable solution at some opoint in the future, I don\u2019t know when that will be and they can follow the lead of Paris. 100%, I mean, this is a great point Stephen. Experiences, I absolutely like within, like Airbnb is typically something you book once or twice a year, very, very few people will book Airbnb every month. Unless you are like incredibly prolific traveller and so we struggle from the point, where on the 1 hand, like our average purchase price is over $500, so, like, like the economics are great, on the other hand we have the challenge of low frequency, most people don't travel that frequently. Expansions are going to be, I think, one of many new offerings that you can increase the frequency that can make Airbnb go from an annual App to a monthly usage App or even for some people weekly usage App. And the reason is because Experiences will not be limited just when you travel. Just like they are today. We are designing products, Experiences and new services that will be great when you travel, but you could book them in your own home town like and I think there's a real problem which is what do you what do you want to do on a Saturday? And if you're with your family. Other than the things you already do. If you got a Friday night, what do you do other than going to a restaurant, staying home and watching Netflix I think there is a market for a locals who want to do unique things and I think traveling is how they are going to be expose Experiences, but I do think that some of the people will try them back home. I think the really big opportunity here kind of similar to iPod, when iPod launched you can only use it with a Macintosh. And the really big game for the iPod was once it became Windows compatible. When iTunes be able to Windows all the people that end on the Mac, but iPod end of sales surged. But I do think there is potential place for that down the road experiences. We're gonna position it for most of travelers. But it\u2019\u2019s not going to be exclusive travlers and I do think people are going to come to work frequently. All right. Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining today. And just to recap, revenue was $3.7 billion, which is 10% higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion and our trailing 12 months cash flow is $1.1 billion. Now this is representing a free cash flow margin of 38%. Our strong enables to repurchase $1.1 billion of our common stock this quarter and we're continuing to innovate and our product just keeps getting better. I am so proud that we accomplish and I am satisfied with that. Thank you all for joining."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAngela Yang: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb's first quarter of 2024 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u2019s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Ellie Mertz. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of 2024. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of Airbnb's website. During the call, we'll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q&A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also, during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I will pass the call to Brian.\nBrian Chesky: All right. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining. Q2 marked another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had 125 million nights and experiences booked. Revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $2.75 billion. Net income was $555 million representing a net income margin of 20% and we generated $1 billion of free cash flow. Our total trailing 12 month free cash flow was $4.3 billion, our highest ever, and our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase $749 million of our shares in the quarter. And as of the end of Q2, we had $5.25 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization program. Now during Q2, we continue to make progress on our three strategic priorities, which again are making hosting mainstream, perfecting our core service and expanding beyond the core. So I\u2019ll share a few highlights on each. First, we are making hosting mainstream. Last year, we shared a commitment to make hosting just as popular as travelling in Airbnb. We've been focused on raising awareness around the benefits of hosting and providing better tools for hosts. In Q2, we surpassed 8 million active listings driven by continued growth across all regions and market types. We're not just growing supply and we're also committed to ensuring that it's high quality supply. Since launching our updated host quality system last April, we\u2019ve removed over 200,000 listings that failed to meet our guests expectations. And we'll continue to raise the overall quality of listings on Airbnb so we can consistently deliver high quality stays. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We remain focused on making Airbnb more reliable, affordable and a overall better service for hosting guests. We\u2019ve rolled out hundreds of new features and upgrades over the past two years to do this. This includes launching major reliability initiatives like guest favorites which make it easy for guests to find the best listings in Airbnb. Now since launch, last November, we've seen over a 150 million nights booked at guest favorite listings. We've also made dozens of smaller changes that have led to improved usability and booking conversion. These include things like simplified set up and login, improved map, clear cancellation policies and so much more. Now we've made tremendous progress and we'll never stop improving Airbnb. We're going to continue this commitment. And finally, perhaps most excitingly, we are expanding beyond our core. We continue to drive growth by investing in underpenetrated markets. In Q2, growth of gross nights booked on an origin basis in our expansion markets significantly outperformed our core markets on average. Our core markets again are US, UK, France, Australia and Canada. This is largely due to the success of our global expansion playbook which includes a more localized product and marketing approach. We're also expanding Airbnb\u2019s brand positioning beyond travel accommodations with the launch and roll out of Airbnb Icons which is a new category of extraordinary experiences that we launched in May. Now since launch, we see nearly 40 million views of Icons on our site. Helping people understand that Airbnb offers more than accommodations will be critical as we expand our offerings in the coming years. Now, looking back to Q2, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, guests are increasingly booking on the Airbnb app. We've continued to optimized our mobile website\u2019s app downloads and we believe our approach is working. Nights booked in our app during Q2 increased 19% year-over-year. Now these bookings now comprise 55% of total nights booked and this is up from 50% in the prior year period. Now in addition to our success of mobile downloads and bookings, we're continuing to see growth of first-time bookers on our platform with the highest levels of growth seen in the youngest age demographic. Second, Airbnb is uniquely positioned for special events where continuously more guests choose Airbnb for major holidays and events. The week of July 4th for example represented our single highest week of revenue ever in North America and we saw similar trends in Europe. Now in anticipation of the Olympics which is in Paris, nights booked in Paris through Q2 were more than double what they were this time last year. Additionally, cities hosting matches during the recent Euro Cup in Germany saw an average of more than 20% year-over-year increase in nights booked. And supply has increased to meet the higher demand. So we have 37% increase in active listings in Paris in Q2 compared to the year ago. And these events, what they really do is they highlight Airbnb\u2019s unique ability to disperse travel and spread economic benefits by allowing people stay in local neighborhoods where there are no hotels. Finally, supply growth is improving on Airbnb. We made huge strides for supply growth, we remain just as focus on supply quality. As we improve quality, we believe more people will try Airbnb unlocking even more growth. We have two major initiatives underway to help us do this. First, we're removing low quality supply. As I shared earlier, we've removed over 200,000 listings since April of last year. Second, we're making it easier for guests to find the best stays on Airbnb. We launched guest favorites as well as top listing highlights, which show the top 1%, 5% and 10% of eligible homes on Airbnb. These new features make it easy for guests to find the highest quality homes on Airbnb. In Q2, we also saw active listing managed by Superhosts, some of our highest quality hosts, increase 26% year-over-year. We're proud of our Q2 results. Now, turning to Q3, we're looking forward to another record summer travel season. We're encouraged by the excitement around the Olympics and the Euro Cup and we're also encouraged by the relative strength of Latin America and Asia Pacific which continue to be our fastest growing regions. However, we are seeing shorter looking lead times globally and some signs of slowing demand from US guests and our Q3 outlook incorporate these recent trends. We are watching these trends closely along with the impact any macroeconomic pressures might be causing. And we're continuing to execute against our growth strategy by improving our service, expanding in less penetrated markets and introducing new offerings. We believe this growth strategy will over the long term offset any transitory macro trends. So with that, Ellie and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. You're line is open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two please. Brian, just with your last comments on slowing lead times and what not in North America. Can you tell us a little bit more about that when you saw those trends sort of first hit. And then, how it offsets the strength from the Olympics and UEFA and everything else? And that's question one. And maybe a bigger question when we think about expanding beyond the core and perfecting the core service. Post summer release, posts winter release we've seen a lot of key improvements across Airbnb with Guest Favorites, with Icons and the list goes on and on, , how does - when we think about the coming winter release and throughout \u201825 and everything else, how are these newer services helping to influence call it the Airbnb of tomorrow? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky : Yes, why don\u2019t Ellie you take the first one about slowing lead times and when we started seeing these trends and I'll take the second one.\nEllie Mertz : Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So let me double click a little bit in terms of the trends for lead times since the beginning of the year. In both Q1 and Q2, what we saw with that lead times were basically equivalent with what we had seen in 2023. So there wasn't really any timing shift behavior in terms of when guests were booking. What we\u2019ve seen more recently and in particular in July is a shrinking of the lead times and in particular what we've seen is that there continues to be very strong growth of the shorter lead times. So anything from same day to next week to a couple of weeks from now. But what we're not seeing the same level of strength is in those longer lead times. So two months from now, what you\u2019re booking for Thanksgiving what you\u2019re booking for Christmas, and so it's that I would say softness in terms of longer lead times as a big factor in terms of the outlook that we've provided. What I would say additionally is that, over the last couple of years as we emerge from covid, there were several periods where we saw some volatility in terms of overall lead times and in particular some hesitancy for consumers to book those longer lead time trips. I suspect that's what we're seeing right now and the - I would say the silver lining with regard to the trends that we see right now, it's not that consumers are not necessarily going to book that trip for Thanksgiving or Christmas. It just appears that they have not booked it yet. So we're closely following all of the trends on lead times, but it is a factor that informs the outlook that we provided for Q3.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Chesky : Sorry, sorry.\nOperator: My apology.\nBrian Chesky : Sorry, there was a second part of the question. So, Ron, to answer your question about expanding beyond the core business. Where we are is we spent 16 years building a business that's approaching $80 billion in gross booking value that's basically one category, which we call Airbnb which is short term accommodation. It's been pretty amazing how far this single product has gone. And we haven't really charged other than like essentially travel insurance, we haven't really ever really expanded beyond our core business and we do have long-term stays which are [17%] (ph) of nights. We haven't done very much. We began before the pandemic preparing to expand Airbnb. And then when the pandemic hit, we cut back a lot of our resources. We got focused, went back to our roots and really focused on rebuilding our platform, becoming lean, becoming a functional organization and we now have essentially the same amount of employees as before the pandemic and double the revenue and that explains why we have 41% free cash flow margin, one of the most profitable companies in tech. We're now beginning to prepare the next chapter of Airbnb. And I want Airbnb to be one of the most important companies of our generation and to do that, we're going to do more than one thing. We're going to do multiple new things. We're going to have to have multiple new products and multiple new services. This fall, this October, we're going to be launching a new host service which is really important. It's essentially a co-hosting marketplace. So, there are people that have homes but they don't have time. There are other people in the world that have time but they don\u2019t have a home. And so, there's a Venn diagram of people today who have both that get host. But what if we can match those two people together? That would unlock a lot more inventory. That's what we're going to be launching later in October. Then next year we're going to begin to expand Airbnb truly beyond our core business. And we're going to be launching - we're going to relaunch Experiences. I've been asked about Experiences probably every earnings call since we\u2019ve been public, rightly so, because it's very exciting. We've learned a lot of lessons from Experiences. They need to be more affordable. They need to be more unique to Airbnb when you think so you can only find on Airbnb. They should be merchandised, videos not photos. They should be discoverable in the app and we should market them. If we think we do these five things, we think we'll have a hit on our hands and we're working on that. We also have new guests services and new host services that we're launching next year that we're working on. And then every year starting next year, we're going to launch new products and services. I look at Apple, I look at Amazon. Apple at one point was selling iMacs, Amazon was only selling books. We've gotten bigger than either of those companies just selling short-term rentals. But we're ready to go beyond short term rentals. So, the new Airbnb, to answer your question Ron, will be about a lot more than short-term rentals. It's going to be about long-term stays. It's going to be our guest services, host services and many new offerings and you'll begin to see that next year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Ellie, just to follow up on I know you talked about the shorter booking window. Are you seeing any change in activity around pricing or class of property? And is there anything to call out across cohorts or income levels? And then, Brian just circling back on expanding beyond the core, are there any expansion markets in particular that you would call out where you're seeing particularly strong traction? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky : Yes. So, why don't Ellie, you take the first. I\u2019ll take the second.\nEllie Mertz : Yeah. so Let's talk a little bit generally about ADR, so question was like what are people are actually purchasing on the platform. I would say, generally, so far this year what you've seen is a little bit of ADR appreciation globally. In particular, obviously, but more recently in North America. And what we see there is a big driver of the ADR appreciation is big shifts, which you can assume is what it sounds like people choosing more expensive or larger properties. And I think part of the read through from that can be oh, people are choosing more expensive listings. Therefore, you are seeing stronger demand from higher economic demographics. I think that is one read through. I think another read through is that, if you think about the value proposition of Airbnb, it's that we offer these larger properties and on a per guest basis, they can be quite affordable and frankly more affordable than a hotel. So I think part of that ADR mix shift appreciation that you see is frankly people gravitating to where we actually have some great value, which is the larger Airbnb that that do provide value on a guest level.\nBrian Chesky : And to answer your question about expansion markets, maybe a framework I can give to think about how we want accelerate growth, listen, we want to be growing a lot fast than we are. We want to be growing in healthy double-digit growth - double-digit growth and I think we can. And the way we're thinking about accelerating growth is through short-term, medium- term and long-term. Short-term is really optimizing our core business. It's really around affordability, about having high quality stays and just conversion rate increases. Long term is really about new products and services. So, the question you asked about international is interesting because it's kind of like a medium term horizon, like one to three years. And to frame this, Airbnb is in 220 countries and regions. We're one of the most global companies in the world on the Internet, 220 countries and regions. We operate nearly in every country in the world. But there's only really five markets where we're penetrating. And those markers are the US, UK, France, Canada and Australia. And you'd think like, well, if there was one company in the world that would truly be like have a lot of international penetration it\u2019d be a global travel network, right? A website where you want to travel, use one platform to travel around the world. So there's a number of countries. Just to give you a couple of examples of our some big expansion markets, Germany and Brazil we've seen a lot of progress. Those are huge travel markets and the biggest travel markets in the world. And we're continuing to go bigger. In Europe, Italy and Spain, we have low penetration compared to France and UK and these are major destinations. Then in Latin America, we've had a lot of progress in Brazil but there's really Peru, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, these are a huge opportunity markets, and that's Latin America is the fastest growing region alongside Asia. And Asia, you really have like the big four, big five countries. So you have China, Japan, Korea, India and then maybe we could kind of call out Southeast Asia as a holistic region. So what we're going to do is we have an international playbook, which is really product and marketing. First, need to localize the product, you need to make sure you have the right regulation in place. You need to make sure you have the right foundation. We've highlighted in our Investor Letter that we\u2019ve retooled our product for Asia. Asia are different character counts. And so it's more laborious in certain languages to type in so like in Korea and Japan they prefer to do browsing than search. So we've had to retool our product and that's yielded some huge conversion rate increases. So some of these are going to pay back sooner, like some of North - like Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, they're going to pay back sooner. Japan is going to be a longer game, but that's one of the biggest travel markets in the world. And I literally think there are tens of billions of dollars of gross booking value increase just by getting all the aforementioned countries to the current market penetration of Canada or Australia. If we can get those countries to Canada, Australia there's tens of billions of dollars and it's just something we've had to focus - we're going to focus on. It's something we hadn't focused on in the last four years as much. We really want to solidify our core business, but now we're focused on it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nRichard Clarke: I just want to unpick the Q3 revenue guidance a little bit more. I guess the - if I look from the balance sheet your funds held on behalf of customers, to me it looks like it's up about 13% year-on-year. So it looks like you're carrying more bookings into the quarter and then you're talking about shorter lead times. So does that mean more bookings in the quarter for the quarter. So just trying to square that with why revenue is slowing down in your guidance?\nEllie Mertz: Yeah, thanks Richard. So, obviously, that that energy is balanced on - on the balance sheet gives you some indication of the backlog. I would not take those balance sheet items as a one for one read through in terms of the revenue that will be recognized over the course of the quarter. A couple of deviations in terms of why they might not match. One is obviously a good portion of the bookings that we will recognize in a particular quarter are still to be booked within the quarter? That's one aspect. The second is the balance sheet items will reflect the timing of the payments, the - whether it\u2019s pay less upfront or the entirety of the payment and so they're just not a one for one guide. All they do, they do obviously give a time stamped point in time view of the backlog that we have.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I can ask a two-parter coming back to the booking window. When you've \u2013 what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years in terms of the booking window evolving from where it was pre-pandemic to where it is post-pandemic how much differ just that booking window look today versus maybe 2019 as opposed to today versus one in two years ago. And when you think about what that shift looks like, how much of that do you think in terms of a shortening booking window are elements of demand-driven Dynamics where the consumer might want to spend less money and be more discerning. Or just elements of normalization that are working in the way back into global travel? Thank you.\nEllie Mertz: Thanks, Eric. So, let's talk about lead times over time. If we look at where we were say in Q2 of 2019, the average lead time across the platform was within one or two days of what it was in Q2 in \u201824? So from the kind of pre-covid to last quarter, there hasn't been some material shifts. What you did see through the path of covid was initially, we saw a massive reduction in lead time because people had no confidence in terms of their ability to book far out. That, that reversed in say the 20 to 2022 to \u201823 time period where people are so eager to travel that they were booking way in advance of their kind of normalized patterns to make sure that they had the trip on the book. They got the most attractive listing at the best price by booking early. And I think fast forward to \u201824 you're seeing up and up through Q2 a very much return to normal. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of the overall four-year arc. In terms of having some color commentary in terms of what we're seeing today, just to reiterate some of the color I provided at the beginning of the call. The last minute bookings are incredibly strong. So they are, I would say much higher in growth rates than what we are guiding to in terms of the average. There seems to be a lot of desire in terms of making sure you get your summer travel in at very elevated rates. But it's being offset by that portion of bookings which is for us about half of the overall bookings, which are a month or longer. And I think it's a minor - it's a minor softness, but it does have impact in terms of our backlog just given the concentration of bookings that happen more than a month in advance. There's just a modest amount of softness that is bringing the average lead times down. And I think what we\u2019ve seen in the past is from time-to-time whether it be a new COVID variant, whether it be a macro headline, whether it be like last year the outbreak of war in Israel. People from time to time have moments where they are not booking in the same timeframe that they did in prior periods, and that's what we're tracking closely right now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll squeeze in two. Let me ask one on the marketing expense comments for you Ellie. You mentioned in the guide marking expense has been real faster than revenue in the third quarter. I guess, the question is how do we think about performance versus brand expend and I think you sort of learned about your marketing spend over the years sort of gives you confidence this could resonate even faster room than growth this time around. And then one for Brian and sort of Gen AI and philosophical strategy. There's a lot of talks that are about top of funnel Gen AI travel assistance. How do you think about taking your leading supply that you have maybe partnering with hotel partners to create a really differentiated top of funnel alternative and hotel booking assistant using all these large language model capabilities?\nEllie Mertz : Yeah, so, Brian, let me let me talk a little bit about our marketing spend. Let me just back up before I talk about Q3 and remind you of the full year guide that we provided back in February. What we shared in February is that, for the full year we were looking to deliver an EBITDA margin of a minimum of 35%, which was obviously down slightly from the nearly 37% we delivered in \u201823. And the intent on guiding to margin compression on a year-over-year basis was to allow us the flexibility to invest in growth. And what you've seen so far this year is that for H1, marketing as a percent of revenue was effectively flat with where it was in \u201823. But we do intend to lean into those growth investments in the back half of the year starting in Q3, and that's obviously what informs the EBITDA guide that that you saw in the letter. In terms of where we are leaning in on marketing in particular and the confidence around the various channels, let me just talk about a couple of the components of the increase in marketing. So first, consistent with the conversation Brian Chesky just had on international markets. What you'll see in Q3 is that we will be layering on a handful of incremental markets that we will be targeting and effectively turning on our global playbook. In particular, you'll see us try or intend to extend our success that we've seen in Latin American countries like Brazil and Mexico to other markets in that region. Places like Peru, Colombia, Chile, Argentina so there will be some layering on of those incremental markets. We feel like we have had pretty good success there. Obviously it takes time in terms of investments in a market both from a product perspective as well as a marketing perspective to reaccelerate growth. But as the results have shown in terms of the differential between growth rates in our expansion markets and our core markets we feel like our expansion efforts have been successful and so, rolling them out to incremental markets will be helpful over the medium term. In terms of incremental performance marketing, what we've shared with you today that has continued into Q3 is that based on a lot of optimizations that we've made to our performance marketing efforts. We've been able to maintain extremely high efficiencies and so where we see those we do lean in and have quite high confidence in terms of returns.\nBrian Chesky : And why don\u2019t take your second question. So Brian Gen AI ChatGPT launched late November 2022. When it launched, I think we all got like incredibly excited. It was kind of like the moment probably some of us first discovered the Internet or you know maybe when I come with launch. And when it was launched you had a feeling that everything was going to change. But I think that's still true. But I think one of the things we\u2019ve learned over the last say 18 months or nearly two years 22 months since ChatGPT launched is that that\u2019s going to take a lot longer than people think for applications to change. If I were to think of AI, I'd probably think about it in three layers. You have the chips. You have the models. And you have the applications. There has been a lot of innovation on the chips. There has been a lot of innovation on the models. We have a lot of new models and there's a prolific rate of improvement in these models. But if you look at your home screen which of your apps are fundamentally different because of the AI? Like fundamentally different kinds of generative AI, very little especially even less in e-commerce or travel. And the reason why is I think it's just going to take time to develop new AI paradigm. ChatGPT is an AI model \u2013 interface if that could have existed before AI. And so, all of our paradigms are pre-AI paradigms. And so what we need to do is we need to actually develop AI applications that are needed to the models, no one's done this yet. There's not been one app that I'm aware of at the top 50 app in the app store in the United States that is a fundamentally new paradigm as fundamentally different FC multi-touch was to the iPhone in 2008 and we need that interface change. So that's one of the things that we're working on. And I do think Airbnb will eventually be much more than a search box where you type a destination, add dates and find a listing. It's going to be much more of a travel concierge is having a conversation, learning adapting to you. It's going to take a number of years to develop this. And so, it won't be in the next year that this will happen and I think this is probably what most of my tech friends are also saying, it's going to just take a bit more time. But the answer to your question on what\u2019s possible, a new interface paradigm would allow us to attach new businesses. So the question is, what permission do we have to go into a business like hotel? Well today, we have permission because we have a lot of traffic. But if we had a breakthrough interface we have even more permission. Because suddenly we could move top of funnel and not just ask where you're going but we could point to we could inspire where you travel. Imagine if we add an index of the world's communities we told you we had information about every community and we can provide the end-to-end trip for you. So, there's a lot of opportunities as we develop new interfaces to cross-sell new more inventory. And just to remind everyone we own hotels nights. We bought that before the pandemic. It\u2019s one of the most popular hotel booking apps in the world and we are still investing in hotels. So absolutely there are opportunities down the road with this new interface to sell new things including hotels and everything.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great thanks for taking my question. Just on the North America and Europe markets presumably growing a little slower than the average for the company. Any signs of kind of cyclical or macro pressure like shorter trips or people trading down that that could end in and any that could maybe drive some acceleration when the period ends. And second, how do you feel about your market share in those two key regions? Thank you.\nEllie Mertz : Yes, so let me talk. Let me talk a little bit about what we're seeing in both, North America and EMEA. I would say I would go back to my prior comments in terms of just the lead times. That that commentary is true globally so it applies to both northern - North America and EMEA. I would say EMEA has been relatively stable quarter to-date. And so it is not necessarily part of the broader moderation story that we have shared. In terms of North America, there's a handful of components. One is the shorter lead times I would say. A second is North America has a concentration of our long-term stays, nights and what we've seen over the last year is that short term days have grown more quickly than long term stays. And so, the LTS to growth rate is a drag on the average that has an outsized impact on North America and we've just comped with the changes that we made a year ago in terms of our LTS fees which is a bit of a headwind for LTS generally on the platform, but in particular in North America The one other thing I would add in terms of just providing some color on what's happening in the US is couple of regulatory comments. One in particular that we're watching is that in California, the total price display and cancellation grace period, regulations went in went into place on July 1st and we think that's been a little bit of a headwind to our California business. Our California business if you include both guests who reside in California as well as guests who are travelling to California, which is what the new rule is applied to is about 10% of our GVV. So it\u2019s an area that we're watching quite closely just see how quickly consumer behavior normalizes after these regulations have been put into place. And into the comments I made earlier on ADR, I would say we haven't really seen a material move towards trade downs much of the contrary people continue to book our larger more expensive listings. And then in terms of shorter trips, the average from playing has gone down, but that is really a function of the mix shift between short-term rentals growing more quickly than long-term rentals. Less so people choosing a three day trip versus a four-day trip. So I don't think we've seen that the type of tree down behavior that that you're likely asking about. In terms of the second component of your question, market share. When we look at market share, we look at the market of night stays across accommodations. And so that obviously includes all the hotel nights that are either booked directly through hotel or booked through an intermediary. And when we look at market share on that basis is what we see is that, in Q2, consistent with prior quarters, we continued on a year of your basis to gain market share in terms of total nights stayed over the universe of hotel and other travel accommodations. That is also true on a regional basis. We feel like we're doing quite well. As we across the world continue to gain market share.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for my questions. Two here please. First on experiences. What are some of the frictions and difficult problems you're trying to resolve here. It seems like you have plenty of supply, plenty of listings. So that doesn't seem to be that issue. Can you help us understand something key paint points for both suppliers and customers? And second, I once again noticed in North America and EMEA, you have call out that to see a mix shift to non-urban markets and just want to get some more color on that. Urban markets in general, are you seeing weaker demand or seeing increased competition in the hotels? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky : Hey, James, I'll take the first question. So there's five things that we're looking for to do with experiences. The first thing is we want them to be a better price selection. Right now, we think we can have - we can offer more affordable experiences that younger people especially Gen Z could afford. So that's the first thing. We don't really have enough affordable listings. The second thing is, we need more unique inventory. It's really good. The inventory we have is good. In fact the five star rating average for experiences is higher than the five star rating for homes. But we still think we can have even more unique inventory that you could only find at Airbnb. That's not another platform and we want to recruit some of the most interesting people in the world to be on our platform. And we're getting a lot of excitement. The third is we think we can even merchandise them better. I think experience to see more and more insights like with film, with movie, with video. Imagine deciding on a movie but instead of a film trailer, you had some movie stills. Would you go see the movie, you probably wouldn't. You need a trailer. You need a video experience. You saw video first. The fourth it needs to be discoverable in the apps. Right now experiences are really hard to find because those the last four years we've really focused on prioritizing our core business. I mean a lot of people they come to our homepage they don't ever see experiences. You wouldn't know these sell experiences. So we're going to completely reimagine our search and discovery engines to cross-sell experiences after you book a home and to really target the right homes. We were going to show you other guests on the experience, just provide social proof. We're going to bring some of the magic like the countdown in the icons and some of the magic there. And the final thing is awareness for experiences really low. Most people don't know we offer experiences even though we launched them eight years ago. So we're going to actually market them and tell the world about them and we can do this without a lot of incremental investment because we can market homes and experiences in the same ad. So if we do those five things, I think we can dramatically change the trajectory of experiences business.\nEllie Mertz: And James, to your second question, in terms of the mix shift to non-urban market. We call it on the letter because it is a differential in terms of the respective market segments, but there isn't \u2013 it\u2019s not a major shift what we are seeing is that growth in non-urban markets continues to be slightly higher than that of urban. I think what that tells you is we have a - I would think differentiated offering in non-urban. And I think the interesting thing about that portion of our business is, it has maintained a - I would say meaningful larger share of our business demand four years post covid than it was previously. And I think over the last four years has been a broadening awareness of the variety of markets that Airbnb is available that hotels simply don't exist and we continue to see great demand for those markets.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. Ellie, I appreciate your comments on margins and real flexibility to invest this year. Could you talk about how long we should see this investment cycle persist and when we could start seeing more meaningful returns? Thank you.\nEllie Mertz: Yes, thank you. So we always have not given a guide for \u201925. We will provide you a view on \u201825 as it approaches. What I would say is, if you look at where we have come over the last couple of years, we obviously delivered a substantial amount of margin expansion from where we started. You followed us for some time, but pre - going public we had negative EBITDA margins and four years later, we were able to deliver almost 37% margins last year. So I think we've more than demonstrated the strength of this model both from a profitability basis as well as a free cash flow basis. What we'd like to deliver more of is growth and that's why we have as I said a lower margin target for the current year. And as I said previously, you'll see us start to make those investments in the back half of the year. I anticipate that when you think about both our medium term growth lever of international markets and then what long-term growth lever of expanding the core offerings. Those will require some ongoing investments in order to scale and then deliver the growth. What I think you should also think about though is that all of our expansions to-date have not been very capital intensive. So we will use some of the probability to invest but we don't anticipate any kind of sea change in the foreseeable future around overall profitability levels.\nOperator: And you're next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. So, if we adjust our Easter impact it looks like you have a little bit of revenue growth slowing kind of each quarter this year expect to see the third quarter. Based on the dynamics you're seeing today do you anticipate some further slowing towards the end of the year, if you look at how space are shaping up for Q4 or do you see anything in your numbers as of now that could lead to stabilization? Thanks.\nEllie Mertz: Yes. thanks, Kevin. So I would say, first, we're not going to provide outlook right now for Q4, but when I when I give you that color on the lead times, I think it's pretty informative from the perspective of, it's not that people are not definitively booking over the long term, if they may not have booked yet. And so, as I shared previously, we have seen some. some movement in lead times over the last couple of years and in many cases people have come booked. They just come and booked at a later time period and so that's certainly something that we will be on the eyes out for in terms of Q4 and beyond. I think also just thinking about how the comps play out for the balance of the year. As you'll recall where we were last year September and October were quite soft and then November and December had a bit of a rebound. So those are the comps that we'll be lapping as we approach the end of the summer heading into Q4.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nick Jones with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nNick Jones : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just another one on an expenses and philosophically how you're thinking about it. There's plan to relaunch experiences, Brian it sounds like there's not a lot of incremental investment required there, but earlier you kind of talked about launching new products and services every year. So I guess can you speak to how nimble you plan to be with the investment cycle to if demand may be continues to get weaker or versus kind of bouncing back, how should we be thinking about kind of the level of commitment to invest in and what sounds like a lot of new and exciting products and services?\nBrian Chesky : Yeah, I mean we essentially built our forecast to have already have a spread of that between short term, medium term and long term. So in the short term, I mean, the biggest driver of growth in the short term again is conversion increases. Every 1% increase in our business is about $100 million. And we have hundreds of basis points of growth opportunities just in conversion and usability improvements. And then affordability we have quite a few opportunities and then a quality and reliability. Probably one of the biggest variables might be like how we think about expanding internationally like some of the big Asian countries like Japan, we can be very, very nimble. based on the results of Japan. Most of these new services and offering though are going to not cost very much. They're mostly headcount we're talking some teams hundreds of people not thousands of people so you won't really see that. Because this is a network effect business and most of our traffic is going to be taking traffic we already have for accommodations business and cross-selling new offerings. And so, it's really just the cost of acquisition of supply and that's not very expensive because we've found that we can do it fairly efficiently. So most of this it's very nimble. There's not going to be a lot of incremental investment that would materially change. The variability is sometimes it\u2019s probably like marketing especially internationally that's a question.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly : Hey great. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the urban opportunity and potentially putting more hotels on your platform, can you just talk about philosophically how the company balances putting more supply that you might consider more could commoditize and that can be cross-listed. What that might convert at a higher rate? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky : Hi, Jed, so, essentially, I think people come to Airbnb because they want to get something unique. That's what customers think of when they think of Airbnb. That's why we're a noun and a verb. We're one of the only brands in the world like Kleenex or Xerox, that's a noun and verb and it means you can - it's something that didn't really exist before we created this category at a wide scale. That being said, for everyone who books in Airbnb, about 9 people book a hotel. And so, if we can get just one of those guests to book on Airbnb, that's currently booking on a hotel platform we would go from nearly half a billion nights a year to a billion nights a year. And there's two ways to do that. One is the increased reliability of homes in Airbnb, because the number one reason people tell us they book hotels is they are typically more reliable. They know what they're going to get they have a front desk. The other is adding hotels in Airbnb and we're not philosophically misaligned with adding hotels, if we were we would never bought hotels a night before the pandemic. We just haven't prioritized hotels. We think of hotels as a filling in network gap during high occupancy nights. We generally think our if there's an incredible home at a low price, they're always going to choose that but when occupancy goes up they are going to go towards hotels. There are also some use cases where hotels are better and Airbnbs are better. If you need to stay for one night, you're travelling alone, you are business travel and you plug in you plug out a hotel is better. If you're traveling with a group you are travelling for more than three nights and you're travelling in the non-urban area, Airbnb is better. And then, if you're doing something between then you're going to have choices. So, we do think between filling in a network gap and getting more of those one night business travel stays, there is an opportunity to offer hotels in Airbnb and we have a lot of hotels. We have hundreds of thousands of boutique hotels and non-home inventory on Airbnb and we're going to continue to expand that over its years to come. And so there's no philosophical misalignment to add commodity inventory. The philosophical misalign would be if that becomes the majority of our marketplace and people - consumers stop thinking of Airbnb as unique and local. If they start thinking about us that changes the brand then that would be a philosophical misalignment but I don't see that happening anytime soon.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI, Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: I just wanted to ask a question about Paris and the learnings you've had from this. I assume this is the biggest event for Airbnb and a massive popular event in your largest city. So just if that\u2019s true and I think that is, just step back and talk about the learnings of being able to make sure you had enough supply working with local regulators and agencies and in terms of getting messages out to opportunities out to guests as well like this big event that you've pulled off. Just talk about the lessons you've been able to draw from that that'll you know help you set you a better for the next FIFA World Cup and the next World Cup, next Olympics et cetera?\nBrian Chesky : It\u2019s a great question, Mark I'm really glad you asked this. I just want to like take us back down memory lane because in 2007, Airbnb provided housing for a design conference. Then in 2008, we provided housing for the Democratic National Convention. Then in 2009 we provided housing for the inauguration. Our first three moments when we started Airbnb was provided housing for events. In fact, our original premise of our business was at housing for events. It wasn't meant to be ever offered for anything other than events in conferences. And the reason why is because conferences and events especially things like the Olympics and World Cup are unbelievable use cases for Airbnb. And the reason why is I think obvious to everyone. Events typically like to host more guests than they have hotel rooms available for. And people, most people they have, most regular people aren't looking to become Airbnb host and make a long-term commitment to host every week. So a lot of people events coming to town is wanting to host one week and make $1,000 or $2,000. And so what we did is we focused a year ago on Paris. And in the last year we increased our supply in Paris by 37%. We now have nearly 150,000 homes in Paris. We had 430,000 guests stay in Paris so far and counting and that number to continue to climb. So that's equivalent of five Olympic stadiums, I want you to imagine five Olympic stadiums where the guest staying in at Airbnb. The fact is that the Olympics as we know it could not ever happen again, without Airbnb because this 400,000 could not have stayed in a hotel room. And so to do that, what we did is we worked at the City of Paris. I was in Paris 10 days ago. I met with President Macron. I met with his economic team. And we talked about how important Airbnb was to the Olympics happening. And we had a lot of cooperation. We were a title sponsor Olympics. And we targeted this event of at Paris, we Did a lot of local campaign. And so it was so successful that we now looking at the top thousand events in the world, really large ones like the World Cup and Olympics, but also like you know looking at where Taylor Swift is going on concert or looking at different conferences, different like we provide housing for the Berkshire Hathaway conference in Omaha and we worked with Warren Buffett you got the word out. This is over a decade ago. So conferences, festivals, events, Coachella, you go down the list. I think this is the best strategy we have to recruit supply and the supply recruit for an event is not property managers. They are individuals who host occasionally that come only to Airbnb. And cities actually like when Airbnb provides housing for events because we solve a problem for them. So, I'm glad you ask the question. The answer is it worked widely successful. Better than we ever imagined. We're working on the lawn for 2026. We're looking at La Olympics for 2028. But we're also building a strategy for the top thousand events in the world. But I think this is the strategy the only Airbnb can do. Because we basically increase excess capacity in cities all over the world to allow them to temporary as well. And it's really alignment and incentives. So it's been very successful at least that we continue - we'll be playing to expand the playbook.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. great. Thank you. Brian, I want to ask on Airbnb rooms. I would have thought that given its more nascent statement in the economic backdrop that this is should probably be the product that should be growing the fastest. So is there anything that you can call out in terms of product fit or awareness? I think I heard you call out maybe supply shortages earlier. But any factors that might be weighing on the growth rate here a little bit? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky : Thanks. Yeah, the reality is the biggest issue with Airbnb rooms it\u2019s just a small percent of our business. It's a very small percentage. So even if it - even no matter how fast it grows it's often very small base. It's how Airbnb started by providing a room and a house. It's very affordable. It's very popular for Gen Z, but it is off a very small base and so you're not going to see a major change to the growth rate of the company based on that. I think the thing but maybe just broad zooming out though, two points I\u2019ll make. The first point is Airbnb is one of the most diverse businesses in the world. We have bedrooms and homes up to tens of thousands of dollars a night luxury villas in Airbnb. We allow you to travel by yourself or with the large groups of up to 16 people. We're in every country nearly in the world, every continent in the world including at one point in article and so we're a very - we're in urban areas. Where in the decades arounds this nations we're off to be impact. So our general philosophy is that something for everyone to have the most diverse array of inventory in the world. The other point I'll just make is an area down the road that would really help Airbnb rooms is continuing to invest in our system of trust. The biggest obstacle to people staying in a room is just the discomfort with staying at a house with a stranger they don't know. One of our core inventions with a system of trust and as more we invest in system of trust, I just gave a lot more of these businesses where strangers to live in the others. So I do think it's still a big long term opportunity for us. But it's often but smaller base and it's never going to be as big as entire home and everything.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: Great, thanks. New on one our nights and on pricing. So Ellie you're talking about putting more investments into place in the second half of this year as a means of accelerating growth. Can you help us better understand sort of the payback periods that you tend to expect on these dollars and over what timeframe you may assess the ROI on these investments in terms of accelerating total company growth rates? And then maybe one on ADRs. You guys are highlighting sort of some building demand pressures in North America, all sign the pointing towards people trading up the whole homes and persisting ADR growth for your entire business again despite weaker growth in your highest ADR region, North America. I guess when we think about. the sustainability of ADR growth beyond the 3Q as you mix away from North America and perhaps see the overall travel demand environment continue to soften, how do you think about your ability to continue growing through that kind of a scenario? Thanks so much.\nEllie Mertz: Yeah, so first let me talk about marketing payback. I would say the way we are looking marketing paybacks is very different based on the channels and investment from a performance marketing standpoint obviously the ROI is very specific and relatively short-term. We think about that in terms of weeks and months not quarters. In terms of Brands we think about that over a longer time horizon. If you think about any particular brand campaign, it needs to be in market for quite some time and it needs to be sustained for you not only to see the benefit, but also sustain the benefit and convert it into actual transaction. So I think about that more from the six months to a year payback period and requires - I would say a consistent level of investment. And then, as a third factor something that I mentioned in terms of an area of investment that is not programmatic. We do need to at the margin build some of our teams that are driving this growth and so that will be in a gradual investment modestly above the headcount growth that we've been targeting over the last couple of years but we think it will help long Payback should I should say high payback in terms of driving acceleration across a variety of initiatives. In terms of pricing, I think there's one question about what is happening at a geo level. I think there's a broader question in terms of the aggregate or global ADRs. To your question in terms of if neighbor is softer than other regions what happens to global ADR obviously mix shift is a huge component in terms of the global ADRs that we report. One Factor in terms of the Q3 guide is the shift a little bit away from North America which as you highlight does have the highest ADRs Over time we would anticipate that as regions like Latin America and APAC become larger portions of our overall business, the global ADR would come down. But those incremental nights are all accretive and the economics behind them still are very strong. So it's a at a global basis, we are we're somewhat agnostic because we can deliver strong economics across a wide range in ADRs.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question and answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Brian Chesky for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: Alright, well, thanks for joining us today. Just to recap, revenue was 2.7 billion 11% higher than a year ago, adjusted EBITDA was a Q2 record And our a trailing 12 months free cash flow was $4.3 billion is our highest yet representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. And we've made significant progress over the past few weeks, but there's more to come. In October we're going to share with set of features and upgrades as part of our 2024 winter release. This includes expanding host of co-hosting, setting the stage for host provided services and much more. I'm proud what we accomplished in Q2 and I look forward to sharing more with you next quarter. Thanks for joining.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ellie Mertz",
            "content": "Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So let me double click a little bit in terms of the trends for lead times since the beginning of the year. In both Q1 and Q2, what we saw with that lead times were basically equivalent with what we had seen in 2023. So there wasn't really any timing shift behavior in terms of when guests were booking. What we\u2019ve seen more recently and in particular in July is a shrinking of the lead times and in particular what we've seen is that there continues to be very strong growth of the shorter lead times. So anything from same day to next week to a couple of weeks from now. But what we're not seeing the same level of strength is in those longer lead times. So two months from now, what you\u2019re booking for Thanksgiving what you\u2019re booking for Christmas, and so it's that I would say softness in terms of longer lead times as a big factor in terms of the outlook that we've provided. What I would say additionally is that, over the last couple of years as we emerge from covid, there were several periods where we saw some volatility in terms of overall lead times and in particular some hesitancy for consumers to book those longer lead time trips. I suspect that's what we're seeing right now and the - I would say the silver lining with regard to the trends that we see right now, it's not that consumers are not necessarily going to book that trip for Thanksgiving or Christmas. It just appears that they have not booked it yet. So we're closely following all of the trends on lead times, but it is a factor that informs the outlook that we provided for Q3. Yeah. so Let's talk a little bit generally about ADR, so question was like what are people are actually purchasing on the platform. I would say, generally, so far this year what you've seen is a little bit of ADR appreciation globally. In particular, obviously, but more recently in North America. And what we see there is a big driver of the ADR appreciation is big shifts, which you can assume is what it sounds like people choosing more expensive or larger properties. And I think part of the read through from that can be oh, people are choosing more expensive listings. Therefore, you are seeing stronger demand from higher economic demographics. I think that is one read through. I think another read through is that, if you think about the value proposition of Airbnb, it's that we offer these larger properties and on a per guest basis, they can be quite affordable and frankly more affordable than a hotel. So I think part of that ADR mix shift appreciation that you see is frankly people gravitating to where we actually have some great value, which is the larger Airbnb that that do provide value on a guest level. Yeah, thanks Richard. So, obviously, that that energy is balanced on - on the balance sheet gives you some indication of the backlog. I would not take those balance sheet items as a one for one read through in terms of the revenue that will be recognized over the course of the quarter. A couple of deviations in terms of why they might not match. One is obviously a good portion of the bookings that we will recognize in a particular quarter are still to be booked within the quarter? That's one aspect. The second is the balance sheet items will reflect the timing of the payments, the - whether it\u2019s pay less upfront or the entirety of the payment and so they're just not a one for one guide. All they do, they do obviously give a time stamped point in time view of the backlog that we have. Thanks, Eric. So, let's talk about lead times over time. If we look at where we were say in Q2 of 2019, the average lead time across the platform was within one or two days of what it was in Q2 in \u201824? So from the kind of pre-covid to last quarter, there hasn't been some material shifts. What you did see through the path of covid was initially, we saw a massive reduction in lead time because people had no confidence in terms of their ability to book far out. That, that reversed in say the 20 to 2022 to \u201823 time period where people are so eager to travel that they were booking way in advance of their kind of normalized patterns to make sure that they had the trip on the book. They got the most attractive listing at the best price by booking early. And I think fast forward to \u201824 you're seeing up and up through Q2 a very much return to normal. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of the overall four-year arc. In terms of having some color commentary in terms of what we're seeing today, just to reiterate some of the color I provided at the beginning of the call. The last minute bookings are incredibly strong. So they are, I would say much higher in growth rates than what we are guiding to in terms of the average. There seems to be a lot of desire in terms of making sure you get your summer travel in at very elevated rates. But it's being offset by that portion of bookings which is for us about half of the overall bookings, which are a month or longer. And I think it's a minor - it's a minor softness, but it does have impact in terms of our backlog just given the concentration of bookings that happen more than a month in advance. There's just a modest amount of softness that is bringing the average lead times down. And I think what we\u2019ve seen in the past is from time-to-time whether it be a new COVID variant, whether it be a macro headline, whether it be like last year the outbreak of war in Israel. People from time to time have moments where they are not booking in the same timeframe that they did in prior periods, and that's what we're tracking closely right now. Yeah, so, Brian, let me let me talk a little bit about our marketing spend. Let me just back up before I talk about Q3 and remind you of the full year guide that we provided back in February. What we shared in February is that, for the full year we were looking to deliver an EBITDA margin of a minimum of 35%, which was obviously down slightly from the nearly 37% we delivered in \u201823. And the intent on guiding to margin compression on a year-over-year basis was to allow us the flexibility to invest in growth. And what you've seen so far this year is that for H1, marketing as a percent of revenue was effectively flat with where it was in \u201823. But we do intend to lean into those growth investments in the back half of the year starting in Q3, and that's obviously what informs the EBITDA guide that that you saw in the letter. In terms of where we are leaning in on marketing in particular and the confidence around the various channels, let me just talk about a couple of the components of the increase in marketing. So first, consistent with the conversation Brian Chesky just had on international markets. What you'll see in Q3 is that we will be layering on a handful of incremental markets that we will be targeting and effectively turning on our global playbook. In particular, you'll see us try or intend to extend our success that we've seen in Latin American countries like Brazil and Mexico to other markets in that region. Places like Peru, Colombia, Chile, Argentina so there will be some layering on of those incremental markets. We feel like we have had pretty good success there. Obviously it takes time in terms of investments in a market both from a product perspective as well as a marketing perspective to reaccelerate growth. But as the results have shown in terms of the differential between growth rates in our expansion markets and our core markets we feel like our expansion efforts have been successful and so, rolling them out to incremental markets will be helpful over the medium term. In terms of incremental performance marketing, what we've shared with you today that has continued into Q3 is that based on a lot of optimizations that we've made to our performance marketing efforts. We've been able to maintain extremely high efficiencies and so where we see those we do lean in and have quite high confidence in terms of returns. Yes, so let me talk. Let me talk a little bit about what we're seeing in both, North America and EMEA. I would say I would go back to my prior comments in terms of just the lead times. That that commentary is true globally so it applies to both northern - North America and EMEA. I would say EMEA has been relatively stable quarter to-date. And so it is not necessarily part of the broader moderation story that we have shared. In terms of North America, there's a handful of components. One is the shorter lead times I would say. A second is North America has a concentration of our long-term stays, nights and what we've seen over the last year is that short term days have grown more quickly than long term stays. And so, the LTS to growth rate is a drag on the average that has an outsized impact on North America and we've just comped with the changes that we made a year ago in terms of our LTS fees which is a bit of a headwind for LTS generally on the platform, but in particular in North America The one other thing I would add in terms of just providing some color on what's happening in the US is couple of regulatory comments. One in particular that we're watching is that in California, the total price display and cancellation grace period, regulations went in went into place on July 1st and we think that's been a little bit of a headwind to our California business. Our California business if you include both guests who reside in California as well as guests who are travelling to California, which is what the new rule is applied to is about 10% of our GVV. So it\u2019s an area that we're watching quite closely just see how quickly consumer behavior normalizes after these regulations have been put into place. And into the comments I made earlier on ADR, I would say we haven't really seen a material move towards trade downs much of the contrary people continue to book our larger more expensive listings. And then in terms of shorter trips, the average from playing has gone down, but that is really a function of the mix shift between short-term rentals growing more quickly than long-term rentals. Less so people choosing a three day trip versus a four-day trip. So I don't think we've seen that the type of tree down behavior that that you're likely asking about. In terms of the second component of your question, market share. When we look at market share, we look at the market of night stays across accommodations. And so that obviously includes all the hotel nights that are either booked directly through hotel or booked through an intermediary. And when we look at market share on that basis is what we see is that, in Q2, consistent with prior quarters, we continued on a year of your basis to gain market share in terms of total nights stayed over the universe of hotel and other travel accommodations. That is also true on a regional basis. We feel like we're doing quite well. As we across the world continue to gain market share. And James, to your second question, in terms of the mix shift to non-urban market. We call it on the letter because it is a differential in terms of the respective market segments, but there isn't \u2013 it\u2019s not a major shift what we are seeing is that growth in non-urban markets continues to be slightly higher than that of urban. I think what that tells you is we have a - I would think differentiated offering in non-urban. And I think the interesting thing about that portion of our business is, it has maintained a - I would say meaningful larger share of our business demand four years post covid than it was previously. And I think over the last four years has been a broadening awareness of the variety of markets that Airbnb is available that hotels simply don't exist and we continue to see great demand for those markets. Yes, thank you. So we always have not given a guide for \u201925. We will provide you a view on \u201825 as it approaches. What I would say is, if you look at where we have come over the last couple of years, we obviously delivered a substantial amount of margin expansion from where we started. You followed us for some time, but pre - going public we had negative EBITDA margins and four years later, we were able to deliver almost 37% margins last year. So I think we've more than demonstrated the strength of this model both from a profitability basis as well as a free cash flow basis. What we'd like to deliver more of is growth and that's why we have as I said a lower margin target for the current year. And as I said previously, you'll see us start to make those investments in the back half of the year. I anticipate that when you think about both our medium term growth lever of international markets and then what long-term growth lever of expanding the core offerings. Those will require some ongoing investments in order to scale and then deliver the growth. What I think you should also think about though is that all of our expansions to-date have not been very capital intensive. So we will use some of the probability to invest but we don't anticipate any kind of sea change in the foreseeable future around overall profitability levels. Yes. thanks, Kevin. So I would say, first, we're not going to provide outlook right now for Q4, but when I when I give you that color on the lead times, I think it's pretty informative from the perspective of, it's not that people are not definitively booking over the long term, if they may not have booked yet. And so, as I shared previously, we have seen some. some movement in lead times over the last couple of years and in many cases people have come booked. They just come and booked at a later time period and so that's certainly something that we will be on the eyes out for in terms of Q4 and beyond. I think also just thinking about how the comps play out for the balance of the year. As you'll recall where we were last year September and October were quite soft and then November and December had a bit of a rebound. So those are the comps that we'll be lapping as we approach the end of the summer heading into Q4. Yeah, so first let me talk about marketing payback. I would say the way we are looking marketing paybacks is very different based on the channels and investment from a performance marketing standpoint obviously the ROI is very specific and relatively short-term. We think about that in terms of weeks and months not quarters. In terms of Brands we think about that over a longer time horizon. If you think about any particular brand campaign, it needs to be in market for quite some time and it needs to be sustained for you not only to see the benefit, but also sustain the benefit and convert it into actual transaction. So I think about that more from the six months to a year payback period and requires - I would say a consistent level of investment. And then, as a third factor something that I mentioned in terms of an area of investment that is not programmatic. We do need to at the margin build some of our teams that are driving this growth and so that will be in a gradual investment modestly above the headcount growth that we've been targeting over the last couple of years but we think it will help long Payback should I should say high payback in terms of driving acceleration across a variety of initiatives. In terms of pricing, I think there's one question about what is happening at a geo level. I think there's a broader question in terms of the aggregate or global ADRs. To your question in terms of if neighbor is softer than other regions what happens to global ADR obviously mix shift is a huge component in terms of the global ADRs that we report. One Factor in terms of the Q3 guide is the shift a little bit away from North America which as you highlight does have the highest ADRs Over time we would anticipate that as regions like Latin America and APAC become larger portions of our overall business, the global ADR would come down. But those incremental nights are all accretive and the economics behind them still are very strong. So it's a at a global basis, we are we're somewhat agnostic because we can deliver strong economics across a wide range in ADRs."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining. Q2 marked another strong quarter for Airbnb. We had 125 million nights and experiences booked. Revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $2.75 billion. Net income was $555 million representing a net income margin of 20% and we generated $1 billion of free cash flow. Our total trailing 12 month free cash flow was $4.3 billion, our highest ever, and our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase $749 million of our shares in the quarter. And as of the end of Q2, we had $5.25 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization program. Now during Q2, we continue to make progress on our three strategic priorities, which again are making hosting mainstream, perfecting our core service and expanding beyond the core. So I\u2019ll share a few highlights on each. First, we are making hosting mainstream. Last year, we shared a commitment to make hosting just as popular as travelling in Airbnb. We've been focused on raising awareness around the benefits of hosting and providing better tools for hosts. In Q2, we surpassed 8 million active listings driven by continued growth across all regions and market types. We're not just growing supply and we're also committed to ensuring that it's high quality supply. Since launching our updated host quality system last April, we\u2019ve removed over 200,000 listings that failed to meet our guests expectations. And we'll continue to raise the overall quality of listings on Airbnb so we can consistently deliver high quality stays. Second, we're perfecting our core service. We remain focused on making Airbnb more reliable, affordable and a overall better service for hosting guests. We\u2019ve rolled out hundreds of new features and upgrades over the past two years to do this. This includes launching major reliability initiatives like guest favorites which make it easy for guests to find the best listings in Airbnb. Now since launch, last November, we've seen over a 150 million nights booked at guest favorite listings. We've also made dozens of smaller changes that have led to improved usability and booking conversion. These include things like simplified set up and login, improved map, clear cancellation policies and so much more. Now we've made tremendous progress and we'll never stop improving Airbnb. We're going to continue this commitment. And finally, perhaps most excitingly, we are expanding beyond our core. We continue to drive growth by investing in underpenetrated markets. In Q2, growth of gross nights booked on an origin basis in our expansion markets significantly outperformed our core markets on average. Our core markets again are US, UK, France, Australia and Canada. This is largely due to the success of our global expansion playbook which includes a more localized product and marketing approach. We're also expanding Airbnb\u2019s brand positioning beyond travel accommodations with the launch and roll out of Airbnb Icons which is a new category of extraordinary experiences that we launched in May. Now since launch, we see nearly 40 million views of Icons on our site. Helping people understand that Airbnb offers more than accommodations will be critical as we expand our offerings in the coming years. Now, looking back to Q2, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, guests are increasingly booking on the Airbnb app. We've continued to optimized our mobile website\u2019s app downloads and we believe our approach is working. Nights booked in our app during Q2 increased 19% year-over-year. Now these bookings now comprise 55% of total nights booked and this is up from 50% in the prior year period. Now in addition to our success of mobile downloads and bookings, we're continuing to see growth of first-time bookers on our platform with the highest levels of growth seen in the youngest age demographic. Second, Airbnb is uniquely positioned for special events where continuously more guests choose Airbnb for major holidays and events. The week of July 4th for example represented our single highest week of revenue ever in North America and we saw similar trends in Europe. Now in anticipation of the Olympics which is in Paris, nights booked in Paris through Q2 were more than double what they were this time last year. Additionally, cities hosting matches during the recent Euro Cup in Germany saw an average of more than 20% year-over-year increase in nights booked. And supply has increased to meet the higher demand. So we have 37% increase in active listings in Paris in Q2 compared to the year ago. And these events, what they really do is they highlight Airbnb\u2019s unique ability to disperse travel and spread economic benefits by allowing people stay in local neighborhoods where there are no hotels. Finally, supply growth is improving on Airbnb. We made huge strides for supply growth, we remain just as focus on supply quality. As we improve quality, we believe more people will try Airbnb unlocking even more growth. We have two major initiatives underway to help us do this. First, we're removing low quality supply. As I shared earlier, we've removed over 200,000 listings since April of last year. Second, we're making it easier for guests to find the best stays on Airbnb. We launched guest favorites as well as top listing highlights, which show the top 1%, 5% and 10% of eligible homes on Airbnb. These new features make it easy for guests to find the highest quality homes on Airbnb. In Q2, we also saw active listing managed by Superhosts, some of our highest quality hosts, increase 26% year-over-year. We're proud of our Q2 results. Now, turning to Q3, we're looking forward to another record summer travel season. We're encouraged by the excitement around the Olympics and the Euro Cup and we're also encouraged by the relative strength of Latin America and Asia Pacific which continue to be our fastest growing regions. However, we are seeing shorter looking lead times globally and some signs of slowing demand from US guests and our Q3 outlook incorporate these recent trends. We are watching these trends closely along with the impact any macroeconomic pressures might be causing. And we're continuing to execute against our growth strategy by improving our service, expanding in less penetrated markets and introducing new offerings. We believe this growth strategy will over the long term offset any transitory macro trends. So with that, Ellie and I look forward to answering your questions. Yes, why don\u2019t Ellie you take the first one about slowing lead times and when we started seeing these trends and I'll take the second one. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, there was a second part of the question. So, Ron, to answer your question about expanding beyond the core business. Where we are is we spent 16 years building a business that's approaching $80 billion in gross booking value that's basically one category, which we call Airbnb which is short term accommodation. It's been pretty amazing how far this single product has gone. And we haven't really charged other than like essentially travel insurance, we haven't really ever really expanded beyond our core business and we do have long-term stays which are [17%] (ph) of nights. We haven't done very much. We began before the pandemic preparing to expand Airbnb. And then when the pandemic hit, we cut back a lot of our resources. We got focused, went back to our roots and really focused on rebuilding our platform, becoming lean, becoming a functional organization and we now have essentially the same amount of employees as before the pandemic and double the revenue and that explains why we have 41% free cash flow margin, one of the most profitable companies in tech. We're now beginning to prepare the next chapter of Airbnb. And I want Airbnb to be one of the most important companies of our generation and to do that, we're going to do more than one thing. We're going to do multiple new things. We're going to have to have multiple new products and multiple new services. This fall, this October, we're going to be launching a new host service which is really important. It's essentially a co-hosting marketplace. So, there are people that have homes but they don't have time. There are other people in the world that have time but they don\u2019t have a home. And so, there's a Venn diagram of people today who have both that get host. But what if we can match those two people together? That would unlock a lot more inventory. That's what we're going to be launching later in October. Then next year we're going to begin to expand Airbnb truly beyond our core business. And we're going to be launching - we're going to relaunch Experiences. I've been asked about Experiences probably every earnings call since we\u2019ve been public, rightly so, because it's very exciting. We've learned a lot of lessons from Experiences. They need to be more affordable. They need to be more unique to Airbnb when you think so you can only find on Airbnb. They should be merchandised, videos not photos. They should be discoverable in the app and we should market them. If we think we do these five things, we think we'll have a hit on our hands and we're working on that. We also have new guests services and new host services that we're launching next year that we're working on. And then every year starting next year, we're going to launch new products and services. I look at Apple, I look at Amazon. Apple at one point was selling iMacs, Amazon was only selling books. We've gotten bigger than either of those companies just selling short-term rentals. But we're ready to go beyond short term rentals. So, the new Airbnb, to answer your question Ron, will be about a lot more than short-term rentals. It's going to be about long-term stays. It's going to be our guest services, host services and many new offerings and you'll begin to see that next year. Yes. So, why don't Ellie, you take the first. I\u2019ll take the second. And to answer your question about expansion markets, maybe a framework I can give to think about how we want accelerate growth, listen, we want to be growing a lot fast than we are. We want to be growing in healthy double-digit growth - double-digit growth and I think we can. And the way we're thinking about accelerating growth is through short-term, medium- term and long-term. Short-term is really optimizing our core business. It's really around affordability, about having high quality stays and just conversion rate increases. Long term is really about new products and services. So, the question you asked about international is interesting because it's kind of like a medium term horizon, like one to three years. And to frame this, Airbnb is in 220 countries and regions. We're one of the most global companies in the world on the Internet, 220 countries and regions. We operate nearly in every country in the world. But there's only really five markets where we're penetrating. And those markers are the US, UK, France, Canada and Australia. And you'd think like, well, if there was one company in the world that would truly be like have a lot of international penetration it\u2019d be a global travel network, right? A website where you want to travel, use one platform to travel around the world. So there's a number of countries. Just to give you a couple of examples of our some big expansion markets, Germany and Brazil we've seen a lot of progress. Those are huge travel markets and the biggest travel markets in the world. And we're continuing to go bigger. In Europe, Italy and Spain, we have low penetration compared to France and UK and these are major destinations. Then in Latin America, we've had a lot of progress in Brazil but there's really Peru, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, these are a huge opportunity markets, and that's Latin America is the fastest growing region alongside Asia. And Asia, you really have like the big four, big five countries. So you have China, Japan, Korea, India and then maybe we could kind of call out Southeast Asia as a holistic region. So what we're going to do is we have an international playbook, which is really product and marketing. First, need to localize the product, you need to make sure you have the right regulation in place. You need to make sure you have the right foundation. We've highlighted in our Investor Letter that we\u2019ve retooled our product for Asia. Asia are different character counts. And so it's more laborious in certain languages to type in so like in Korea and Japan they prefer to do browsing than search. So we've had to retool our product and that's yielded some huge conversion rate increases. So some of these are going to pay back sooner, like some of North - like Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, they're going to pay back sooner. Japan is going to be a longer game, but that's one of the biggest travel markets in the world. And I literally think there are tens of billions of dollars of gross booking value increase just by getting all the aforementioned countries to the current market penetration of Canada or Australia. If we can get those countries to Canada, Australia there's tens of billions of dollars and it's just something we've had to focus - we're going to focus on. It's something we hadn't focused on in the last four years as much. We really want to solidify our core business, but now we're focused on it. And why don\u2019t take your second question. So Brian Gen AI ChatGPT launched late November 2022. When it launched, I think we all got like incredibly excited. It was kind of like the moment probably some of us first discovered the Internet or you know maybe when I come with launch. And when it was launched you had a feeling that everything was going to change. But I think that's still true. But I think one of the things we\u2019ve learned over the last say 18 months or nearly two years 22 months since ChatGPT launched is that that\u2019s going to take a lot longer than people think for applications to change. If I were to think of AI, I'd probably think about it in three layers. You have the chips. You have the models. And you have the applications. There has been a lot of innovation on the chips. There has been a lot of innovation on the models. We have a lot of new models and there's a prolific rate of improvement in these models. But if you look at your home screen which of your apps are fundamentally different because of the AI? Like fundamentally different kinds of generative AI, very little especially even less in e-commerce or travel. And the reason why is I think it's just going to take time to develop new AI paradigm. ChatGPT is an AI model \u2013 interface if that could have existed before AI. And so, all of our paradigms are pre-AI paradigms. And so what we need to do is we need to actually develop AI applications that are needed to the models, no one's done this yet. There's not been one app that I'm aware of at the top 50 app in the app store in the United States that is a fundamentally new paradigm as fundamentally different FC multi-touch was to the iPhone in 2008 and we need that interface change. So that's one of the things that we're working on. And I do think Airbnb will eventually be much more than a search box where you type a destination, add dates and find a listing. It's going to be much more of a travel concierge is having a conversation, learning adapting to you. It's going to take a number of years to develop this. And so, it won't be in the next year that this will happen and I think this is probably what most of my tech friends are also saying, it's going to just take a bit more time. But the answer to your question on what\u2019s possible, a new interface paradigm would allow us to attach new businesses. So the question is, what permission do we have to go into a business like hotel? Well today, we have permission because we have a lot of traffic. But if we had a breakthrough interface we have even more permission. Because suddenly we could move top of funnel and not just ask where you're going but we could point to we could inspire where you travel. Imagine if we add an index of the world's communities we told you we had information about every community and we can provide the end-to-end trip for you. So, there's a lot of opportunities as we develop new interfaces to cross-sell new more inventory. And just to remind everyone we own hotels nights. We bought that before the pandemic. It\u2019s one of the most popular hotel booking apps in the world and we are still investing in hotels. So absolutely there are opportunities down the road with this new interface to sell new things including hotels and everything. Hey, James, I'll take the first question. So there's five things that we're looking for to do with experiences. The first thing is we want them to be a better price selection. Right now, we think we can have - we can offer more affordable experiences that younger people especially Gen Z could afford. So that's the first thing. We don't really have enough affordable listings. The second thing is, we need more unique inventory. It's really good. The inventory we have is good. In fact the five star rating average for experiences is higher than the five star rating for homes. But we still think we can have even more unique inventory that you could only find at Airbnb. That's not another platform and we want to recruit some of the most interesting people in the world to be on our platform. And we're getting a lot of excitement. The third is we think we can even merchandise them better. I think experience to see more and more insights like with film, with movie, with video. Imagine deciding on a movie but instead of a film trailer, you had some movie stills. Would you go see the movie, you probably wouldn't. You need a trailer. You need a video experience. You saw video first. The fourth it needs to be discoverable in the apps. Right now experiences are really hard to find because those the last four years we've really focused on prioritizing our core business. I mean a lot of people they come to our homepage they don't ever see experiences. You wouldn't know these sell experiences. So we're going to completely reimagine our search and discovery engines to cross-sell experiences after you book a home and to really target the right homes. We were going to show you other guests on the experience, just provide social proof. We're going to bring some of the magic like the countdown in the icons and some of the magic there. And the final thing is awareness for experiences really low. Most people don't know we offer experiences even though we launched them eight years ago. So we're going to actually market them and tell the world about them and we can do this without a lot of incremental investment because we can market homes and experiences in the same ad. So if we do those five things, I think we can dramatically change the trajectory of experiences business. Yeah, I mean we essentially built our forecast to have already have a spread of that between short term, medium term and long term. So in the short term, I mean, the biggest driver of growth in the short term again is conversion increases. Every 1% increase in our business is about $100 million. And we have hundreds of basis points of growth opportunities just in conversion and usability improvements. And then affordability we have quite a few opportunities and then a quality and reliability. Probably one of the biggest variables might be like how we think about expanding internationally like some of the big Asian countries like Japan, we can be very, very nimble. based on the results of Japan. Most of these new services and offering though are going to not cost very much. They're mostly headcount we're talking some teams hundreds of people not thousands of people so you won't really see that. Because this is a network effect business and most of our traffic is going to be taking traffic we already have for accommodations business and cross-selling new offerings. And so, it's really just the cost of acquisition of supply and that's not very expensive because we've found that we can do it fairly efficiently. So most of this it's very nimble. There's not going to be a lot of incremental investment that would materially change. The variability is sometimes it\u2019s probably like marketing especially internationally that's a question. Hi, Jed, so, essentially, I think people come to Airbnb because they want to get something unique. That's what customers think of when they think of Airbnb. That's why we're a noun and a verb. We're one of the only brands in the world like Kleenex or Xerox, that's a noun and verb and it means you can - it's something that didn't really exist before we created this category at a wide scale. That being said, for everyone who books in Airbnb, about 9 people book a hotel. And so, if we can get just one of those guests to book on Airbnb, that's currently booking on a hotel platform we would go from nearly half a billion nights a year to a billion nights a year. And there's two ways to do that. One is the increased reliability of homes in Airbnb, because the number one reason people tell us they book hotels is they are typically more reliable. They know what they're going to get they have a front desk. The other is adding hotels in Airbnb and we're not philosophically misaligned with adding hotels, if we were we would never bought hotels a night before the pandemic. We just haven't prioritized hotels. We think of hotels as a filling in network gap during high occupancy nights. We generally think our if there's an incredible home at a low price, they're always going to choose that but when occupancy goes up they are going to go towards hotels. There are also some use cases where hotels are better and Airbnbs are better. If you need to stay for one night, you're travelling alone, you are business travel and you plug in you plug out a hotel is better. If you're traveling with a group you are travelling for more than three nights and you're travelling in the non-urban area, Airbnb is better. And then, if you're doing something between then you're going to have choices. So, we do think between filling in a network gap and getting more of those one night business travel stays, there is an opportunity to offer hotels in Airbnb and we have a lot of hotels. We have hundreds of thousands of boutique hotels and non-home inventory on Airbnb and we're going to continue to expand that over its years to come. And so there's no philosophical misalignment to add commodity inventory. The philosophical misalign would be if that becomes the majority of our marketplace and people - consumers stop thinking of Airbnb as unique and local. If they start thinking about us that changes the brand then that would be a philosophical misalignment but I don't see that happening anytime soon. It\u2019s a great question, Mark I'm really glad you asked this. I just want to like take us back down memory lane because in 2007, Airbnb provided housing for a design conference. Then in 2008, we provided housing for the Democratic National Convention. Then in 2009 we provided housing for the inauguration. Our first three moments when we started Airbnb was provided housing for events. In fact, our original premise of our business was at housing for events. It wasn't meant to be ever offered for anything other than events in conferences. And the reason why is because conferences and events especially things like the Olympics and World Cup are unbelievable use cases for Airbnb. And the reason why is I think obvious to everyone. Events typically like to host more guests than they have hotel rooms available for. And people, most people they have, most regular people aren't looking to become Airbnb host and make a long-term commitment to host every week. So a lot of people events coming to town is wanting to host one week and make $1,000 or $2,000. And so what we did is we focused a year ago on Paris. And in the last year we increased our supply in Paris by 37%. We now have nearly 150,000 homes in Paris. We had 430,000 guests stay in Paris so far and counting and that number to continue to climb. So that's equivalent of five Olympic stadiums, I want you to imagine five Olympic stadiums where the guest staying in at Airbnb. The fact is that the Olympics as we know it could not ever happen again, without Airbnb because this 400,000 could not have stayed in a hotel room. And so to do that, what we did is we worked at the City of Paris. I was in Paris 10 days ago. I met with President Macron. I met with his economic team. And we talked about how important Airbnb was to the Olympics happening. And we had a lot of cooperation. We were a title sponsor Olympics. And we targeted this event of at Paris, we Did a lot of local campaign. And so it was so successful that we now looking at the top thousand events in the world, really large ones like the World Cup and Olympics, but also like you know looking at where Taylor Swift is going on concert or looking at different conferences, different like we provide housing for the Berkshire Hathaway conference in Omaha and we worked with Warren Buffett you got the word out. This is over a decade ago. So conferences, festivals, events, Coachella, you go down the list. I think this is the best strategy we have to recruit supply and the supply recruit for an event is not property managers. They are individuals who host occasionally that come only to Airbnb. And cities actually like when Airbnb provides housing for events because we solve a problem for them. So, I'm glad you ask the question. The answer is it worked widely successful. Better than we ever imagined. We're working on the lawn for 2026. We're looking at La Olympics for 2028. But we're also building a strategy for the top thousand events in the world. But I think this is the strategy the only Airbnb can do. Because we basically increase excess capacity in cities all over the world to allow them to temporary as well. And it's really alignment and incentives. So it's been very successful at least that we continue - we'll be playing to expand the playbook. Thanks. Yeah, the reality is the biggest issue with Airbnb rooms it\u2019s just a small percent of our business. It's a very small percentage. So even if it - even no matter how fast it grows it's often very small base. It's how Airbnb started by providing a room and a house. It's very affordable. It's very popular for Gen Z, but it is off a very small base and so you're not going to see a major change to the growth rate of the company based on that. I think the thing but maybe just broad zooming out though, two points I\u2019ll make. The first point is Airbnb is one of the most diverse businesses in the world. We have bedrooms and homes up to tens of thousands of dollars a night luxury villas in Airbnb. We allow you to travel by yourself or with the large groups of up to 16 people. We're in every country nearly in the world, every continent in the world including at one point in article and so we're a very - we're in urban areas. Where in the decades arounds this nations we're off to be impact. So our general philosophy is that something for everyone to have the most diverse array of inventory in the world. The other point I'll just make is an area down the road that would really help Airbnb rooms is continuing to invest in our system of trust. The biggest obstacle to people staying in a room is just the discomfort with staying at a house with a stranger they don't know. One of our core inventions with a system of trust and as more we invest in system of trust, I just gave a lot more of these businesses where strangers to live in the others. So I do think it's still a big long term opportunity for us. But it's often but smaller base and it's never going to be as big as entire home and everything. Alright, well, thanks for joining us today. Just to recap, revenue was 2.7 billion 11% higher than a year ago, adjusted EBITDA was a Q2 record And our a trailing 12 months free cash flow was $4.3 billion is our highest yet representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. And we've made significant progress over the past few weeks, but there's more to come. In October we're going to share with set of features and upgrades as part of our 2024 winter release. This includes expanding host of co-hosting, setting the stage for host provided services and much more. I'm proud what we accomplished in Q2 and I look forward to sharing more with you next quarter. Thanks for joining."

Airbnb had a strong start to 2024. We had 133 million nights and experiences booked in Q1, marking our highest first quarter ever. Revenue of $2.1 billion grew 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued strength in travel demand and the timing of Easter. Net income was $264 million, representing a net income margin of 12%. For Q1, our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, our highest ever. And for the trailing 12 months, our free cash flow was $4.2 billion, representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. Our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase $750 million of our shares in the quarter. And at the end of Q1, we had $6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. Now, during Q1, we made significant progress across our three strategic initiatives, which are making hosting mainstream, perfecting our core service, and expanding beyond the core. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We remain focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling in Airbnb. And to do this, we're raising awareness around the benefits of hosting, providing better tools, and helping hosts deliver high-quality stays. As we grow, we're also taking action to rapidly improve the quality of stays on Airbnb. In Q1, we removed thousands of listings that failed to meet our guest expectations. And excluding these removals, active listings for accommodations grew 17% year-over-year. And we also saw sustained double-digit supply growth across all regions. This year, we'll continue to raise awareness around hosting and improve the overall host experience. Second, we are perfecting our core service. Over the past few years, we've rolled out more than 430 new features and upgrades to improve our service. In November, we took another huge step forward on reliability with the launch of Guest Favorites, a collection of the top homes on Airbnb based on ratings, reviews, and reliability. Now, since launching Guest Favorites, there have been more than 100 million nights booked at these listings. And we will continue to make it easier for guests to find high-quality and affordable stays. Finally, we're expanding beyond our core. During the quarter, we continued investing in less mature markets to unlock more growth. And in Q1, growth nights booked in our expansion markets grew twice as fast as our core markets. And we're also focused on expanding beyond our core business. Now, this will be a multi-year journey, and we've already begun laying the foundation. Last week, we introduced Icons, a new category of extraordinary experiences by the greatest names in music, film, sports, and more. Icons mark an important next step in helping people understand that Airbnb offers more than just travel accommodations. Now, before I share a few business highlights, I just want to provide some context on why we actually introduced Icons, because they deliver on three key objectives. First, Icons keeps Airbnb's brand relevant and top of mind. With new Icons launching throughout the year, we can introduce more people to Airbnb and highlight what makes us unique. Second, while Airbnb's brand is already recognized around the world, there are specific segments where we want to accelerate growth. And with a broad range of Icons spanning various geographies, demographics, and fan bases, we'll be able to reach key segments in a more targeted way. And third, Icons helped change the way people think about Airbnb and what we offer. And this is going to be critical as we expand beyond accommodations in the coming years. Now, it's still early, but we're really excited about the response we've seen to Icons so far. In just one week, the Icons launch has generated over 8,100 pieces of global media coverage and 371 million social media impressions. And the coverage has been overwhelmingly positive. Now, just to put this into perspective, Icons has already generated more for us than our IPO. It's clear Icons are resonating with people. Now, looking back to Q1, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, mobile downloads are accelerating. So, to quickly zoom out, nights and experiences booked in Q1 increased 9.5% year-over-year, despite a hard conference this time last year. And we were particularly encouraged by the growth of app downloads. In the U.S., app downloads increased 60% in Q1 compared to a year ago. And global nights booked in our app increased 21% year-over-year. And they now represent 54% of nights booked during the quarter. And this time last year, mobile bookings represented only 49%. So, it went from 49% to 54%. So, we're seeing some really, really good traction. Second, Airbnb is uniquely positioned for special events. Special events is really how we started Airbnb. We really started it to provide housing for conferences and events. And in April, we had over 500,000 guests stay on Airbnb during the solar eclipse in North America. And interestingly, we saw more than twice as many nights stayed on Airbnb along the direct path of the eclipse compared to the year prior, with many of these locations in areas that don't even have hotels. Nights booked in Paris during the summer's Olympics are five times higher than this time a year ago. And Germany is also seeing a similar trend for the Euro Cup this summer, with nights booked nearly double compared to a year ago. Now, supplies also increased to meet the higher demand, including nearly 40% more active listings in Paris in Q1 compared to a year ago. These events highlight that Airbnb's unique ability to disperse travel and spread economic benefits by allowing people to stay in local neighborhoods where there are no hotels. And finally, supply growth remains strong. Now, as mentioned earlier, in Q1, we removed thousands of listings that failed to meet our guest expectations. And excluding these removals, active listings for accommodations grew 17% year-over-year. We continue to see double-digit supply growth across all regions, with the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. Urban and non-urban supply increased at about the same rate, and we saw relatively similar supply growth among individual and professional hosts, with the majority of new listings exclusive to Airbnb. We're really proud of our strong Q1 results, and we're looking forward to another record summer travel season. So with that, Ellie and I look forward to answering your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. You talk about these kind of leaning into these kind of less mature markets and this doubling of growth rate in some of those expansion markets versus your core markets. Could you give a little more color on which countries and which markets that is? Which countries, I think in the past, you may have mentioned Brazil, but which ones you're leaning into this year? And then secondly, that U.S. app downloads increase of 60% year-over-year. That's an extremely high number for what you would think would be a reasonably well-known app and brand. So what drove that? Do you have any whys behind that? Thank you very much.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey, Mark. Why don't I start? So leaning into less mature markets. So if you think about Airbnb, we're obviously in 220 countries and regions. We're one of the most global brands in the world. But our markets with the highest penetration would be U.S., Canada, Australia, France, and U.K. So those five. So the next markets that are the biggest potential TAM would be like Mexico, and Brazil, and Latin America. In Europe, it would be Germany. It would be Italy. It would be Spain. We're also starting to see some traction like Switzerland and Netherlands. And in Asia, it would be Japan. It would be Korea. It would be China. And eventually, a little bit longer game would be India. So these are, and there's a few others in Latin America. So I could kind of keep going. But those are kind of some of the really, really big travel TAMs. And Mark, maybe just one other thing I'll just say. I think a really good thing to look at is our penetration for each country. And while U.S., Canada, Australia are really, really similar, there's a really, really big drop off in a lot of these other markets that are huge travel TAMs, I mean, especially in Asia. And one of the things that we've learned is that Airbnb pretty much resonates pretty equally everywhere once there's the awareness. In fact, I could argue that Airbnb might resonate better in Asia because there's a younger travel population that's not predisposed to hotels and they're on social media. And we are disproportionately on social media versus our competitors. So I'm very, very bullish about that. Now, on U.S. staff downloads, you're right. I mean, it's grown 60% last year. It went from 49% of bookings to 54% of bookings. So at the highest level mark, what drove that was just focused on a roadmap. We have a brand that most everybody, at least in the United States has heard of. And a lot of people download our app, but we've never really focused on optimizing our app from a download perspective. And just to be clear, these numbers were driven organically, not by paid advertising. So it was really just a lot of optimization, different touch points, encouraging people at the right moment to download our app, not being intrusive. We had pushed a lot of people to just, we just pushed them to our mobile website. Our mobile website does not convert nearly at the rate of our app download. And so maybe the highest level point I'll just make is, I think what we've been able to prove in the last three years is when we focus on something, we can drive the numbers. Two years ago, supply wasn't growing, we focused on it. It's now growing 70% net quality. A year ago, we felt like app downloads weren't where they needed to be. We put a team on it, they focused. So I think we're developing a good track record to really be able to move metrics when we focus on them.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Brian.\nEllie Mertz: Brian, if I could just add, I think the app download effort is really just part of our broader priority around perfecting the core and optimizing the core business. We identified that not as many of our guests were using the app as they should. And we know that the app is a much better user experience than MoWeb. So it's again, part of a broader suite of roadmap items that are intended to improve and perfect the core experience.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Ellie.\nBrian Chesky: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Richard Clark with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for my questions. Just on, you mentioned on the prepared remarks and you mentioned that Q4, that Q1 would have quite a tough comp. And there's calendar effects in there as well. But you're guiding the Q2, it's going to be flat on room night growth. So is there anything you call out in Q2 that's maybe holding that back and how we should think about the rest of the year? And maybe just a similar question on margin, the Q2 guide, I guess a little bit softer than consensus had some calendar in there. Is that including any of the growth investments you talk about or are those things that may come in more the second half of the year?\nEllie Mertz: Yes, thanks, Richard. Let me just talk a little bit about the trends that we've seen here today to help answer your question. So first, as you point out, as we were heading into 2024, we were widely aware that last January was particularly strong. And so the guide that we've provided back in February included a step down in growth from Q4 to Q1 that was reflective of that hard comp from a year ago. We did experience it. And then since then, we've seen relatively stable growth, which I see as frankly, a really strong statement in terms of both the stability and resilience of leisure travel demand so far this year. I think, something that we've seen this year that is contrasting to last year there was a lot of volatility in terms of the timing of when people booked relative to their check-ins. And so far this year, it's been, frankly, much more stable. Lead times on our platform have been, frankly, generally in line with a year ago, and it just hasn't been at the same level of volatility, again, that we saw a year ago. And so heading into Q2, our guidance reflects this continued stability of booking. Obviously, we'd like to deliver higher growth and stable growth, but our outlook obviously reflects the trends that we have seen quarter to date. To your question on Q2 margins, obviously, we guided, the Q1 results reflect a pretty meaningful year-over-year margin expansion. A big portion of that is due to the timing of Easter. So Easter is not only a benefit to revenue growth in Q1, but it's obviously also a benefit to margin expansion. Those two factors reverse in Q2. It is a headwind to revenue growth, and it is a headwind to overall margins. Two other components in terms of what's putting pressure on margins in Q2. One is just some one-time credits that we had in payment processing a year ago that will not recur this year. And then third, we shifted slightly the timing of our marketing spend, a little bit heavier in Q2 than in Q1, and that will be reflected in terms of marketing as a percent of revenue growing in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.\nRichard Clarke: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on ADRs. They seem to be relatively sticky, and I think a couple quarters ago, you talked about driving value to the consumer. So can you just give us an update on where you are in sort of some of your value initiatives? And then on supply, great supply growth again. Can you talk about how we should think about supply and nights eventually converging to similar growth rates? Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Hey, Jed. Why don't I take the first one on value initiatives, and I'll let Ellie take the second one. So on providing value, when we started Airbnb, our original tagline was a cheap, affordable alternative to a hotel. And the majority of the primary reason people came to us is because it was a better value than a hotel. And we still think that's a core value proposition that we have to offer. Now, a year and a half ago, we noticed that, there was a lot of concern about Airbnb prices increasing. And so we created a whole team to identify a series of initiatives to modulate our prices, and they're working. And I'll go down the list. One is total price display. So as you know, in travel, especially online travel, there's a lot of progressive fee disclosures. And we decided to have a toggle right on the homepage that you can turn on to show the total price display. Since we've done that, not only do consumers -- not only are consumers going toward the best total value, but it's begun to change behavior in our host community because 300,000 or 300,000 listeners, say, have removed or lowered their cleaning fee as a result. So that was the first thing we did. The next thing we did is we started offering monthly and weekly discounts and much more robust tools for that. Now, this is important because, nearly half of our nights booked are for stays of a week or longer. And now more than two-thirds of our hosts offer a monthly or weekly discount. We also noticed that a lot of hosts that weren't getting booked weren't getting booked because their prices were too high. And they just didn't have really good concepts. So we created a tool called the Compare Listing Tool where people can see how much other people are charging the neighborhood. And they can actually see people who are getting booked, not getting booked. And no surprise, the people getting booked generally have lower prices. We have nearly 2 million hosts that now use the Compare Listing Tool. So those are just a few of the initiatives we've done. We actually have many others as well. The net of all of it is that hotel prices are up year-over-year and Airbnb listings on a like-for-like basis are down. So today the value of Airbnb versus a hotel is better than it was a year ago. And I think that trend line is going to continue given all of our efforts. And maybe the only other thing I'll just say on this is, as we know, loss of supply and demand, as supply grows faster and demand prices go down a little bit. And supply is growing faster in demand. I think that's also relieving some pressure. Ellie, over to you.\nEllie Mertz: Yes, so Jed, to your question with regard to the relative growth rates of supply and demand, just a few comments. I would say first, something that we've shared previously is that in any given quarter, we would not expect supply and demand to grow exactly in line. But when we look over a longer time period, either the last decade or more specifically from pre-pandemic to today, what we do see is that over a period of years, they do grow generally in line. And I would say that continues to be the case. Where we are right now, I would say we're very encouraged to be able to deliver this continued level of very strong supply growth for a couple of reasons. I would say one, we know that more unique, differentiated supply wins and differentiated supply is why people come to Airbnb. I would say second, and Brian made this point, but growing supply allows us to, it really benefits our affordability measures in that more supply obviously but gets more competitive pricing. And then I would say third, relevant to our recent quality initiatives, we see it as an opportunity for, as supply growth is stronger than demand growth, for us to continue to be driving quality. What you saw in the quarters, we obviously did some one-time takedowns of supply that frankly just did not meet our community's expectations. And the fact that supply is growing so rapidly, it allows us to make those cuts, if you will, to the supply base and to be continually upgrading the level of quality that we deliver to our guests.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. Brian, I wanted to ask you about search on Airbnb, just following the strength and the benefits of guest favorites. I wanted to better understand sort of, talk to us about post-guest favorites, how search and really conversion rates have improved and really how you feel search can just evolve over time. And then as a follow-up to what we were just talking about around inventory quality, we'd love to hear just the process to ensure that quality listings continue to come on the platform. I think we've talked about verified listings and trophies, but any other thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: Oh yes, Ron. These are really, really good questions, Ron. So yes, let's start with search. So, we did approximately $10 billion last year in revenue. So the way to think about this is if we can just drive an incremental 100 basis points in growth, that's $100 million. So like the way we look at our conversion rate is like we have teams dedicated to the search experience. And we, over the last year, we, the last 12 months, we've likely driven at least a few 100 basis points of incremental growth just through optimizations of the search flow, because we just get so much traffic. And so just to call out a couple of things that we did, I mean, there's been dozens of dozens, I'll just name a couple. One I already mentioned, mobile app downloads. Now, why do mobile app downloads lead to also more bookings? Because the conversion rate on a native application is typically a lot higher than a mobile website. Number two, just to give you a couple of examples, one of the challenges of Airbnb compared to a hotel is you may type in a location and certain dates and maybe you're on vacation and you don't see exactly the home you need and you might not book a home. You might now open a different app. And we have this carousel that basically offers, hey, if you change your dates by one or two days, here are other listings you can find. And that led to a huge increase in booking. We made improvements to filters. We've made improvements to search input, the search box, making the search box more prominent. So there are quite literally dozens and dozens of improvements that we've made. And I see hundreds of basis points of incremental growth just through essentially optimizing the end-to-end guest flow for our core business. So it's really, really exciting. And a couple of big areas would be maps and location. There's a huge opportunity around that area. So that's on search. On inventory and quality, this is a great question. I mean, we have a really extensive roadmap. Last year we launched guest favorites, as you know. In November, 100 million nights booked have been booked through them. I would say the response to guest favorites has even been greater than I anticipated. We're seeing more people not only book guest favorites, but we're seeing that guest favorites have a fraction of the trip issue and contact rate as non-guest favorites. So guest favorites have between a fifth and a 10th the contact rate as our bottom quartile of listings. And the rebooking rates are much higher. And I also think what Guest Favorites is doing is it's changing behavior to encourage more hosts to become better. And so after that we launched quality highlights in March. Quality highlights, basically what happened was Guest Favorites was the top 2 million listings in Airbnb. But a bunch of people were saying, well how do we know which are the best within those 2 million? So what we did is we have a top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% trophy classification. And this is also really I think popular with guests. We've now removed hundreds of thousands of listings. And we are going to be doing a number of new things. One of the things we are experimenting with is showing to percentile where something falls in a quality distribution as a percentile basis. And then continually adding a lot more supply, and then tightening up our quality control, and really giving a lot more feedback to hosts to become better. I think that a really good opportunity here is to get a lot more listings in Guest Favorites, and to provide host education, host tools for the hosts that are struggling to be much more successful. So there's a pretty big and extensive roadmap to go. And just the last thing I'll say about this is, as big as Airbnb is, and we are approaching half a billion room nights a year, for everyone who stays in Airbnb, somewhere around 8 or 9 people stay in hotels. And when you ask people, why are you staying in a hotel? Airbnb is typically more affordable. It's a more local experience. It's much better for groups and families. People say yes, but hotels are historically a more consistent experience. And so if we can just get one of those travelers from hotels to stay in Airbnb, that would double the size of our business to a billion nights a year. And so we think quality and reliability is a multi-year roadmap. So you're going to be hearing every year major updates from us on quality and reliability.\nRon Josey: Thank you, Brian. Super helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe coming back and putting a finer point on some of the topics we've talked about already, Brian. When you think about your top investment priorities for 2024 and beyond, how would you categorize those investments if we put them in buckets such as demand generation, supply growth, and platform and product innovation over the long-term? And in that last bucket, how should we increasingly think about what you're learning about testing and deploying AI across the platform and how it might reduce friction over the longer term? Thanks so much.\nBrian Chesky: Hey, Eric. Good to hear from you. So maybe I can just \u2013 you had three buckets. Maybe I can give you three slightly different buckets to give you our framework. The way I think about deploying our resources \u2013 and when I say resources, probably the most precious resources we have is product and engineering resources. And the way I think about that is we have our core business, we have international expansion, and we have expanding our core business of accommodation. So that's kind of the way we think about our portfolio. And you can imagine they're all totally different horizons. So the majority of our people are still focused on the core business. And I believe that we are just scratching the surface of the size of our core business. Within our core business, we typically have about three different areas of focus. One I just talked about, which is quality and reliability. The next one is affordability, making sure Airbnbs are more affordable hotels. And the third is usability, what I also talked about with search and reducing friction. So that's the first bucket of our investment. And that really will pay off within this year. And so there's \u2013 you can get a return on those efforts within a matter of months, because a lot of that \u2013 a lot of those changes are software changes. They're immediate. They touch 100% of our user base. And they touch a very large base, our entire GBV. Next is international expansion. International expansion is really supply, demand, and platform. It's all three within international. And you can really bucket into two things. We have to localize the product, and then we have to have a global marketing strategy to go one market at a time. And we've done a lot of really good work over the last few years on international expansion. But I think at this moment, we are ready to step on the gas. And by stepping on the gas, I don't mean it's going to be a significantly greater investment, but a much greater velocity, because we spend a lot of energy updating our products. So most recently, we just \u2013 we just updated our application in Asia, specifically in China. And we're bringing a lot of those improvements to Japan and Korea, because the applications work fairly similarly. And so getting these products onto a better standard is a really good first thing that you want to do before you actually step on the gas for marketing. So that's international. And of course, the final thing is expanding the inter-corporate business accommodation. So from dollars and number of people, this is by far the smallest area that we're putting people on now, because it's a small base. But it's actually where I'm spending the majority of my time. And I think the majority of the leadership's time is now being spent focused on transforming the company from an accommodations business to a multi-vertical or multi-category company. And over the next three years, you're going to see this play out quite substantially. So that's the way we think about it, core, international, and then expanding beyond our core.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you.\nBrian Chesky: And then I think the other question, sorry, I have to answer the question about how are you, what are we learning about AI and reducing friction? So just a couple of things in AI. First of all, like, we've been using AI for a long time. In the last 12 months, we've made a lot of progress. I'll just give you three examples of things we've done with AI. We've made it easier to host. We have a computer vision model that we trained in 100 million photos, and that allows hosts to, like the AI model, to organize all their photos by room. Why would you want to do this? Because this increases conversion rate when you do this. Number two, we launched last week AI-powered quick replies for hosts. So it basically predicts the right kind of question or answer for a host to pre-generate to provide to guests. And this has been really helpful. And then we've made a really big impact on reducing partisan Airbnb with our reservation screening technology. So now we're going much bigger on generative AI. I think we're going to see, I think we're going to see the biggest impact is going to be on, customer service in the near term. I think more than hotels, probably even more than OTA, Airbnb will benefit from generative AI. And the reason why is just a simple structural reason. We have the most, like, varied inventory. We don't have any SKUs. And we're an incredibly global platform. So it's a very difficult customer service challenge. But imagine an AI agent that can actually, like, read a corpus of a thousand pages of policies and be able to help adjudicate and help a customer service agent help a guest from Germany staying with a host in Japan. It's a very difficult problem and AI can really supplement. Over time, we're going to bring the AI capabilities from customer service to search and to the broader experience. And the end game is to provide basically an AI-powered concierge. So that's where it's going. But it's really focused on customer service at this very moment.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two just to sort of come back to a couple of the topics we talked about. The comp did get easier. So with the comps getting modestly harder in the back half, can you just sort of walk us through maybe micro levels of innovation that can sort of drive stability? Or how do we think about reasonable ranges of outcomes for room-night growth in the second half? And then the second one, you know, Brian, you talked about how like-for-like pricing is more attractive versus hotels. I don't have the transcript exactly yet. But if I look at Marriott and Hilton and their ADRs are up 2% to 3% and your ADRs are also up 2% to 3%, is there something else that you're seeing where the relative pricing is actually becoming more attractive that you can help us understand a little bit more? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes. Why don't I take the second question? And I think, Brian, either you or I cut out. We didn't hear the first part of your question.\nBrian Nowak: So do you want to just repeat the first question? Yes. Yes, absolutely. The first question was more for Ellie, where she has \u2013 you talked about how you have stable room-night growth now, but I think the comp is a little bit easier from 1Q to 2Q. And with the comps getting a little more difficult in the back half, can you just sort of walk us through some reasonable ranges of outcomes of growth in the back half and maybe micro-level drivers to kind of keep the stability versus drive deceleration?\nBrian Chesky: Ellie, you want to take the first one, and I'll take the second one?\nEllie Mertz: Yes. So I think you were right in terms of the thinking was that the comparison in Q2 would be a little bit softer. I think what we've seen so far, just to repeat what I said previously, is that, yes, it was clear that there was a hard comp in January. Since then, we've seen, I would just say, a general stability. We are not so far this year seeing the same level of volatility that we saw in 2023 in terms of either movement of lead times or consumer, I would say, hesitancy to book during kind of macro dislocation. So general statement is that, year-to-date, just the trends have been stable, and that's what our Q2 reflects. In terms of the back half of the year, I would say \u2013 I don't know if I would characterize the back half of the year as harder comps. I think if you recall, actually, some of the volatility that we and others saw in the back half of the year, there was a bit of a moment of dislocation end of summer heading into October, and in particular, in the month of October related to the conflict breaking out in Israel. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize the back half of the year as being a harder comp. Instead, I think if you think through the growth initiatives that Brian talked about in terms of thinking about where our portfolio of investments lie, I would say we are optimistic that a lot of the core optimizations could have near-term impact as well as the international investments. So those are the places where we're really looking to drive in-year growth above where we are today.\nBrian Chesky: And Brian, I'll take the like-for-like question. So specifically, the data we're citing is global like-for-like basis. So what we're comparing is the average price of a global hotel room to a one-bedroom listing on Airbnb in March. And in March, our prices were down 2% and hotel prices were up 3%. So our prices were, again, one-bedroom globally on Airbnb in March was $114, down 2%. Hotels were $148, up 3%. So that's what we're talking about, one-bedroom global. When our ADRs move, obviously the other thing to take into consideration is mix shift. Oftentimes our ADRs do go up because people increasingly, more and more of our travel is group travel. 81% of our trips now have two or more guests and increasingly we're seeing people booking more space, larger homes, just as travel's mixing towards larger groups.\nBrian Nowak: That's helpful. Thank you both.\nEllie Mertz: And Brian, that was particularly the case in North America this quarter. On an absolute basis, ADRs were up, but if you exclude the impact of mix, they were flat.\nBrian Nowak: Oh, okay. Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And just want to follow up the prior question on supply and demand growth. And in other segments of the gig economy services, they seem to benefit when supply exceeding demand. So if you think about, ride sharing and food delivery, because they drive prices down and therefore increasing consumer demand. Should we, think about it in the same path for home accommodation? Are you thinking, expecting maybe a similar trend for your business as well? Thanks.\nEllie Mertz: I would say generally speaking, when we see growth in supply, it is additive to demand. It means that, when people are searching for a particular night in a particular city, if we have more that we can provide them, it is obviously net beneficial. I think I would just, repeat the prior comments that we don't always see kind of in period equivalence by market in terms of the respective growth rates. And that I would say that, there's a primary difference in terms of our business model relative to some of the others that you mentioned in that the frequency of the activity is simply lower and the lead time is also much longer.\nJames Lee: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS. Please go ahead.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you so much. So Brian, would we be overreaching if we were to think that Icons is a leading indicator of what should be, I guess, a revitalization or re-imagining of experiences? So, maybe the overnight stay in the [Indiscernible] generates all the media and consumer attention, but maybe this affords you the opportunity to expose the users you're getting to the more everyday experiences. And also secondarily, you've talked about this and the letter talks about this also, the Olympics and the Euro's bump, and there's going to be travelers who are probably not sports fans and who might want to be avoiding Paris and the host cities in Germany altogether. So, is there anything you can share in terms of how additive these two events may be? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: All right, Stephen. Well, that was, you are absolutely not overreaching on Icons. So let me give you a sense. You can think of a company as going through a few phases, especially to start a company. You have an idea, you get product market fit, that's phase one. Phase two is you try to go into hyper growth. We've done that. Phase three, you become a real company, you go public, you generate a return for shareholders. And then the fourth frontier, and very few companies have ever done this, is you reinvent yourself and you go from offering one thing to many things. And a lot of the big tech companies have done this. But one of the companies that I think is a really interesting one to look at is Nike. In the late 70s and early 80s, my recollection, I was born in 81, but my recollection is, I remember, Nike was mostly a running shoe company. And then the 80s, they became more popular with basketball and other things. But at the time, people didn't really think of Nike as a serious basketball shoe. And so they had to not only create a great product for basketball, but they had to actually stretch the brand and open up in people's minds what Nike stands for. And a lot of brands have had to do this. I mean Apple had to do this with the iPod. And I think Airbnb, one of the strengths of our brand also is something that we have to manage which is Airbnb is a noun and a verb. It's synonymous with a category, kind of like Kleenex or Xerox. People say, I'm going to get an Airbnb. I'm going to Airbnb my place. Literally, the name Airbnb has the name B&B in it. So one of the challenges is that people open our app to expect to see stays. And so what we want to do in addition to bringing back experiences, you are totally right, is we wanted to expand Airbnb's brand positioning to include more than just a place to stay. And one of the things you'll notice is when we launched Icons, we said these are extraordinary experiences. We didn't say these are extraordinary stays. We positioned them as experiences. And so you can almost imagine Icons is like we are a car company, but we are starting with a Formula 1 car. And very few people can experience a Formula 1 car, but it captures the magic. It captures the demand. It really expands the brand and increases our permission to be able to go into experiences. And then you kind of move down market. And one of our goals is going to be to bring the magic of Icons to everyone. So I can't probably say too much more about experiences, but absolutely it's not a leap or a stretch whatsoever. Icons is primarily a brand positioning and a brand investment. It obviously wasn't a business. There's only about 4,000 tickets. But we are seeing some really encouraging signs in the last week, a big bump in traffic. It's a lot more top of mind. A lot more people are opening our app. And I just think we are being positioned as more aspirational. And I think people are now starting to think of us for experiences. So I think we've really paved the way for next year. Ellie, do you want to take the Olympics in your own?\nEllie Mertz: Yes, certainly. So if you look at our history, I would say that special events have always been kind of a good moment for Airbnb to shine and have been overall additive in terms of both our brand perception as well as supply growth. I think what we've seen from prior events, and I'm talking about pre-COVID Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl, those type of events, what we see is that it should bring a ton of supply onto the platform. And while not all of that supply will persist, a good portion of it does. And so it's a nice supply acquisition moment for us. I would also say it's really additive in terms of signaling to cities how helpful and additive Airbnb can be to those cities to ramp up supply in a very organic and easy way without adding incremental hotel infrastructure that will not be necessarily needed long-term. And I think you see that in particular in Paris right now. We're going to be hugely additive in terms of hosting travelers for the games, whereas the existing infrastructure would not be able to manage such a large inflow.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Dave [ph] on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. One for you, Ellie. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the investment levers that provide flexibility and shape your 35% plus EBITDA margin guide for the full year? And can we expect to see these levers get pulled more through the year?\nEllie Mertz: Yes, so I couldn't hear entirely, but a question about our guide for full year EBITDA margins, a floor of 35%. Let me just talk a little bit. Yes, the investment level.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, and how you're thinking about investment levers.\nEllie Mertz: Yes, of course. So let me just step back and provide a little bit more color in terms of why the 35%. If you look at our performance since the IPO, pre-IPO, we had a negative 5% EBITDA margin. And behold, three years after the IPO, we delivered nearly 37% EBITDA margins last year. I think we have repeatedly demonstrated the increased strength of this business model in terms of very strong profitability, inclusive of GAAP, net income profitability, as well as free cash flow. And at the same time, where we sit today, we see a huge opportunity in driving incremental growth. And so as we kicked off the year last quarter and looked at our opportunity set, we've identified a handful of areas where we'd like the flexibility to lean in and drive incremental growth beyond what we're seeing today. So where would you see those investment levers on the P&L? It's really two areas. So first, not surprisingly, is marketing. In marketing, we've been very disciplined over the last couple of years. We continue to have a much lower level of marketing intensity than really anyone else in travel. And at the same time, at the margin, we have seen some incremental opportunities to lean in on channels where we're seeing higher ROIs. In Q1, we saw nice, very high ROIs in performance marketing. To the extent that that continues, we would lean in modestly over the course of the year. Additionally, and probably more importantly, Brian talked a little bit about our opportunity set in international markets. And that's also an area where, to the extent that our full funnel marketing investments are working, we would look to top off those investments and to therefore accelerate growth. So marketing is one line item. You will potentially see some margin compression in order to drive growth. The second area, Brian talked about prioritizing our resources and identified that, in many cases, our product development team is our kind of scarcest resource. And I think when you hear us talk about our roadmap, you can obviously infer that we have a very robust list of initiatives that we would like to tackle. And so there's an opportunity to, at the margin, add more personnel over the course of the year to allow us to accelerate that roadmap. And you would see that in particular on the product development line item. So grand scheme of things, no material pivot in terms of our overall financial discipline, but instead a bit of lean into those areas where we believe we can accelerate growth.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for the detailed response.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kopelman: Great, thanks a lot. I had a question on the May release. You added a couple of small new features to the user profiles, I think on the photos and the travel stamps. Can we see that as a first step towards some of the profile enhancements and community features that you've talked about being interested in in the past and where does kind of building out potentially new community features stand in your priority list? Thanks.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, hey Kevin. We spoke in this call mostly about Icons, but I mean, I am equally excited for the results that we've seen for group travel. I'm not going to go through all the metrics, but the metrics have been all really, really positive for group travel features. And in particular, one of the things we've seen is, when people book an Airbnb, the average number of guests is two. So that means that typically for every booking, there's another guest. But typically the other guest hasn't connected their account to Airbnb. So if you travel with a partner or a friend, maybe if you book, the other person doesn't actually have an account or they haven't connected their account. So as we've, and it's strategic for us to get more accounts, that would make sense, right? Especially as you want to sell more things beyond home. We want to have a point of sale for every single person on a trip, not just a point of sale for the booker. So this is really, really critical for us. And what we've seen is a major jump in the number of co-travelers that are now creating accounts in Airbnb and not only creating accounts, but filling out their profile. And so to answer your question, yes, this is the beginning of something much bigger. To probably zoom out, when we started Airbnb, there already were vacation rentals, but they were mostly on classified sites like Craigslist [ph] or there were like paid subscription services like Vrbo. And one of the innovations we brought is we added profiles, payments, two-sided reviews and messaging and those capabilities unlocked really this whole new category. This was what we may call the system of trust. So what we're now doing is we're going to be investing a lot more in increasing our profiles and our profile capabilities, both our account structure, cleaning it up, our identity verification, making, getting more people to complete more robust profiles, increasing their preferences so we have more information about people. And this is so strategic because as trust goes up, more, you can unlock more things for people. And as we know more about you, we can match you better. So, I think in the future, right now, if you think of like the Airbnb solar system, the home is like the sun at the center of the solar system. I think in the future, the profile will be at the center of the solar system of Airbnb and the home will be one of many categories orbiting the profile.\nKevin Kopelman: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Jones with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess maybe going back to supply and your effort to remove low quality supply. I guess, can you speak to the percentage of the supply that you've removed over time? I think you said 100 to 1,000 that I guess maybe take the removal and I guess the learnings and come back and try to list and provide a kind of a higher quality or better experience. I guess as you continue to remove lower quality supplies, it's becoming a tool to kind of nudge hosts into the behavior you're looking for without actually having to remove them.\nBrian Chesky: Yes, I mean, hey Nick, why don't I take the first one? So, the first thing I'll say is the global occupancy on Airbnb is so much lower than hotels. So, even though you type in a certain date and a location, when it's a popular day and location, occupancy can rise at a global level. We are still like, not even close to high occupancy. And so, one of the games we need to do is we want to point them in to the best supply on Airbnb. So, we don't, and so having removed all this supply, we haven't seen a fundamental shift or impact on global bookings because a lot of them either weren't getting as many bookings in the first place, or they were eating up page views, they were lower converting listings, or people were booking them, they were really expensive because they were leading to customer service contacts, which were expensive. And if you went through all that, the revoking rate for them was much lower. Now, as far as the answer to your question about like how many of them come back, I don't have the stats on top of my head. But, I think that like this quality control program, one of the things we've noticed is that a lot of hosts are very coachable and learnable. They're very coachable and they can learn. So I think one of the problems in this category is historically there's these marketplaces have been so hands off that people don't know what it takes to be successful. And as you give them more like metrics, as you give them more incentive to be good, and as you create more boundaries about what's not acceptable in Airbnb, it actually does change behavior and people do come back. So, we're seeing that for sure. And we're seeing that the good people reward and they tend to expand their business. So, I don't have the exact numbers of people that come back, but absolutely, we do think people will come back, if they've remediated some of their issues. And some of what we do too is we'll give warnings to people. So, we don't always have to remove people. We can give warnings first. And warnings are like very, very effective. We're just giving them a heads up. And that actually has a way of increasing the quality of our platform. The last thing I'll just say on this is, we've, what I think makes Airbnb different than our competitors, we have a much more hands-on approach to quality than our competitors. But we are getting more and more hands-on every single year. As we want to get bigger, and we want to capture more of the hotel traveling market, our quality has to go up. And that means that we need to just continue to raise the bar of quality. So, we have a multi-year roadmap where we're going to continue to do so and continue to invest in host education.\nNick Jones: Thanks for the color, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Naved Khan with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yes. Hi. Thanks a lot. Maybe a clarification from Ellie. I think, I heard you say you saw really good ROIs on the performance marketing channels. I wanted to understand better where that came from. And maybe on a related topic, was there any effect from either the rollout of the DMA in Europe in March, or maybe changes to Google search in late March and early April? And then I have a follow-up.\nEllie Mertz: Yes. So, in terms of first, the higher ROIs that we're seeing on marketing, I would say we over the last year have just been frankly very encouraged with the ROIs that we've been able to deliver from that channel. In particular, like what has been driving that? Well, we've been continually testing, improving our performance marketing execution. We have expanded the target audiences. We've expanded our keyword coverage. We've made general improvements to the landing pages. And all of that has been, I would say, quite successful in terms of allowing us to spend marginally more and maintain really great efficiencies. So, really good channel for us, even though it is obviously a minority of our overall marketing spend or strategy. In terms of your second question, impact from the D&A rollout, I would say we haven't seen any meaningful impact. I think primarily that is because the majority, 90% of our traffic is coming to us through direct or unpaid traffic. And so, we have not seen any noticeable impact there yet or at all, I should say.\nNaved Khan: Okay. And then, yes, I know it does help. So, maybe just on the changes to the extenuating circumstances policy, I wanted to kind of understand better what kind of led to that change and what kind of impact we can expect from the outside looking in?\nEllie Mertz: I didn't hear that question. Sorry.\nNaved Khan: Sorry, the changes to the extenuating circumstances policy, I think it was tweaked recently to kind of maybe raise the bar on the cancellation.\nEllie Mertz: Extenuating circumstance policy. Brian, do you have any comments on that? I would say we just tried to clarify over time and make that more equitable for our guests and hosts, but no meaningful impact to the business.\nNaved Khan: Yes, I agree.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi everyone. Thank you. Just on the under-penetrated international markets, as you develop those, I'm just curious if they're producing the, what you'd expect in terms of key KPIs from, take rate ADR profits, just trying to understand how the mixed changes are going to impact the overall company. And then just one on the 2Q to 3Q re-acceleration. I would assume that the booking window is a little bit more extended this year, given some of the events. Just curious on where you're booked into 3Q right now, just trying to understand the confidence interval there. Thank you.\nEllie Mertz: Yes, sure. So first the question is around economics of our international expansion markets. So if you think about the various factors on our economics, so first there's virtually no change in terms of our underlying take rates by market. So that's not a factor. I would say second, depending on the market that we're targeting, many of these markets will have lower ADRs than our averages. So over time, to the extent that we were incrementally more successful in higher, seeing higher penetration in places like Latin America or Asia Pacific, we would anticipate that the global ADR would come down. And yet all of those nights would be accretive. So it would be market expanding, even if the nights were coming in at a lower ADR. And what we've been able to achieve over time is very strong economics at the booking level for a wide range of ADRs. So it is not a concern for us to be expanding in markets where the average ADRs are lower. It is again, just accretive in terms of the top line and the volume of the business. Your second question is around lead time. I would say generally speaking, as I said previously, our lead times year-to-date have been pretty flat on a year-over-year basis. We did not see a pull forward that maybe some others in the industry mentioned. And yet when we look forward in terms of the backlog for Q3, it's quite strong. And it's that backlog that gives us quite a bit of confidence around the comments we made in the outlook that Q3 revenue should accelerate above the Q2 outlook.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate it, thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Brian Chesky for closing remarks.\nBrian Chesky: All right, well, thank you all for joining us today. And I just wanted to say before I wrap up, this was Ellie's first earning call as CFO and the transition has gone incredibly well. Her, Dave and I are really, really focused on this next chapter of growth. So to recap, revenue was $2.1 billion, this is 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q1 records and our trailing 12 month free cash flow was $4.2 billion, representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. Now we've made a tremendous amount of progress over the past few years. And with the launch of Icons, we're now laying the foundation for our plan to expand beyond our core business. This is just the beginning. Thank you all and we'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: That concludes our call for today. We thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.\nBrian Chesky: For business. This is just the beginning. Thank you all and we'll see you next quarter.",

            "name": "Ellie Mertz",
            "content": "Brian, if I could just add, I think the app download effort is really just part of our broader priority around perfecting the core and optimizing the core business. We identified that not as many of our guests were using the app as they should. And we know that the app is a much better user experience than MoWeb. So it's again, part of a broader suite of roadmap items that are intended to improve and perfect the core experience. Yes, thanks, Richard. Let me just talk a little bit about the trends that we've seen here today to help answer your question. So first, as you point out, as we were heading into 2024, we were widely aware that last January was particularly strong. And so the guide that we've provided back in February included a step down in growth from Q4 to Q1 that was reflective of that hard comp from a year ago. We did experience it. And then since then, we've seen relatively stable growth, which I see as frankly, a really strong statement in terms of both the stability and resilience of leisure travel demand so far this year. I think, something that we've seen this year that is contrasting to last year there was a lot of volatility in terms of the timing of when people booked relative to their check-ins. And so far this year, it's been, frankly, much more stable. Lead times on our platform have been, frankly, generally in line with a year ago, and it just hasn't been at the same level of volatility, again, that we saw a year ago. And so heading into Q2, our guidance reflects this continued stability of booking. Obviously, we'd like to deliver higher growth and stable growth, but our outlook obviously reflects the trends that we have seen quarter to date. To your question on Q2 margins, obviously, we guided, the Q1 results reflect a pretty meaningful year-over-year margin expansion. A big portion of that is due to the timing of Easter. So Easter is not only a benefit to revenue growth in Q1, but it's obviously also a benefit to margin expansion. Those two factors reverse in Q2. It is a headwind to revenue growth, and it is a headwind to overall margins. Two other components in terms of what's putting pressure on margins in Q2. One is just some one-time credits that we had in payment processing a year ago that will not recur this year. And then third, we shifted slightly the timing of our marketing spend, a little bit heavier in Q2 than in Q1, and that will be reflected in terms of marketing as a percent of revenue growing in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Yes, so Jed, to your question with regard to the relative growth rates of supply and demand, just a few comments. I would say first, something that we've shared previously is that in any given quarter, we would not expect supply and demand to grow exactly in line. But when we look over a longer time period, either the last decade or more specifically from pre-pandemic to today, what we do see is that over a period of years, they do grow generally in line. And I would say that continues to be the case. Where we are right now, I would say we're very encouraged to be able to deliver this continued level of very strong supply growth for a couple of reasons. I would say one, we know that more unique, differentiated supply wins and differentiated supply is why people come to Airbnb. I would say second, and Brian made this point, but growing supply allows us to, it really benefits our affordability measures in that more supply obviously but gets more competitive pricing. And then I would say third, relevant to our recent quality initiatives, we see it as an opportunity for, as supply growth is stronger than demand growth, for us to continue to be driving quality. What you saw in the quarters, we obviously did some one-time takedowns of supply that frankly just did not meet our community's expectations. And the fact that supply is growing so rapidly, it allows us to make those cuts, if you will, to the supply base and to be continually upgrading the level of quality that we deliver to our guests. Yes. So I think you were right in terms of the thinking was that the comparison in Q2 would be a little bit softer. I think what we've seen so far, just to repeat what I said previously, is that, yes, it was clear that there was a hard comp in January. Since then, we've seen, I would just say, a general stability. We are not so far this year seeing the same level of volatility that we saw in 2023 in terms of either movement of lead times or consumer, I would say, hesitancy to book during kind of macro dislocation. So general statement is that, year-to-date, just the trends have been stable, and that's what our Q2 reflects. In terms of the back half of the year, I would say \u2013 I don't know if I would characterize the back half of the year as harder comps. I think if you recall, actually, some of the volatility that we and others saw in the back half of the year, there was a bit of a moment of dislocation end of summer heading into October, and in particular, in the month of October related to the conflict breaking out in Israel. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize the back half of the year as being a harder comp. Instead, I think if you think through the growth initiatives that Brian talked about in terms of thinking about where our portfolio of investments lie, I would say we are optimistic that a lot of the core optimizations could have near-term impact as well as the international investments. So those are the places where we're really looking to drive in-year growth above where we are today. And Brian, that was particularly the case in North America this quarter. On an absolute basis, ADRs were up, but if you exclude the impact of mix, they were flat. I would say generally speaking, when we see growth in supply, it is additive to demand. It means that, when people are searching for a particular night in a particular city, if we have more that we can provide them, it is obviously net beneficial. I think I would just, repeat the prior comments that we don't always see kind of in period equivalence by market in terms of the respective growth rates. And that I would say that, there's a primary difference in terms of our business model relative to some of the others that you mentioned in that the frequency of the activity is simply lower and the lead time is also much longer. Yes, certainly. So if you look at our history, I would say that special events have always been kind of a good moment for Airbnb to shine and have been overall additive in terms of both our brand perception as well as supply growth. I think what we've seen from prior events, and I'm talking about pre-COVID Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl, those type of events, what we see is that it should bring a ton of supply onto the platform. And while not all of that supply will persist, a good portion of it does. And so it's a nice supply acquisition moment for us. I would also say it's really additive in terms of signaling to cities how helpful and additive Airbnb can be to those cities to ramp up supply in a very organic and easy way without adding incremental hotel infrastructure that will not be necessarily needed long-term. And I think you see that in particular in Paris right now. We're going to be hugely additive in terms of hosting travelers for the games, whereas the existing infrastructure would not be able to manage such a large inflow. Yes, so I couldn't hear entirely, but a question about our guide for full year EBITDA margins, a floor of 35%. Let me just talk a little bit. Yes, the investment level. Yes, of course. So let me just step back and provide a little bit more color in terms of why the 35%. If you look at our performance since the IPO, pre-IPO, we had a negative 5% EBITDA margin. And behold, three years after the IPO, we delivered nearly 37% EBITDA margins last year. I think we have repeatedly demonstrated the increased strength of this business model in terms of very strong profitability, inclusive of GAAP, net income profitability, as well as free cash flow. And at the same time, where we sit today, we see a huge opportunity in driving incremental growth. And so as we kicked off the year last quarter and looked at our opportunity set, we've identified a handful of areas where we'd like the flexibility to lean in and drive incremental growth beyond what we're seeing today. So where would you see those investment levers on the P&L? It's really two areas. So first, not surprisingly, is marketing. In marketing, we've been very disciplined over the last couple of years. We continue to have a much lower level of marketing intensity than really anyone else in travel. And at the same time, at the margin, we have seen some incremental opportunities to lean in on channels where we're seeing higher ROIs. In Q1, we saw nice, very high ROIs in performance marketing. To the extent that that continues, we would lean in modestly over the course of the year. Additionally, and probably more importantly, Brian talked a little bit about our opportunity set in international markets. And that's also an area where, to the extent that our full funnel marketing investments are working, we would look to top off those investments and to therefore accelerate growth. So marketing is one line item. You will potentially see some margin compression in order to drive growth. The second area, Brian talked about prioritizing our resources and identified that, in many cases, our product development team is our kind of scarcest resource. And I think when you hear us talk about our roadmap, you can obviously infer that we have a very robust list of initiatives that we would like to tackle. And so there's an opportunity to, at the margin, add more personnel over the course of the year to allow us to accelerate that roadmap. And you would see that in particular on the product development line item. So grand scheme of things, no material pivot in terms of our overall financial discipline, but instead a bit of lean into those areas where we believe we can accelerate growth. Yes. So, in terms of first, the higher ROIs that we're seeing on marketing, I would say we over the last year have just been frankly very encouraged with the ROIs that we've been able to deliver from that channel. In particular, like what has been driving that? Well, we've been continually testing, improving our performance marketing execution. We have expanded the target audiences. We've expanded our keyword coverage. We've made general improvements to the landing pages. And all of that has been, I would say, quite successful in terms of allowing us to spend marginally more and maintain really great efficiencies. So, really good channel for us, even though it is obviously a minority of our overall marketing spend or strategy. In terms of your second question, impact from the D&A rollout, I would say we haven't seen any meaningful impact. I think primarily that is because the majority, 90% of our traffic is coming to us through direct or unpaid traffic. And so, we have not seen any noticeable impact there yet or at all, I should say. I didn't hear that question. Sorry. Extenuating circumstance policy. Brian, do you have any comments on that? I would say we just tried to clarify over time and make that more equitable for our guests and hosts, but no meaningful impact to the business. Yes, sure. So first the question is around economics of our international expansion markets. So if you think about the various factors on our economics, so first there's virtually no change in terms of our underlying take rates by market. So that's not a factor. I would say second, depending on the market that we're targeting, many of these markets will have lower ADRs than our averages. So over time, to the extent that we were incrementally more successful in higher, seeing higher penetration in places like Latin America or Asia Pacific, we would anticipate that the global ADR would come down. And yet all of those nights would be accretive. So it would be market expanding, even if the nights were coming in at a lower ADR. And what we've been able to achieve over time is very strong economics at the booking level for a wide range of ADRs. So it is not a concern for us to be expanding in markets where the average ADRs are lower. It is again, just accretive in terms of the top line and the volume of the business. Your second question is around lead time. I would say generally speaking, as I said previously, our lead times year-to-date have been pretty flat on a year-over-year basis. We did not see a pull forward that maybe some others in the industry mentioned. And yet when we look forward in terms of the backlog for Q3, it's quite strong. And it's that backlog that gives us quite a bit of confidence around the comments we made in the outlook that Q3 revenue should accelerate above the Q2 outlook."

            "name": "Brian Chesky",
            "content": "All right. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining. Airbnb had a strong start to 2024. We had 133 million nights and experiences booked in Q1, marking our highest first quarter ever. Revenue of $2.1 billion grew 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued strength in travel demand and the timing of Easter. Net income was $264 million, representing a net income margin of 12%. For Q1, our free cash flow was $1.9 billion, our highest ever. And for the trailing 12 months, our free cash flow was $4.2 billion, representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. Our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase $750 million of our shares in the quarter. And at the end of Q1, we had $6 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization. Now, during Q1, we made significant progress across our three strategic initiatives, which are making hosting mainstream, perfecting our core service, and expanding beyond the core. First, we're making hosting mainstream. We remain focused on making hosting just as popular as traveling in Airbnb. And to do this, we're raising awareness around the benefits of hosting, providing better tools, and helping hosts deliver high-quality stays. As we grow, we're also taking action to rapidly improve the quality of stays on Airbnb. In Q1, we removed thousands of listings that failed to meet our guest expectations. And excluding these removals, active listings for accommodations grew 17% year-over-year. And we also saw sustained double-digit supply growth across all regions. This year, we'll continue to raise awareness around hosting and improve the overall host experience. Second, we are perfecting our core service. Over the past few years, we've rolled out more than 430 new features and upgrades to improve our service. In November, we took another huge step forward on reliability with the launch of Guest Favorites, a collection of the top homes on Airbnb based on ratings, reviews, and reliability. Now, since launching Guest Favorites, there have been more than 100 million nights booked at these listings. And we will continue to make it easier for guests to find high-quality and affordable stays. Finally, we're expanding beyond our core. During the quarter, we continued investing in less mature markets to unlock more growth. And in Q1, growth nights booked in our expansion markets grew twice as fast as our core markets. And we're also focused on expanding beyond our core business. Now, this will be a multi-year journey, and we've already begun laying the foundation. Last week, we introduced Icons, a new category of extraordinary experiences by the greatest names in music, film, sports, and more. Icons mark an important next step in helping people understand that Airbnb offers more than just travel accommodations. Now, before I share a few business highlights, I just want to provide some context on why we actually introduced Icons, because they deliver on three key objectives. First, Icons keeps Airbnb's brand relevant and top of mind. With new Icons launching throughout the year, we can introduce more people to Airbnb and highlight what makes us unique. Second, while Airbnb's brand is already recognized around the world, there are specific segments where we want to accelerate growth. And with a broad range of Icons spanning various geographies, demographics, and fan bases, we'll be able to reach key segments in a more targeted way. And third, Icons helped change the way people think about Airbnb and what we offer. And this is going to be critical as we expand beyond accommodations in the coming years. Now, it's still early, but we're really excited about the response we've seen to Icons so far. In just one week, the Icons launch has generated over 8,100 pieces of global media coverage and 371 million social media impressions. And the coverage has been overwhelmingly positive. Now, just to put this into perspective, Icons has already generated more for us than our IPO. It's clear Icons are resonating with people. Now, looking back to Q1, we saw a number of positive business highlights. First, mobile downloads are accelerating. So, to quickly zoom out, nights and experiences booked in Q1 increased 9.5% year-over-year, despite a hard conference this time last year. And we were particularly encouraged by the growth of app downloads. In the U.S., app downloads increased 60% in Q1 compared to a year ago. And global nights booked in our app increased 21% year-over-year. And they now represent 54% of nights booked during the quarter. And this time last year, mobile bookings represented only 49%. So, it went from 49% to 54%. So, we're seeing some really, really good traction. Second, Airbnb is uniquely positioned for special events. Special events is really how we started Airbnb. We really started it to provide housing for conferences and events. And in April, we had over 500,000 guests stay on Airbnb during the solar eclipse in North America. And interestingly, we saw more than twice as many nights stayed on Airbnb along the direct path of the eclipse compared to the year prior, with many of these locations in areas that don't even have hotels. Nights booked in Paris during the summer's Olympics are five times higher than this time a year ago. And Germany is also seeing a similar trend for the Euro Cup this summer, with nights booked nearly double compared to a year ago. Now, supplies also increased to meet the higher demand, including nearly 40% more active listings in Paris in Q1 compared to a year ago. These events highlight that Airbnb's unique ability to disperse travel and spread economic benefits by allowing people to stay in local neighborhoods where there are no hotels. And finally, supply growth remains strong. Now, as mentioned earlier, in Q1, we removed thousands of listings that failed to meet our guest expectations. And excluding these removals, active listings for accommodations grew 17% year-over-year. We continue to see double-digit supply growth across all regions, with the highest growth in regions with the highest demand. Urban and non-urban supply increased at about the same rate, and we saw relatively similar supply growth among individual and professional hosts, with the majority of new listings exclusive to Airbnb. We're really proud of our strong Q1 results, and we're looking forward to another record summer travel season. So with that, Ellie and I look forward to answering your questions. Yes. Hey, Mark. Why don't I start? So leaning into less mature markets. So if you think about Airbnb, we're obviously in 220 countries and regions. We're one of the most global brands in the world. But our markets with the highest penetration would be U.S., Canada, Australia, France, and U.K. So those five. So the next markets that are the biggest potential TAM would be like Mexico, and Brazil, and Latin America. In Europe, it would be Germany. It would be Italy. It would be Spain. We're also starting to see some traction like Switzerland and Netherlands. And in Asia, it would be Japan. It would be Korea. It would be China. And eventually, a little bit longer game would be India. So these are, and there's a few others in Latin America. So I could kind of keep going. But those are kind of some of the really, really big travel TAMs. And Mark, maybe just one other thing I'll just say. I think a really good thing to look at is our penetration for each country. And while U.S., Canada, Australia are really, really similar, there's a really, really big drop off in a lot of these other markets that are huge travel TAMs, I mean, especially in Asia. And one of the things that we've learned is that Airbnb pretty much resonates pretty equally everywhere once there's the awareness. In fact, I could argue that Airbnb might resonate better in Asia because there's a younger travel population that's not predisposed to hotels and they're on social media. And we are disproportionately on social media versus our competitors. So I'm very, very bullish about that. Now, on U.S. staff downloads, you're right. I mean, it's grown 60% last year. It went from 49% of bookings to 54% of bookings. So at the highest level mark, what drove that was just focused on a roadmap. We have a brand that most everybody, at least in the United States has heard of. And a lot of people download our app, but we've never really focused on optimizing our app from a download perspective. And just to be clear, these numbers were driven organically, not by paid advertising. So it was really just a lot of optimization, different touch points, encouraging people at the right moment to download our app, not being intrusive. We had pushed a lot of people to just, we just pushed them to our mobile website. Our mobile website does not convert nearly at the rate of our app download. And so maybe the highest level point I'll just make is, I think what we've been able to prove in the last three years is when we focus on something, we can drive the numbers. Two years ago, supply wasn't growing, we focused on it. It's now growing 70% net quality. A year ago, we felt like app downloads weren't where they needed to be. We put a team on it, they focused. So I think we're developing a good track record to really be able to move metrics when we focus on them. Thanks, Mark. Yes. Hey, Jed. Why don't I take the first one on value initiatives, and I'll let Ellie take the second one. So on providing value, when we started Airbnb, our original tagline was a cheap, affordable alternative to a hotel. And the majority of the primary reason people came to us is because it was a better value than a hotel. And we still think that's a core value proposition that we have to offer. Now, a year and a half ago, we noticed that, there was a lot of concern about Airbnb prices increasing. And so we created a whole team to identify a series of initiatives to modulate our prices, and they're working. And I'll go down the list. One is total price display. So as you know, in travel, especially online travel, there's a lot of progressive fee disclosures. And we decided to have a toggle right on the homepage that you can turn on to show the total price display. Since we've done that, not only do consumers -- not only are consumers going toward the best total value, but it's begun to change behavior in our host community because 300,000 or 300,000 listeners, say, have removed or lowered their cleaning fee as a result. So that was the first thing we did. The next thing we did is we started offering monthly and weekly discounts and much more robust tools for that. Now, this is important because, nearly half of our nights booked are for stays of a week or longer. And now more than two-thirds of our hosts offer a monthly or weekly discount. We also noticed that a lot of hosts that weren't getting booked weren't getting booked because their prices were too high. And they just didn't have really good concepts. So we created a tool called the Compare Listing Tool where people can see how much other people are charging the neighborhood. And they can actually see people who are getting booked, not getting booked. And no surprise, the people getting booked generally have lower prices. We have nearly 2 million hosts that now use the Compare Listing Tool. So those are just a few of the initiatives we've done. We actually have many others as well. The net of all of it is that hotel prices are up year-over-year and Airbnb listings on a like-for-like basis are down. So today the value of Airbnb versus a hotel is better than it was a year ago. And I think that trend line is going to continue given all of our efforts. And maybe the only other thing I'll just say on this is, as we know, loss of supply and demand, as supply grows faster and demand prices go down a little bit. And supply is growing faster in demand. I think that's also relieving some pressure. Ellie, over to you. Oh yes, Ron. These are really, really good questions, Ron. So yes, let's start with search. So, we did approximately $10 billion last year in revenue. So the way to think about this is if we can just drive an incremental 100 basis points in growth, that's $100 million. So like the way we look at our conversion rate is like we have teams dedicated to the search experience. And we, over the last year, we, the last 12 months, we've likely driven at least a few 100 basis points of incremental growth just through optimizations of the search flow, because we just get so much traffic. And so just to call out a couple of things that we did, I mean, there's been dozens of dozens, I'll just name a couple. One I already mentioned, mobile app downloads. Now, why do mobile app downloads lead to also more bookings? Because the conversion rate on a native application is typically a lot higher than a mobile website. Number two, just to give you a couple of examples, one of the challenges of Airbnb compared to a hotel is you may type in a location and certain dates and maybe you're on vacation and you don't see exactly the home you need and you might not book a home. You might now open a different app. And we have this carousel that basically offers, hey, if you change your dates by one or two days, here are other listings you can find. And that led to a huge increase in booking. We made improvements to filters. We've made improvements to search input, the search box, making the search box more prominent. So there are quite literally dozens and dozens of improvements that we've made. And I see hundreds of basis points of incremental growth just through essentially optimizing the end-to-end guest flow for our core business. So it's really, really exciting. And a couple of big areas would be maps and location. There's a huge opportunity around that area. So that's on search. On inventory and quality, this is a great question. I mean, we have a really extensive roadmap. Last year we launched guest favorites, as you know. In November, 100 million nights booked have been booked through them. I would say the response to guest favorites has even been greater than I anticipated. We're seeing more people not only book guest favorites, but we're seeing that guest favorites have a fraction of the trip issue and contact rate as non-guest favorites. So guest favorites have between a fifth and a 10th the contact rate as our bottom quartile of listings. And the rebooking rates are much higher. And I also think what Guest Favorites is doing is it's changing behavior to encourage more hosts to become better. And so after that we launched quality highlights in March. Quality highlights, basically what happened was Guest Favorites was the top 2 million listings in Airbnb. But a bunch of people were saying, well how do we know which are the best within those 2 million? So what we did is we have a top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% trophy classification. And this is also really I think popular with guests. We've now removed hundreds of thousands of listings. And we are going to be doing a number of new things. One of the things we are experimenting with is showing to percentile where something falls in a quality distribution as a percentile basis. And then continually adding a lot more supply, and then tightening up our quality control, and really giving a lot more feedback to hosts to become better. I think that a really good opportunity here is to get a lot more listings in Guest Favorites, and to provide host education, host tools for the hosts that are struggling to be much more successful. So there's a pretty big and extensive roadmap to go. And just the last thing I'll say about this is, as big as Airbnb is, and we are approaching half a billion room nights a year, for everyone who stays in Airbnb, somewhere around 8 or 9 people stay in hotels. And when you ask people, why are you staying in a hotel? Airbnb is typically more affordable. It's a more local experience. It's much better for groups and families. People say yes, but hotels are historically a more consistent experience. And so if we can just get one of those travelers from hotels to stay in Airbnb, that would double the size of our business to a billion nights a year. And so we think quality and reliability is a multi-year roadmap. So you're going to be hearing every year major updates from us on quality and reliability. Hey, Eric. Good to hear from you. So maybe I can just \u2013 you had three buckets. Maybe I can give you three slightly different buckets to give you our framework. The way I think about deploying our resources \u2013 and when I say resources, probably the most precious resources we have is product and engineering resources. And the way I think about that is we have our core business, we have international expansion, and we have expanding our core business of accommodation. So that's kind of the way we think about our portfolio. And you can imagine they're all totally different horizons. So the majority of our people are still focused on the core business. And I believe that we are just scratching the surface of the size of our core business. Within our core business, we typically have about three different areas of focus. One I just talked about, which is quality and reliability. The next one is affordability, making sure Airbnbs are more affordable hotels. And the third is usability, what I also talked about with search and reducing friction. So that's the first bucket of our investment. And that really will pay off within this year. And so there's \u2013 you can get a return on those efforts within a matter of months, because a lot of that \u2013 a lot of those changes are software changes. They're immediate. They touch 100% of our user base. And they touch a very large base, our entire GBV. Next is international expansion. International expansion is really supply, demand, and platform. It's all three within international. And you can really bucket into two things. We have to localize the product, and then we have to have a global marketing strategy to go one market at a time. And we've done a lot of really good work over the last few years on international expansion. But I think at this moment, we are ready to step on the gas. And by stepping on the gas, I don't mean it's going to be a significantly greater investment, but a much greater velocity, because we spend a lot of energy updating our products. So most recently, we just \u2013 we just updated our application in Asia, specifically in China. And we're bringing a lot of those improvements to Japan and Korea, because the applications work fairly similarly. And so getting these products onto a better standard is a really good first thing that you want to do before you actually step on the gas for marketing. So that's international. And of course, the final thing is expanding the inter-corporate business accommodation. So from dollars and number of people, this is by far the smallest area that we're putting people on now, because it's a small base. But it's actually where I'm spending the majority of my time. And I think the majority of the leadership's time is now being spent focused on transforming the company from an accommodations business to a multi-vertical or multi-category company. And over the next three years, you're going to see this play out quite substantially. So that's the way we think about it, core, international, and then expanding beyond our core. And then I think the other question, sorry, I have to answer the question about how are you, what are we learning about AI and reducing friction? So just a couple of things in AI. First of all, like, we've been using AI for a long time. In the last 12 months, we've made a lot of progress. I'll just give you three examples of things we've done with AI. We've made it easier to host. We have a computer vision model that we trained in 100 million photos, and that allows hosts to, like the AI model, to organize all their photos by room. Why would you want to do this? Because this increases conversion rate when you do this. Number two, we launched last week AI-powered quick replies for hosts. So it basically predicts the right kind of question or answer for a host to pre-generate to provide to guests. And this has been really helpful. And then we've made a really big impact on reducing partisan Airbnb with our reservation screening technology. So now we're going much bigger on generative AI. I think we're going to see, I think we're going to see the biggest impact is going to be on, customer service in the near term. I think more than hotels, probably even more than OTA, Airbnb will benefit from generative AI. And the reason why is just a simple structural reason. We have the most, like, varied inventory. We don't have any SKUs. And we're an incredibly global platform. So it's a very difficult customer service challenge. But imagine an AI agent that can actually, like, read a corpus of a thousand pages of policies and be able to help adjudicate and help a customer service agent help a guest from Germany staying with a host in Japan. It's a very difficult problem and AI can really supplement. Over time, we're going to bring the AI capabilities from customer service to search and to the broader experience. And the end game is to provide basically an AI-powered concierge. So that's where it's going. But it's really focused on customer service at this very moment. Yes. Why don't I take the second question? And I think, Brian, either you or I cut out. We didn't hear the first part of your question. Ellie, you want to take the first one, and I'll take the second one? And Brian, I'll take the like-for-like question. So specifically, the data we're citing is global like-for-like basis. So what we're comparing is the average price of a global hotel room to a one-bedroom listing on Airbnb in March. And in March, our prices were down 2% and hotel prices were up 3%. So our prices were, again, one-bedroom globally on Airbnb in March was $114, down 2%. Hotels were $148, up 3%. So that's what we're talking about, one-bedroom global. When our ADRs move, obviously the other thing to take into consideration is mix shift. Oftentimes our ADRs do go up because people increasingly, more and more of our travel is group travel. 81% of our trips now have two or more guests and increasingly we're seeing people booking more space, larger homes, just as travel's mixing towards larger groups. All right, Stephen. Well, that was, you are absolutely not overreaching on Icons. So let me give you a sense. You can think of a company as going through a few phases, especially to start a company. You have an idea, you get product market fit, that's phase one. Phase two is you try to go into hyper growth. We've done that. Phase three, you become a real company, you go public, you generate a return for shareholders. And then the fourth frontier, and very few companies have ever done this, is you reinvent yourself and you go from offering one thing to many things. And a lot of the big tech companies have done this. But one of the companies that I think is a really interesting one to look at is Nike. In the late 70s and early 80s, my recollection, I was born in 81, but my recollection is, I remember, Nike was mostly a running shoe company. And then the 80s, they became more popular with basketball and other things. But at the time, people didn't really think of Nike as a serious basketball shoe. And so they had to not only create a great product for basketball, but they had to actually stretch the brand and open up in people's minds what Nike stands for. And a lot of brands have had to do this. I mean Apple had to do this with the iPod. And I think Airbnb, one of the strengths of our brand also is something that we have to manage which is Airbnb is a noun and a verb. It's synonymous with a category, kind of like Kleenex or Xerox. People say, I'm going to get an Airbnb. I'm going to Airbnb my place. Literally, the name Airbnb has the name B&B in it. So one of the challenges is that people open our app to expect to see stays. And so what we want to do in addition to bringing back experiences, you are totally right, is we wanted to expand Airbnb's brand positioning to include more than just a place to stay. And one of the things you'll notice is when we launched Icons, we said these are extraordinary experiences. We didn't say these are extraordinary stays. We positioned them as experiences. And so you can almost imagine Icons is like we are a car company, but we are starting with a Formula 1 car. And very few people can experience a Formula 1 car, but it captures the magic. It captures the demand. It really expands the brand and increases our permission to be able to go into experiences. And then you kind of move down market. And one of our goals is going to be to bring the magic of Icons to everyone. So I can't probably say too much more about experiences, but absolutely it's not a leap or a stretch whatsoever. Icons is primarily a brand positioning and a brand investment. It obviously wasn't a business. There's only about 4,000 tickets. But we are seeing some really encouraging signs in the last week, a big bump in traffic. It's a lot more top of mind. A lot more people are opening our app. And I just think we are being positioned as more aspirational. And I think people are now starting to think of us for experiences. So I think we've really paved the way for next year. Ellie, do you want to take the Olympics in your own? Yes, hey Kevin. We spoke in this call mostly about Icons, but I mean, I am equally excited for the results that we've seen for group travel. I'm not going to go through all the metrics, but the metrics have been all really, really positive for group travel features. And in particular, one of the things we've seen is, when people book an Airbnb, the average number of guests is two. So that means that typically for every booking, there's another guest. But typically the other guest hasn't connected their account to Airbnb. So if you travel with a partner or a friend, maybe if you book, the other person doesn't actually have an account or they haven't connected their account. So as we've, and it's strategic for us to get more accounts, that would make sense, right? Especially as you want to sell more things beyond home. We want to have a point of sale for every single person on a trip, not just a point of sale for the booker. So this is really, really critical for us. And what we've seen is a major jump in the number of co-travelers that are now creating accounts in Airbnb and not only creating accounts, but filling out their profile. And so to answer your question, yes, this is the beginning of something much bigger. To probably zoom out, when we started Airbnb, there already were vacation rentals, but they were mostly on classified sites like Craigslist [ph] or there were like paid subscription services like Vrbo. And one of the innovations we brought is we added profiles, payments, two-sided reviews and messaging and those capabilities unlocked really this whole new category. This was what we may call the system of trust. So what we're now doing is we're going to be investing a lot more in increasing our profiles and our profile capabilities, both our account structure, cleaning it up, our identity verification, making, getting more people to complete more robust profiles, increasing their preferences so we have more information about people. And this is so strategic because as trust goes up, more, you can unlock more things for people. And as we know more about you, we can match you better. So, I think in the future, right now, if you think of like the Airbnb solar system, the home is like the sun at the center of the solar system. I think in the future, the profile will be at the center of the solar system of Airbnb and the home will be one of many categories orbiting the profile. Yes, I mean, hey Nick, why don't I take the first one? So, the first thing I'll say is the global occupancy on Airbnb is so much lower than hotels. So, even though you type in a certain date and a location, when it's a popular day and location, occupancy can rise at a global level. We are still like, not even close to high occupancy. And so, one of the games we need to do is we want to point them in to the best supply on Airbnb. So, we don't, and so having removed all this supply, we haven't seen a fundamental shift or impact on global bookings because a lot of them either weren't getting as many bookings in the first place, or they were eating up page views, they were lower converting listings, or people were booking them, they were really expensive because they were leading to customer service contacts, which were expensive. And if you went through all that, the revoking rate for them was much lower. Now, as far as the answer to your question about like how many of them come back, I don't have the stats on top of my head. But, I think that like this quality control program, one of the things we've noticed is that a lot of hosts are very coachable and learnable. They're very coachable and they can learn. So I think one of the problems in this category is historically there's these marketplaces have been so hands off that people don't know what it takes to be successful. And as you give them more like metrics, as you give them more incentive to be good, and as you create more boundaries about what's not acceptable in Airbnb, it actually does change behavior and people do come back. So, we're seeing that for sure. And we're seeing that the good people reward and they tend to expand their business. So, I don't have the exact numbers of people that come back, but absolutely, we do think people will come back, if they've remediated some of their issues. And some of what we do too is we'll give warnings to people. So, we don't always have to remove people. We can give warnings first. And warnings are like very, very effective. We're just giving them a heads up. And that actually has a way of increasing the quality of our platform. The last thing I'll just say on this is, we've, what I think makes Airbnb different than our competitors, we have a much more hands-on approach to quality than our competitors. But we are getting more and more hands-on every single year. As we want to get bigger, and we want to capture more of the hotel traveling market, our quality has to go up. And that means that we need to just continue to raise the bar of quality. So, we have a multi-year roadmap where we're going to continue to do so and continue to invest in host education. All right, well, thank you all for joining us today. And I just wanted to say before I wrap up, this was Ellie's first earning call as CFO and the transition has gone incredibly well. Her, Dave and I are really, really focused on this next chapter of growth. So to recap, revenue was $2.1 billion, this is 18% higher than a year ago. Net income and adjusted EBITDA were both Q1 records and our trailing 12 month free cash flow was $4.2 billion, representing a free cash flow margin of 41%. Now we've made a tremendous amount of progress over the past few years. And with the launch of Icons, we're now laying the foundation for our plan to expand beyond our core business. This is just the beginning. Thank you all and we'll see you next quarter. For business. This is just the beginning. Thank you all and we'll see you next quarter."
